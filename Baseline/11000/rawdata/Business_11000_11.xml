'''Alfredo Enrique Nalib Yabrán''' (November 1, 1944&amp;nbsp; in [[Larroque, Entre Ríos|Larroque]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]] – May 20, 1998) was a powerful [[businessperson|businessman]] in [[Argentina]], with close links with the government, in particular with the administration of [[Carlos Saúl Menem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2001/3/11/politica-7925.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508065057/http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2001/3/11/politica-7925.asp |archivedate=2012-05-08 |df= }} Afirman que Menem recibió una mansión de Yabrán
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Yabrán was born in [[Larroque, Entre Ríos|Larroque]], province of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Rios]], in 1944, the seventh son of Nallib Miguel Yabrán and Emilia Tufic Marpez, both children of Lebanese immigrants.

He moved to Buenos Aires in the early 60's, as he began to do business in the areas of security and banking transactions. In the 70's, he became one of the main shareholders of [[Ocasa]], and at the end of President [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s  term he began to operate airport security in Ezeiza.

His name became known due to allegations of former economy minister [[Domingo Cavallo]]. At a session of the Congress in 1995, the then finance minister denounced Yabrán as a kind of mafia boss with political and judicial protection. Yabrán, currently known by the general public, was largely unknown at the time and the press did not have any pictures of him.

Legally, Yabrán only declared a few companies, but Cavallo accused him of driving, through [[Proxy voting|proxies]], other major companies. Among them, [[Correo OCA]] (which handled 30% of the Argentine postal market), Ocasa (which Yabrán claimed to have sold ), [[Ciccone Calcográfica]] (a print and minting company that printed the Patacones Bonaerenses in the 2001 recession) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/75487-los-ciccone-niegan-que-los-controle-yabran&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2002/2/27/un-34389.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and a transport and logistics company called [[Villalonga Furlong]]. These companies were sold to the [[Exxel Group]]  for $605 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-71627-2006-08-18.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/148406-exxel-reestructura-villalonga-furlong&lt;/ref&gt;

The main accusation against Yabrán was that their transport and security companies were being used to hide drugs, [[weapons trafficking]] and [[money laundering]].

Among other things, he owned the private [[courier]] company [[OCASA]], and the immense {{convert|2723269|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} - of which  {{convert|645834|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} are covered - [[EDCADASSA]] warehouses at the [[Ezeiza International Airport|Ezeiza international airport]] in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/164359-yabran-y-la-mafia-del-oro&lt;/ref&gt;

When his name became known due to allegations of former economy minister Domingo Cavallo, Yabrán was extremely secretive and jealous of his privacy. After the [[murder]] of photojournalist [[José Luis Cabezas]], who had been investigating Yabrán, he was forced to come out in public and face the suspicions of society.

===Close links with Menem's government===
The killing of Cabezas embarrassed President Carlos Menem's government while Menem admitted that Emir Yoma was Alfredo Yabrán's friend, he denied that Yabran knew him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/69608-admitio-menem-que-emir-yoma-es-amigo-de-yabran&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/66205-el-presidente-menem-aseguro-que-no-es-amigo-de-yabran&lt;/ref&gt;

His former wife [[Zulema Yoma]] insisted that they were close friends, and was proven right when it was found out that Yabran had given Menem a mansion in Buenos Aires as a marriage gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2001/3/11/politica-7925.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508065057/http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2001/3/11/politica-7925.asp |archivedate=2012-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Minister Elias Jassan had to resign over the 102 calls he personally made to Yabran and because of the calls that he had with Yabran's bodyguards the day after the murder of Cabezas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/70853-la-custodia-de-yabran-llamo-a-jassan&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinet Minister Jorge Rodriguez was criticized for receiving Yabran in the [[Casa Rosada]].&lt;ref&gt;http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1997/06/24/t-00601d.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide===
In 1998,  Yabrán was found dead in one of his houses, with a gunshot through his face which left him nearly unrecognizable.&lt;ref name="IRBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,QUERYRESPONSE,ARG,4562d94e2,3df4be0c30,0.html|title=Argentina: Individuals present at the time of Alfredo Yabrán's suicide in May 1998; reports of Yabrán faking his own death in order to evade capture by the authorities ( 1998-May 2001)|author=Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada|id=ARG37222.E|date=30 May 2001|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonio Marcegaglia''' (born in [[Mantua]] on 12 December 1963) is an [[Italians|Italian]] [[managing director]], Chairman and CEO of [[Marcegaglia]]; the leading industrial group in steel manufacturing.

==Biography==
Antonio Marcegaglia obtained an honours degree in business studies from Milan’s Luigi Bocconi University in 1987 and joined the [[Marcegaglia]] full-time a few days later. He forged an indissoluble bond between his personal career and the growth of this fine mid-sized Italian company of those days, later transforming it into today’s major global player.

Led by Antonio Marcegaglia, the diversification of the group was then extended with the establishment of Bioindustrie Mantovane and the acquisition of Oskar of Osteria Grande (Bologna), Nuova Omec, Ennepi of Lugo di Romagna (Ravenna) and Imat of Fontanafredda (Pordenone) in 1988 and of CCT of Gallarate (Varese) and Elet.Ca of Capalle (Florence) in 1989, as well as the foundation in 1989 of Marcegaglia Impianti of Saronno (Varese).  In the same year, Marcegaglia acquired holdings in Fergallo of Motteggiana (Mantua), SIM of Sant'Atto (Teramo) and Elletre of Montebello Vicentino (Vicenza). In 1991 the Group acquired Resco Tubi of Cusago (Milan) and OMF of Fiume Veneto (Pordenone). In 1994 it acquired Brollo Profilati of Desio (Milan), later moved to the “former Breda” area just outside Milan, on a site totalling 8 [[hectare]]s purchased in 1996, and then in 1995 ETA Euro Tubi Acciaio of Milan, followed by a stake in Allu's of Sesto al Reghena (Pordenone).

The new business and production constellation enabled the group to have a presence also in the sectors of metal household items, electrostatic paint for metals and metal components for the electrical appliance industry. Meanwhile, its metallurgical sector grew with the production of fine stainless steel tubes and cold-rolled profiles.

In 1996, the Euro Energy Group was also established in order to create plants for the production of energy from renewable sources. In January 1997 Nuova Forsidera Spa,&lt;ref&gt;Corriere della Sera [http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1997/febbraio/06/Marcegaglia_rileva_Forsidera_co_0_9702068052.shtml Marcegaglia rileva Forsidera]&lt;/ref&gt; specialising in steel cold rolling and galvanising processes, was acquired with its plants in Corsico (Milan) and Albignasego (Padua).

The group’s energy division was expanded in 1997 under the guidance of Antonio Marcegaglia with the establishment of Green Power, for the development of strategies and systems for energy generation through the gasification of waste and biomass. Further expansion came in 1998, with the creation of Boiler Expertise to design and construct the industrial and power boilers.

In that same year came the acquisition of Astra of Mezzolara, Budrio (Bologna), and the Siderplating establishment was also acquired, under the name of Marcegaglia San Giorgio of Nogaro (Udine), producing rolling mill plates.

Antonio Marcegaglia’s corporate development programme continued in 1999 with the acquisition of Morteo Nord of Pozzolo Formigaro (Alessandria),&lt;ref&gt;La Stampa [http://archivio.lastampa.it/LaStampaArchivio/main/History/tmpl_viewObj.jsp?objid=2340439 Marcegaglia: rilancio della Morteo in 3 anni] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722041446/http://archivio.lastampa.it/LaStampaArchivio/main/History/tmpl_viewObj.jsp?objid=2340439 |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ponteggi Dalmine of Milan, Graffignana (Lodi) and Potenza.

This was followed in 2001 by the acquisition, in the tourism sector, of the holiday resort of Pugnochiuso, situated on the Gargano promontory in Apulia.

In December 2001, following an investment of over 500 million euros over very few years, a large new centre of production was opened in Ravenna, the second largest iron and steel centre in Italy. And in 2002, in the former Belleli area in Taranto, its second largest production plant in the South, after the one in Potenza, entered into operation

In 2003, the sector of products for the household electrical appliance industry expanded further with the acquisition of BVB of San Lorenzo in Campo (Pesaro). While in 2004 the group took a fundamental step in the development of its activities in the tourism sector by acquiring, with Banca Intesa and the Ifil group, 49% of Sviluppo Italia Turismo

In 2007 Antonio Marcegaglia acquired the stake in Gabetti Property Solutions and upgraded the Ravenna plant with a further investment of 300 million euros. The Group continued its expansion in the energy sector where, with its subsidiary Arendi, began production of photovoltaic panels.  Likewise, its presence in tourism grew further with the acquisition of the management of Forte Village of Santa Margherita di Pula, in Sardinia, the largest hotel complex in Italy and Europe. This was followed soon after by the “Le Tonnare” holiday resort in Stintino, in the province of Sassari. In 2007 the production plant at Boltiere (Bergamo) was also enlarged. In 2008 the Group acquired the holiday location at Castel Monastero di Castelnuovo Berardenga (Siena) and the "Former Arsenale" property complex at La Maddalena (Sassari).

Since 2017, following the assignment of the Ilva Group to AM Investco (the joint-venture consisting of ArcelorMittal and [[Marcegaglia]]), Antonio Marcegaglia has been promoting the relaunch of this great European steelworks asset. The objective is to strengthen its position as a market leader and to increase the company’s market share in the European and World iron and steel works industry.

== Internationalisation of the Group ==
In 1989, Antonio Marcegaglia launched the Marcegaglia Group’s internationalisation policy which has strengthened its direct presence in the international markets.

Marcegaglia Deutschland of Düsseldorf was established in 1989 for the distribution of the Group’s own products on the German market and in Scandinavia.  United Stainless Steel was also created in the UK near London, followed by Marcegaglia U.K., for the production of welded tubes from hot and cold rolled strip, and then by Marcegaglia UK at Dudley, West Midlands.

In 1991 Antonio Marcegaglia launched the project which would see the group enter into the transatlantic markets. In the second half of the year The New Bishop Tube of Philadelphia was acquired in the US, and, in February 1992, Damascus of Greenville. Two major production units which then led to the creation of Damascus-Bishop Tube Company, specialising in the production of stainless steel.

In 1993 Antonio Marcegaglia acquired the Belgian Cotubel group, a distributor of stainless steel products and tubes in France and Benelux, and founded the trading company Central Bright Steel for the distribution of welded tubes in the UK; it also began production of these same products near Birmingham in 1997.

In the summer of 1998, a large industrial area in Munhall, near Pittsburgh, was acquired to accommodate the new Marcegaglia USA, which would also incorporate the Damascus-Bishop Tube Company.

During the same period, two other companies were formed in the United States, as subsidiaries of the parent companies in Italy: Oskar Usa in Birmingham (Alabama) and Oto Mills Usa in Wheaton (Illinois).

In 1999 Antonio Marcegaglia’s efforts led to the incorporation of Marcegaglia Iberica, Marcegaglia Ireland, Marcegaglia France, Marcegaglia Austria and Marcegaglia do Brasil, the latter tripling its turnover by 2005, extending its plant and taking the number of its employees to 1000. Meanwhile in Bremen, in joint venture with the Arbed Group, the first Marcegaglia company to produce quality steel was formed.

In 2000, the Group acquired Earcanal of Leioa, Spain. Following the joint venture with Arbed, in 2004 the Marcegaglia Group signed an agreement with the Corus group for the 10-year co-management of its British steelworks on Teesside, guaranteeing the supply at cost price of one million tonnes per year of slabs for the production of coils and sheets. Oto Mills do Brasil was founded in San Paolo in the same year.

In 2005 the Group proceeded with the expansion of Marcegaglia do Brasil, and in June Antonio Marcegaglia opened its fourth overseas production plant in Praszka (Poland), to manufacture tubes for refrigeration, panels and corrugated steel sheets. One year later, 20 kilometres away, the plant at Kluczbork was added, for the production of tubes and drawn products. Marcegaglia established Marcegaglia Gulf at Doha, Qatar in 2007. The expansion of its industrial activities continued in 2008 with its entry into China, where, in [[Yangzhou]], 350&amp;nbsp;km north-west of Shanghai,&lt;ref&gt;Agichina24 - [http://www.agichina24.it/repository/canali/norme-e-tributi/notizie/200803130200-rt2-ss20080313027aaa-art.html Marcegaglia investe a Shanghai]&lt;/ref&gt; it created its first Asian plant for the production of stainless steel tubes and high-precision carbon steel, with the establishment of Marcegaglia Romania at [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], and with the start of work on the new production plant at [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], Russia.

In October 2013, following the passing of his father Steno, founder of the group, Antonio Marcegaglia is appointed Chairman of [[Marcegaglia]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/lombardia/2013/10/04/Marcegaglia-Antonio-Emma-presidenti_9408448.html Marcegaglia: Antonio ed Emma presidenti -]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiaoggi.it/news/dettaglio_news.asp?id=201310041542505307&amp;chkAgenzie=ITALIAOGGI Marcegaglia, il timone passa a Antonio ed Emma -]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.borsaitaliana.it/borsa/notizie/radiocor/finanza/dettaglio/nRC_04102013_1631_286118702.html Marcegaglia: Antonio presidente, Emma ai vertici Marfin -] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105164646/http://www.borsaitaliana.it/borsa/notizie/radiocor/finanza/dettaglio/nRC_04102013_1631_286118702.html |date=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1727">'''Blank endorsement''' of a financial instrument, such as a [[cheque]], is only a [[signature]], not indicating the [[payee]]. The effect of this is that it is payable only to the [[bearer instrument|bearer]] – legally, it transforms an [[order instrument]] ("pay to the ''order of'' (the payee)") into a [[bearer instrument]] ("pay to the bearer"). It is one of the types of endorsement of a [[negotiable instrument]].

It is "an endorsement consisting of nothing but a signature and allowing any party in possession of the endorsed item to execute a claim."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investorwords.com/5421/blank_endorsement.html Investor Words web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also called an ''endorsement in blank''&lt;ref name="Answers.com"/&gt; or ''blank endorsement''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon W. Brown and Paul A. Sukys, ''Business law with U.C.C. Applications'' pp. 491, 929 (McGraw-Hill, 11th ed. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The prevalent spelling in American English is ''en''dorsement; the minority convention, ''in''dorsement, is found in older American documents, although the revised [[Uniform Commercial Code]] Article on negotiable instruments retains the older spelling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8442">[[File:Metal burr.jpg|thumb|Metal burr extending beyond the edge of the cut piece, view on the cut face (top) and from the bottom (bottom)]]

A '''burr''' is a raised edge or small piece of material remaining attached to a workpiece after a modification process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillespie|1999|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usually an unwanted piece of material and is removed with a '''deburring tool''' in a process called 'deburring'. Burrs are most commonly created by [[machining]] operations, such as [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], [[drilling]], [[Milling machine|milling]], [[engraving]] or [[turning]]. It may be present in the form of a fine wire on the edge of a freshly sharpened tool or as a raised portion of a surface; this type of burr is commonly formed when a [[hammer]] strikes a surface. Deburring accounts for a significant portion of manufacturing costs.

In the [[printmaking]] technique of [[drypoint]], burr, which gives a rich fuzzy quality to the engraved line, is highly desirable—the great problem with the drypoint medium is that the burr rapidly diminishes after as few as ten impressions are printed.

==Types==
There are three types of burrs that can be formed from machining operations: ''Poisson burr'', ''rollover burr'', and ''breakout burr''. The rollover burr is the most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stephenson | first = David A. | last2 = Agapiou | first2 = John S. | title = Metal cutting theory and practice | page = 435 | publisher = Marcel Dekker | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=19AdVu1O4fQC&amp;lpg=PA435 | isbn = 978-0-8247-9579-5 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrs may be classified by the physical manner of formation. Plastic deformation of material includes lateral flow (Poisson burr), bending (rollover burr), and tearing of material from the workpiece (tear burr). Solidification or redeposition of material results in a recast bead. Incomplete cutoff of material causes a cutoff projection.&lt;ref name="tmeh"&gt;Tool and Manufacturing Engineers Handbook (TMEH), Volume 3, Materials, Finishing and Coating. Society of Manufacturing Engineers, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrs can be minimized or prevented by considering materials, function, shape, and processing in the design and manufacturing engineering phases of product development.&lt;ref name="tmeh"/&gt;

Burrs in drilled holes cause fastener and material problems. Burrs cause more stress to be concentrated at the edges of holes, decreasing resistance to fracture and shortening fatigue life. They interfere with the seating of fasteners, causing damage to fastener or the assembly itself. Cracks caused by stress and strain can result in material failure. Burrs in holes also increase the risk of corrosion, which may be due to variations in the thickness of coatings on a rougher surface. Sharp corners tend to concentrate electrical charge, increasing the risk of static discharge. Burrs in moving parts increase unwanted friction and heat. Rough surfaces also result in problems with lubrication, as wear is increased at the interfaces of parts. This makes it necessary to replace them more frequently. Electrical charge buildup can cause corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, David. "Surface Condition Impacts Part Performance," ''Metal Finishing'', February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deburring==
[[File:Deburring tool.jpg|thumb|upright|60px|A manual deburring tool]]

There are many deburring processes, but the most common are [[mass-finishing]], [[spindle finishing]], [[media blasting]], [[sanding]], [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], [[wire brushing]], [[abrasive flow machining]], electrochemical deburring, [[electropolishing]], thermal energy method, [[machining]], and manual deburring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillespie|1999|pp=7–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manual deburring===
''Manual deburring'' is the most common deburring process because it is the most flexible process. It also only requires low cost tools and allows for instant inspection.&lt;ref name="gillespie11"&gt;{{harvnb|Gillespie|1999|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Manual deburring is either done with tools like scrapers, files, sandpaper, stones and reamers or with handheld power tools that use abrasive points, sandpaper, or cutters similar to those used to deburr during machining.

===Electrochemical deburring===
''Electrochemical deburring'' is the use of [[electrochemical machining]] to deburr precision work pieces and edges that are hard-to-reach, such as intersecting holes. The process uses a salt or [[glycol]] solution and electricity to dissolve the burr. The electric current is applied with a specialized tool to reach the burr location. Burrs are removed in 5 to 10 seconds, while the rest of the work piece is unaffected.&lt;ref name="gillespie11"/&gt;

===Thermal energy method===
''Thermal energy method'' (TEM), also known as ''thermal deburring'', is a deburring process used to remove hard-to-reach burrs or burrs from multiple surfaces at the same time. The process uses an explosive gas mixture to provide thermal energy to burn off the burrs. It is the fastest burr removal process, requiring only 20 milliseconds to remove a burr.&lt;ref name="benedict"&gt;{{Citation | last = Benedict | first = Gary F. | title = Nontraditional manufacturing processes | pages = 349–350 | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1987 | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=xdmNVSio8jUC&amp;pg=PA349 | isbn = 978-0-8247-7352-6 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process starts by loading the workpiece into an [[explosion-proof]] chamber, which is then sealed and clamped with approximately {{convert|220|metric ton|short ton|abbr=on}}. The chamber is then evacuated of air and filled with an oxygen and fuel mix; this mixture is pressurized to {{convert|0.5|to|1.9|MPa|abbr=on}}. An electrical igniter then ignites the mixture, which burns for approximately 20 milliseconds, causing all of the sharp corners and burrs to burn away. The peak temperature reaches {{convert|3000|C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="benedict"/&gt;

===Cryogenic deburring===
''Cryogenic deburring'' is a [[cryogenic]] process used to remove burrs and [[flash (manufacturing)|flash]] from [[plastic]] and [[die cast]] workpieces. The process works by tumbling and/or abrasively blasting the workpieces at cryogenic temperature levels. The low temperatures (approximately {{convert|-195|C|abbr=on}}) are achieved using [[liquid nitrogen]], liquid [[carbon dioxide]], or [[dry ice]]. This low temperature brings the material below its [[Embrittlement|embrittlement temperature]], which causes the flash or burrs to be easily removed via tumbling or media blasting. This process has been around since the 1960s to deflash plastic and rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillespie|1999|pp=195–196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Common materials that are typically cryogenically deburred with blast media include PEEK, nylon, Teflon, Delrin, polypropylene, polycarbonate, acetal, PTFE, PET, HDPE, PVC, ABS and many others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nitrofreeze.com/services/deburring/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical deburring===
[[File:Mechanical Deburring Tool.jpg|thumb|A typical example of a 'Burraway' tool, deburring the back of a hole.]]
''Mechanical deburring'' is a deburring process that either mechanically grinds a burr off of metal or rolls the edge of dangerous slit or sheared metal burrs into itself.  Rolled mechanical deburring was first developed in the 1960s by Walter W. Gauer from Gauer Metal Product, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gauermetal.com/products/edging-machines/|title = Gauer Edging Machines|date = |accessdate = |website = Gauer Edging Machines|publisher = |last = Schultz|first = Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a means to speed up the process of hand deburring strips of metal that were used in bakery racks.&lt;ref&gt;Metal Progress, Volume 96&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Collegiate Middle Level Association''' ('''CMLA''') is a student association designed to promote and support the professional development of future middle level teachers, as well as the development and nurturing of middle level education programs.  CMLA is an affiliate of [[National Middle School Association]].  Currently, [[Otterbein College]] is serving as the national host site for the organization's leadership.  Their two-year leadership term will conclude November 2011 with CMLA's annual meeting at NMSA's headquarters in Columbus, OH.

==Purpose of CMLA==

*Advance appropriate middle level education
*Provide information about starting and maintaining an organized group of students involved in middle level education on college and university campuses.
*Support standards and recommendations which enhance middle level concepts, practices and ideas.
*Publicize current middle level employment opportunities.
*Promote and invite collegiate participation at national, state and regional middle level conferences.
*Support and encourage students of middle level education, and inform members of the progress and activities of both CMLA and other student groups via newsletters, electronic technology and other sources of communication.

==Collegiate Middle Level Association: A Historical Perspective==

John Swaim,
CMLA Advisory Chair

The Collegiate Middle Level Association currently has 31 chapters. These 31 chapters represent a growing number of colleges and universities who are now preparing teachers to teach young adolescents in American's [[middle schools]]. This would have been an unthinkable dream for a handful of college students in the middle school teacher education program at the [[University of Northern Colorado]] who were trying to create a national organization for students preparing to become middle school teachers in 1988. At that time there were only 18 states that had [[middle school]] certification or endorsement as opposed to 46 states today. In 1988 middle school teacher education programs were the exception rather than the rule. Even more rare were middle school teacher education programs with active student organizations. As the decade of the 90s began there were only four higher education institutions that had active middle school student groups, [[University of Northern Colorado]], [[University of Northern Iowa]], [[Illinois State University]], and [[Appalachian State University]].

In 1989, under the leadership of Ned Gilardino, a UNC student, a constitution was drafted and the Student Association for Middle Education (SAME) was born. Its name was later changed to Collegiate Middle Level Association (CMLA). That same year CMLA made a presentation to the [[NMSA]] Board of Trustees. The Board recognized CLMA and agreed to help finance them by sharing a percentage of the membership fee of all college students who joined NMSA and had an interest in also becoming a member of CMLA. However, joining by individual membership did not provide the stability that was needed to help the association grow. In fact, when the elections were held the officers often came from several different campuses which made it difficult to conduct the business of the association.

Then, in 1995 two significant events occurred that moved CMLA to a new level. First, NMSA recognized CMLA as an official affiliate member, joining other state middle school associations. Secondly, CMLA moved from an individual membership to a chapter membership. The constitution underwent major revisions that not only changed membership from individual to chapter membership, but also changed how the association would be financed and governed. An advisory board was established consisting of the chapter advisors of all the member chapters. The officers were now elected from one campus that applied and was approved by the Advisory Board to be the host site for a two year term. Financing was more closely aligned with NMSA. The association was able to have two annual meetings rather than just meeting at the NMSA annual conference.

At first CMLA grew slowly under this newly revised structure. However, as more states legislated [[middle school]] teacher licensure and more colleges and universities began to develop middle school teacher education programs, CMLA provided an ever increasing number of prospective middle school teachers the opportunity to become professionally involved as middle level educators.

The following colleges and universities have been leadership host sites for CMLA since the new restructuring: [[Otterbein College]] (2009–Present); [[Georgia College &amp; State University]] (2007-2009); [[University of Dayton]] (2005-2007); [[Ashland University]] (2003-2005); [[Appalachian State University]] (2001-2003); [[Central Michigan University]] (1999-2001); [[Missouri Southern State University]] (1997-1999); and [[Illinois State University]] (1995-1997).

'''Edholm's law''', named for [[Phil Edholm]], says the [[wireless]], nomadic and wired network capabilities will converge. Soon, even slower communications channels like cellphones and radio modems will eclipse the capacity of early [[Ethernet]], thanks to upcoming standards known as [[UMTS]] and [[MIMO]], which will boost bandwidth by maximizing antenna usage.

Extrapolating forward indicates a convergence between the rates of nomadic and wireless technologies around 2030.

'''Feminist therapy''' is a set of related [[therapy|therapies]] arising from what proponents see as a disparity between the origin of most psychological theories and the majority of people seeking counseling being female.  It focuses on [[society|societal]], [[culture|cultural]], and [[politics|political]] causes and solutions to issues faced in the counseling process. It openly encourages the client to participate in the world in a more social and political way.

[[Feminist]] therapy contends that women are in a disadvantaged position in the world due to sex, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, religion, age and other categories.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Rowan, John. "AHP A Guids to Humanistic Psychology." 2001. Association for Humanistic Psychology. 25 Nov. 2008 &lt;http://www.ahpweb.org/rowan_bibliography/chapter16.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist therapists argue that many problems that arise in therapy are due to disempowering social forces; thus the goal of therapy is to recognize these forces and empower the client.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In a feminist therapy setting the therapist and client work as equals. The therapist must demystify therapy from the beginning to show the client that she is her own rescuer, and the expectations, roles, and responsibilities of both client and therapist must be explored and equally agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;Byram Fowles, Tammie. "Contributions to Feminist Therapy." Psych-Net- UK. 25 Nov. 2008 &lt;http://www.psychnet-uk.com/readers_articles/contributions%20of%20feminist%20theory.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The therapist recognizes that with every symptom a client has, there is a strength.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[[Lenore E. Walker|Walker, Lenore]]. "A Feminist Therapist Reviews the Case.” Women As Therapists. Cantor, Dorothy. 1990. as cited in Byram Fowles, Tammie. "Contributions to Feminist Therapy." Psych-Net- UK. 25 Nov. 2008 &lt;http://www.psychnet-uk.com/readers_articles/contributions%20of%20feminist%20theory.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist therapy grew out of concerns that established therapies were not helping women. Specific concerns of feminist therapists included gender bias and stereotyping in therapy; [[victim blaming|blaming victims]] of [[physical abuse]] and [[sexual abuse]]; and the assumption of a traditional [[nuclear family]].
== Principles ==
# An [[egalitarian]] relationship (a relationship in which the participants have equal status) between therapist and client is key in feminist therapy, utilizing the therapist's psychological knowledge and the client's knowledge of herself. The inherent power differentials between therapist and client are addressed, and the client must realize that the therapist is not giving her power, but power comes from within herself. This relationship provides a model for women to take responsibility in making all of their relationships egalitarian. Feminist therapists focus on embracing the client's strengths rather than fixing their weaknesses, and accept and validate the client's feelings.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
# Feminist therapy theory is always being revised and added to as social contexts change and the discourse develops.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100216022159/http://www.feminist-therapy-institute.org:80/ethics.htm|archive-date=16 February 2010|url=http://www.feminist-therapy-institute.org/ethics.htm|date=5 May 2008|title=Feminist Therapy Code of Ethics|publisher=Feminist Therapy Institute|editor=Marcia Chappell|access-date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The therapist always retains [[accountability]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
# The feminist therapy model is non-[[victim blaming]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
# The client's well-being is the leading principle in all aspects of therapy.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==Feminist therapists' responsibilities==

# Feminist therapists must integrate [[feminist analysis]] in all spheres of their work.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
# Feminist therapists must recognize the client's socioeconomic and political circumstances, especially with issues in access to mental health care.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
# Feminist therapists must be actively involved in ending oppression, empowering women and girls, respecting differences, and social change.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
# Feminist therapists must be aware of their own situated experience (their own socioeconomic and political situations as well as sex, gender, race, sexuality, etc.) and is constantly self-evaluating and remedying their own biases and oppressive actions. As well as must be learning about other dominant and non-dominant cultural and ethnic experiences.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
# Feminist therapists must accept and validate their client's experiences and feelings.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
In 1977, scholar Susan Thomas argued that feminist therapy was "more [a] part of a social movement than [a] type of psychotherapy", and was so intimately tied to broader social and political feminism that its legitimacy as a therapeutic school was questionable.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Becker, Dana. (2005). The Myth of Empowerment: Women and the Therapeutic Culture in America. New York: New York University Press, 2005. p 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Sally Satel]] of Yale University has been critical of feminist therapy since the late 1990s, characterizing it as promoting a [[paranoid]] [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Satel, Sally (1998) [http://www.familytx.org/research/articles/patriarchymademe.html The Patriarchy Made Me Do It], Originally published in The Women's Freedom Network Newsletter September/October, 1998, Vol. 5, Number 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Satel argued in her 2000 book ''P.C. MD: How Political Correctness Is Corrupting Medicine'' that the very concept of feminist therapy is contrary to the methods and goals of [[psychotherapy]], sometimes so far as to veer into potential [[malpractice]].&lt;ref&gt;Satel, Sally, M.D. (2000) P.C., M.D.: How Political Correctness Is Corrupting Medicine. Basic Books, {{ISBN|0-465-07182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, notes Satel, the goal of therapy is to help the patient understand and alter unrealistic thinking and unhealthy behaviors to improve the patient's confidence, interpersonal skills, and quality of life. Traditional therapy, while rooted in well-tested methods, must also be flexible enough to adapt to each patient's unique experiences, personality and needs.

'''Giannis Vardinogiannis''' ({{lang-el|Γιάννης Βαρδινογιάννης}}, born 7 April 1962)&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; is a Greek billionaire shipping magnate, the eldest son of petroleum tycoon [[Vardis Vardinogiannis]].&lt;ref name="famcap.com"/&gt; He is included in the [[Lloyd's List]] ''Most influential people in the shipping industry''.

==Early life and career==
He majored in economics at [[Vassar College]] in the United States. He is a former [[Rallying|car rally]] champion who owns the private rally team Cyclon Rally Sport, with seven participations (from 1986 to 1992) in the international [[Acropolis Rally]]. He was the first Greek driver in Acropolis Rally for five years from 1988 to 1992. He won six times (1987 to 1992) the Greek Rally title, driving [[Lancia Delta]] with co-driver Kostas Stefanis. Since his retirement from the sport, in 1993, he works in the family business([[Vardinogiannis]] [[group of companies]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradewindsnews.com/weekly/153634/vardinoyannis-empire |title=Vardinoyannis EMPIRE &amp;#124; TradeWinds |publisher=Tradewindsnews.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has interests in oil, shipping, television broadcasting, publishing, banking  etc. The Vardinogiannis family owns the multi-billion oil refining company [[Motor Oil Hellas]], in whose Board of Directors is Yannis Vardinogiannis, and also serves shipping company [[Avin International S.A.]], and [[Piraeus Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bankingnews.gr/index.php?id=342434|title=Οι βασικοί μέτοχοι Κωστόπουλος, Λάτσης, Βαρδινογιάννης μηδένισαν στις ελληνικές τράπεζες, αντικαταστάθηκαν από funds|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

He is the principal shareholder of the Cairo-based [[Vegas Oil and Gas]].

==As owner of Panathinaikos F.C.==
In the summer of 2000, the President of [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]], [[Yiorgos Vardinogiannis]], resigned from his duties and sold his share to his nephew Giannis Vardinogiannis, who changed the style of management into the club. On 22 April 2008, main shareholder Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50% – after 30 years of full ownership – through a €800 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, Panathinaikos Athlitikos Omilos 10% and the rest shareholders 34%. The Vardinogiannis family finally withdrew from Panathinaikos in 2012. The team had the following successes as an owner of Panathinaikos:

- Quarter-finals in Champions League: 2001-02

- Quarter-finals in Uefa Cup: 2002-03

- Greek Championship: 2004, 2010

- Greek Cup: 2004, 2010

==Political views==
In February 2015 Vardinogiannis said in a statement to [[Reuters]] that the new Prime Minister of Greece [[Alexis Tsipras]] had a valid point in attacking the corrupted Greek oligarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grey |first=Stephen |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/17/uk-eurozone-greece-corruption-insight-idUKKBN0LL13K20150217 |title=Insight - PM Tsipras declares war at home on Greece's 'oligarchs' &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=2015-02-17 |accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guaranty Trust Bank plc''' also known as '''GTBank''' or simply '''GTB''' is a Nigerian [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[financial institution]], that offers Online/Internet Banking, Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, Investment Banking and Asset Management services, with its head office in [[Victoria Island (Nigeria)|Victoria Island]], [[Lagos]].

The bank was formed in 1988 by over 35 young Nigerians in their thirties, spearheaded mostly by [[Tayo Aderinokun]] and [[Fola Adeola]], but also included [[Femi Pedro]], [[Gbolahan Osibodu]], [[Femi Akingbe]], [[Akin Opeodu]] and others. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jarushub.com/they-dared-they-did-the-story-of-youngsters-that-founded-gtb/|title=THEY DARED, THEY DID: THE STORY OF YOUNGSTERS THAT FOUNDED GTB|date=2016-10-10|work=JarusHub - Nigeria's No. 1 Career Website|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Guaranty Trust Bank plc was incorporated as a limited liability company licensed to provide commercial and other banking services to the Nigerian public in 1990 and commenced operations in February 1991.

In September 1996, Guaranty Trust Bank plc became a publicly quoted company and won the Nigerian Stock Exchange President’s Merit award.  In February 2002, the Bank was granted a universal banking license and later appointed a settlement bank by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gtbank.com/about-gtbank/our-company/history|title=History - Guaranty Trust Bank Plc|last=User|first=Super|website=www.gtbank.com|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guaranty Trust Bank undertook its second share offering in 2004 and raised over N11 billion from Nigerian Investors to expand its operations.

On 26 July 2007 GTBank became the very first [[Sub-Saharan Africa|subsaharan]] bank and first Nigerian [[joint stock company]] to be listed on [[London Stock Exchange]] and [[Deutsche Börse]]. The IPO raised US$750,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;forbes.com: [https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/07/10/afx3897102.html „''Nigeria's Guaranty Trust Bank to raise 750 mln usd from London listing“''] (11 September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, they successfully placed Nigeria's first private Eurobond issue on the international capital markets.&lt;ref&gt;clickafrique.com: [http://www.clickafrique.com/Magazine/ST010/CP0000002294.aspx ''GTBank completes Nigeria's first private EuroBond Issue.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTBank USD 500,000,000 Eurobond was the first ever Benchmark Eurobond issue by a Nigerian corporate and the second Eurobond programme by GTBank in the last 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;thisdaylive.com: [http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/gtbank-s-us-500-million-eurobond-oversubscribed/91872/ ''GTBank’s US$500 million Eurobond Oversubscribed'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term debts of Guaranty Trust Bank plc are rated [[Standard &amp; Poor's#Long-term credit ratings|BB-]] by [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] and AA- by [[Fitch Ratings]], which are the highest ratings for a Nigerian bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201201060827.html|title=Nigeria: S&amp;P Rates Firstbank, Zenith, GTB Positive|last=Ahmed|first=Idris|date=2012-01-06|work=Daily Trust (Abuja)|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200904160052.html|title=Nigeria: GTBank Gets AA Minus By Fitch|last=Egwuatu|first=Peter|date=2009-04-16|work=Vanguard (Lagos)|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They introduced [[online banking]] and [[SMS banking]] in Nigeria and a [[naira]] denominated [[MasterCard]] as well as the ''Platinum'' and ''World Signia'' cards and with ''GTB-on-wheels'', mobile branches.

On 12 March 2008, GTBank was given a banking licence for the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Financial Services Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;allafrica.com: [http://allafrica.com/stories/200803120199.html „''GTBank to Commence Operations in UK“'']&lt;/ref&gt;

GTBank is a partner of [[Eko Atlantic City]] a new made island (820 ha.) in the [[Atlantic]] ocean, adjacent to Victoria Island Lagos. It will be the home of the new Financial District. The building of Eko Atlantic City started in 2009 and is expected to be finished in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekoatlantic.com/about/aboutus_partners.htm ekoatlantic.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

To commemorate the bank's 20th anniversary, the [[Nigerian Postal Service]] issued a set of GTBank Anniversary postage stamps. This was the first time in Nigeria that a corporate organization was honored in such a way.&lt;ref&gt;nigeriacommunicationsweek.com.ng: [http://www.nigeriacommunicationsweek.com.ng/node/2973 ''NIPOST Launches Stamps to Mark GTBank 20th Anniversary'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the bank became the biggest bank in Nigeria by market capitalisation.&lt;ref&gt;thisdaylive.com: [http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/gtbank-leads-banking-stocks-in-market-capitalisation/106397/ ''GTBank Leads Banking Stocks in Market Capitalisation'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the bank acquired 70 percent shareholding in the [[Fina Bank Group]] for a cash payment of US$100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=7 June 2015|first=.|

In 2013, the Bank issued a USD 400,000,000 Euro bond at a coupon rate of 6%; the least obtained by a Nigerian company in the international capital market. The Eurobond was issued under the USD 2,000,000 Global Medium Term Note Programme, which is registered under both Regulation in the United State of America and Rule 144A in the United Kingdom and sold to investors across Africa, America, Asia and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gtbank.com/about-gtbank/our-company/history|title=History - Guaranty Trust Bank Plc|last=User|first=Super|website=www.gtbank.com|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bank has over 10,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gtbank.com/about-gtbank|title=About GTBank - Guaranty Trust Bank Plc|last=User|first=Super|website=www.gtbank.com|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Bonilla''' (born January 2, 1954) is a former congressman who represented [[Texas's 23rd congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. He was defeated in his bid for re-election by [[Ciro Rodriguez|Ciro Davis Rodriguez]], a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of Congress, in a [[special election]] runoff held on December 12, 2006. His term expired January 3, 2007 when the 110th Congress officially began.

==Roots in San Antonio==
Bonilla was born in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], the son of Anita Arellano and Enrique A. Bonilla.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/reps/bonilla.htm 1 "Henry Bonilla,"] ''Rootsweb.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was young he joined a TRIO [[Educational Talent Search]] program, which provides academic support and college awareness activities to students. He graduated from South San Antonio High School in 1972 and received his Bachelor of Journalism degree from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1976. Before entering politics, he was a television news executive at San Antonio's [[CBS]] affiliate, [[KENS-TV]]. His former wife, Deborah Knapp (born December 1, 1954), continues as an anchor at the station. He has since married the former Sheryl White Shelby (born 1959).

==Congressional career==
In March 1992, Bonilla won the 23rd district's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives ([https://web.archive.org/web/20050909082641/http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/preview/congdist/tx23_109.gif map]). The 23rd had been a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] district since its creation in 1967, but Bonilla charged four-term incumbent [[Albert G. Bustamante]] with neglecting his constituents' needs, being involved in the [[House banking scandal]] by writing 30 "cheques calientes" in the House Bank, and taking excessive and questionable junkets abroad.

Bonilla got an inadvertent assist from the state legislature, which left a heavily Republican area of western San Antonio in the 23rd while carving the new 28th District out of much of the 23rd's territory. Despite being outspent by $758,453 to $594,032 and being in a district that [[Bill Clinton]] carried the same year, Bonilla won by a huge 21-point margin, 59 to 38 percent, the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent that year.

In March 1999, Governor [[George W. Bush]] named Bonilla as the only Texan on his presidential [[exploratory committee]]. Bonilla often represented Bush on national news programs and as a surrogate speaker. Although the 23rd had a slight Democratic lean, Bonilla developed a very conservative voting record. Largely because of his popularity in San Antonio, he did not face a credible challenge until 2002, when Democrat [[Henry Cuellar]], a former Texas secretary of state, came within two points of unseating him.

Bonilla announced that he would probably run in 2006 for the [[United States Senate]] seat held by fellow Republican [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] if she ran for [[governor of Texas|governor]] in 2006 against the [[incumbent]] Republican [[Rick Perry]]. However, Hutchison decided to run for another term in the Senate.

==American Dream PAC==
When Bonilla took charge in 1999 of an independent political fund called American Dream PAC, he made clear that its mission was to "give significant, direct financial assistance to first-rate minority GOP candidates". However, between 1999 and the end of 2003, only $48,750 (or 8.9 percent) of the $547,000 the PAC has received, has gone to minority office-seekers, while more than $100,000 has been routed to Republican Party organizations or causes.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Bonilla defends his PAC's record of assisting minority candidates, saying, "We did the best we could." In all, 27 minority office-seekers, predominantly Hispanic-American, received money, mostly small donations. But Bonilla said it was sometimes difficult to find "good, solid minority candidates to expend the funds on". In July 2003, the treasurer of the PAC pleaded guilty to embezzling $119,021 between 1999 and 2003 and was sentenced to 15 months in prison. The thefts were not discovered until almost four years after they began. "It was a black mark on my judgment", Bonilla said in a 2004 interview.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==2003 redistricting==
Bonilla was priming for a rematch against Cuellar in 2004, but in 2003, a controversial [[2003 Texas redistricting|mid-decade redistricting]] by the Texas legislature, the results of efforts by U.S. House Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]], moved most of Laredo, which had been one of the cores of the 23rd since its formation, to the 28th district. In its place, Bonilla received several heavily Republican San Antonio suburbs that had previously been in the nearby 21st District, all but assuring him of a seventh term. Meanwhile, Cuellar entered and won the 2004 primary against the 28th's incumbent Democrat [[Ciro Rodriguez]] and then went on to win the general election.

Bonilla contributed money from his American Dream PAC to the redistricting effort.

Soon after the 2004 election, Bonilla was criticized when he proposed a procedural rule change that would permit House leaders to retain their leadership positions despite having been indicted by a state grand jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/stories/MYSA120306.2H.Bonilla2ed.221ba8a.html|author=Charles Babington|title=GOP Pushes Rule Change to Protect DeLay's Post|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=July 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625041055/http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/stories/MYSA120306.2H.Bonilla2ed.221ba8a.html|archive-date=June 25, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal would have allowed Tom DeLay to remain as Majority Leader despite having been indicted by the Travis County district attorney's office for possible campaign finance violations. Many constituents believed that Bonilla was blatantly repaying a political favor to DeLay for having favorably redrawn the 23rd District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/stories/MYSA120306.2H.Bonilla2ed.221ba8a.html|author=Staff|title=With seniority, Bonilla the better runoff option|date=December 2, 2006|publisher=My San Antonio Opinion|accessdate=July 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625041055/http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/stories/MYSA120306.2H.Bonilla2ed.221ba8a.html|archive-date=June 25, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2006, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], with Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] taking the lead, ruled in ''[[League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry]]'' that Bonilla's district violated the Civil Rights Act, although the justices upheld most of the 2003 redistricting. The Court declared that the Texas legislature violated the rights of Latino voters when it cut most of Laredo out of the 23rd. Although the reconfigured 23rd was still 55 percent Latino, only 46 percent of the district's voting-age population was Latino.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The justices held that as a result, the new district didn't have enough Latinos to pass muster under the [[Voting Rights Act]].  Since the legislature hadn't created an acceptable majority-Latino district (its intended replacement, the [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]-to-[[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]] [[Texas's 25th congressional district|25th]], was not considered compact enough), the reconfigured 23rd had to be struck down as well.  Because of the size of the 23rd, the ruling effectively forced the redrawing of nearly every district from El Paso to San Antonio. Precedent dictated that a new map had to be issued before the November elections.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The court issued the new lines on August 7. It moved all of Laredo out of the 23rd and into the 28th, but nevertheless made the district much friendlier to Democrats by boosting its Latino population to 65 percent. In particular, Bonilla lost many of the strongly Republican areas he had inherited in the 2003 redistricting. At the same time, he picked up much of heavily Democratic south San Antonio.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Bonilla had grown up in this area, which had been part of the 23rd from 1967-93. The court ordered an all-party primary on Election Day, with a December runoff if no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote. The new map included Rodriguez' home and much of his former base, and he announced that he would run against Bonilla in November. [[Federal Elections Commission]] records show Bonilla paid the [[Los Angeles]]-based law firm of [[Latham &amp; Watkins]] $100,000 in 2006, from his campaign funds, to argue that the district boundaries were constitutional. In February, the firm filed an ''amicus'' brief before the Supreme Court in support of the redistricting plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/001156.php|author=Justin Rood|title=Lawmaker Blew Big Bucks to Keep District Lines Unfair – to His Own Voters.|publisher=[[Talking Points Memo|TPM Muckraker]]|accessdate=July 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091428/http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/001156.php|archive-date=September 29, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defeat in 2006==
On November 7, Bonilla faced six Democrats, including [[Ciro Rodriguez]] and [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[Rick Bolanos]] in the all-candidate special election required by the court decision on redistricting (see above). The ballot also included one independent. Bolanos had won the Democratic primary earlier in the year.

In the first special election, Bonilla won 48 percent of the vote to Rodriguez's 20 percent. Since no one gained a majority, there was a runoff between the two former colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/politics/elections/16224956.htm] dead link.&lt;/ref&gt; According to unofficial results of the Texas Secretary of State [http://204.65.107.84/06decspcrun.htm?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;id=824]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Rodriguez won the runoff with 54% of the vote to Bonilla's 46%. Bonilla was the first Republican incumbent in Texas to be unseated by a Democrat in 10 years, since [[Nick Lampson]]'s defeat of [[Steve Stockman]] in a 1996 runoff election. Lampson was also returned to Congress in 2006 after being defeated for reelection in 2004, like Rodriguez in another district. Bonilla said in interviews the night of his defeat that his loss was in part a result of the changed districting. He ran controversial commercials that claimed that Rodriguez took funds from [[terrorist]]s, which media outlets called "bold claims". He later apologized to the press for any of those who took offense, but stood by his statement.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

However, a large number of Hispanics and Latinos, who predominantly reside in District 23, had expressed disdain for Bonilla by stating that he had fallen out of touch with the needs and concerns of minorities. His reputation even earned him the nickname "Henry Vanilla", as some Hispanics claimed that Bonilla no longer could relate to his culture. In a year of war, illegal immigration issues, and a proposed border fence, Latinos left the Republicans side in droves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondchron.org/news/index.php?itemid=4016|author=Paul Hogarth|title=Latino Voters Bring Victory to Texas Democrats|publisher=Beyond Chron.org|accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failed nomination as ambassador==
After his term in Congress expired, Bonilla was nominated to be Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the [[Organization of American States]], with the rank of [[Ambassador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/03/20070315-5.html|author=Office of the Press Secretary|title=Personnel Announcement|publisher=The White House|accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two months with no action by the Senate, Bonilla asked U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] to withdraw his nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/one_item_and_teasers/nom_wdr.htm |author=United States Senate |title=Nominations Withdrawn |publisher=Senate.gov|accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the withdrawal of his ambassador nomination, Bonilla joined the Washington-based firm [http://www.thenormandygrp.com/ The Normandy Group].

==Consideration for Trump Cabinet==
In December 2016, Bonilla and two other Texas Republicans, [[Texas Agriculture Commissioner]] [[Sid Miller (politician)|Sid Miller]] and Miller's predecessor in that office, [[Susan Combs]], were interviewed for the position of [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'', December 31, 2016, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hugh Hendry.jpg|thumb]]'''Hugh Hendry''' (born March 1969) is the founding partner and, at various times, the chief investment officer, chief executive officer and chief portfolio manager of Eclectica Asset Management. He began to attract attention when his fund achieved a 31.2 per cent positive return in 2008 in the depths of the [[Global Financial Crisis|financial crisis]], earning him a reputation as a [[Contrarian investing|contrarian]] investor,&lt;ref name="Hugh Hendry Bio"&gt;[http://valueslots.com/other-investors/hugh-hendry/hugh-hendry-bio/ "Hugh Hendry Bio"], Valueslots. Retrieved 8 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but his claim on wider public notice was based in a series of outspoken media appearances. Hendry has been referred to as "the most high-profile Scot" in the [[hedge fund]] sector.&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;Sharp, Tim. [http://www.heraldscotland.com/business/markets-economy/scottish-hedge-fund-king-i-m-heading-offshore-to-avoid-brussels-penalties-1.993348 "Scottish hedge fund king: I’m heading offshore to avoid Brussels"], [[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]], 20 December 2009. Retrieved 8 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendry once said to an interviewer: "To my mind, the three most important principles when it comes to investing are Albert Camus's principles of ethics: God is dead, life is absurd and there are no rules." He suggested that a great fund manager was defined by "an ability to establish a contentious premise outside the existing belief system, and have it go on and be adopted by the rest of the financial community".&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Leslie P. [http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052748703786004577221590093305080.html?mod=BOL_twm_fs#printMode "Barron's Interview: Keeping an Eye on Wealth Creation"], [[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]], 20 December 2009. Retrieved 19 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and career==

Hendry was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, in 1969 and graduated from [[Strathclyde University]] in 1990 with a BA in economics and finance. His father worked as a lorry driver and he was the first member of his family to go to university.&lt;ref name="An Outspoken Man in a Secretive Trade"&gt;Werdigier, Julia. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/business/global/20hedge.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business "An Outspoken Man in a Secretive Trade"], [[The New York Times]], 19 July 2010. Retrieved 8 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Hendry joined the prestigious [[Edinburgh]] investment management firm, [[Baillie Gifford]]. He claimed that he was hired only because investors had instructed the company to recruit more working-class employees.&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;

After Baillie Gifford he worked for [[Credit Suisse|Credit Suisse Asset Management]]. Following a chance meeting with [[Crispin Odey]], Hendry joined Odey Asset Management in 1999. "It was a meeting of minds," Hendry said. "He checked my references, got the message that I was a troublemaker, and said, 'You're one of us, you're one of the pirates'."&lt;ref name="Master of the universe"&gt;Usborne, Simon. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/master-of-the-universe-can-hugh-hendry-teach-us-to-love-hedge-funds-1924913.html "Master of the universe: Can Hugh Hendry teach us to love hedge funds?"], [[The Independent]], 28 May 2010. Retrieved 8 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He learned the art of "momentum investing"&lt;ref name="Hugh Hendry Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Focus in the Eye of the Storm"&gt;Fieldhouse, Stuart.[http://www.thehedgefundjournal.com/magazine/200805/profiles/choppy-waters-are-meat-and-drink-for-eclecticas-hugh-hendry.php "Focus In the Eye of the Storm: Choppy waters are meat and drink for Eclectica's Hugh Hendry"], [[The Hedge Fund Journal]], May 2008. Retrieved 8 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and was responsible for managing a range of funds from the Eclectica Fund to more than a $1&amp;nbsp;billion of long only European mandates, including the award-winning Odey Continental European Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclectica-am.com/template.aspx?target=people "Eclectica Asset Management: People"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Eclectica Asset Management website. Retrieved 8 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; "(Odey) taught me how to manage money," Hendry said. "More than that, he taught me how to misbehave. Misbehaviour is all about curiosity, how you invoke and think about change, which is very necessary in the management of money."&lt;ref name="The MT Interview"&gt;Blackhurst, Chris. [http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/features/1061079/MT-Interview-Crispin-Odey-Odey-Asset-Management/ "The MT Interview: Crispin Odey of Odey Asset Management"], [[Management Today]], 1 April 2011. Retrieved 13 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eclectica Asset Management===

Eclectica Asset Management was founded in 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclectica-am.com/template.aspx?target=home "Eclectica Asset Management: Home"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Eclectica Asset Management website. Retrieved 8 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; when Hendry and his colleague Simon Batten purchased the management contract of the Eclectica Fund from Odey to establish themselves as a stand-alone fund manager.&lt;ref name="Master of the universe"/&gt; "A lot of people define investors as value or growth. We are neither. We are time investors," Hendry said.&lt;ref name="Focus in the Eye of the Storm"/&gt;

Despite his reputation as a [[Contrarian investing|contrarian]], Hendry explained to the [[Financial Times]] in July 2012 that his approach continued to be based in taking advantage of market momentum. "Our ideas are harshly disciplined by market trends. You will never see us pursue a homegrown idea when it is to the detriment of the prevailing trend," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Cookson, Robert. [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/06dac24c-cca6-11e1-9c96-00144feabdc0.html#axzz20zbhsi8c "Hendry – ‘Bad things are going to happen’"], [[Financial Times]], 17 July 2012. Retrieved 19 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He closed the fund in 2017 due to consistently poor annual performances since 2009.

==Media appearances==
Hendry has become known in the United Kingdom for his outspoken commentary on the [[Global Financial Crisis|financial crisis]]. On an episode of the [[BBC]]'s [[Newsnight]] programme aired on 9 April 2010, Hendry began his response to comments by the Nobel Prize–winning economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] on the financial position of Greece by saying, "Erm, hello.

'''Immersive commerce''' or '''iCommerce''' is an extension of [[E-commerce]] that focuses on improving [[Customer experience|customer experience]] by using advanced digital technology to create virtual smart stores from existing [[brick and mortar]] locations.

Immersive commerce platforms give consumers the ability to browse and shop aisles of a virtual store using any online device.

Customers can view three-dimensional images of all products within a retailer's [[Stock keeping unit|SKU]] inventory. For retailers, iCommerce seeks to provide [[Omnichannel|omni-channel]] [[touchpoint]] data from the customer, including from social media, allowing retailers to continually optimize their offers in real time. It also provides retailers with an increased ability to market their brands and provides co-branding opportunities with suppliers.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''José Plácido de Castro''' (9 September 1873 – 11 August 1908) was a Brazilian soldier, surveyor, rubber producer and politician who led the armed revolt during the [[Acre War]] of 1902–03, when the [[Republic of Acre]] broke away from [[Bolivia]]. He was the president of the state of Acre just before and after it was purchased by Brazil. After the war he became extremely wealthy as a rubber producer, and made many enemies. He was assassinated in 1908. He is considered a hero of Brazil.

==Early years==
José Plácido de Castro was born on 9 September 1873 in [[São Gabriel, Rio Grande do Sul]].
His great grandfather had served in the 1801 war in which the [[Missões]] territory was annexed to [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and his grandfather had fought in the 1820s [[Cisplatine War]] between the [[United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata]] and the [[Empire of Brazil]].{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}
His father, captain Prudente da Fonseca Castro, fought in [[Uruguay]] and in the [[Paraguayan War]] (1864–70).
His mother was Zeferina de Oliveira Castro.{{sfn|Carlos Fernandes}}

His father died when he was twelve years old, and Plácido de Castro had to work to help support his mother and six brothers.
He took various jobs before joining the 1st Regiment of Field Artillery in 1889 at the age of 16.{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}
A few months later he enrolled in the Rio Pardo School of Tactics.
In 1892 he returned to his regiment as a staff sergeant.
The next year he entered the [[Porto Alegre]] Military Academy.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=1}}
José Plácido was studying there at the start of the [[Federalist Riograndense Revolution|Federalist Revolution]] in 1893.
He considered that the government of Marshal [[Floriano Peixoto]] was illegitimate, and direct elections should have been held to choose a new president.
He joined the rebels and reached the rank of major.
After the revolt was defeated in 1895 he refused the government amnesty and left the army.
He stayed for a short time in São Gabriel, then moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]], at that time the capital of Brazil.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=1}}

Plácido de Castro arrived in Rio de Janeiro in 1896.{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}
He was given a position at the Military College of Rio de Janeiro as an inspector of students.{{sfn|Carlos Fernandes}}
He lost this job due to a quarrel with a teacher, and by March 1898 was working with the Companhia Docas de Santos, which ran the docks in the port of [[Santos, São Paulo]].
Early in 1899 he accepted an offer from the engineer Orlando Correia Lopes to go to [[Acre (state)|Acre]] to work on delimiting rubber concessions.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=1}}
At that time Acre belonged to Bolivia, but was mainly occupied by Brazilian rubber tappers.{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}
He began to work as a land surveyor, and soon fell ill with [[malaria]].{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}

In July 1899 the Brazilians in Acre declared the Independent Republic of Acre.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=1}}
This was quickly dissolved by troops sent by the Brazilian government.
Bolivia sent a small military mission to occupy Acre that was stopped by the rubber tappers.
[[Silvério José Néri]], governor of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], dispatched an expedition to Acre, known as the "Poets Expedition" due to the intellectuals among its members, which declared a second Independent Republic of Acre in November 1890.
This time the republic was overthrown by Bolivian troops.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=2}}

The newspapers now reported an alleged agreement where Bolivia would lease Acre to an Anglo-American "Bolivian syndicate" for 30 years, and would send troops armed by the United States to defend the territory.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=2}}
The possibility of losing control of the rubber trade alarmed the merchants of [[Pará]], who until then had not backed the Amazonas merchants in trying to displace Bolivia from Acre.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=61}}
Bolivian president [[José Manuel Pando]] obtained approval from Congress for the syndicate plan on 21 December 1901.
The news that a US concern backed by troops was taking over caused panic among the Brazilian rubber tappers in Acre.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=62}}

==Acre revolution==
[[File:Coronel Plácido de Castro após a Revolução Acreana.jpg|thumb|Plácido de Castro after the Acre revolution]]
Plácido de Castro was working in the [[Purus River]] area when he heard of the Bolivian government's leasing plan.{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}
At the start of 1902 he accepted an invitation from Rodrigo de Carvalho and two other large rubber producers to lead a revolt against Bolivia.{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}
Plácido de Castro took a boat up the Acre river, ostensibly to conduct land surveys in the south but in fact carrying arms and ammunition. 
He stopped off briefly in Puerto Alonso (also called Puerto Acre, now [[Porto Acre]]) to meet the Bolivian governor Lino Romero and evaluate his future opponent.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=63}}
In the south he organised the rubber tappers and other inhabitants for the revolt.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=3}}
He then returned to Brazil, bypassing Puerto Alonso to avoid alerting the Bolivians.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=63}}
Plácido participated in the 1 July 1902 meeting at which the revolutionary junta was formed with a goal of obtaining the independence of Acre and then integrating it with Brazil.{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}

Although he argued for immediately attacking the garrison of 230 troops at Puerto Alonso, Plácido de Castro was persuaded to first take the outpost at [[Xapuri]].{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=63}}
He entered Xapuri with 33 men in the early morning of 6 August 1902 and captured the sleeping garrison without spilling blood.
On 7 August 1902 he issued a manifesto proclaiming that Acre was independent.
He planned to next take Puerto Acre, but news of an approaching column of Bolivian troops from the [[Orthon River]] caused many of his 200 men to desert.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=64}}
When the remaining 63 rebels were attacked at Volta da Empresa (now [[Rio Branco, Acre|Rio Branco]]) on 18 September 1902 they were decisively defeated, losing half their number. 
The Bolivian commander, Colonel Rojas, issued a proclamation in which he called the rebels and their leaders cowards.
As a result, Plácido's ranks quickly swelled to at least 500 angry rubber tappers.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=64}}

Rojas had lost men and was short of supplies. 
He made camp at Volta da Empresa and sent messengers to Puerto Alonso and [[Riberalta]] asking for fresh guns and ammunition.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=65}}
Plácido de Castro surrounded the Bolivian camp but failed to achieve surprise in an attack on 5 October 1902 and instead settled into a siege, digging diagonal trenches to close in on the Bolivians.
He invited Rojas to surrender on 9 October.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=65}}
Rojas held out for a few more days, then surrendered on 15 October and led his disarmed men back to Bolivia.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=66}}
On 14 October 1902 the rebels captured some of the outer defences of Puerto Alonso and the armed Bolivian launch ''Rio Afua'', which they renamed the ''Independencia''.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|loc=PP30}}
Further successful fighting continued in the south against a column of Bolivian rubber tappers and a picket of poorly trained troops at [[Santa Rosa del Abuná]].{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=66}}

Plácido de Castro could not persuade his men to continue south to destroy the Bolivian base on the Orthon, and turned back towards Puerto Alonso.
Lino Romero had failed to organise for defence.
Plácido de Castro surrounded the town on 8 January 1903, and launched an attack on 15 January 1903 that soon petered out.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=67}}
By now Plácido had 2,000 men under his command. 
They started to dig zigzag trenches to the Bolivian lines.
Eventually, with his forces exhausted and almost out of ammunition, Romero surrendered on 24 January 1903.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=68}}
Plácido de Castro's leadership skills had played a key role in the success of the revolt, helped by supplies of food, ammunition and weapons from the great rubber barons of Acre.{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}

==Later years==
[[File:Placido1.jpg|thumb|Plácido de Castro in 1907]]
The Brazilian government sent troops under General Olímpio da Silveira to take control.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=2}}
Plácido de Castro went to Rio de Janeiro to report on the campaign to  [[José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco]]. 
On his journey he was acclaimed in [[Manaus]] and [[Belém]], and received with honour in Rio.
He declined an offer to become a colonel in the National Guard.{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}
In August 1903 Plácido was made provisional commander of the army of Acre and president of the territory of Acre.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=3}}
Plácido de Castro's views were those of a ''[[caudillo]]'' rather than a democrat.
He was not impressed by Brazil's lack of support for the revolt, and favoured an independent state of Acre.{{sfn|Hecht|Cockburn|2011|p=86}}
However, under the [[Treaty of Petrópolis]] of 17 November 1903 Brazil formally acquired Acre for two million pounds sterling, ceded some land in [[Mato Grosso]] and undertook to build the [[Madeira-Mamoré Railroad]]  to allow export of Bolivian products via the [[Amazon River]].{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}
Plácido remained leader of Acre until February 1904.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=3}}

After leaving office Plácido de Castro bought the Capatará rubber concession on credit, and also obtained property in Bolivia.
He became a major landowner, culminating with the purchase on credit of the great Bagaço rubber concession.
His rapidly acquired fortune earned him enemies.{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}
In June 1906 he was appointed prefect of Alto Acre, one of the four departments of the territory of Acre.
He had to deal with various intrigues, including opposition by a former subordinate, Colonel Alexandrino José da Silva.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=3}}
He resigned from his post due to a disagreement with the government.{{sfn|Carlos Fernandes}}

On 9 August 1908, as he was preparing to return to Rio Grande do Sul, he fell into an ambush prepared by José da Silva.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=3}}
He was shot from behind, and died two days later.{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}
His dying words were recorded as, "Death is a phenomenon as natural as life. He who knows how to live will know how to die. I only lament that having had so much occasion for glorious death, these 'heroes' have shot me in the back."{{sfn|Hecht|Cockburn|2011|p=293}}
His body was taken to [[Porto Alegre]] and buried in the Santa Casa cemetery.{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}

==Legacy==
Plácido de Castro has become admired as a hero of Brazil.
The municipality of [[Plácido de Castro, Acre]], was created in 1963.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=3}}
Rio Branco has a Praça Plácido de Castro.{{sfn|Marshall|Jenkins|Cleary|2009|loc=PT880}}
José Plácido de Castro was included in the [[Tancredo Neves Pantheon of the Fatherland and Freedom]] in [[Brasília]] on 17 November 2004 as the liberator of Acre.{{sfn|Eduardo Carneiro}}
The [[Rio Branco International Airport]] was renamed the Rio Branco-Plácido de Castro International Airport in 2009.{{sfn|Lei n˚11.917, de 9 de abril de 2009}}

'''''Last Call!''''' is a video game for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] released in 2000 by publisher [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Last Call Review|url = http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/last-call|website = www.gamerevolution.com|accessdate = 2015-07-29|last = Silverman|first = Ben|date = 2000-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those playing the game take on the role of a bartender attempting to maximize tips from customers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Last Call! - Overview - allgame |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=23852 |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2015-07-29 |last=Hernandez |first=Tara |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211112443/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=23852 |archivedate=December 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The game was developed by Cutler Creative and supported [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows 98]]. The game's creator, John Cutler, first got the idea for the game in 1995. He wanted to have a game that could teach people to mix drinks. Under the original title Bartender USA, the player would start at a [[Howard Johnson's]] and gradually work their way up to a trendy bar in New York City. At the time, Cutler had no video game experience, and didn't own a computer until he started development. He attended [[E3]] and also worked as a bartender to better understand what he needed to do. He hired programmers and artists to put together a mockup of the game. The original concept included some live action animation, which was dropped from the final game. Simon &amp; Schuster had recently published the comedy game [[Deer Avenger]], and agreed to publish the game since it matched up with their business model at the time. This agreement gave Cutler's team funding to develop and complete the game. Due to Cutler's inexperience, many aspects of the game needed to be rethought during the development process. Cutler credited his choice to use [[Macromedia Director]] as making a mammoth task much easier. He struggled with [[feature creep]] and his relationship with the testing company.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Postmortem: Cutler Creative's  Last Call|url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131490/postmortem_cutler_creatives_last_.php|website = www.gamasutra.com|accessdate = 2015-07-29|last = Cutler|first = John|date = 2001-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The setting of the game is a fictional bar in New York City. The player, as bartender, must learn to mix over one hundred drinks. They also have to ID all customers (serving an underage customer will get the player fired), charm customers, keep music playing, and keep customers from being too drunk. The game offers a recipe book for players, but players will score better if they don't use it. Also, without memorizing the recipes, the player will run out of time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Last Call|url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/05/last-call|website = IGN|date = 2000-04-04|accessdate = 2015-07-29|first = I. G. N.|last = Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of the game is to get the most tips. There are around 20 characters that the player needs to serve in the game. One of these characters is Vincent the Hedgehog, who is an actual hedgehog.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Reviews and sales ==
Review of the game were mixed. Ben Silverman of Game Revolution describes it as a casual game, and not one that a player would expect to play for hours. Silverman described it as a replacement for Solitaire that wouldn't hook players, but also stated that with its low price, it may be worth buying.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lisa Savignano of All Game praised the creative characters, but noted that some of the graphics were poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Last Call! - Review - allgame |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=23852&amp;tab=review |date=2014-11-17 |accessdate=2015-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117050219/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=23852&amp;tab=review |archivedate=November 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN appreciated the large library of drinks, but noted that the animation was often clunky.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The game sold poorly and was a flop. Despite this, for the French and UK market under the name Happy Hour, and in Germany under the name On the Rocks. Cutler was surprised at the nearly even ratio of male to female purchasers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The video game is rated mature and is not recommended for those younger than 21.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Mario F. Kassar''' ({{lang-ar|ماريو قصار}}; born October 10, 1951&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;) is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[film producer]] and industry executive whose projects are frequently in association with [[Andrew G. Vajna]]. He founded the now bankrupt [[Carolco Pictures]].

==Early life==
Kassar was born on October 10, 1951 in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=dofg&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date= 11 March 2014|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web|last=Hammer|first=Joshua|title=Total Free Fall|date=8 March 1992|publisher=''[[Newsweek]]''|url=http://www.newsweek.com/total-free-fall-195938|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last2=Cieply|first2=Michael|last1=Citron|first1=Alan|title=Judges Freezes Mario Kassar's Carolco Shares : Entertainment: The film studio chairman, who bought the stock at a premium, was rebuked for enriching himself at the company's expense.|date=21 December 1990|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/business/fi-7074_1_chairman-mario-kassar|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Citron|first=Alan|title=Like Carolco, Studio's Boss Trims Sails : Entertainment: Emblematic of the company's cost cutting, Mario Kassar is without his 203-foot yacht at this year's Cannes Film Festival.|date=11 May 1992|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-11/business/fi-1320_1_cannes-film-festival|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like him, his father was also an independent movie producer.&lt;ref name=dofg/&gt;  Kassar is of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Italians|Italian]] descent.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;

At the age of 15, Kassar had purchased several [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] films for distribution in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name=dofg/&gt;&lt;ref name=weminoredinfilm&gt;{{cite web|last=Konda|first=Kelly|title=HOLY CRAP!

==Carolco Pictures==

===1970s and Vajna===
Kassar met [[Andrew G. Vajna]] at the [[1975 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=dofg/&gt;  A year later, Kassar and Vajna founded [[Carolco Pictures]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=dofg/&gt;&lt;ref name=weminoredinfilm/&gt;&lt;ref name=mynewsla/&gt;&lt;ref name=streetinsider/&gt;&lt;ref name=freelibrary/&gt;&lt;ref name=geek/&gt;&lt;ref name=kftv/&gt;&lt;ref name=geeknation&gt;{{cite web|last=Clow|first=Chris|title=EXCLUSIVE: Producer Felissa Rose Talks Return of Iconic Action Movie Studio Carolco Pictures|date=24 January 2015|publisher=[[GeekNation]]|url=http://geeknation.com/exclusive-producer-felissa-rose-talks-return-of-iconic-action-movie-studio-carolco-pictures/|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Carolco" was a name they had taken from a long-defunct company based in [[Panama]].  "We just bought the name," Kassar later told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. "It means nothing."&lt;ref name=dofg/&gt;&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;&lt;ref name=weminoredinfilm/&gt;

The first film Kassar and Vajna ventured together was ''[[The Sicilian Cross]]'', a 1976 [[Italian language|Italian]] film that starred [[Roger Moore]].  They bought the rights to the film for $130,000.  Kassar flew to [[Asia]] and sold it for $220,000.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;  By the early 1980s, Vajna and Kassar had bought a small office in [[Melrose Avenue]].  Their desks faced each other in the office and Vajna's wife and Kassar's girlfriend were their secretaries.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;  Kassar and Vajna served as executive producers on ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]'' (1980), ''[[The Amateur (1981 film)|The Amateur]]'' (1981), and ''[[Escape to Victory]]'' (1981).  The latter film marked the first time for both Kassar and Vajna to have worked with [[Sylvester Stallone]].&lt;ref name=dofg/&gt;

===1980s and ''Rambo''===
In 1980, Kassar and Vajna paid [[Warner Bros.]] approximately $383,000 for the [[Option (filmmaking)|option]] rights of [[David Morrell]]'s 1972 novel, ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]''.&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite web|last=Fierman|first=Daniel|title=How two once-hot producers stopped getting action|date=30 April 2004|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2004/04/30/how-two-once-hot-producers-stopped-getting-action|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though they overpaid him, Kassar and Vajna cast Stallone as [[John Rambo]] because they knew the actor's star status could be used to secure the requisite investment.  The result, ''[[First Blood]]'', was a major hit in October 1982, and eventually made $125 million on its $14 million investment, making Carolco a major Hollywood production company.&lt;ref name=dofg/&gt;&lt;ref name=weminoredinfilm/&gt;&lt;ref name=geeknation/&gt;  According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] group associated with Kassar's family was instrumental in financing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Delugach|first=Al|title=Carolco Seeks Life Beyond 'Rambo' Films|date=31 May 1987|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-31/business/fi-9501_1_carolco-pictures|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid to late 1980s, Kassar executive produced [[Rambo (film series)|two Rambo sequels]]: ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985) and ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988), both of them also released by Carolco.&lt;ref name=dofg/&gt;&lt;ref name=mynewsla&gt;{{cite web|last=Park|first=Colleen|title=‘Rambo,’ ‘Terminator’ producer Mario Kassar returns to Carolco Pictures|date=17 February 2015|url=http://mynewsla.com/hollywood/2015/02/17/producer-mario-kassar-returns-carolco-pictures-board-chairman/|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=freelibrary/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierce|first=Nev|title=Mario Kassar; Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines|date=24 July 2003|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/07/24/mario_kassar_terminator_3_interview.shtml|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kassar also executive produced ''[[Angel Heart]]'' (1987) and ''[[Johnny Handsome]]'' (1989), as well as having produced ''[[Red Heat (1988 film)|Red Heat]]'' (1988).&lt;ref name=streetinsider/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

"They knew the international distribution business so well," remembers [[Alan Parker]], who directed ''Angel Heart'' for Carolco. "They figured out that 60 percent of the revenue of a film comes from outside the U.S. market. Andy and Mario personally knew all the worldwide local independent distributors."&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;

In 1989, Vajna left Carolco and sold his interests to Kassar.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;  "After ''Rambo'', we were trying to become a major studio. I felt that was the wrong direction," Vajna told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. "My feelings were very negative and it caused a lot of friction between Mario, myself, and Peter (Hoffman), who was by then Mario's right hand. I disagreed with where they wanted to go, and Peter played our egos against each other. He wanted to be a partner."  Kassar and Vajna's partnership had fallen apart that year, and the latter was paid approximately $100 million for his share in the company.  Kassar carried on with Peter Hoffman, who was president/chief executive of Carolco at the time since 1986.  Hoffman had been introduced to Kassar by [[Tom Pollock]], who would later become head of [[Universal Studios]].&lt;ref name=dofg/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;&lt;ref name=weminoredinfilm/&gt;

[[Dino De Laurentiis]]'s defunct studio, [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]], along with its headquarters in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] was purchased by Hoffman at Kassar's urging.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;

===1990s and Hoffman===
Films that Kassar executive produced during the 1990s included ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), ''[[Air America (film)|Air America]]'' (1990), ''[[Narrow Margin]]'' (1990), ''[[L.A. Story]]'' (1991), ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'' (1991), ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), ''[[Rambling Rose (film)|Rambling Rose]]'' (1991), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'' (1993), ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' (1994), ''[[Last of the Dogmen]]'' (1995), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995) and ''[[Cutthroat Island]]'' (1995).  Kassar also produced ''[[Universal Soldier (1992 film)|Universal Soldier]]'' (1992) and ''[[Chaplin (film)|Chaplin]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name=dofg/&gt;&lt;ref name=mynewsla/&gt;&lt;ref name=streetinsider&gt;{{cite web|title=Mario Kassar Returns As Carolco Pictures' Chairman Of The Board Of Directors|date=17 February 2015|url=http://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/Mario+Kassar+Returns+As+Carolco+Pictures%27+Chairman+Of+The+Board+Of+Directors/10278315.html|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=freelibrary/&gt;&lt;ref name=stockguru&gt;{{cite web|title=News: Brick Top Productions Enters Agreement with Mario Kassar|date=24 November 2014|url=http://stockguru.com/2014/11/24/news-brick-top-productions-enters-agreement-with-mario-kassar/|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=4traders&gt;{{cite web|title=Brick Top Productions : Enters Agreement with Mario Kassar Producer and Executive Producer of Motion Picture World-Wide Blockbusters for Over 30 Years|date=24 November 2014|url=http://www.4-traders.com/BRICK-TOP-PRODUCTIONS-INC-12324461/news/Brick-Top-Productions--Enters-Agreement-with-Mario-Kassar-Producer-and-Executive-Producer-of-Motion-19444737/|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gtnnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=baystreet/&gt;&lt;ref name=fashiontimes&gt;{{cite web|last=Monzon|first=Inigo|title=J-Horror ‘Audition’ Getting a Hollywood Remake|date=1 July 2014|publisher=Fashion Times|url=http://www.fashiontimes.com/articles/9195/20140701/j-horror-audition-getting-a-hollywood-remake.htm|accessdate=26 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227025651/http://www.fashiontimes.com/articles/9195/20140701/j-horror-audition-getting-a-hollywood-remake.htm|archivedate=27 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pecchia|first=David|title=Films now going into production:|date=11 June 1989|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-11/entertainment/ca-3028_1_frank-marshall-executive-producers-joe-banks|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pecchia|first=David|title=Films now going into production:|date=8 October 1989|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-08/entertainment/ca-228_1_film-west|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title=Dogmen' Charms With Its Familiarity|date=8 September 1995|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-08/entertainment/ca-43437_1_dogmen-familiarity-movie|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During that time, relations between Kassar and Hoffman had degenerated into mistrust and [[antipathy]].  Hoffman thought Kassar's largesse was destroying the company; Kassar suspected Hoffman was scheming to depose him.  Hoffman later resigned on March 1992 with a $1.8 million settlement.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloombergbusiness/&gt;  A falling out that he had with Kassar was what caused Hoffman to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Citron|first=Alan|title=Ex-President of Carolco Starts Own Company|date=11 May 1992|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-11/business/fi-1328_1_entertainment-markets|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"They're extraordinary men, but they couldn't prevent confusion, conflict and disintegration," says [[Daniel Melnick]], who produced Carolco's ''L.A. Story''.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;   "There were armed camps on both sides," recalls Melnick, who resigned from the Carolco board in April 1991.&lt;ref name=bloombergbusiness/&gt;

Kassar paid $10 million to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] for him to star in ''Total Recall'' and  $15 million to [[Michael Douglas]] for him to star in ''Basic Instinct''.  "(Kassar) was a big-time riverboat gambler," says [[Brian Grazer]], who coproduced the $43 million ''The Doors'' with Kassar.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Easton|first=Nina J.|title=Hollywood's Billion-Dollar Man : Competing studios aren't exactly thrilled with Carolco Pictures' big-spending ways, but Mario Kassar says, hey, it works for him|date=23 September 1990|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-23/entertainment/ca-1806_1_mario-kassar|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kassar went as far as even giving Schwarzenegger his own airplane, which costed an additional $17 million.&lt;ref name=weminoredinfilm/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloombergbusiness&gt;{{cite web|last=Grover|first=Ronald|title=Carolco May Be Headed For A Quick Dissolve|date=5 July 1992|publisher=''[[Bloomberg Business]]''|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1992-07-05/carolco-may-be-headed-for-a-quick-dissolve|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, a [[Los Angeles]] judge froze $2.2 million of Kassar's shares and limited his access to company accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carolco Pictures Is Talking to Several Potential Investors|date=2 March 1991|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-02/business/fi-1711_1_carolco-pictures|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kassar attempted to produce the now [[Development hell|shelved]] ''Bartholomew vs. Neff'', a [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] film which would have starred Stallone and [[John Candy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHORT TAKES : Stallone in Line for Comedy Role|date=30 July 1990|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-30/entertainment/ca-997_1_sylvester-stallone|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carolco lost about $47 million on ''Cutthroat Island'' and went into bankruptcy on November 1995, six weeks before the film was released to theatres.  Nevertheless, Kassar received his $1 million fee.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffreys|first=Daniel|title=The vanity that led to a $100m bonfire|date=10 April 1996|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-vanity-that-led-to-a-100m-bonfire-1304053.html|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paramount and ''Lolita''===
In the wake of Carolco's collapse, Kassar shifted his employment to [[Paramount Pictures]].  [[Sherry Lansing]], chairman of Paramount, said: "I am thrilled that Mario will be making his new home at Paramount. Mario excels at producing major action-adventure films with high level directors and cast that have worldwide appeal. He also brings creative financial arrangements to the films he makes. We all look forward to our new relationship with him and the exciting projects he will bring to the studio."&lt;ref name=freelibrary&gt;{{cite web|title=MARIO KASSAR TO DEVELOP, PRODUCE FILMS FOR PARAMOUNT PICTURES|date=3 January 1996|publisher=[[The Free Library]]|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MARIO+KASSAR+TO+DEVELOP,+PRODUCE+FILMS+FOR+PARAMOUNT+PICTURES-a017958446|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mario Kassar said: "I have the highest regard for Sherry Lansing and the rest of the Paramount team. Jon Dolgen and I have had a great working relationship for years. Since I've always worked outside the studio system, I am very happy to begin my post-Carolco career with a studio as flexible, dynamic and creative as Paramount. I can't wait to make films in such an environment."&lt;ref name=freelibrary/&gt;

Kassar also executive produced ''[[Lolita (1997 film)|Lolita]]'' (1997), which was directed by [[Adrian Lyne]] and starred [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Melanie Griffith]] and [[Dominique Swain]].&lt;ref name=freelibrary/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

===C2 Pictures and Magnetik Media===
In 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bates|first=James|title=Movie Producer Fined $5,000 in Tax Case|date=8 April 1998|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/08/business/fi-37105|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he reunited with Vajna again and together they founded [[C2 Pictures]], which produced ''[[I Spy (film)|I Spy]]'' (2002), ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003) and ''[[Basic Instinct 2]]'' (2006).&lt;ref name=dofg/&gt;&lt;ref name=mynewsla/&gt;&lt;ref name=streetinsider/&gt;  Kassar later confirmed on March 11, 2009 that as a result of the latter movie being a failure at the [[box office]], plans for a third chapter were shelved and C2 Pictures officially ended the ''Basic Instinct''/[[Catherine Tramell]] franchise.&lt;ref name=moviehole&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive : No more Basic Instinct for C2|date=11 March 2009|url=http://moviehole.net/200918112no-more-basic-instinct-for-c2|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  C2 Pictures was later disbanded afterwards and it was later revealed that Vajna and Kassar founded the company only for the purpose of reviving the ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' franchise.&lt;ref name=weminoredinfilm/&gt;

Kassar also co-founded [[Magnetik Media]] with Erick J. Feitshans and it was announced on May 15, 2007 that Magnetik Media signed ''[[3:10 to Yuma (2007 film)|3:10 to Yuma]]'' (2007) and ''[[The Forbidden Kingdom]]'' (2008) from [[Ryan Kavanaugh]]'s studio, [[Relativity Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodridge|first=Mike|title=Kassar, Feitshan form Magnetik, sign three from Relativity|date=15 May 2007|publisher=[[Screen Daily]]|url=http://www.screendaily.com/kassar-feitshan-form-magnetik-sign-three-from-relativity/4032423.article|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Dade|title=Kassar, Feitshans form Magnetik|date=15 May 2007|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/kassar-feitshans-form-magnetik-1117964945/|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 2000s===
According to ''[[Today's Zaman]]'', it was announced on August 7, 2008 that Kassar was reportedly collaborating with the [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]] on a [[miniseries]] that would recount the life of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kassar to film Sultan Suleiman’s life story|date=7 August 2008|publisher=''[[Today's Zaman]]''|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/arts-culture_kassar-to-film-sultan-suleimans-life-story_149533.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227045317/http://www.todayszaman.com/arts-culture_kassar-to-film-sultan-suleimans-life-story_149533.html|archivedate=27 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that Kassar also participated on ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' (2009).&lt;ref name=moviehole/&gt;  However, it was later revealed that he and Vajna sold the [[Terminator (franchise)|franchise]] to Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek of the Halcyon Group in 2007.  Kassar received $30 million for the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terminator rights up for sale again (but don't worry ... much)|date=28 September 2009|url=http://www.blastr.com/2009/09/terminator_rights_up_for.php|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=Pacificor nabs ‘Terminator’|date=9 February 2010|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|url=https://variety.com/2010/biz/news/pacificor-nabs-terminator-1118014933/|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=Ellisons partner on next ‘Terminator’|date=3 December 2012|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/ellisons-partner-on-next-terminator-1118063043/|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Audition'' and Brick Top===
''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced on October 4, 2012 that Kassar was backing Schuyler Moore, who is helping raise $100 million for the [[Singapore]]-based Infiniti Media Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last2=Szalai|first2=Georg|last1=Bond|first1=Bond|title=Wall Street's Rocky Love Affair With the Movies|date=4 October 2012|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/wall-street-love-affair-movies-375945|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2014, it was reported that Kassar will be producing an English language remake of [[Takashi Miike]]'s 1999 film, ''[[Audition (1999 film)|Audition]]'', which is based on the 1997 [[Audition (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Ryū Murakami]].

On November 24, 2014, [[Brick Top Productions]] had entered into an Executive Services Agreement with Kassar.  Alexander Bafer, Brick Top's CEO said, "There is no human being on this planet better than Mario Kassar at making true Hollywood blockbusters. I am honored with this opportunity to work with him."&lt;ref name=stockguru/&gt;&lt;ref name=4traders/&gt;

==Carolco relaunch==
On January 20, 2015, it was announced that Carolco Pictures was back when Brick Top acquired its name.&lt;ref name=geek&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: CEO Alex Bafer Tells Us About The Return of Carolco|date=26 January 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/243077/exclusive-ceo-alex-bafer-tells-us-about-the-return-of-carolco|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brick Top Productions officially changed its corporate name to Carolco Pictures Inc.&lt;ref name=baystreet&gt;{{cite web|title=Carolco Pictures Label Returns for First Time in 20 Years|date=21 January 2015|url=http://www.baystreet.ca/viewarticle.aspx?id=425088|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2015, it was announced that Kassar had returned as chairman of the board of directors of the currently relaunched Carolco Pictures.  "One of my greatest joys in life was being the chairman of Carolco Pictures ... I am elated to return to that position, to produce the world's greatest movies once again under the Carolco brand for my fans and people everywhere to enjoy," Kassar said.&lt;ref name=mynewsla/&gt;&lt;ref name=streetinsider/&gt;

"The major difference between now and then are the advances in technology and cinematography not previously available to Carolco Pictures 20 years ago," Kassar said. "Combined with these advances ... the best movies I will ever produce are still yet to come."  Alex Bafer, now Carolco Pictures’ CEO, said Kassar "is hands-down the world's greatest producer of mega-hit films. We couldn't be more excited than to have Mario return as the chairman of the board. Our goal now is to not only restore the Carolco brand back to its rightful place in Hollywood, but also to build an entirely new library of memorable films for today's generation."&lt;ref name=mynewsla/&gt;&lt;ref name=streetinsider/&gt;

In November 2017, the new Carolco was renamed Recall Studios.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

'''''Market Wizards''''' is a book written by [[Jack D. Schwager]] and published in 1989 in which he interviews a wide range of [[trader (finance)|traders]] with excellent track records of profitability.

The book contains four parts covering interviews with traders in a wide range of markets. The interviews contain a mixture of facts about the trading careers of the interviewees, their philosophy, and many trading anecdotes. After each of the interviews, Schwager summarises what he believes are the key things to be learned from that particular trader. The book also contains a fifth part on the psychology of trading and two appendices on [[program trading]] and basic options theory. ''If you want to get some insights, by way of verbatim interviews, into the thought processes and trading rules.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= Stanley W| last= Angrist| publisher= The Wall Street Journal |title= Business Bookshelf: Secrets of the Super Traders | date=1989-07-24| url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/wsj/access/27544764.html?dids=27544764:27544764&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jul+24%2C+1989&amp;author=By+Stanley+W.+Angrist&amp;type=1995_1984&amp;desc=Business+Bookshelf%3A+Secrets+of+the+Super+Traders }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those profiled in this book are [[Ed Seykota]], [[Bruce Kovner]], [[Paul Tudor Jones]], [[Michael Steinhardt]], [[Van K. Tharp]] and [[Jim Rogers|James B. Rogers]].

== Traders Interviews ==
Schwager kicks off the series of interviews—and hence the investigation into their thought process—by talking to a man he describes as one of the pioneers of commodity trading—[[Michael Marcus (trader)|Michael Marcus]] of ''Canmarc Trading Co''. His discussion with Marcus is typical of the book as a whole. The reader effectively eavesdrops on a conversation between the two men that starts with how Marcus got into the business and continues through subjects such as the skill necessary to become a good trader.

== Follow-up books ==
After the success of ''Market Wizards'', Schwager in 1992 released a second book, ''[[The New Market Wizards]]'', in 2001 a third book, ''Stock Market Wizards'', and in 2012 his latest book, ''Hedge Fund Market Wizards''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11256">'''Martin Antonio Báez''' is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] businessman and the son of [[Lázaro Báez]]. The younger Báez, who is a director of Austral Construcciones, a construction firm founded by his father, is, like the elder Báez, a central figure in the corruption scandal known variously as “[[Lázarogate]]” and “The Route of the K Money,” the letter K being a reference to the ties enjoyed by Báez and other suspects to the presidencies of the late [[Néstor Kirchner]] and his wife, the incumbent, [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]].

According to ''Perfil'', Martin Báez is the single individual who has been “most compromised” by Lázarogate.&lt;ref name=perf&gt;{{cite web| last =Delfino| first =Emilio| title =Martín Báez, el heredero y el más comprometido del Lázarogate| work =Perfil| url = http://www.perfil.com/politica/Martin-Baez-el-heredero-y-el-mas-comprometido-del-Lazarogate-20130427-0008.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|The Route of the K-Money}} 

==Career==
Martin Báez’s first job was at Epsur SA, where he was a director.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt; Details were reported in July 2013 about Nestor Kirchner’s role in the founding years earlier of Epsur SA, under the control of Lazaro and Martin Baez, and his protection of the company from government regulation and the usual oversight by the Department of Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Entre 2006 y 2007 Kirchner propició un negocio que dejó en manos de Epsur SA, Alessandro Perrone, Julio De Vido, Lázaro y Martín Báez| work =Opi Santa Cruz| date =Jun 14, 2013| url = http://opisantacruz.com.ar/home/2013/06/14/entre-2006-y-2007-kirchner-propicio-un-negocio-que-dejo-en-manos-de-epsur-sa-alessandro-perrone-julio-de-vido-lazaro-y-martin-baez/16435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Báez also became a member of the boards of Del Curto y Loscalzo, Kank &amp; Costilla, and other companies.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt;

The younger Báez is a shareholder in Austral Constructions.  His participation in the family business began in 2007, when he was 26 years old.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt; The firm, which had been created in 2003, only days before the inauguration of Néstor Kirchner as President of Argentina, went on to win more than 90 percent of tenders for public works in Santa Cruz.&lt;ref name=tnimp&gt;{{cite web| title =Otra denuncia contra Baez vez por evasion de impuestos| work =TN| date =Jun 17, 2013| url = http://tn.com.ar/politica/otra-denuncia-contra-baez-esta-vez-por-evasion-de-impuestos_395751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also ran Teegan Martin Inc., a company created in [[Panama]] and based in [[Belize]].&lt;ref name=perf/&gt; Teegan Inc. was established by the law firm Guardia &amp; Guardia in November 2008. Báez was its principal shareholder.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt; 
Martin Báez accumulated substantial wealth in a brief period, which enabled him to purchase a mansion in [[Rio Gallegos]] and a red [[Audi]] coupe, among other possessions.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt;

=="Lázarogate"==
On April 4, 2013, businessman [[Federico Elaskar]], owner of the firm SGI, appeared on the episode of ''Periodismo para todos'', a TV news-investigation program hosted by journalist [[Jorge Lanata]], that began the K money scandal. Elaskar said on the program that [[Leonardo Fariña]] had “sent tens of millions of dollars and euros abroad to offshore companies that were linked to Lázaro Báez and his sons, Leandro and Martin.”&lt;ref name=perf/&gt;

As of April 2013, Martin was the only member of the Báez family to acknowledge connections to Fariña and to SGI. Martin told ''Perfil'' that he had introduced Fariña to representatives of the Buenos Aires cargo-transport firm Plus Cargas.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt; He also admitted that Fariña worked for Austral Construcciones and that some of his suppliers had cashed checks in SGI, also known as the “Rosadita.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =The son of Lázaro Báez admitted he worked with Fariña| work =m24digital| date =Apr 21, 2013| url = http://m24digital.com/en/2013/04/21/the-son-of-lazaro-baez-admitted-he-worked-with-farina/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He denied to ''Perfil'', however, that either he or his father had businesses in Panama or Belize, although Teegan was in fact founded and headquartered in those countries. After hearing that Martin Báez was involved in a scandal, the counsel and representatives of Teegan all resigned.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt;

It was reported on May 3, 2013 that Lázaro and Martin Báez, among others, had been involved with the late Nestor Kirchner in a money-laundering scheme that involved the transfer of cash through Panama, Belize, and [[Switzerland]]. The ''Buenos Aires Herald'' described the Báezes’ actions as “a grotesque display of greed and opulence that is financed, it appears, from kickbacks on public work projects.” Lázaro Báez denied the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Belize in money laundering scheme originating from Argentina| work =News 5| date =May 3, 2013| url = http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/84985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacqueline Bühlmann, spokesperson for the State Prosecutor of the Swiss Confederation, confirmed in May 2013 that the Swiss Attorney General would open formal proceedings for the prosecution of money laundering charges against Lázaro and Martin Báez, among others. This announcement came in the wake of a request by Argentinian officials that an account in the [[Geneva]] bank [[Lombard Odier]] in the name of the Teegan firm, with Martin Báez as proxy, containing $1.5 million in deposits, be frozen, along with accounts in the name of Helvetic Service Group. The bank stated that the Teegan account had already been closed some time earlier, and it was not known were the money had gone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Swiss District Attorneys Office opens proceedings against money laundering | work =offshore bank directory| url = http://www.offshorebanksdirectory.com/offshore-banks-news/swiss-district-attorneys-office-opens-proceedings-against-money-laundering.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A May 2013 report indicated that Martin Báez and [[Daniel Perez Gadín]] had traveled together to [[Spain]] in 2011 and 2012, and to Brazil in 2012, after the Báez group had taken control of Elaskar’s SGI. In addition to numerous trips by Pérez Gadín to [[Uruguay]] in 2011 and 2012, these journeys were held up as evidence of involvement in irregular international money transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Los viajes sospechos del hijo y el contador de Baez| work =TN| date =May 13, 2013| url = http://tn.com.ar/politica/los-viajes-sospechosos-del-hijo-y-el-contador-de-baez_388111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported by the [[Zürich]] newspaper ''Tages Anzeiger'' in June 2013 that Martin Báez’s account at Lombard Odier had existed between 2011 and 2012, and that the money in the account had been moved to [[J. Safra Sarasin]] in [[Brazil]]. The Swiss federal prosecutor affirmed that a criminal investigation for money laundering was underway and that an effort was being made “to get a complete picture” of Lázarogate-related events “here in Switzerland.” Public prosecutor José María Campagnoli summoned Martin Báez for testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Gasparini| first =Juan| title =Destapan el blindaje suizo del grupo Báez en un banco brasilero de Ginebra| work =Plaza del Mayo| date =Jul 10, 2013| url = http://www.plazademayo.com/2013/07/destapan-el-blindaje-suizo-del-grupo-baez-en-un-banco-brasilero-de-ginebra/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Dinero de Martín Báez en Suiza y empresario amigo de la presidenta envuelto en el “Lazarogate”| work =Opi Santa Cruz| date =Jul 8, 2013| url = http://opisantacruz.com.ar/home/2013/07/08/dinero-de-martin-baez-en-suiza-y-empresario-amigo-de-la-presidenta-envuelto-en-el-%E2%80%9Clazarogate%E2%80%9D/16552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in June 2013, Martin Báez, his brother Leandro, their father Lázaro Báez, Austral Construcciones president [[Julio Mendoza]], and the firm’s accountants Daniel Pérez Gadín and [[César Andrés]] were all named by attorney Alejandro Sánchez Kalbermatten in a complaint filed with Economic Criminal Judge Ezekiel Berón Astrada. The complaint charged them with tax evasion and other crimes that had been allegedly carried out on behalf of their firm Austral Construcciones through the use of “creative accounting.” It was asked that the defendants be prohibited from leaving the country and that an audit of the company’s balance sheets be prepared. The complaint also charged the defendants with irregular conduct and misconduct, mismanagement, and false balance.&lt;ref name=tnimp/&gt;

In July 2013 it was reported that the Argentinian justice department had opened two investigations into the Báezes, one for extortion and one for laundering, and that the Swiss Confederation had also opened a criminal investigation into money laundering involving both Lázaro and Martin Báez. Campagnoli, it was noted, had traced “the repatriation of millions of euros” by these two men and their confederates “from Switzerland to Argentina.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =La Suisse enque sur une affaire de blanchiment| work =Le Temps| url = http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/efb27210-e59d-11e2-99fe-9d7442c3ec89/La_Suisse_enqu%C3%AAte_sur_une_affaire_de_blanchiment_li%C3%A9e_%C3%A0_lArgentine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also emerged in July 2013 that security cameras revealed that Lázaro and Martin Báez had gone to Banco Santa Cruz in Rio Gallegos to access the contents of 14 safe-deposit boxes on May 29 and 30, only days before a raid that had been requested by prosecutor Guillermo Marijuán four days earlier. Cameras did not record, however, what they did when they accessed the boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Confirman que Baez reviso sus cajas de antes de que allanaran el banco santa cruz| work =TN| url = http://tn.com.ar/politica/confirman-que-baez-reviso-sus-cajas-de-antes-de-que-allanaran-el-banco-santa-cruz_398230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Antes de que las allanen Baez reviso sus 14 cajas| work =TN| url = http://tn.com.ar/politica/antes-de-que-las-allanen-baez-reviso-sus-14-cajas_397253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casanello was invited by the Swiss Attorney General to travel to Switzerland to discuss the investigation of Martin Báez’s $1.5 million bank account, and after initially accepting the proposal, inviting Marijuán to accompany him, and asking for authorization and funding to make the trip, decided against it in November 2013. Further contacts between the two governments in the matter were made by persons at lower levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Dinero K Casanello no viajara a suiza| work =TN| url = http://tn.com.ar/politica/dinero-k-casanello-no-viajara-a-suiza_424037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in July 2014 that Club Boca Rio Gallegos, a football club chaired by Martín Báez, was, like him, being investigated for money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Salinas| first =Lucia| title =La malaria también llegó al Boca de Lázaro Báez| work =Clarin| date =Mar 7, 2014| url = http://www.clarin.com/politica/Boca-Rio_Gallegos-Lazaro_Baez_0_1168083507.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mexican Stock Exchange''' ({{lang-es|Bolsa Mexicana de Valores}}), commonly known as '''Mexican Bolsa''', '''Mexbol''', or '''BMV''', is one of two [[stock exchange]]s in [[Mexico]], the other being [[BIVA - Bolsa Institucional de Valores]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/articulos/nueva-bolsa-institucional-de-valores?idiom=es|title=Nueva Bolsa Institucional de Valores|first=Presidencia de la|last=República|website=gob.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is the second largest stock exchange in [[Latin America]], only after [[São Paulo]] based [[BM&amp;F Bovespa|B3]] in [[Brasil]]. It is also the fifth largest stock exchange in [[the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-exchanges.org/statistics/monthly-reports |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817220823/http://www.world-exchanges.org/statistics/monthly-reports |archivedate=2014-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exchange platform is owned by [[BMV Group]], which also owns the derivative exchange ''MexDer'' and the custody agency ''Indeval''.

The BMV was created out of the merger of the three stock exchanges which formerly operated in Mexico: The ''Bolsa de Valores de México'', which operated in [[Mexico City]], the Bolsa de Occidente (''Occidental Stock Exchange'') in [[Guadalajara]], and the Bolsa de Monterrey (''Monterrey Stock Exchange''). The exchange kept modernising until its introduction of a fully electronic system for trading which was consolidated in 1999.

In 2014, the Mexican Stock Exchange completed its first trade as a part of [[Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano|MILA]] which, together with the stock exchanges of [[Santiago Stock Exchange|Santiago]], [[Lima Stock Exchange|Lima]], and [[Colombia Stock Exchange|Colombia]], is the second largest securities market by total capitalisation in Latin America.

== History ==
=== Bolsa de México===
From 1880 to 1900, Plateros and Cadena streets in the [[Historic Center of Mexico City|historic centre of Mexico City]] were home to recurring meetings in which brokers and businessmen purchased and sold all kinds of commodities as well as stocks in [[public offering]]s. Afterwards, exclusive groups of shareholders and issuing company representatives would gather to negotiate behind closed doors in different places around the city.

[[File:Calle Madero - Mexico City.jpg|thumbnail|left|Madero Avenue, home of the first stock exchange in Mexico, is today a pedestrian mall.]]
In 1894, Manuel Algara, Camilo Arriaga, and Manuel Nicolín pushed, among the most distinguished brokers of the time, the idea of a normative and institutionalised system to trade securities. With the increased backing and widespread support for his ideas, the '''Bolsa Nacional''' (''National Stock Exchange'') was founded on 31 October 1894 at 9 Plateros Street, later renamed [[Francisco I. Madero Avenue|Madero Street]]. Less than a year later, another group of brokers, led by Francisco A. Llerena and Luis G. Necochea, formed a society named '''Bolsa de México''' (''Stock Exchange of Mexico)'', and registered as a competing establishment on 14 June 1895. Because of coinciding objectives and links between members of the two institutions, leaders began discussing a union between them. On 3 September 1895, the merger was finalised, keeping the name Bolsa de México, and the administrative offices at the Plateros Street address. The company was officially inaugurated on 21 October 1895.

By the start of the following year, Bolsa de México had three public issuing companies and eight private ones, among them, the [[Bank of Mexico]], the [[Grupo Financiero Banamex|National Bank of Mexico]], and the {{Interlanguage link multi|Banco de Londres y México|es}} (later acquired by [[Banco Santander]]).
On 1 March 1933, the [[Congress of Mexico]] passed and President [[Abelardo L. Rodríguez]] signed into law the Regulatory Decree of the General Law of Credit Institutions and Auxiliary Organisations, normalising the exchange of securities and the stock market in Mexico.

===Bolsa de Valores de México, S.A.===
[[File:Abelardo.rodriguez.jpg|framed|right|President Abelardo L. Rodríguez]]
Because of the legal reforms of the time, and the concession authorised by Congress on 28 October 1933, which for the first time included stock exchanges, the charter and bylaws of the Bolsa de Valores de México, S.A. (Stock Exchange of Mexico) were approved, and on 5 September, the institution was incorporated. That same year, the National Securities Commission, later renamed [[Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores|National Banking and Securities Commission]], was established to supervise the Bolsa de Valores de México.

Because of substantial industrial and commercial growth in Mexico mid-century, owing to the rise in the creation of [[maquiladora]]s in northern Mexico, as well as the accumulation of capital and the constant creation of new businesses at the time, the [[Monterrey]] Stock Exchange was established, and it grew to serve the entire North of the country, reaching over 100 listings.&lt;ref&gt;title="Desigualdad, poder y cambio social en Monterrey" by Menno Vellinga. 1988. Siglo Veintiuno Editores&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, businesses in [[Guadalajara]] started organising a third stock exchange, and in 1960, the Occidental Stock Exchange was established to serve the West coast of Mexico.

===Mexican Stock Exchange created===
[[File:Bolsa de Valores México.JPG|thumbnail|left|The Stock Exchange Centre in 2012]]
Because of low performance in the Guadalajara and Monterrey stock exchanges, however, Congress passed in 1975 the Securities' Market Law, which prompted the Bolsa de Valores de México to change its name to Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (Mexican Stock Exchange) and merge the other two exchange houses into it, creating thus the single entity that remains to this day the only stock exchange in Mexico.

On 19 April 1990, the Centro Bursátil was finished on [[Paseo de la Reforma]], turning the Stock Exchange Centre into the heart of the financial district of Mexico City. Five years later, the BMV completely modernised the centre, introducing a completely electronic system (BMV-SENTRA) which was phased into the workings of the exchange, becoming fully operational by 1999.

In 2001, [[Citigroup]] became the first foreign company to begin trading in the BMV, opening the door to many new companies to do the same, especially from Central and South America. The same year, the Securities'  Market Law was reformed according to the demutualisation of BMV. The following year, the Corporativo Mexicano del Mercado de Valores, S.A. de C.V. was constituted to manage the hiring of personnel, and administration of the Stock Exchange and other financial institutions within the Centre.

In 2003, the global market was made available through the BMV, allowing national investors access to foreign securities from within the country. In 2006, the Mexican securities market was opened to foreigners through the MexDer system, allowing them operation from anywhere in the world. In October of the same year, four ETFs ([[exchange-traded fund]]s) over indexes of the stock exchange itself were listed, placing BMV in the first place in [[Latin America]] in terms of ETFs listed over own indexes, and as the leading stock exchange in terms of total ETFs.

In 2010, the BMV signed an alliance with the world's largest derivatives exchange, the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], putting Mexican derivatives within reach of international investors.


The Mexican Stock Exchange, BMV, announced its first trade made as part of the [[Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano|Latin American Integrated Market]] (MILA by its Spanish initials) on 2 December 2014.&lt;ref name="FTMILA"&gt;{{cite web|author= Jude Webber|title= Mexico exchange names Sacristán as new head| url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4ef088e4-7a43-11e4-a8e1-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3OKK1KxiZ |publisher=Financial Times |accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade on MIILA was a $1,415 purchase of 200 shares in Chilean retailer [[Falabella (retail store)|Falabella]], executed by GBM Mexico through GBM Chile.&lt;ref name="FTMILA"/&gt; With the entry of Mexico into MILA, the integrated stock market now counts 798 issuers among the four countries, making it the biggest market by number of listed companies in Latin America, and the biggest in terms of market capitalization, according to the [[World Federation of Exchanges]].&lt;ref name="FTMILA"/&gt; The joint capitalization of the four bourses tops US$1.25 trillion, making it larger than the US$1.22 trillion [[BM&amp;F Bovespa]].&lt;ref name="Nasdaq"&gt;{{cite web|author= Peter Kohli|title= The Andean Exchange: A Developing Market Opportunity In Our Backyard| url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/the-andean-exchange-a-developing-market-opportunity-in-our-backyard-cm331968#ixzz3OKW48vfz |publisher=Nasdaq |accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move comes largely as step in the integration efforts between Mexico, [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], and [[Peru]], as members of the [[Pacific Alliance]].

== Structure and operations ==
BMV is now a public company following its IPO in June 2008, and its shares are traded on the BMV equities market. It operates by concession of the [[Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stockexchange.com.mx/ |title=Data |website=stockexchange.com.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until its IPO BMV was owned by its members, which were a group of banks and brokerage firms. The exchange trades [[debt]] instruments including Federal Treasury certificates ([[CETES]]), Federal Government Development [[Government bond|bonds]] (BONDES), Investment Unit bonds (UDIBONOS), [[Bankers acceptance]]s, [[promissory notes]] with [[Yield (finance)|yield]] payable at [[maturity (finance)|maturity]], [[commercial paper]] and [[International financial institutions|development bank]] bonds. In addition, it also trades [[stocks]], [[debentures]], [[mutual fund]] [[Share (finance)|shares]], and [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]]. Trading is conducted electronically through the BMV-SENTRA [[Equity (economics)|Equities]] System. Settlement is T+3, and trading hours are 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 3 p.m. for the capital markets and 8 a.m. to 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. for debt instruments (Monday through Friday),

== Indices ==
The BMV calculates 13 indices of stock prices. Each [[index (economics)|index]] can be used as an underlying value for [[derivative]] products listed on specialized markets. The main benchmark stock index is called the '''IPC''', which stands for [[Índice de Precios y Cotizaciones]], and is the broadest indicator of the BMV's overall performance. It is made up of a balanced weighted selection of shares that are representative of all the shares listed on the exchange from various sectors across the economy, and is revised twice a year. Weight is determined by [[market capitalization]]. The IPC's value is related to the previous day's value, rather than the base date of October 30, 1978. Since February 2009 the IPC index has included BMV's own A shares. Indice Mexico (INMEX) is a market capitalization weighted index of 20 to 25 of the BMV's most highly marketable issuers, using their most representative series. The sample is limited to issuers with a minimum market value of $100 million and is revised every six months. The weighting cannot be greater than 10% at the start of each calculation period.

'''Mir Khalil-ur-Rahman''' (1927 – 25 January 1992) was the founder and editor of the [[Jang Group of Newspapers]]  which currently publishes many [[Urdu]] and English newspapers in [[Pakistan]]. A self-made newspaper magnate, he ranks among the most successful newspaper entrepreneurs in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Aziz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/spedition/mkr/2009/article1.html |title=Tribute to Mir Khalil-Ur-Rahman (Special Edition 2009) |website=Jang.com.pk |date=1947-08-14 |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/590711/journalist-mir-jamil-dies |title=Journalist Mir Jamil dies - Newspaper |website=Dawn.com |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mir Khalil ur Rahman was born in 1927 to a middle-class family in the town of [[Gujranwala]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], where he received his basic schooling and college education. He received his degree in Accounting from the [[University of the Punjab]] in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]. During the Second World War, his parents moved to [[New Delhi]], the capital of India. It was here that he discovered his love for journalism. The world of newspapers attracted him far more than the dull books of accounting. He had a passion for reading and writing and a fondness for newspapers and magazines. He sat glued to his radio set, listening to the latest war news.&lt;ref name="Aziz"/&gt;

In 1940, when he was still a student, he started a newspaper for the [[Islam|Muslims]] during [[World War II]] in [[Delhi]]. He called it the ''Jang'', or ''War''. Some of his critics said, at that time, that he encouraged the war hysteria by selecting a name like that for his newspaper but  Mir Khalil-ur-Rehman made it clear that he was doing it for the soldiers and not to encourage the [[Second world war]].&lt;ref name=researchpedia/&gt;

After the independence of [[Pakistan]] on 14 August 1947, Mir Khalil moved to [[Karachi]], first capital of the newly created state of Pakistan, and started publishing the [[Daily Jang]] from there which was funded by a loan of 5000 rupees from Abdul Ghani Barq of [[Ferozsons]] Publishers of Lahore. Pakistan's first Governor General and founder,  [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] was delighted by this move and offered the government's help in running it. Mir, however, declined the offer saying that the freedom of the press was his motto and goal for journalism in Pakistan. Mir also helped in the founding of the [[Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors]]. He opposed, tooth and nail, any government measures or action which curbed the freedom of the press in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=researchpedia/&gt;

The index covers the Third Federal Reserve District (the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Fed), namely  covers eastern and central [[Pennsylvania]], the nine southern counties of [[New Jersey]], and [[Delaware]].&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/|title = Business Outlook Survey|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is sometimes also called the '''Philadelphia Fed Index''' because it includes reporting of some index values.&lt;ref name=investopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/philadelphia-fed-survey.asp|title = Philadelphia Fed Survey|publisher = [[Investopedia]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=investopedia2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/philadelphiafederalindex.asp|title = Philadelphia Federal Index|publisher = [[Investopedia]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Philadelphia Fed Report has been published monthly since May 1968, and archives for all historical data (revised to account for seasonal adjustments) are available on the website.&lt;ref name=historical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/historical-data/|title = Business Outlook Survey Historical Data|date = January 9, 2014|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details and data reported==

===Release schedule===

The Philadelphia Index is conducted monthly by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] and questions voluntary participants on things such as unemployment, new orders, shipments, inventories, and prices paid. The report is released on the third Thursday of every month, making it the earliest such regional report which is released to investors.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;&lt;ref name=investopedia2/&gt; For instance, the report for April 2014 was released on Thursday, April 17, 2014.&lt;ref name=april-2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/2014/bos0414.cfm|title = April 2014 Business Outlook Survey|accessdate = April 22, 2014|date = April 17, 2014|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey questions===

The survey is a one-page survey asking respondents to include their name, title, company name, and mailing address, and then seeking their opinion on how they think various indicators related to business changed over the past month, as well as how they anticipate it changing over the next 6 months. For each question, they may select between the options of ''decrease'', ''no change'', and ''increase''.&lt;ref name=sample&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/SampleBOSForm.pdf|title = Business Outlook Survey Questionnaire Sample|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The questions include:

* '''General Business Conditions''': What is your evaluation of the level of general business activity?
* '''Company Business Indicators''':
** New orders
** Shipments
** Unfilled orders
** Delivery times
** Inventories
** Prices paid
** Prices received
** Number of employees
** Average employee workweek
** Capital expenditures

The percentage of respondents selecting particular responses can be accessed, and charted over time to compare responses in different months.&lt;ref name=april-2014/&gt;

Higher survey figures suggest higher production, which contribute to economic growth. Results are calculated as the difference between percentage scores with zero acting as the centerline point. As such, values greater than zero indicate growth, while values less than zero indicate contraction.&lt;ref name=investopedia/&gt;

Some months have additional special questions included in the survey. For instance, the month of April 2014 asked the following questions:&lt;ref name=april-2014/&gt;

# How important are the following factors in influencing your firm’s decision to remain in the three-state region?
# Have the same factors become more or less important in recent years?

for the following list of factors:

* Availability of skilled labor
* Cost of labor
* Taxes/subsidies/regulation
* Cost of energy
* Proximity of customers
* Proximity to distribution channels
* Proximity to suppliers/raw materials

'''Rashid Lombard''' (born 1951) is known as both a jazz photographer and political photojournalist. Lombard is the CEO of espAfrika, an events management company which he started in 1997. espAfrika is responsible for staging the [[Cape Town International Jazz Festival]], formerly known as the North Sea Jazz Cape Town.

&lt;!-- If you need section use == Section_title == as below --&gt;

==Background ==

Rashid Lombard was born in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, South Africa on 10 April 1951. His family moved to Cape Town in the early 1960s. Lombard trained as an architectural draughtsman and then worked as an industrial photographer for the construction company, Murray and Roberts, before becoming a photojournalist covering Africa, and, particularly, South Africa where he focussed on photographing the rise of the democratic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South African History|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/rashid-lombard|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
In the 1980s he worked for the BBC, NBC, AFP and a number of progressive publications such as ''Grassroots'' and ''South''. His work has been part of exhibitions all over southern Africa, including the University of Zimbabwe in 1983 and the [[Staffrider]] exhibitions of 1984 and 1985. In 1985 his work formed part of the exhibition and book, ''South Africa: The Cordoned Heart, Essays by Twenty South African Photographers'', edited by [[Omar Badsha]] and published in New York. He was a member of the ''Vukalisa'' artists' collective which promoted community-based cultural activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South African History Online|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/rashid-lombard|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cape Town International Jazz Festival==
In the mid 1990s he became station manager at [[Fine Music Radio]], and then programming manager at P4 Smooth Jazz Radio. In 1998 Lombard approached the director of the North Sea Jazz Festival to stage a local festival in Cape Town. This was the start of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival, now in its 14th year. The Mandela Bay Music Festival was launched in Port Elizabeth, his home town, in 2011 with George Benson playing to a 28 000 strong crowd. Similar jazz festivals have been held in Mozambique and Angola and there are plans to expand into the rest of Africa including Namibia, Tanzania and Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Daily Maverick|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-04-03-maverick-interview-rashid-lombard/#.UXZX4aJmiSo|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cape Town International Jazz Festival brings more than 40 musicians to perform over two days attracting in excess of 30 000 people. It has been ranked in 2007 fourth in the world, below Montreaux and New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and above the North Sea jazz Festival.  Part of the week-long program focuses on workshops, training and mentoring sessions to develop music appreciation and performance. Top performers at the 2013 festival included the Buena Vista Social Club, Mi Casa, Jimmy Dludlu, Jill Scott, and Gregory Porter.

==Jazz Photography==
Lombard has photographed both local and international musicians, and has paid particular attention to recording South African musicians-in-exile like [[Hugh Masekela]], [[Miriam Makeba]] and [[Abdullah Ibrahim]]. In 2010, he contributed to the exhibition at the Duotone Gallery at the Cape Town International Jazz Festival which paid tribute to South African saxophonist, Hugh Masekela.

His book of jazz photographs, ''Jazz Rocks'', was published in 2010 by espAfrika and Highbury/Safika Media.  [[James Matthews (writer)|James Matthews]], South African poet and writer, in the foreword to the book observed that "Lombard's collection of photographs...is an ode to South Africa's jazz musicians...Each and every lovingly taken photo displays its empathy with the music and the players. As a photographer I don't think Rashid was ever really objective, he is far too personally engaged with his subjects for that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lombard|first=Rashid|title=Jazz Rocks|year=2010|publisher=Highbury Safika Media|location=Cape Town|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jazz Rocks'' was edited by fellow photographer, [[George Hallett (Cape Town)|George Hallett]], who amongst others has won an award for his photographs of [[Nelson Mandela]] and worked on the [[Nobel Peace Centre]] project. The book chronicles the period from the early 1980s to roughly 2004. It is intended as a tribute to some of the musicians who Lombard has worked with and the important role that music played in the anti-apartheid struggle.

In his own words: "Over the years I have spent so much time backstage that the space behind the music is a part of me. Many of the musicians I photographed were far more than just subjects to me. The musicians became my friends and family. We spent many hours honing our skills and teaching each other the politics of the arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lombard|first=Rashid|title=Jazz Rocks|year=2010|publisher=Highbury Safika Media|location=Cape Town|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10345">[[Image:Robert Vincotte.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Robert Vinçotte.]]
'''Robert Vinçotte''' ([[Borgerhout]], 1844-[[Schaarbeek]], 1904) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[engineer]] who laid the basis for industrial [[occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] in his native country. He was involved in the founding of the two companies that would dominate the Belgian [[inspection]] and [[product certification|certification]] market during the twentieth century. He was also the brother of [[Thomas Vinçotte]], a famous Belgian sculptor.

==Early years==
Vinçotte was born in [[Antwerp]]. His father was Jean-Henri Vinçotte (1807-1890), a man who started out as a communal teacher but eventually, through studies in [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Leuven]] and [[Liège (city)|Liège]], became first a professor in [[Antwerp]], then [[Ghent]], and ended his career as a high school inspector (a function that was brand new and very prestigious at the time). Vinçotte Sr. was a highly respected man, once described as "la personnification du devoir et du devoir austère. Ses inspections étaient conduites de la façon la plus consciencieuse"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jaumotte, page 11. Translation: ..."the personification of duty and austere duty. His inspections were performed in the most meticulous way".&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Vinçotte also attended school in Liège and in 1865, gaining the titles of "ingénieur honoraire des mines" (honorary [[History of coal mining#Belgium|mining]] engineer) and "docteur en sciences physiques et mathématiques" (doctor in physical and mathematical sciences). In addition, he was allotted a post as a mathematics teacher at the Atheneum&lt;ref&gt;In Belgium, the term "Atheneum" refers to a secondary school organised by the state, in opposition to those schools linked to [[Catholicism]]&lt;/ref&gt; of Brussels, a great honour in those days. While teaching, Vinçotte deepened his explorations of the explosion of [[Boiler (steam generator)|steam boilers]].

In 1872 Maurice Urban, a director of the [[National Railway Company of Belgium]], asked him to take charge of a new organisation, which would be created for the purpose of inspecting steam boilers in factories. At the time, Vinçotte expressed the problem the new association (and the whole of the industrialized world) faced as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Les explosions de chaudières sont l'un des côtés fâcheux de notre situation industrielle. Désastreuses par les dégâts et les chômages qu'elles occasionnent, odieuses en ce qu'elles montrent la vie humaine pesant moins dans la balance que les dépenses préventives, elles sont, avec les autres dangers du travail, l'une des causes le plus actives à la désaffection des ouvriers.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lecocq, page 2. Translation: "Steam boiler explosions are one of the regrettable aspects of our industrial environment. Disastrous because of the damage and unemployment they cause, hateful because they show human life as less expensive than preventive spending, they are, together with the other dangers of work, one of the most biggest causes of disaffected workers".&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Vinçotte went on to point out that, whereas in [[Great Britain]] there was on average one explosion for every 6000 boilers in service, for Belgium this rate was one in 1000 to 1200. He identified the main causes for this discrepancy as construction or design errors, coupled with bad maintenance, and concluded that regular inspections, as they were being performed in Britain, could decrease the number of boiler explosions in Belgium with at least 75 percent.

==Director of the association==
[[Image:Report Front.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Front of a handwritten inspection report, addressed to Robert Vinçotte]]
In August that year, 13 captains of industry and engineers gathered and set up the provisional organisation that they named the "[[Vinçotte (company)#Association Vinçotte|Association pour la surveillance des chaudières à vapeur]]" ("Association for the Surveillance of Steam Boilers"). Its purpose was to prevent [[Boiler (steam generator)|steam boilers]] from exploding through safety inspection and to promote a more efficient use of power. In return for a membership fee, it would provide semiannual safety inspections and staff instruction. According to the introductory letter, the association was non-profit.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fondée dans un but philantropique, l'Association a exclu l'idée de faire des bénéfices; les ressources de l'Association seront entièrement consacrées à rendre le service aussi complet que possible.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lecocq, page 4. Translation: "Founded for a [[philanthropic]] purpose, the association has excluded the notion of making profit; the resources of the association will be entirely devoted to giving the most complete service possible.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Report Middle.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Middle of the same inspection report. Note the underlined big "Explosion de 1895" in the middle.]]
The association had near to five hundred members by the end of 1872. By 1910, it would inspect more boilers than the combined inspection organisations of Germany and France.&lt;ref&gt;Lecocq, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; However, this success was still far away at the time: in 1873, the association only had three engineers at its disposal, one of whom was its director, Robert Vinçotte, himself. In that year, Vinçotte combined his function of director with inspecting 250 steam boilers (half of the number of steam boilers the association had registered at the end of the previous year). Vinçotte went abroad the next years, to [[Düsseldorf]] and the [[United States]], to follow the latest innovations in [[steam engine|steam engine and vessel]] technology. In 1875, he pressed the Belgian government to make inspections such as his company performed obligatory by law, something that resulted in the revised police regulations of 1884.

Vinçotte's close cooperation with the state would continue in 1881 when he travelled to the United States again, this time on request of the Belgian government {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} to bring back knowledge of the safety measures for steam boilers of the [[Gilded Age#Industrial and technological advances|burgeoning American industry]]. The result was a compilation of rules for calculating the [[reliability engineering|reliability]] and strength of the key parts of steam boilers, later published in a textbook. Also in 1881, the association announced that, after ten years, its amount of biannually inspected steam boilers had more than quadrupled, while only 0.17 percent of them had failed in the same period.

For these and his earlier contributions to Belgian industrial safety, Vinçotte was awarded the rank of Knight in the [[Order of Leopold II]] in 1885.

In 1887, a budget surplus allowed every one of its employees a life insurance, a fund that could also be accessed upon retirement.

==Death==
Robert Vinçotte died in 1904 after returning from a study trip to [[Italy]], and would be replaced as a director of AV in 1909 by his son, whose first name was the same as his. He is buried in [[Schaarbeek]]. In that same year,{{which|date=December 2016}} AIB was given its second golden medal for its participation at the [[World's fair|world exhibition]] in [[Paris]]. As a tribute, the "Association pour la surveillance des chaudières à vapeur" would be rebaptised in 1922 as "Association Vinçotte pour la surveillance des chaudières à vapeur", as it had already been known for some time abroad.

'''Salvatore Ferragamo''' (5 June 1898 &amp;ndash; 7 August 1960) was an [[Italy|Italian]] shoe [[fashion designer|designer]] and the founder of [[luxury goods]] high-end retailer [[Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A.]]. Ferragamo worked with many [[celebrities|Hollywood stars]] in the 1920s, before returning to Italy to found the eponymous company making bespoke footwear. His scientific and creative approach to shoes spawned many innovations such as the [[wedge (footwear)|wedge heel]] and cage heel. 

==Early life==
Salvatore Ferragamo was born in 1898 to a poor family in [[Bonito, Italy|Bonito]], [[Italy]], near [[Avellino]], the eleventh of 14 children. After making his first pair of shoes for himself, a pair of high heels, at age nine (and his sisters to wear at their [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]]), young Salvatore decided that he had found his calling.{{Citation Needed|date=October 2018}}

==Career==
After studying [[shoemaking]] in [[Naples]] for a year, Ferragamo opened a small store based in his parent's home. In 1914, he emigrated to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where one of his brothers worked in a cowboy boot factory. After a brief stint at the factory, Ferragamo convinced his brothers to move to [[California]], first [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] then [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. It was here that Ferragamo found success, initially opening a shop for repair and [[made-to-measure]] shoes, leading to a long period of designing footwear for the cinema. However, he could not fathom why his shoes pleased the eye yet hurt the foot, so he proceeded to study [[anatomy]] at the [[University of Southern California]].{{Citation Needed|date=October 2018}}

After spending thirteen years in the US, Ferragamo returned to Italy in 1927, settling in [[Florence]]. He began to fashion shoes for women , from the [[Indira of Baroda|Maharani of Cooch Behar]] to [[Eva Peron]] to [[Marilyn Monroe]]. He opened a workshop in the Via Mannelli, concentrating his efforts in experimenting with design, applying for patents for ornamental and utility models and some related inventions. Although he filed for [[bankruptcy]] in 1933 due to bad management and economic pressures, Ferragamo nonetheless expanded his operation during the 1950s to a workforce of around 700 expert artisans that produced 350 pairs of handmade shoes a day.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

"The Rainbow" was created by Salvatore Ferragamo in 1938 and was the first instance of the platform shoe returning in modern days in the West. The platform sandal was designed for American singer and actress [[Judy Garland]]. The shoe was a tribute to Judy Garland's signature song "[[Over the Rainbow]]" performed in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) feature film. The shoe was crafted using shaped slabs of [[Cork (material)|cork]] that were covered in [[suede]] to build up the wedge and gold kidskin was used for the straps. His creation was a result of experimentations with new materials because of wartime rationing during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= DeMello| first= M. |year= 2009| title= Feet and footwear: A cultural encyclopedia| place= Santa Barbara, California| publisher= Greenwood Press/ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Salvatore Ferragamo died in 1960 at the age of 62, but his name lives on as an international company, which has expanded its operations to include luxury shoes, bags, eyewear, silk accessories, watches, perfumes and a ready-to-wear clothing line. At his death, his wife Wanda and later their six children (Fiamma, Giovanna, Fulvia, Ferruccio, Massimo and Leonardo) ran the company. {{Citation Needed|date=October 2018}}

His most famous invention is arguably the "Cage Heel".{{cn|date=August 2018}} Fiamma (Salvatore's eldest daughter who died in 1998) came up with the "Vara pumps" in 1978.{{Citation Needed|date=October 2018}}

A [[Salvatore Ferragamo Museum|museum dedicated to Ferragamo's life and work]] opened in the [[Palazzo Spini Feroni]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.florencedailynews.com/2017/04/28/salvatore-ferragamos-return-to-italy-90-years-later/|title=Ferragamo's return to Italy... 90 years later {{!}} Florence Daily News|date=2017-04-28|work=Florence Daily News|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palazzo had been bought by Ferragamo in the 1930s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In March 2013, Ferragamo's fashion house, [[Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A.]], established the Ferragamo Foundation in Florence. The foundation was formed to cultivate young [[fashion designer]]s, based on the ideas of Salvatore Ferragamo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2013/03/27/salvatore-ferragamo-launches-fashion-foundation |title=Salvatore Ferragamo Launches Fashion Foundation |date=27 March 2013 |first=Scarlett |last=Kilcooley-O'Halloran |journal=Vogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==
The company is currently owned by the Ferragamo family, which in November 2006 included Salvatore's widow Wanda, five children, 23 grandchildren and other relatives. There is a rule that only 3 members of the family can work at the company, prompting fierce competition.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

'''Shmuel "Samy" Flatto-Sharon''' ({{lang-he-n|שמואל פלאטו-שרון}}, born 18 January 1930) is a controversial [[France|French]]-[[Israel]]i businessman, radio talk-show host and former politician who was a member of the [[Knesset]] between 1977 and 1981.

==Biography==
Flatto-Sharon was born as '''Shmuel Sheibitz''' to a Jewish family in [[Łódź]], [[Poland]] in 1930. His family escaped to France after the [[German invasion of Poland]], with Shmuel disguised as a girl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1159193370598&amp;pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull One on One with Flatto-Sharon: Broadcast Zionism] The Jerusalem Post, 4 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Forty members of his family, including his father, died in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. He attended high school in [[Paris]] and [[Strasbourg]], and joined the [[Mouvement Jeunes Communistes de France|Young Communist League]] in 1945.

At age 14, he began selling cigarettes to soldiers and students, and then entered the recycling business, making a fortune in the recycling of paper, rags, and scrap metal. At age 21, he entered the real estate business. Throughout his 20s, Sharon built up his business empire. He came to own a transport service for hauling merchandise with dozens of trucks, industrial plants, a chain of restaurants and cafes, and hotels.&lt;ref name=hayom&gt;http://www.israelhayom.co.il/site/newsletter_article.php?id=25609&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1960s, he owned dozens of companies throughout Europe, the [[United States]], and [[South America]], and did business in oil, logging, and precious metals in [[Africa]].

==Emigration to Israel==
In 1975 he made [[aliyah]] to Israel, fleeing the French authorities as he was wanted for embezzling $60 million.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/28/world/israel-court-orders-candidate-to-begin-a-bribery-jail-term.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fE%2fEthics Israel Court Orders Candidate To Begin a Bribery Jail Term] New York Times, 28 June 1984&lt;/ref&gt; He bought a villa in [[Savyon]] and immediately launched a business career in Israel. He entered a partnership with Israeli businessman Avraham Pilz, with whom he established the [[Dizengoff Center]], which was Israel's first shopping mall. 

==Israeli political career==
Despite barely speaking Hebrew, in 1977 he formed a one-man [[List of political parties in Israel|party]], also named [[Development and Peace (political party)|Flatto-Sharon]], to run in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|Knesset elections]] that year, hoping to obtain parliamentary immunity to avoid extradition to France.&lt;ref name=FS&gt;[http://www.flattosharon.co.il/BRING%20BACK%20FLATTO-SHARON.html Bring Back Flatto-Sharon] Shmuel Flatto-Sharon&lt;/ref&gt;

The list won 2% of the vote, enough for two seats. However, as it was a one-man list, only one seat was taken.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_mimshal_res9.htm Ninth Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the surprising level of support that the party won was a response to France's refusal to extradite [[Abu Daoud]], who was wanted in Israel for the [[Munich massacre]].&lt;ref name=FS/&gt;

Once ensconced in the [[Knesset]], Flatto-Sharon joined [[Menachem Begin]]'s coalition, with one of his first acts being to vote in favour of a law that prohibited the extradition of Israeli citizens.&lt;ref name=FS/&gt; He sat on the Economic Affairs Committee and in 1978 he renamed the party ''Development and Peace''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionHistoryAll_eng.asp Mergers and Splits Among Parliamentary Groups] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; During his Knesset term he was involved in negotiations to free Israeli [[Prisoner of war|POWs]].&lt;ref name=FS/&gt; The party ran in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981]] and [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984 elections]], but did not pass the [[Election threshold|electoral threshold]] of 1% in either, and subsequently disappeared. Flatto-Sharon was never extradited to France to serve the five-year sentence given to him in his absence, as the five-year statute of limitations had expired.

In 1984 he was sentenced to three months community service for bribery during the 1977 election campaign. It had emerged that he had "bought votes in 1977 by promising apartments to young couples and homes to others at reduced prices" as well as paying voters (who were described as "campaign workers") and giving money to a local party in [[Dimona]] to be associated with his party. His community service was performed in a state agency in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Later life==
After losing his seat in the Knesset in 1981, he returned to private business. He and his wife Annette became celebrities known for hosting parties in their luxury villa in Savyon, with businessmen and other celebrities attending. The French government continued to maintain an international arrest warrant for him, and due to this, he rarely left Israel. In the early 1990s, after learning that he no longer had an [[Interpol]] warrant out for his arrest, Sharon flew to [[Italy]] on a business trip, and was arrested upon arrival in [[Rome]].

'''Super Bock''' is a Portuguese beer brand from the '''[[Unicer]]''' brewery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superbock.pt/global/en/products/#super-bock-original|title=Super Bock: Characteristics|publisher=Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produces a range of beers under the same name. Established in 1927, Super Bock maintains a leading position in the market and it is among the favourite beer brands of the Portuguese. It is also the best-selling Portuguese beer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/arquivo/2005/interior/super-bock-lidera-ranking-de-bebidas-em-portugal-611658.html|title='Super Bock' leads 'ranking' of drinks in Portugal|language=Portuguese|date=March 7, 2005|publisher=Diário de Notícias|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marktest.com/wap/a/n/id~1d54.aspx|title=Super Bock maintains the leadership in the space occupied in linear|language=Portuguese|date=June 17, 2014|publisher=Marktest|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Super Bock was created in 1927 and, in 1967, its first adverts were launched under the slogan "The beer that goes beyond your expectations".&lt;ref name="Super Bock - Unicer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicer.pt/en/home-en/brands/beer/super-bock-en#76|title=Brands – Beer: Super Bock|publisher=Unicer Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 70s, the company launched a distribution network in [[Lisbon]] with 12 delivery vans.&lt;ref name="Super Bock - Unicer"/&gt;

In 1992, Super Bock became the market leader in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbbsdev.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=7070&amp;Itemid=74|title=Case Study: Super Bock|language=Portuguese|date=2008|publisher=Superbrands Portugal}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining the preference of beer consumers until today. In 1995, Super Bock was the first Portuguese brand to use product naming in a music festival. Thus, [[Super Bock Super Rock]] came to be&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superbocksuperrock.pt/en/history/|title=History|publisher=Super Bock Super Rock Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; the biggest rock festival to be held in Portugal and the only one to celebrate 20 consecutive years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/empresas/detalhe/super_bock_super_rock_celebrara_em_lisboa_os_seus_20_anos_de_musica_estival.html|title=Super Bock Super Rock Festival celebrates 20 years in Parque das Nações|language=Portuguese|date=December 3, 2014|publisher=Negócios|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 and 2001, Super Bock sponsors two of the largest Portuguese cultural events ever: [[Expo'98]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parqueexpo.pt/conteudo.aspx?lang=ing&amp;id_object=692&amp;name=EXPO%2798|title=History: World Expo’98|publisher=Parque Expo Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Porto 2001 ([[European Capital of Culture]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videos.sapo.pt/ePjGHnqGPbY8EIzZazaC|title=2001 Year Review – Porto Capital of Culture|language=Portuguese|date=August 2, 2012|publisher=SIC|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Super Bock Stout''', launched in 2003, sold five million litres with three months of market presence, the value the group estimated to achieve by the end of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/empresas/detalhe/super_bock_stout_atinge_objectivos_de_vendas_anuais_em_tres_meses.html|title=Super Bock Stout reaches annual sales targets in three months|language=Portuguese|author=Bárbara Leite|date=May 21, 2003|publisher=Negócios|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the brand entered the segment of non-alcoholic beers with '''Super Bock Twin'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/unicer/ferreira-de-oliveira/super-bock-vai-lancar-cerveja-sem-alcool|title=Super Bock will launch non-alcoholic beer|language=Portuguese|date=March 2, 2005|publisher=TVI 24|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, 2004, '''Super Bock Green''' was launched,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/empresas/detalhe/unicer_investe_3_milhoes_no_lancamento_da_nova_super_bock_green.html|title=Unicer invests 3 million in the launch of the new Super Bock|language=Portuguese|author=Paula Brito|date=April 5, 2004|publisher=Negócios|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; marking the beginning of a new segment in the beer market in Portugal: ''beer mixers'' (flavoured beers).

In 2006, two new beers are launched: '''Super Bock Tango''', the first "[[Redcurrant|gooseberry]] beer" produced in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hipersuper.pt/2006/03/23/Unicer_lan_a_cerveja_com_groselh/|title=Unicer launches beer with gooseberry|language=Portuguese|author=Rita Gonçalves|date=March 23, 2006|publisher=Hipersuper|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Abadia''', a craft beer recipe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/portugal/europa/abadia-e-maior-sucesso-de-lancamento-da-unicer|title=Abadia is the most successful release of Unicer|language=Portuguese|author=Catarina Craveiro|date=March 23, 2006|publisher=TVI 24|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which achieved the highest market share among new releases.

In 2007, Super Bock presented the first Portuguese beer bottle made entirely of aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hipersuper.pt/2007/02/27/Super_Bock_em_alum_nio_/|title=Super Bock in aluminium|language=Portuguese|author=Victor Jorge|date=February 27, 2007|publisher=Hipersuper|accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the new range of non-alcoholic Super Bock beers – created through a partnership with the [[Chemical Engineering]] Department of [[Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto|Porto University's Faculty of Engineering]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/noticias_geral.ver_noticia?p_nr=6687|title=Unicer and FEUP have unique beer production process without alcohol|language=Portuguese|date=April 2007|publisher=FEUP Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; – was relaunched. The production of the new '''Non-Alcoholic Super Bock''' begins with a base beer – '''Super Bock Original''' – from which the [[aroma]]s are removed. It is then subjected to a process of alcohol removal and, in the end, flavours are returned to the beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meiosepublicidade.pt/2007/05/Para_que_serve_a_Super_Bock_P_ss/|title=What is the purpose of Super Bock Peach|language=Portuguese|author=Filipe Pacheco|date=May 4, 2007|publisher=Público|accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a '''Non-alcoholic Black''' beer and a '''Non-alcoholic beer with Peach flavour''' were launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dinheirodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?id_news=76610|title=Unicer wants to grow 25% in the non-alcoholic beers this year|language=Portuguese|date=January 23, 2007|publisher=Dinheiro Digital|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, the launch of '''Super Bock Non-Alcoholic Lemon''' reinforces the range of Unicer non-alcoholic beers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hipersuper.pt/2007/10/26/limo-refora-aposta-sem-lcool-da-super-bock/|title=Lemon reinforces Super Bock beers without alcohol|language=Portuguese|author=Victor Jorge|date=October 26, 2007|publisher=Hipersuper|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, '''Abadia Ruby and Gold''' beers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/superbock/gourmet/super-bock-lanca-campanha-para-novas-cervejas-por-3-milhoes|title=Super Bock launches new beers campaign for 3 million|language=Portuguese|date=March 20, 2008|publisher=TVI 24|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; – gourmet limited editions – were launched, the same year when '''Super Bock XpresS''' bottle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hipersuper.pt/2008/06/03/super-bock-a-pressao-renasce-em-garrafa/|title=Draught Super Bock now in bottle|language=Portuguese|author=Rita Gonçalves|date=June 3, 2008|publisher=Hipersuper|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was announced – a pressure bottled beer, a partner product of the pressure beer system for domestic use (Super Bock XpresS) that had been put on the market in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meiosepublicidade.pt/2006/11/Super_Bock_lan_a_cerveja_press/|title=Super Bock launches draught beer for home use|language=Portuguese|author=Maria João Lima|date=November 15, 2006|publisher=Meios&amp;Publicidade|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2008, the brand began a process of restyling of its entire range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superbrands.com/pt/pdfs/vol5_case_studies/SUPERBOCK.pdf|title=Case Study: Super Bock|language=Portuguese|date=2009|publisher=Superbrands Portugal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Super Bock Mini''' with easy opening – a pioneering system, which eliminates the need of a corkscrew&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hipersuper.pt/2009/05/29/super-bock-mini-com-capsula-inovadora/|title=Super Bock Mini with innovative capsule|language=Portuguese|author=Rita Gonçalves|date=May 29, 2009|publisher=Hipersuper|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; – hits the market in 2009. Following this launch, in 2010 begins the sale of the IceBocks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.briefing.pt/marketing/11682-novas-super-bock-verao-e-icebocks-em-edicao-especial.html|title=New Super Bock Verão and Icebocks in special edition|language=Portuguese|date=May 31, 2011|publisher=Briefing|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a box to which ice can be added to cool the mini beers -, and is launched the first edition of '''Super Bock Verão''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinheirovivo.pt/buzz/super-bock-entra-na-onda/|title=Super Bock goes with the flow|language=Portuguese|author=Ana Marcela|date=July 19, 2011|publisher=Dinheiro Vivo|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a more refreshing and low-alcohol beer.

Also in 2010 the range of '''Super Bock Non-Alcoholic 0.0%''' has been extended with the launch of a new flavour: Apple. The brand seized this launch to present a new image for its non-alcoholic flavoured beers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hipersuper.pt/2010/05/12/super-bock-sem-alcool-e-com-sabor-a-maca/|title=Non-Alcoholic Super Bock with a taste of apple|language=Portuguese|date=May 12, 2010|publisher=Hipersuper|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The big focus in 2011 was the launch of '''Super Bock Classic'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meiosepublicidade.pt/2011/05/super-bock-regressa-as-origens-com-nova-cerveja/|title=Super Bock returns to his roots with new beer|language=Portuguese|author=Pedro Durães|date=May 4, 2011|publisher=Meios&amp;Publicidade|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Super Bock went through a market repositioning process, creating a new brand signature: "Life is Super".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicer.pt/en/home-en/unicer/history|title=Over a hundred years of history|publisher=Unicer Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, '''Super Bock Selecção 1927''' was launched,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.distribuicaohoje.com/Super-Bock-lanca-Seleccao-1927/|title=Super Bock launches Selecção 1927|language=Portuguese|author=Ana Rita Costa|date=April 30, 2013|publisher=Distribuição Hoje|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essenciadovinho.com/pt/revista-wine/read/548-super-bock-reforca-gama-de-cervejas-artesanais-seleccao-1927|title=Super Bock reinforces range of craft beers with Selecção 1927|language=Portuguese|date=July 25, 2013|publisher=Essência do Vinho|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a range of craft beers in limited and seasonal editions.

In 2015, the best-selling Portuguese beer in the world took on a new commitment with Portuguese consumers, and changed its signature to "Super Bock takes Friendship Seriously".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://imagensdemarca.sapo.pt/temas-especiais/radar/super-bock-leva-a-amizade-a-serio/|title=Super Bock takes Friendship seriously|language=Portuguese|author=Ana Gaboleiro|date=April 17, 2015|publisher=Imagens de Marca|accessdate=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketeer.pt/2015/04/20/super-bock-quer-mais-brindes-a-amizade/|title=Super Bock wants more toasts to friendship|language=Portuguese|date=April 20, 2015|publisher=Marketeer|accessdate=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Super Bock launched a new range of beers – '''Super Bock Mix Vodka Lemon''' and '''Super Bock Mix Caipirinha''' – in order to meet the needs of urban consumers, and focusing on night markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinheirovivo.pt/buzz/vodka-limao-ou-caipirinha-a-super-bock-da-a-provar-as-duas/|title=Vodka lemon or caipirinha?

In January 2016, Unicer opened the visitor centre "Super Bock House of Beer", located in Leça do Balio Production Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://marketeer.pt/2016/01/18/super-bock-inaugura-casa-dedicada-a-cerveja/|title=Super Bock opens house dedicated to beer|language=Portuguese|date=January 18, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2016|publisher=Marketeer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.meiosepublicidade.pt/2016/01/casa-da-cerveja-da-super-bock-no-porto-com-assinatura-da-omdesign/|title=Super Bock House of Beer in Porto made by Omdesing|language=Portuguese|author=Pedro Durães|date=January 18, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2016|publisher=Meios&amp;Publicidade}}&lt;/ref&gt; There you can see the brewing process, discover the raw materials used to make beer, as well as stories, interesting facts and remarkable moments of Super Bock beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.hipersuper.pt/2016/01/19/super-bock-inaugura-casa-da-cerveja-no-porto-com-imagens/|title=Super Bock opens House of Beer in Porto|language=Portuguese|author=Rita Gonçalves|date=January 19, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2016|publisher=Hipersuper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://imagensdemarca.sapo.pt/atualidade/super-bock-abre-as-portas-da-casa-da-cerveja/|title=Super Bock opens House of Beer|language=Portuguese|author=Marco Silva|date=January 18, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2016|publisher=Imagens de Marca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, TÜSİAD released a statement criticizing a proposed law which would enhance the government’s authority to appoint boards of trustees to companies.The controversial article was later removed from the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2016/ekonomi/kayyum-duzenlemesi-degistirildi-1282408/|title=Kayyum düzenlemesi değiştirildi|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universiti Teknologi Malaysia''' (also known as '''UTM''') is a public research-intensive university in engineering, science and technology located in [[Skudai]], [[Johor]] and it has a branch campus in [[Kuala Lumpur]].

UTM is a graduate-focused university with 56% of its student population consisting of postgraduate students, the highest in Malaysia. As of 2015, UTM has more than 5,000 international students from more than 120 countries, the highest research university in Malaysia.

==History==

=== From a technical school ===
The history of UTM began in 1904 when a technical school began operation on Weld Road (now Jalan Raja Chulan) to teach Technical Assistants for the Federated Malay States Departments of Railways, Survey and Public Works. The school was known as '''Treacher Technical School''' , named after Sir [[William Treacher]], the Resident General. Students took classes on part-time basis; they worked and trained according to the technical needs of their employment.

In 1941 the Advisory Committee of Technical Schools recommended that the school be elevated to college status and proposed that a new technical college be constructed. The new college was to be built on a 47-acre piece of government land in Gurney Road (now Jalan Semarak), Kuala Lumpur. Plans for the construction of the college, however, were put on hold when [[World War II]] erupted in Peninsular Malaysia.

=== Then a technical college ===
In the early years, the technical college conducted engineering courses at [[diploma]] level in Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Radio Engineering, Land Surveying, Building Architecture and Quality Surveying, while a special in Automobile Engineering was offered for the transportation enforcement officers. The enrolment for the 1958/1959 academic session was 320 students.

In 1960 the college began a new era by upgrading its [[engineering]] courses to the [[academic degree|degree]] level. Student following courses at the college sat for [[professional examinations]] conducted by the Institution of Civil Engineers and Institution of Mechanical Engineers, United Kingdom &amp; the Royal Institute of British Architects, as well as the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. Students for the professional courses were drawn from government servants for the Federation of Malaya Singapore, Borneo and Brunei. Minimum entry requirements then were Grade I &amp; II in the Cambridge School Certificate or the Malayan School Certificate with credits in English Language &amp; Basic Mathematics. Priorities were given to those who obtained credits in Science subjects.

=== A technical institute ===
On March 14, 1972, Malaysia’s Ruler, DYMM Seri Paduka Baginda Yang Dipertuan Agong proclaimed the formation of Institut Teknologi Kebangsaan (ITK) under section 6(1) of the [[University &amp; University College Act 1971]]. The institution inherited all the amenities and facilities of the former Technical College of Gurney Road. Mr. [[Ainuddin Abdul Wahid]] who was the principal of Technical College was made the first Rector of ITK. An interim Council consisting of nine members was tasked to devise the major policies to be implemented in the new establishment. Three administrative positions were also formalized: the [[Registrar (education)|Registrar]], the [[Bursar]] and the [[Chief Librarian]].

=== Finally a university ===
On 1 April 1975, the journey from school to university was completed when the institution became '''Universiti Teknologi Malaysia''' (UTM).

In 1976, the government approved the university constitution and the university Senate and Council were established.

As of the 1975/1976 academic year, the [[UTM Faculty of Engineering]] split into the faculties of [[Civil engineering|Civil]], [[Mechanical engineering|Mechanical]] and [[Electrical engineering|Electrical]] Engineering Faculties. The three faculties together with the Faculty of [[Built Environment]] and Faculty of [[Surveying]], plus the Centre for Science for Science Students and Centre for Humanities Students became the precursors of most academic programmes in UTM today. By 1976, the student population had reached 2,593 with 1,745 pursuing diploma level studies, 607 in the degree programmes, and 241 in the integrated programmes.

On December 3, 1977, UTM witnessed its first group of 65 graduates being conferred their degrees in the inaugural convocation ceremony in Kuala Lumpur, graced by the Royal Highness Almarhum Sultan Ismail Ibni Almarhum Sultan Ibrahim, the first Chancellor of UTM.

=== Moving to Johor ===

The university moved to a new campus located on 2,400 acres of land in [[Skudai]], Johor. Construction works had begun in 1978 and the campus opened on September 16, 1985 by His Majesty [[Sultan Iskandar Ibni Almarhum Sultan Ismail]], then the [[Yang di Pertuan Agong]], in his capacity as his capacity as the second Chancellor of UTM.

UTM's has regional and international academic collaborations., including [[Intel]], [[Altera]], and [[Proton (automobile)|Proton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.innovation.utm.my/collaborations-in-innovation/utm-proton-in-green-tech/ UTM-Proton to Collaborate in developing hybrid and green technology&lt;/ref&gt; UTM is one of the few public universities in Malaysia that has attained [[research university]] status, opening avenues for research and industrial collaboration through government research grants.

=== Full autonomy ===
On 8 January 2012, the [[Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education]] declared UTM to be the first Malaysian university to attain full autonomy from the government. This allows the university to select the best of the regional students, as well as handle most of the management internally for a more efficient administration.

==Campuses==
UTM has two campuses - the main campus is in [[Skudai]], and was the first university in the state of [[Johor]]. It has an area of 1148 hectares&lt;ref name="sps.utm.my"&gt;http://www.sps.utm.my/download/bahan2015/Postgraduate%20brochure%20SRAD%202015.pdf A Guide to Postgraduate Study&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://web.utm.my/campus_map/ campus map]), and is the second largest public university after [[Universiti Putra Malaysia]] (UPM). It is about 20&amp;nbsp;km north of the state capital, Johor Bahru.

The branch campus is situated in ''Jalan Semarak'' within [[Kuala Lumpur]], with an area of 38 hectares.&lt;ref name="sps.utm.my"/&gt; The branch campus accommodates [[diploma]] students, part-time students (also known as the ''SPACE'' program), undergraduate students (Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology) and foreign students taking business courses.

== General ==
The university has a library (known as ''Perpustakaan Sultanah Zanariah'')&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utm.my/psz/ Homepage of Perpustakaan Sultanah Zanariah&lt;/ref&gt; with online facilities. There are free bus services, as well as local and international restaurants on campus.

The Webometrics Ranking of World Universities places UTM in the fourth place in the South East Asia Region, and the top in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.webometrics.info/top100_continent.asp?cont=SE_Asia |title=Webometric Rankings of Universities in South East Asia |access-date=13 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705123840/http://www.webometrics.info/top100_continent.asp?cont=SE_Asia |archive-date=5 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the QS University Rankings, it placed 100 in the "''Engineering &amp; Technology Universities''" category among other world ranked universities in 2016&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universiti-teknologi-malaysia-utm Ranking of UTM at topuniversities.com]&lt;/ref&gt; UTM aims to achieve the status of a global university and rank among 50 of the world's best universities by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernama|title=UTM Strives to be Among World's Top 50 Universities|url=http://www.malaysiandigest.com/news/38607-utm-strives-to-be-among-worlds-top-50-universities.html|work=Malaysian Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another initiative is the formation of the Iskandar Malaysia Academic Partnership (IMAP) resulting from the Inaugural UTM University Presidents Forum.

== Official Song ==
UTM official song entitled 'Keunggulan Terbilang' (Distinct Eminence) was composed by Hamzah Ibrahim. The lyrics was written by Tamjis Kastiran.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utm.my/about/utm-official-song/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residential colleges (Skudai Campus)==
UTM has on-campus hostel blocks that provide accommodation for students. The hostel blocks are grouped into units known as colleges, for simplifying administration. Each college has three or more hostel blocks under their administration. UTM has 13 colleges, which can accommodate 17,500 students. Among the facilities provided at each residential college are a cafeteria, a multipurpose hall, a Muslim prayer room, tennis courts, an internet and computer center, a convenience store and a common room.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utm.my/currentstudent/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=123 Accommodation in UTM&lt;/ref&gt;

UTM can provide accommodation for outsiders, i.e. parents or relatives, visiting friends  etc., with Scholar's Inn @ UTM JB and Scholar's Inn @ UTM KL.

The Scholar’s Inn @ UTMKL is a city campus hotel at Jalan Semarak, in the heart of Kuala Lumpur. Located within the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Kuala Lumpur campus and approximately 10 minutes’ drive from KLCC/ Petronas Twin Towers, the hotel is also within range of tourist spots such as the National Library, National Art Gallery, Istana Budaya and the Golden Triangle.

'''Wu Yao-ting''' ({{zh|t=吳耀庭|labels=no}}; 20 June 1926 – 4 February 2012) was a Taiwanese businessman, best known as the founder of the [[President Department Store]] and other companies such as [[supermarket]], [[hotel]], and various [[food industry]] businesses.

In 1958, Wu established the department store Ta Shing (大新百貨), the first department store in Taiwan to have an [[escalator]].&lt;ref name="ET20120209"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ettoday.net/news/20120209/23898.htm?t=%E3%80%8C%E7%99%BE%E8%B2%A8%E5%8D%97%E9%9C%B8%E5%A4%A9%E3%80%8D%E5%90%B3%E8%80%80%E5%BA%AD%E7%97%85%E9%80%9D%E3%80%80%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E4%BB%A3%E6%8E%A5%E7%8F%AD|script-title=zh:「百貨南霸天」吳耀庭病逝　第二代接班|trans-title='Southern Department Store King' Wu Yao-ting passes away; second generation takes the reigns|work=Eastern Television|date=2012-02-09|accessdate=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he subsequently established the President Department Store (大統百貨), the largest department store in Taiwan at that time. In 1984, Wu founded the Talee Department Store (大立百貨), which later became a Japanese-style department store Talee-[[Isetan]] (大立伊勢丹).

Additionally, Wu also founded Hotel Kingdom (華王飯店) and collaborated with [[Costco]] in Taiwan to operate several warehouse supermarkets.  The department stores, hotels, supermarkets and shopping malls established by Wu are now being managed by the President Group (大統集團).

Wu died at Kaohsiung General Veterans Hospital (高雄榮民總醫院) on 4 February 2012.&lt;ref name="ET20120209"/&gt;
