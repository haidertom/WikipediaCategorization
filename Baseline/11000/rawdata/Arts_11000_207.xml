{{French literature sidebar}}
The '''Société littéraire des Goncourt''' ('''Goncourt Literary Society'''), usually called the '''académie Goncourt''' ('''Goncourt Academy'''), is a French literary organization based in Paris. It was founded &lt;!-- in 1900 (citation?) --&gt; by the French writer and publisher [[Edmond de Goncourt]] (1822–1896).  He wanted to create a new way to encourage literature in France, and disagreed with the contemporary policies of the [[Académie française]].

==Formation and organization==
Wishing to honor his deceased brother [[Jules de Goncourt|Jules]] (1830–1870), Goncourt  bequeathed his estate to establish an organization to promote [[French literature|literature in France]]. He named his friend, the writer [[Alphonse Daudet]], along with [[Léon Hennique]], to oversee and administer his estate. The society was to consist of ten members, of whom eight were nominated in the will. Each of the members was to receive an annuity of 6,000 [[French franc|francs]], and a yearly prize of 5,000 francs was to be awarded to the author of some work of fiction. After some litigation, the academy was constituted in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Goncourt, De|volume=7|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, each December, a ten-member board of the Académie has awarded the ''[[Prix Goncourt]]'' for the best work of [[fiction]] of the year.

Membership is reserved to writers who have produced works in the French language, but it is not limited to citizens of France. In 1996, the [[Spain|Spanish]] novelist and scriptwriter [[Jorge Semprún]] was elected as the first foreigner to become a member of the academy.

In addition to the Prix Goncourt, which comes with a symbolic cheque of 10 euros, the Académie Goncourt awards honors for first novel and achievements in short story, poetry and biography genres.

The ten members of the academy are usually called ''les Dix'' (the Ten).  They meet the first Tuesday of each month, except in summer. Since 1914, they have convened in an oval room, the ''salon Goncourt'', on the second floor of the Restaurant Drouant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drouant.com/fr/lhistoire/0-5-1-1.html "Histoire"], Restaurant Drouant. Note: The restaurant Drouant was founded as a ''bar tabac'' by the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] Charles Drouant, who expanded it to a [[bistrot]]. It made its reputation from the fresh oysters delivered by Drouant's brother, who farmed them. Daudet was a regular, as were artists such as [[Renoir]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Camille Pissarro]].&lt;/ref&gt; place Gaillon, in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris|heart of Paris]].  The [[cutlery]]  which they use while dining there constitutes the main physical continuity of the academy.  Each new member receives the fork and knife of the member whom he (or she) is replacing, and the member's name is engraved on the knife and the fork.

'''Alexander Ivanovich Dmitriev-Mamonov''' (Russian: Александр Иванович Дмитриев-Мамонов; 24  December 1787 in [[Saint Petersburg]] &amp;ndash; 9 December 1836 in [[Moscow]]) was the commander of a Belarusian [[Hussar]] regiment and a [[battle painter]].

== Biography ==
He was born into a noble family and was the son of Major-General Ivan Dmitriev-Mamonov (1754-1812). His mother, Mariya (1768-1794), died when he was only seven and his father remarried into the Tolstoy family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/%D0%98%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D0%A4%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87-%D0%94%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2-%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2/6000000008806275819 Ivan Dmitriev-Mamonov] @ [[Geni.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; Most sources say that his father's second wife, Yelena (1772-1855), was his mother.

After 1806, he served as an [[actuary]] at the [[Collegium of Foreign Affairs]], then moved to the State Chancellery.&lt;ref name="N"&gt;[http://napoleonic.ru/история/персоналии/дмитриев-мамонов-александр-иванович Brief biography] @ Napoleonic.ru.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812, he joined the [[Narodnoe Opolcheniye|People's Militia]] in Moscow. He received the rank of Lieutenant and served in the battles of [[Battle of Ostrovno|Ostrovno]], [[Battle of Valutino|Valutino]], [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] and [[Battle of Krasnoi|Krasnoi]]. In 1813, he was assigned to a Hussar regiment, commanded by General [[Pyotr Petrovich Palen|Pyotr Palen]], that followed Napoleon's retreating army and participated in numerous battles before reaching Paris.&lt;ref name="N" /&gt;
[[File:A.I.Dmitriev-Mamonov-Fere-Champenoise.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Battle of Fère-Champenoise]]]]
In 1816, he became an [[adjutant]] to General [[Nikita Volkonsky]] and promotions followed rapidly. By 1823, he had been promoted to Colonel and left the General's service.&lt;ref name="N" /&gt; He had several friends among the [[Decembrist revolt|Decembrists]] and the courage to speak out on behalf of those who had been exiled or placed in custody. In 1827, he was given command of a Hussar regiment and, in 1830, took part in suppressing the [[November Uprising]]. The following year, he was promoted to Major-General.&lt;ref name="N" /&gt; Over the next few years, he commanded [[light cavalry]] and [[Uhlan]] regiments, as well as the Hussars.

In addition to his military activities, he was an amateur artist and brought back numerous  sketches from the battles he had seen during the Napoleonic campaigns. In 1820, he was one of the founders of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]], together with {{ill|Ivan Alexeyevich Gagarin|ru|Гагарин, Иван Алексеевич}} and [[Pyotr Kikin]]. Seven years later, he established a drawing school. Many of his sketches and watercolors are displayed in the buildings at [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. 

In 1835, he moved into the civil service and became a [[State Counsellor (Russia)|State Councillor]] at the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The awards he received during his military career include the [[Order of Saint Vladimir]], [[Order of Saint Anna]], the [[Medal "For the Capture of Paris"]] and the order [[Pour le Mérite]].&lt;ref name="N" /&gt;

His wife, Sofia, was [[Maid of honour|maid of honor]] to [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Maria Feodorovna]]. His son, [[Emmanuil Dmitriev-Mamonov|Emmanuil]], was a portrait painter, art historian and noted [[Slavophile]].

'''''Ali Pascha von Janina oder Die Franzosen in Albanien''''' (''Ali Pasha of Ioannina or The French in Albania'') is a one-act German [[singspiel]]. It is set around 1820 in [[Ioannina]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and is named after its central character [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina]].

Its music and [[libretto]] are both by the German composer [[Albert Lortzing]] – it can be considered as a precursor to his later full-length operas. He had decided to write for the stage in 1823, aged 22. [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] subjects were then popular and so he chose that theme for his first work. On 30 January 1824 he married [[Rosina Regina Ahles]] and soon afterwards he completed the music, but it took him until 1828 to find a theatre which would mount the work.

The couple took on an engagement at the [[Landestheater Detmold|Hoftheater Detmold]] in autumn 1826, as well as appearing in theatres in [[Münster]] and [[Osnabrück]].  Lortzing finally premiered the work in the [[Städtische Bühnen Münster]] in on 1 February 1828, where it was a moderate success and enabled him to continue writing plays.

==Characters==
*Ali Bey, Pasha of Joannina ([[bass (voice type)|bass]])
*Ibrahim, overseer of the pasha's harem (bass)
*Captain Bernier ([[tenor]])
*Lieutenant Robert, Bernier's friend (tenor)
*Arianna, a girl from Corfu ([[soprano]])
*Soldiers, sailors, guards, slavegirls, slaves, imprisoned maidens (chorus)

==Plot==
Stationed in Ioannina with his battalion, the French naval captain Bernier has fallen in love with Arianna, a beautiful girl from the nearby island of [[Corfu]]. However, he has not heard from her for days and is worried about what might have happened to her. Bernier's friend Robert tries in vain to comfort him.

Bernier's concerns prove justified – Arianna had been captured by a wild horde whilst out walking on the beach and taken to Ali Pasha's [[harem]]. Ali Pasha cannot bear her laments and complaints and orders her to forget Bernier since she now belongs to him alone. The other women in the harem are unwilling to raise Arianna's hopes and instead advise her that the only way to survive her suffering is to submit herself to fate and Ali Pasha's will.

In the meantime Bernier receives news of his beloved and gains entry to Ali Pasha's palace under a pretext. Ali Pasha is initially delighted to welcome a Frenchman and brings in Arianna to show her off to him, make Bernier envious and draw on Bernier's knowledge of women.

Bernier and Arianna find it hard to conceal their true feelings and pretend that they do not know each other, but only a few minutes after Ali Pasha leaves she admits to her love. Ali Pasha overhears this from a hiding place and rushes back in swearing vengeance. Bernier is chained up but Robert and the French battalion succeed in penetrating the harem. They free Bernier and Arianna and return with them to France.

The Alliance offers a "TV Shadowing Program" providing opportunities for new directors to learn from experienced directors at work.&lt;ref name=AWDAbout/&gt; The AWD is a nominator for the [[21st Century Fox|Fox]] Global Directors Initiative&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Global Directors Initiative|url=http://www.foxaudiencestrategy.com/directors/|website=Fox Audience Strategy|accessdate=March 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315083527/http://www.foxaudiencestrategy.com/directors/|archive-date=2015-03-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The AWD are listed as a nominating institution under the "WHO ARE THE NOMINATING ORGANIZATIONS FOR FDI?" header--&gt; and an allied organization of the Women Filmmakers Initiative.&lt;ref name=Sundance&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring the Barriers and Opportunities for Independent Women Filmmakers|last1=Smith|first1=Stacy L.|last2=Pieper|first2=Katherine|last3=Choueiti|first3=Marc|url=http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/Exploring-The-Barriers.ashx|publisher= [[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism]]|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AWD helps its members make professional connections.

==Views==
According to their [[press kit]], the Alliance believes in "foster[ing] a community of professionals to advance the art, craft and visibility of women directors in the world of film, television and new media" and promotes the idea that it is "vital that stories are told from all perspectives".&lt;ref name=AWDPress&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/b3f9a4_73ff9a1b991fe545f4123a5b0d890891.pdf|title=Press/Media Kit|publisher=Alliance of Women Directors|format=pdf|access-date=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleonore Dailly]], co-chair of the AWD, in an interview with ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine, described the group's goals as, "debunk[ing] this myth that there aren't enough female directors. There are highly trained female directors who can handle thrillers and action films just like male directors can handle romantic comedies."&lt;ref name=Elle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moss|first=Rebecca|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a24941/summer-blockbusters-female-directors/|title=What Does a Female-Directed Blockbuster Look Like?|journal=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|date=June 30, 2014|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Maria Burton]] was the co-chair of the Alliance for six years. Describing the problem to the ''[[LA Daily News]]'', Burton said "through all the years, through all the genres, in front and behind the camera, women are vastly underrepresented."&lt;ref name=LADailyNews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynews.com/arts-and-entertainment/20150218/women-still-making-few-inroads-in-directing-field|title=Women still making few inroads in directing field|last=Lowman|first=Rob|date=February 18, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking as an AWD board member, director Jacqui Barcos told ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' on the lack of women-directed films at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], "complex dramas [...] tend to be difficult to finance in the U.S. If they are complex, the only way to get them financed is to have a big-name director, because then the investors are assured it'll be a masterpiece. And many of the most talented female directors are still relatively unproven, so investors don't want to take a chance."&lt;ref name=HuffPost&gt;{{cite news|title=Cannes' Female Director Problem Highlighted By 2012 Selections|last=Satran|first=Joe|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/19/cannes-film-festival-female-director_n_1438632.html|date=April 19, 2015|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Barcos told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that it was important to demonstrate that "a woman director can deliver a commercially successful film that is outside the romantic comedy ghetto".&lt;ref name=Variety2009/&gt;

'''Antiquities''' are objects from [[Ancient history|antiquity]]&lt;!-- Don't attempt to disam; most meanings are relevant  --&gt;, especially the [[civilizations]] of the [[Mediterranean]]: the [[Classical antiquity]] of Greece and Rome, [[Ancient Egypt]] and the other [[Ancient Near East]]ern cultures.  Artifacts from earlier periods such as the [[Mesolithic]], and other civilizations from Asia and elsewhere may also be covered by the term.  The phenomenon of giving a high value to ancient artifacts is found in other cultures, notably China, where [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], three to two thousand years old, have been avidly collected and imitated for centuries, and the [[Pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica]], where in particular the artifacts of the earliest [[Olmec civilization]] are found reburied in significant sites of later cultures up to the Spanish Conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artworld.uea.ac.uk/cms/index.php?q=node/873 |accessdate=August 10, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The definition of the term is not always precise, and institutional definitions such as [[museum]] "Departments of Antiquities" often cover later periods, but in normal usage [[Gothic art|Gothic]] objects, for example, would not now be described as antiquities, though in 1700 they might well have been, as the cut-off date for antiquities has tended to retreat since the word was first found in English in 1513.  Non-artistic [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] are now less likely to be called antiquities than in earlier periods. [[Francis Bacon]] wrote in 1605: "Antiquities are history defaced, or some remnants of history which have casually escaped the shipwreck of time".

The art trade reflects modern usage of the term; [[Christie's]] "Department of Antiquities" covers objects "from the dawn of civilization to the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], ranging from Western Europe to the Caspian Sea, embracing the cultures of Egypt, Greece, Rome and the Near East."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/departments/ant/overview.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120013/http://www.christies.com/departments/ant/overview.asp |date=August 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bonhams]] use a similar definition: "...4000 B.C to the 12th Century A.D. Geographically they originate from Egypt, the Near East and Europe ..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/public.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=usa&amp;Screen=antiquities |title=Antiquities |publisher=Bonhams |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Official cut-off dates are often later, being unconcerned with precise divisions of [[art history]], and using the term for all historical periods they wish to protect: in [[Jordan]] it is 1750,&lt;ref&gt;[http://conference.legadoandalusi.es/en/doa1.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202717/http://conference.legadoandalusi.es/en/doa1.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance|Hong Kong]] 1800, and so on.

The term is no longer much used in formal academic discussion, because of this imprecision. However, a recent attempt to standardise this and other terms has been carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://saa.uaic.ro/from-antiquities-to-memorabilia-a-standardised-terminology-for-ancestral-artefacts-according-to-manufacture-date/|title=From antiquities to memorabilia: a standardised terminology for ancestral artefacts according to manufacture date|first=Policarp|last=HORTOLÀ|date=1 December 2017|journal=Studia Antiqua et Archaeologica|volume=23|issue=2|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, but not all, antiquities have been recovered by [[archaeology]].  There is little or no overlap with [[antiques]], which covers objects, not generally discovered as a result of archaeology, at most about three hundred years old, and usually far less.

==History==
The sense of ''antiquitates'', the idea that a civilization could be recovered by a systematic exploration of its [[relic]]s and [[material culture]], in the sense used by [[Varro]] and reflected in [[Josephus]]' ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' was lost during the Middle Ages, when ancient objects were collected with other appeals, the rarity or strangeness of their materials or simply because they were thought to be endowed with magical or [[Miracle|miraculous]] powers.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Weiss, 1969. ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'', p. 2ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Precious [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]]s and other antique [[carved gem]]s might be preserved when incorporated into crowns and diadems and liturgical objects,&lt;ref&gt;The "[[Cup of the Ptolemies]]" was set in Carolingian precious mounting and preserved in the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diptych|consular ivory diptych]]s by being used as gospel covers.  Roman columns could be re-erected in churches.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Weiss notes (1969:8) that Ionic columns from the [[Baths of Caracalla]] were used in Innocent II's rebuilding of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], 1139&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] could receive new occupants and [[Urn|cinerary urn]]s could function as holy water [[stoup]]s. Sculptural representations of the human form, feared and reviled as "[[Cult image|idols]]" could be rehabilitated by reidentifying their subjects: the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius|equestrian bronze Marcus Aurelius]] of the Campidoglio was respected as a representation of the Christian emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], and in Pavia the [[Regisole]] acquired a civic role that preserved it. In Rome the Roman bronze ''[[Boy with Thorn|Spinario]]'' was admired for itself by the guidebook writer [[Magister Gregorius]]. The classicism of the [[Carolingian renaissance]] was in part inspired by appreciation of [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] manuscripts: the [[Utrecht Psalter]] attempts to recreate such a Late Antique original, both in its handwriting and its illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Noted in this context by Roberto Weiss 1969:4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many museums hold these artifacts and keep them safe so that we have access to the knowledge they hold about the past. On September 2nd the National Museum of Brazil was engulfed in flames. This event caused many artifacts to be lost forever. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/08/lessons-from-the-destruction-of-the-national-museum-of-brazil|title=Lessons from the destruction of the National Museum of Brazil|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal trading==
[[Image:Euphronios krater side B MET L.2006.10.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Euphronios krater]] has been returned to Italy by the [[Metropolitan Museum]]]]
The export of antiquities is now heavily controlled by law in almost all countries and by the [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|1970 UNESCO Convention]] on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property|title=Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|publisher=Unesco.org|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a large and increasing trade in [[Illicit antiquities]] continues.  The [[Euphronios krater]] is an apparent example that has come to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brodie|first=Neil|title=Euphronios (Sarpedon) Krater|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/euphronios-sarpedon-krater|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the ambiguous legal case concerning the [[Getty Museum]]'s "Bronze Statue of a Victorious Youth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://illicit-cultural-property.blogspot.co.uk/2007/03/bronze-statue-of-victorious-youth.html|title=The "Bronze Statue of a Victorious Youth"|author=|date=|website=illicit-cultural-property.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The field has been further complicated by the trade in [[Archaeological forgery|Archaeological forgeries]], such as the [[Etruscan terracotta warriors]], the [[Persian Princess]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brodie|first=Neil|title=Persian Mummy|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/persian-mummy/|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Getty kouros]].

'''Atlas Talent Agency''' is an American commercial talent agency,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.backstage.com/resources/detail/agent/atlas-talent-agency-54524/&lt;/ref&gt; specializing in [[voiceover]] talent. The agency was founded in [[New York, New York|New York City]] on January 1, 2000 when three agents at Don Buchwald and Associates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buchwald.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126052153/http://www.buchwald.com/ |archivedate=2014-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; left to form their own commercial agency. The West Hollywood office opened in 2010.

A '''cartoonist''' (also '''comic strip creator''') is a visual artist who specializes in drawing [[cartoon]]s. This work is often created for entertainment, political commentary, or advertising.  Cartoonists may work in many formats, such as [[book]]lets, [[comic strip]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[editorial cartoons]], [[graphic novel]]s, [[User guide|manuals]], [[gag cartoon]]s, [[graphic design]], [[illustrations]], [[storyboards]], [[posters]], [[shirts]], [[books]], [[advertisements]], [[greeting cards]], [[magazines]], [[newspapers]], and [[video game packaging]].

==History==

===In the West===

The English [[satire|satirist]] and editorial cartoonist [[William Hogarth]], who emerged In the 18th century, has been credited with pioneering Western [[sequential art]]. His work ranged from [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] portraiture to [[comic strip]]-like series of pictures called "modern moral subjects". Much of his work poked fun at contemporary politics and customs; illustrations in such style are often referred to as "Hogarthian".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseumshoponline.org/invt/brimus068?stylecat=art_prints The British Museum. Beer Street, William Hogarth - Fine Art Print] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303011009/http://www.britishmuseumshoponline.org/invt/brimus068?stylecat=art_prints |date=2010-03-03 }} Retrieved 11 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the work of Hogarth, [[political cartoons]] began to develop in England in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of its great exponents, [[James Gillray]] and [[Thomas Rowlandson]], both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and [[caricature]], calling the king (George III), prime ministers and generals to account, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Satire, sewers and statesmen: why James Gillray was king of the cartoon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/21/satire-sewers-and-statesmen-james-gillray-king-of-cartoon|agency=The Guardian|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While never a professional cartoonist, [[Benjamin Franklin]] is credited with having the first cartoon published in an American newspaper.{{sfn|Hess|Northrop|2011|p=24}}  In the 19th century, professional cartoonists such as [[Thomas Nast]] introduced other familiar American political symbols, such as the [[Republican Party (United States)#Name and symbols|Republican elephant]].{{sfn|Hess|Northrop|2011|p=24}}

[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|alt=Cartoon of a snake severed in eight pieces, each piece labeled with the initials of an American colony.  The caption reads, 
''Join, or Die''.|[[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''[[Join, or Die]]'' (1754), credited as the first cartoon published in an American newspaper.]]

[[File:Charles Dana Gibson 02.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A man in late middle-age, facing left, drawing at an upright drawing board.|[[Charles Dana Gibson]] was an influential American cartoonist in the early 20th century.]]
During the [[20th century]], numerous magazines carried single-panel gag cartoons by such [[Freelancer|freelance]] cartoonists as [[Charles Addams]], [[Irwin Caplan]], [[Chon Day]], [[Clyde Lamb]], and [[John Norment]]. These were almost always published in black and white, although ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' often carried cartoons in color. The debut of ''[[Playboy]]'' introduced full-page color cartoons by [[Jack Cole (artist)|Jack Cole]], [[Eldon Dedini]], [[Roy Raymonde]] and others. Single-panel cartoonists syndicated to newspapers included [[Dave Breger]], [[Hank Ketcham]], [[George Lichty]], [[Fred Neher]], [[Irving Phillips]], and [[J. R. Williams (cartoonist)|J. R. Williams]].

==Comics==

Comic strips received widespread distribution to mainstream newspapers by [[Print syndication|syndicates]]&lt;ref name="www.comicsreporter.com"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = The Comics Reporter | url = http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/all_about_comics/all_about/76/ | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 17 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
such as the [[Universal Press Syndicate]], [[United Media]], or [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]]. [[Sunday strip]]s go to a [[colorist|coloring]] company such as American Color before they are published.

Some comic strip creators publish in the [[alternative media|alternative press]] or on the [[Internet]]. Comic strip artists may also sometimes work in book-length form, creating [[graphic novel]]s. Both vintage and current strips receive reprints in book collections.

The major comic book publishers (such as [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] or [[DC Comics|DC]]) utilize teams of cartoonists to produce the art (typically separating pencil work, inking and lettering while the color is added digitally by [[colorist]]s). When a consistent artistic style is wanted among different cartoonists (such as [[Archie Comics]]), character [[model sheet]]s may be used as reference.

Calum MacKenzie, in his preface to the exhibition catalog, ''The Scottish Cartoonists'' (Glasgow Print Studio Gallery, 1979) defined the selection criteria: 
:The difference between a cartoonist and an illustrator was the same as the difference between a comedian and a comedy actor—the former both deliver their own lines and take full responsibility for them, the latter could always hide behind the fact that it was not his entire creation.&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, Calum. ''The Scottish Cartoonists''. Glasgow Print Studio Gallery, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Winsor McCay - Little Nemo film still - drawing.jpg|thumb|alt=A hand holding a pen draws a portly cartoon figure on paper.|Dip pens have traditionally been a popular drawing tool for cartoonists.]]

There are many books of cartoons in both paperback and hardcover, such as the collections of cartoons from ''The New Yorker''. Prior to the 1960s, cartoons were mostly ignored by museums and art galleries. In 1968, the cartoonist and comedian [[Roger Price (comedy)|Roger Price]] opened the first New York City gallery devoted exclusively to cartoons, mainly work by the leading magazine gag cartoonists. Today, there are several museums devoted to cartoons, notably the [[Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]], run by curator Jenny E. Robb at [[Ohio State University]].

==Creation==
Comics artists usually sketch a drawing in pencil before going over the drawing in [[India ink]], using either a [[dip pen]] or a [[brush]]. Artists may also use a [[lightbox]] to create the final image in ink. Some artists, [[Brian Bolland]], for example, use computer graphics, with the published work as the first physical appearance of the artwork. By many definitions (including McCloud's, above), the definition of comics extends to [[digital media]] such as [[webcomic]]s and the [[mobile comic]].

The nature of the comics work being created determines the number of people who work on its creation, with successful [[comic strip]]s and [[comic book]]s being produced through a [[studio]] system, in which an artist assembles a team of assistants to help create the work. However, works from independent companies, [[Self-publishing|self-publishers]], or those of a more personal nature can be produced by a single creator.

Within the comic book industry of North America, the studio system has come to be the main method of creation. Through its use by the industry, the roles have become heavily codified, and the managing of the studio has become the company's responsibility, with an editor discharging the management duties. The editor assembles a number of creators and oversees the work to publication.

Any number of people can assist in the creation of a comic book in this way, from a [[Plot (narrative)|plotter]], a [[Script breakdown|breakdown artist]], a [[penciller]], an [[inker]], a [[writer|scripter]], a [[letterer]], and a [[colorist]], with some roles being performed by the same person.

In contrast, a comic strip tends to be the work of a sole creator, usually termed a cartoonist. However, it is not unusual for a cartoonist to employ the studio method, particularly when a strip become successful. [[Mort Walker]] employed a studio, while [[Bill Watterson]] and [[Charles Schulz]] did not. Gag, political, and editorial cartoonists tend to work alone as well, though a cartoonist may use assistants.

==Web cartoonist==
Many artists have used the web since its inception to publish their works online. This eventually led to the creation of [[webcomics]] thanks in part to many titles being able to be read for free and anyone being able to publish them. Many of the artists who create these webcomics are known as '''web cartoonists''' due to the fact that the vast majority of webcomics are considered to be online versions of comic-strips and cartoons rather than full-fledged comic books like [[digital comics]]. It is hard to pinpoint when the actual term was created but the earliest use was 2001 with the [[Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards]]. Some well known web cartoonists include [[Randall Munroe]] of ''[[xkcd]]'', [[Jeph Jacques]] of ''[[Questionable Content]]'' and [[Jerry Holkins]] and [[Mike Krahulik]] of ''[[Penny Arcade]]''.

==Art styles==
[[Image:ScottMcCloud Angouleme2000.jpg|right|thumb|[[Scott McCloud]], whose work ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' identified the different styles of art used within comics.]] While almost all comics art is in some sense abbreviated, and also while every artist who has produced comics work brings their own individual approach to bear, some broader art styles have been identified. Comic strip artists [[Cliff Sterrett]], [[Frank King (cartoonist)|Frank King]], and [[Gus Arriola]] often used unusual, colorful backgrounds, sometimes veering into abstract art.

The basic styles have been identified as [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] and cartoony, with a huge middle ground for which R. Fiore has coined the phrase liberal. Fiore has also expressed distaste with the terms realistic and cartoony, preferring the terms literal and freestyle, respectively.{{sfn|Fiore|2010}}

Scott McCloud has created "The Big Triangle"&lt;ref name="ref48"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottmccloud.com/4-inventions/triangle/index.html |title=The Big Triangle |publisher=scottmccloud.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a tool for thinking about comics art. He places the realistic representation in the bottom left corner, with iconic representation, or cartoony art, in the bottom right, and a third identifier, [[abstraction (art)|abstraction]] of image, at the apex of the triangle. This allows placement and grouping of artists by [[triangulation]].
* The cartoony style uses comic effects and a variation of line widths for expression. Characters tend to have rounded, simplified anatomy. Noted exponents of this style are [[Carl Barks]] and [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]].{{sfn|Fiore|2010}}
* The realistic style, also referred to as the adventure style is the one developed for use within the adventure strips of the 1930s. They required a less cartoony look, focusing more on realistic anatomy and shapes, and used the [[illustrations]] found in [[pulp magazines]] as a basis.  This style became the basis of the superhero comic book style since [[Joe Shuster]] and [[Jerry Siegel]] originally worked ''[[Superman]]'' up for publication as an adventure strip.&lt;ref name="ref47"&gt;Santos, 1998. [https://web.archive.org/web/19981205234346/http://www.dereksantos.com/comicpage/gold.html The Golden Era... June 1938 to 1945, Part I]&lt;/ref&gt;

McCloud also notes that in several traditions, there is a tendency to have the main characters drawn rather simplistic and cartoony, while the backgrounds and environment are depicted realistically. Thus, he argues, the reader easily identifies with the characters, (as they are similar to one's idea of self), whilst being immersed into a world, that's three-dimensional and textured.{{sfn|McCloud|1993|p=48}}  Good examples of this phenomenon include [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (in his "personal trademark" [[Ligne claire]] style), [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[Spirit (comics)|Spirit]]'' and [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[Buddha (manga)|Buddha]]'', among many others.

===Tools===
Artists use a variety of pencils, paint brushes, or paper, typically [[Bristol board]], and a waterproof [[ink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativebloq.com/art/16-essential-art-tools-artists-41619768|title=16 essential art tools for artists|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When inking, many artists preferred to use a [[Winsor &amp; Newton]] Series 7, #3 brush as the main tool, which could be used in conjunction with other brushes, dip pens, a [[fountain pen]], and/or a variety of [[technical pen]]s or [[marker pen|markers]]. [[Tints and shades|Mechanical tints]] can be employed to add grey tone to an image. An artist might paint with [[acrylic paint|acrylics]], [[gouache]], [[poster paint]]s, or [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]]. Color can also be achieved through crayons, pastels or colored pencils.

[[Eraser]], [[ruler]]s, templates, [[set square]]s and a [[T-square]] assist in creating lines and shapes. A [[drawing board|drawing table]] provides an angled work surface with lamps sometimes attached to the table. A [[light box]] allows an artist to trace his pencil work when inking, allowing for a looser finish. [[Knives]] and [[scalpel]]s fill a variety of needs, including cutting board or scraping off mistakes. A cutting mat aids paper trimming. Process white is a thick opaque white material for covering mistakes. [[Adhesive]]s and [[Adhesive tape|tapes]] help composite an image from different sources.

The '''coat of arms of [[Ascension Island]]''' were granted in August 2012.

'''Crypt Chambers''' (or '''Crypt Building''') is at 28–34&amp;nbsp;Eastgate Street and 34–40&amp;nbsp;Eastgate Row, [[Chester]], Cheshire, England. It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]] and incorporates a section of the [[Chester Rows]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376232|desc= Number 34 Row Crypt Building 34, Chester|access-date= 15 July 2012 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Crypt Chambers is built on the site of a [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] house whose [[undercroft]] is still present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hartwell | first = Clare |last2 = Hyde | first2 = Matthew |last3 = Hubbard | first3 = Edward | author3-link=Edward Hubbard | last4 =Pevsner | first4 =Nikolaus | author4-link =Nikolaus Pevsner | series= The Buildings of England| title = Cheshire |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]]| year =2011| origyear=1971| location =New Haven and London| page = 257|  isbn =978-0-300-17043-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The present building was constructed in 1858 to a design by [[Thomas Mainwaring Penson|T.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Penson]]. It was built as a [[department store]] for William and Charles Brown of the [[Browns of Chester]] family of [[draper]]s.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;
[[File:Browns entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the undercroft|alt=Two columns with a railing between, under which is a stairway leading from the street to a lower level]]

==Architecture==
===Exterior===

The building is in four storeys plus attics. It is constructed in red and yellow [[sandstone]] with a roof of brown tiles. The [[Facade|façade]] is asymmetrical, having a square stair [[turret]], with three bays to the east and one wider bay to the west. At the street level five steps at the base of the tower lead down to the undercroft and in the middle east bay eight steps lead up to the Row level. Between these are shop fronts. At the Row level are [[cast iron]] railings behind which are stallboards and above them are [[Molding (decorative)|moulded]] arches. On the front of the tower at this level is a blank scroll, on the east face is a recessed panel containing the initials W. B. (for William Brown), on the west face the initials are C.&amp;nbsp;B. (for Charles Brown) and on the rear face is a scroll inscribed AD 1858: CRYPT CHAMBERS. On each side of the entrance to the shop are the Chester City [[Coat of arms|arms]]. In each of the third and fourth storeys of the east bays are three pairs of arched, two-light windows with slender columns between each pair. In the west bay are four two-light arched windows in each storey. At this level on the tower is a two-storey [[oriel window]]. Above these storeys, the central eastern bay has a [[gable]] containing a [[Tracery|traceried]] window in a [[Reuleaux triangle|rounded triangle]], on each side of which are three-light [[dormer]] windows. The west bay also has a gable; this contains a small triangular oriel. The tower has a four-light window between shallow [[buttress]]es. The top of the tower consists of a [[Truncation (geometry)|truncated]] [[spire]] with a gabled dormer on each face. At its summit is a cast iron rail.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

===Interior===

==Career==
{{quote|[The street art is] decorative, contextual, layered and artists aren’t afraid of giving their name. Graffiti is more underground, more rebel.|''Daku'', Wall Street Journal, 2013}}

He was introduced to graffiti in 2006 through a website called ''Streetfiles''. His initial collaboration was with France-based artist JonOne, one of the founder-members of ''Crew 156'' — the group of popular New York subway artists from the 1980s, in [[Mumbai]] in 2008 for a year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/H4VKicbDZlm32BrZZRCTzN/On-15-May-this-art-will-disappear.html|title=On 15 May, this art will disappear|last=Parakala|first=Vangmayi|date=2016-05-06|work=Live Mint|access-date=2017-05-31|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also collaborated with two other graffiti artist, Bond and Zine in Delhi in 2008.

==Concept==

One of the organisers, Max Wakefield described the balloon protest as being in response to "the rise of [[far-right politics]] that dehumanises people in order to get into power", and saw it as an attempt to introduce some "good British humour" into the political discourse surrounding Trump's visit.&lt;ref name="Penman" /&gt; Wakefield cited the [[Trump administration family separation policy|Trump administration's family separation policy]] and [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the Paris climate agreement]] as examples of the kind of policies which the protest was targeting.&lt;ref name="Penman" /&gt; Leo Murray, who led the campaign, wrote in its crowdfunding statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/trump-baby-balloon-donald-trump-sadiq-khan/|title=Sadiq Khan's office gives giant 'Trump Baby' permission to fly over anti-Donald Trump protest|last1=Sandhu|first1=Serena|date=5 July 2018|website=The Essential Daily Briefing|publisher=Johnston Publishing Ltd|accessdate=14 July 2018|quote=The petition: Make Trump Baby Fly. Donald Trump is a big, angry baby with a fragile ego and tiny hands. He's also racist demagogue who is a danger to women, immigrants and minorities and a mortal threat to world peace and the very future of life on earth. Moral outrage is water off a duck's back to Trump. But he really seems to hate it when people make fun of him. So when Trump visits the UK on Friday the 13th of July this year, we want to make sure he knows that all of Britain is looking down on him and laughing at him. That's why a group of us have chipped in and raised enough money to have a 6 metre high blimp made by a professional inflatables company, to be flown in the skies over Parliament Square during Trump's visit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/07/05/after-popular-uproar-20-foot-tall-angry-trump-baby-blimp-gets-okay-fly-over-London|title=After Popular Uproar, 20-Foot-Tall Angry Trump Baby Blimp Gets Okay to Fly Over London During President's UK Visit|publisher=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on}} tall, [[helium]]-filled plastic [[inflatable]], also referred to as a "[[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]]" or "[[blimp]]", was designed by Matt Bonner and constructed by Imagine Inflatables of [[Leicester]].&lt;ref name="Doyle"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Doyle |first1=Liam |title=Trump baby balloon: Who is behind the balloon mocking Donald Trump in London? |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/988312/Donald-Trump-baby-blimp-creator-US-president-UK-visit-2018 |accessdate=13 July 2018 |work=[[Daily Express]] |date=13 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made after a [[crowdfunding]] campaign on crowdfunder.co.uk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trump Baby |url=https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/trump-baby |publisher=Crowdfunder}}&lt;/ref&gt; raised the GB£16,000 cost of its creation and deployment.&lt;ref name="BBC-44806900" /&gt; It depicts Trump as "an angry orange baby"&lt;ref name="Yeginsu" /&gt; with a snarling mouth,&lt;ref name="TA"&gt;{{cite news |title=Donald Trump angry baby balloon to fly over London during UK visit |url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/donald-trump-angry-baby-balloon-to-fly-over-london-during-uk-visit/news-story/59435d33f8dcb6deb44faed278d9e592 |accessdate=13 July 2018 |work=[[The Australian]] |date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; tiny hands,&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Khan |first1=Shehab |title=Everything you need to know about the giant baby Trump balloon |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/trump-uk-visit-latest-baby-balloon-blimp-protest-london-a8445476.html |accessdate=13 July 2018 |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; wearing a [[nappy]],&lt;ref name="BBC-44806900" /&gt; and holding a [[smartphone]].&lt;ref name="OGrady" /&gt;

Organiser Max Wakefield said "The only way that you can make any impact with Donald Trump is to mock him, because you can't engage him in any kind of argument — it never gets anywhere."&lt;ref name="Penman" /&gt;

== History ==
Permission from the [[Greater London Authority]] (GLA), [[Metropolitan Police]] and [[National Air Traffic Service]] (NATS) was required for the balloon to be flown over [[Parliament Square]], the space above which is considered [[restricted airspace]].&lt;ref name="OGrady"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/05/a-giant-blimp-depicting-trump-in-a-diaper-is-likely-to-greet-the-u-s-president-when-he-visits-london/|title=A giant blimp depicting Trump in a diaper is likely to greet the U.S. president when he visits London|last=O'Grady|first=Siobhán|date=5 July 2018|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730170802/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/05/a-giant-blimp-depicting-trump-in-a-diaper-is-likely-to-greet-the-u-s-president-when-he-visits-london/|archive-date=30 July 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permission was granted, allowing it to be flown, while tethered, up to {{convert|30|m|-1}} high, for up to two hours.&lt;ref name="Doyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OGrady" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/05/626116238/london-mayor-says-trump-baby-blimp-can-fly-in-protest-of-president-s-visit|title=London Mayor Says 'Trump Baby' Blimp Can Fly In Protest Of President Trump's Visit|publisher=[[NPR]] |date=5 July 2018 |first=Maggie |last=Penman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the GLA's 'City Operations' team and NATS stressed that the nature of the protest did not play a part on their decisions.&lt;ref name="BBC-44767349"&gt;{{cite web |title=Reality Check: The rules on protest balloons |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44767349 |work=BBC News|accessdate=13 July 2018 |date=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After learning of the balloon, Trump remarked, "I guess when they put out blimps to make me feel unwelcome, no reason for me to go to London."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2155074/baby-blimp-makes-me-feel-unwelcome-london-complains-trump-blaming|title=Trump complains baby balloon makes him feel ‘unwelcome’ in UK|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its appearance in London, the balloon was taken to Edinburgh, where it was flown over [[The Meadows (park)|the Meadows]], a public park near to the city centre, as part of the protests against Trump's two-day-visit to Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/trump-baby-balloon-giant-blimp-takes-to-the-sky-above-edinburgh-a3887401.html |title=Trump baby balloon: giant blimp takes to the sky above Edinburgh after being transported from London |last=Collier |first=Hatty |date=14 July 2018 |website=London Evening Standard |access-date=14 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714184319/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/trump-baby-balloon-giant-blimp-takes-to-the-sky-above-edinburgh-a3887401.html |archive-date=14 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; permission to fly the balloon near [[Turnberry (golf course)|Turnberry golf course]] having been refused.&lt;ref name="BBC-44806900" /&gt; On 17 July 2018, the balloon was tethered outside [[the O2 Arena]] in London during a performance by the American rock band [[Pearl Jam]], with their blessing.&lt;ref name="PJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8465972/pearl-jam-baby-trump-balloon-london-o2 |title=Baby Trump Balloon Takes Flight Outside Pearl Jam Show in London |date=18 July 2018| accessdate=18 July 2018| work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters planned on flying the Trump baby balloon in Ireland in November during Trump's visit to the country, however his trip was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/baby-trump-balloon-ireland-visit-protests-us-president-trip-a8518466.html|title=The baby Trump balloon is going to Ireland to meet the US president when he visits|work=The Independent|access-date=2 September 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sadiq Khan balloon ===
A month later on 30 August 2018, pictures of a balloon similar to that of Donald Trump's were circulated, this time depicting London's Mayor [[Sadiq Khan]] wearing a bright yellow bikini. The balloon, like the Donald Trump baby balloon, was crowdfunded after £58,000 was raised to create the blimp.  Organizers, saying "a certain amount of respect should be afforded to the leader of the free world and the greatest ally the UK has," said the balloon was made "in retaliation" to the Trump balloon.&lt;ref name="SadiqBalloon"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Drury |first1=Colin |title=Sadiq Khan balloon: Small crowd gathers to watch £58k blimp of London mayor in yellow bikini |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sadiq-khan-balloon-london-mayor-blimp-trump-baby-yello-bikini-a8518176.html |website=Independent |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;It featured Khan wearing a yellow bikini in response to the banning of a series of Protein World advertisements on London's public transport networks, which had shown a woman in a yellow bikini with the slogan "are you beach body ready?". The adverts were criticized for allegedly objectifying women and promoting unrealistic female body images. The adverts were eventually banned, with Sadiq Khan supporting their removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jacob Jarvis |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/sadiq-khan-blimp-to-be-flown-over-london-in-protest-at-his-decision-to-allow-trump-baby-to-fly-above-a3923216.html |title=Sadiq Khan balloon will fly over London to protest giant Donald Trump baby blimp &amp;#124; London Evening Standard |publisher=Standard.co.uk |date=13 July 2018 |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sadiq Khan commented, "If people want to spend their Saturday looking at me in a yellow bikini they're welcome to do so, I don't really think yellow's my colour though." A small crowd gathered to watch as the blimp flew over London's Parliament Square on 1 September 2018.  It has made no further appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-45352622 |title=Giant Sadiq Khan bikini-clad balloon to fly over London - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SadiqBalloon"/&gt;

==Appearances outside of the UK==

===United States===

A group of activists in the United States raised nearly US$24,000 in a [[GoFundMe]] campaign to construct four Trump baby balloons that they planned to fly over [[Trump National Golf Club (Bedminster, New Jersey)|Trump National Golf Club]] in [[Bedminster, New Jersey]]. Initially, they sought US$4,500 to build one balloon, with permission from the designer, but exceeded their goals more than fivefold.  Their fund raising was so successful that they were able to make six balloons in all. The balloons are available for "adoption" by groups for events in other states.&lt;ref name="Held-180719"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/19/630602022/american-baby-trump-blimp-set-to-breeze-onto-namesakes-home-turf|title=American Baby Trump Blimp Set To Breeze Onto Namesake's Home Turf|last=Held|first=Amy|date=19 July 2018|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams-180717"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/17/politics/trump-baby-blimp-new-jersey-trnd/index.html|title='Baby Trump' balloons are coming to New Jersey after flying in the United Kingdom|last=Williams|first=David|date=17 July 2018|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/07/baby_trump_balloon_campaign_blows_away_goal_now_th.html|title='Baby Trump' balloon campaign blows away goal.

On September 22, a balloon was seen flying near Donald Trump's [[Mar-a-Lago]] resort in West Palm Beach at a rally to mark the anniversary of [[Hurricane Maria]] striking Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Andone |first1=Dakin |title='Baby Trump' balloon makes appearance at Florida rally |url=https://www.foxcarolina.com/news/us_and_world/baby-trump-balloon-makes-appearance-at-florida-rally/article_467ee804-4871-5abc-bba7-fe668ca2f038.html |website=FOX News |accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2, the balloon appeared at a Spokane, Washington protest when Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Washington to support the reelection of Representative [[Cathy McMorris Rodgers]].&lt;ref name="HillBlog"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ostalter |first1=Morgan |title=Trump 'baby blimp' flies over Chicago women’s rally ahead of midterms |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/411268-trump-baby-blimp-flies-over-chicago-womens-rally |website=The Hill |accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baby Trump made an appearance at an October 13, Woman's March rally in Chicago, Illinois.  The march was organized to encourage female political activism leading up to the November midterm elections.&lt;ref name="HillBlog"/&gt;

The balloon made its California debut at the Los Angeles Convention Center on October 19, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-baby-trump-balloon-20181029-story.html|title='Baby Trump' balloon flies over downtown Los Angeles - Los Angeles Times|last=Martinez|first=Fidel|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, the Trump balloon was flown in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  The co-organizer stated,  "It's meant to be fun, but we're also making the point that this guy is dangerous and he's a little unhinged.  We want to make the point that this administration is taking us down what we think is the wrong path and is threatening to democracy, to our moral standing in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kransz |first1=Michael |title=Huge 'Baby Trump' balloon to take flight in Grand Rapids |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2018/10/huge_baby_trump_blimp_to_take.html |website=Grand Rapids News |accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===

The Baby Trump balloon made an appearance at a Paris protest march on November 11, 2018, when hundreds gathered to protest Trump's visit to Paris to attend the ceremonies to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.  Speaking to a [[CNN]] journalist, one protester said,  "I think Paris should be protesting not only Trump's presence here, but also should be trying to send a message to President Macron for having invited him here, especially on the anniversary of the signing of the armistice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keller |first1=Megan |title=‘Baby Trump’ balloon floats over Paris streets |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/news/416145-baby-trump-balloon-floats-over-paris-streets |website=The Hill |accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Overall reaction to the series on [[YouTube]] has been positive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/show?p=x2bSSfqmmB0 Dragon Age: Redemption episode 1, "Tallis" on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

S. Jim Browski of movie review website AintItCoolNews.com writes:

{{cquote|The series is innovative in the respect that it pushes the boundaries of the media experience, having a character that exists in not only live action webseries but also within a videogame. I appreciate her innovation, and hope she continues to push the limitations of what the Hollywood machine and media enable her to do. I have enjoyed the series so far and if you’re a fan of the fantasy genre it is another well produced by Felicia Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/51965|title=AICN's Wide World of Web Series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10368">'''''Droit de suite''''' ([[French language|French]] for "right to follow") is a right granted to [[artist]]s or their heirs, in some jurisdictions, to receive a fee on the resale of their works of art. This should be contrasted with policies such as the American [[first-sale doctrine]], where artists do not have the right to control or profit from subsequent sales.

==History==
[[File:JEAN-FRANÇOIS MILLET - El Ángelus (Museo de Orsay, 1857-1859. Óleo sobre lienzo, 55.5 x 66 cm).jpg|thumb|''[[The Angelus (painting)|The Angelus]]'' was sold by Millet for 1,000 francs in 1865, but just 14 years after [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]]'s death in 1889 it was sold by the copper merchant [[Eugène Secrétan|Secrétan]] for 553,000 francs]]

The ''droit de suite'' was first proposed in Europe around 1893, in response to a decrease in the importance of the salon, the end of the private patron, and to champion the cause of the “starving artist.”{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  Many artists, and their families, had suffered from the war, and ''droit de suite'' was a means to remedy socially difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cri/2005-2006/20060175.asp Assemblee-nationale.fr] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]], ''droit de suite'' was created in France following the sale of [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]]'s 1858 painting, the ''[[The Angelus (painting)|Angélus]]'', in 1889 at the [[Secretan sale]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The owner of the painting made a huge profit from this sale, whereas the family of the artist lived in poverty.

==Legislation==

===European Union===
The [[Resale Rights Directive|2001/84/EC]] [[European Union directive|directive]] mandates a somewhat uniform system of ''droit de suite'' across the [[European Union]]. This directive is controversial in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/01/11/droit-de-suite-debate-heats-up/|title=‘Droit de Suite’ Debate Heats Up|first=Daniel|last=Grant|date=11 January 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]], this system is in force through article L122-8 of the Code of intellectual property. It will be reformed by article 48 of the [[DADVSI]] law, which implements directive 2001/84/EC.  During discussions in the French Parliament leading to this law, it was argued that in practice, the ''droit de suite'' is only paid at [[auction]]s, and that it thus disfavors the Paris art marketplace compared to [[London]] or [[New York City]]. Following DADVSI, a government regulation (through a [[decree]]) is to set degressive rates and maximal fees so that the Paris marketplace is not hindered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/amendements/1206/120600232.asp Assemblee-nationale.fr] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[California Resale Royalty Act]], (Civil Code section 986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/986.html|title=California Civil Code  Section 986 - California Attorney Resources - California Laws|website=law.onecle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was struck down as unconstitutional on May 17, 2012 because it violated the US Constitution Interstate Commerce clause, ending a 35-year run that entitled [[artist]]s to a [[royalty payment]] upon the [[resale]] of their works of art under certain circumstances. The ruling by Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen of U.S. District Court Judge, Central District of California, is pending appeal in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Nguyen added:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.artsjournal.com/culturegrrl/2012/05/court_calls_california_resale.html|title = BLOG: Federal Court Finds California Resale Royalties Act Unconstitutional|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The Court finds that the CRRA explicitly regulates applicable sales of fine art ''occurring wholly outside California'' [emphasis added]. Under its clear terms, the CRRA regulates transactions occurring anywhere in the United States, so long as the seller resides in California. Even the artist---the intended beneficiary of the CRRA---does not have to be a citizen of, or reside in, California....Therefore, the CRRA violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

California’s droit de suite statute, the California Resale Royalty Act, was enacted in 1976,&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1663016|title=The California Resale Royalty Act: Droit De [Not So] Suite|first=Emily|last=Barker|date=10 December 2009|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was struck down on May 17, 2012, pending appeal.  The law applied to all works of fine art resold in California, or resold anywhere by a California resident, for a gross sale of $1000 or more.  It had mandated a five percent royalty on the resale price of any work of fine art.  An artist was able to waive this right “by a contract in writing providing for an amount in excess of five percent of the amount of such sale.”&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/&gt;

At least one scholar has proposed that this law is unconstitutional in that it effects a Fifth Amendment taking of private property.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/&gt;

In September 2012, the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] published a "[[Notice of Inquiry]]" regarding establishing an artist "resale royalty right" in the US.&lt;ref name="USCO-RRR"&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/ "Resale Royalty Right"], U.S. Copyright Office (last visited October 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Notice was published in response to a request by Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]] and Senator [[Herb Kohl]], who had introduced droit de suite legislation in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Resale Royalties: An Updated Analysis|first=Maria|last=Pallante|publisher=Office of the Register of Copyrights|year=2013|url=http://www.copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/usco-resaleroyalty.pdf|accessdate=2015-03-07|ref=harv|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Copyright Office's subsequent report endorsed "congressional consideration of a resale royalty right, or ''droit de suite'', which would give artists a percentage of the amount paid for a work each time it is resold by another party."{{sfn|Pallante|2013|p=10}}  A follow-up bill was introduced in 2014, the American Royalties Too Act, and was vigorously opposed by auction houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/arts/design/auction-houses-taking-no-chances-on-american-royalties-too-act.html|date=2014-03-24|title=Lobbyists Set to Fight Royalty Bill for Artists|first=Patricia|last=Cohen|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill died in committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2045|work=Congress.gov|title=S.2045 - American Royalties Too Act of 2014|accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Australia
The Resale Royalty Right for Visual Artists Act 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au|title=Australasian Legal Information Institute|website=www.austlii.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives the creator of an artwork the right to receive a royalty when their work is resold on the commercial art market. For artworks already in existence at 9 June 2010, the royalty applies only to the second and subsequent resales after that date. Under clauses 22 and 23 of the act artists have a case by case right to instruct the appointed government agency the Copyright Agency Ltd,  to not collect and/or make their own individual collection arrangements.

The royalty is calculated as 5% of the sale price, but does not apply where that price is less than $1,000. It is payable, via an official collecting agency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.com.au|title=The Copyright Agency|website=Copyright Agency|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''or'' if the creator chooses (on a case by case basis) it can be paid directly to the creator, on resales made during their lifetime and to their heirs for resales made up to 70 years after the creator’s death. The primary legal obligation to pay the royalty rests on the seller. However, in economic terms, it may effectively be passed on to the purchaser.

Eligible artworks include original works of graphic or plastic art, including pictures, collages, paintings, drawings, engravings, prints, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics, glassware, photographs, fine art textiles, installations, fine art jewellery, artists’ books, carvings and multi-media artworks.

The royalty is restricted to Australian citizens or residents, though there is provision for reciprocal rights to be extended in the future to persons resident in other jurisdictions with compatible royalty schemes.

The introduction of the scheme was controversial, as it has been elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinsociety.com|title=Home|website=Journal of ART in SOCIETY|accessdate= 6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first three years of its operation, royalty payments totaling $1.5m were made to about 650 artists for 6,800 transactions, with about 50% going to Indigenous artists. The highest individual royalty was A$50,000. Most recipients  have received amounts ranging from A$50 to A$500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resaleroyalty.org.au|title=Copyright Agency - Royalty Resale|website=www.resaleroyalty.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average transaction cost is reportedly $30 AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/qon/question?number=2677|title=Question on Notice|website=www.aph.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the scheme was announced in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.gov.au/visual-arts/resale-royalty-scheme|title=Resale Royalty Scheme|first=Department of Communications and the|last=Arts|date=8 August 2016|website=www.arts.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===

The Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines (Republic Act 8293) gives the author/artist or his heirs a 5-percent share in the gross proceeds of the sale or lease of the original painting, sculpture, or manuscript, subsequent to its first disposition by the creator. This right exists during the lifetime of the author or artist and fifty years after his/her death.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
{{see also|1996 Mount Everest disaster}}

In May 1996, several commercial expeditions at base camp of [[Mount Everest]] prepare for a climb to the summit. [[Rob Hall]], who popularized commercial Everest missions, leads [[Adventure Consultants]]; [[Scott Fischer]] is chief guide for Rob's rival, [[Mountain Madness]]. Rob's clients include [[Beck Weathers]], an experienced climber; Doug Hansen, a former mailman pursuing his dream; climbing veteran [[Yasuko Namba]], who hopes to complete her final [[Seven Summits]] ascent; and [[Outside (magazine)|''Outside'']] magazine journalist [[Jon Krakauer]]. Helen Wilton manages Rob's base camp.

A month earlier in [[New Zealand]], Rob says goodbye to his pregnant wife Jan and promises that he will be home for the birth. At the base camp Rob receives a fax from her, informing him that their baby, not yet born, is a girl. He wants to name her Sarah, but Jan disagrees.

Worried about climber crowding, Rob persuades Scott to cooperate to reduce delays. On the summit attempt, Rob's group departs Camp IV before dawn, planning to complete the ascent and turn around by 2:00 P.M., the latest safe time for return before nightfall. The group is delayed over an hour after discovering that guide ropes are not installed on upper reaches of the climb. Beck has eyesight problems and stops. Rob tells him to return if his condition does not improve in a half-hour. Scott hurries back down to camp to help another climber, but plans to re-ascend. Rob warns him about overexertion.

Rob reaches the summit on time and is joined by other climbers including Yasuko, who jubilantly plants her Japanese flag in the snow. Descending, Rob encounters Doug struggling just above the [[Hillary Step]] and orders him to turn back. Doug insists on continuing, saying that he won't get the chance again. Rob reluctantly agrees and they reach the summit two hours later, well past safe return time. At the summit, Doug is exhausted and increasingly suffering from altitude sickness. Also at the top is Scott, exhausted and increasingly ill from [[high-altitude pulmonary edema]].

As Rob helps Doug descend, a blizzard strikes the mountain and Doug's oxygen tank is empty, causing him to suffer [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. No extra bottles are stored on the route where Rob asked and he radios Helen to send someone up with oxygen. Doug, left alone briefly by Rob, semi-consciously detaches himself from the guide rope and walks unsteadily along the narrow path. He silently topples to his death a moment later.

Scott's condition worsens. He tells his fellow climbers to continue descending without him. He lies down and later dies. Returning climbers reach Beck, whose vision is still impaired, but they all become lost as the blizzard obliterates the trail. Three climbers go for help, leaving Beck and Yasuko behind.

Guide Andy 'Harold' Harris reaches Rob with spare oxygen, but it is frozen shut. They huddle in place in the storm. While Rob sleeps, Andy begins to have hallucinations. He strips off his outer clothing and slides off the mountainside to his death. In the morning, Rob radios Helen that Doug and Andy are gone, and that his hands and feet are frozen. Helen calls Jan, hoping Rob will respond to her voice. Jan tells Rob that he must start moving. Rob tells her that he is cold but comfortable, and asks her to name their baby Sarah. He dies soon after.

Returning climbers tell the camp that Beck and Yasuko are stranded. The weather, however, makes rescue impossible. Helen calls Beck's wife, Peach, and informs her of the situation. In the morning, Beck miraculously awakens, witnesses Yasuko's corpse, and stumbles back to camp alone, severely frostbitten, and in desperate need of medical help. Peach calls the American Embassy and organizes a helicopter rescue. Nepal Army pilot Lt. Col. Madan Khatri Chhetri successfully flies a harrowing high altitude mission to evacuate Beck. Meanwhile, one of Scott's guides, Anatoli, finds his body, and moves it off the trail.

Returning home, Helen has an emotional reunion with Jan, who later gives birth and names her daughter Sarah. Beck returns to his family, heavily bandaged. Closing titles reveal that he lost both hands and nose to severe frostbite, and that Rob's body remains on Everest.

Totino said, "It was very challenging because we had to re-create the sun, which at Everest is so incredibly sharp and crisp." The team used SoftSun lights for creating sun on the summit, Hillary Step and icefall. "They were 9 feet long and 3 ½ feet in diameter and 100,000 watts. They had to be moved around on cranes because they are very heavy," Totino said.&lt;ref name="cinema"/&gt; To photograph one scene during which expedition guide Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) is stuck on the mountain in the storm, Totino recalled: "We tented off a portion of the set with some very heavy plastic and brought in these giant refrigerating units, half the size of a semi truck, and we cooled that part of the stage down to about 26 to 28 degrees Fahrenheit [around -3°C] and brought in real snow. Baltasar really wanted the actor to feel like he was frozen. You really see and feel that."&lt;ref name="cinema"/&gt; The film was shot with [[Arri Alexa XT]] cameras, using the Arriraw format.&lt;ref name="cinema"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/everest-cinematographer-recalls-very-difficult-818689|title='Everest' Cinematographer Recalls "Very Difficult Shoot"|first=Carolyn | last=Giardina|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=([[Prometheus Global Media]])|date=18 September 2015|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song plays in the bus when it passes through a busy Nepali bazaar. Another song in the film is "[[All I Wanna Do (Sheryl Crow song)|All I Wanna Do]]", performed by [[Sheryl Crow]], which is accurate to the timing of the film's events, in 1996. The song "[[Weather with You]]" by [[Crowded House]] also features in the film. The soundtrack was released on 18 September 2015 by [[Varèse Sarabande]].

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 73%, based on 220 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's consensus reads, "''Everest'' boasts all the dizzying cinematography a person could hope to get out a movie about mountain climbers, even if it's content to tread less challenging narrative terrain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/everest_2015/ |title=Everest |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 64 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/everest |title=Everest |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Krakauer]], author of ''[[Into Thin Air]]'', denounced the movie, stating some of its details were fabricated and defamatory. He also expressed regret regarding Sony's rapid acquisition of the rights to the book. Director [[Baltasar Kormákur]] responded, claiming Krakauer's first-person account was not used as source material for the film and alleging that Krakauer's version conflicted with actual events.&lt;ref name=krakauerNotFan&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGovern|first1=Joe|title=Into Thin Air author Jon Krakauer is not a fan of Everest|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/25/thin-air-author-jon-krakauer-not-fan-everest|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Into Thin Air"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krakauer |first1=Jon |title=Into Thin Air |date=1997 |publisher=Villard Books |location=United States |isbn=978-0385494786 |page=300ff |pages=416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gt7EQgH8-b4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=into+thin+air&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGo63LnPXeAhWE61MKHRlOBy4Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=into%20thin%20air&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 November 2018 |ref=Into Thin Air}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4812">'''Fairy tale parody''' is a [[genre]] of fiction which parodies traditional [[fairy tale]]s. 

The genre was popularized on television by the ''[[Fractured Fairy Tales]]'' segments on ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]''.&lt;ref name=Kinsella/&gt;&lt;!--1959 to 1961?--&gt;

The 2001 [[computer-animated]] film ''[[Shrek]]'' brought great popularity to the genre. Parodies soon eclipsed traditional fairy tales. The genre garnered some praise for its more modern views but was also criticized for supplanting the traditional stories.&lt;ref name=Poniewozik/&gt;

Children's books that have been classified as fairy tale parodies:
* ''The Giant's Big Toe'' by [[Brock Cole]]
* ''Sleeping Ugly'' by [[Jane Yolen]]
* ''Jack and the Meanstalk'' by [[Brian Wildsmith]] and Rebecca Wildsmith
* ''The Book That Jack Wrote'', ''[[The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!]]'', ''[[The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales]]'', and ''[[The Frog Prince, Continued]]'' by [[Jon Scieszka]]
* ''Ruby'', by Michael Emberley
* ''Jim Henson Presents Goldilocks, Miss Piggy's Dream'' by Louise Gikow
* ''The Three Bears'' by Cindy West
* Cinderella
** ''Cinder Edna'' by Ellen Jackson
** ''Cinder-Elly'' by Frances Minters
** ''Cinderella and the Glass Flipper'' by [[Janet Perlman]]
** ''Cinderella with Benjy and Bubbles'' by Ruth Perle
* ''The Adventures of Simple Simon'' by Chris Conover
* ''The Velveteen Killer Rabbit'' by Elia Anie 
* ''Kawoni's Journey Across the Mountain: A Cherokee Little Red Riding Hood'' by Cordellya Smith

''Politically Correct Fairy Tales'' and ''[[Politically Correct Bedtime Stories |Politically Correct Bedtime Stories: Modern tales for our life and times]]'' by [[James Finn Garner]] have been called "Adult fractured fairy tales&amp;nbsp;... still humorous but the humor is for adults".&lt;ref name=kinsella2/&gt;

'''''Frieda and Diego Rivera''''' (''Frieda y Diego Rivera'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is a 1931 oil painting by [[Mexican art|Mexican]] artist [[Frida Kahlo]]. This portrait was created two years after Frida Kahlo and [[Diego Rivera]] married, and is widely considered a wedding portrait.

The painting shows Kahlo standing next to her husband and fellow artist, Rivera. Rivera, portrayed as a painter, holds a palette and four brushes in his right hand while Kahlo tilts her head towards him. Both are looking out toward the viewer, unsmiling. Kahlo holds her bright red shawl with her left hand. Rivera and Kahlo hold hands in the center of the portrait. Rivera is physically much larger than Kahlo. The pigeon in the upper righthand corner carries a banner that reads: “Here you see us, me Frieda Kahlo, with my dearest husband Diego Rivera. I painted these pictures in the delightful city of San Francisco California for our companion Mr. Albert Bender, and it was in the month of April of the year 1931.” The work had been commissioned by [[Albert M. Bender]], an art collector and supporter of Rivera.

There are many interpretations of the work. Hayden Herrera, author of ''[[Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo]]'', interprets the work simply as Kahlo depicting herself as the wife of the great artist, Rivera.&lt;ref name="Herrera"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herrera|first1=Hayden.|title=Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo|date=1972|publisher=Perennial / HarperCollins|location=New York, NY.|isbn=0060911271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors, such as Margaret Lindauer, investigate the larger context in which the work was created.&lt;ref name="Lindauer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindauer|first1=Margaret A.|title=Devouring Frida: The Art History and Popular Celebrity of Frida Kahlo|date=1999|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, Conn.|isbn=0819563471|pages=13–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The banner is supportive of Lindauer’s interpretation because it places Kahlo in the producer/professional artist role. 

The painting is currently located at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] (SFMOMA) in [[San Francisco, California]]. It was gifted to the collection in 1937 by the Albert M. Bender Collection.

The '''Gambier Parry process''' is a development of the classical technique of [[fresco]] for painting [[mural]]s, named for [[Thomas Gambier Parry]].

True fresco is the technique of painting on fresh lime plaster whereby the pigments are fixed by the [[carbonatation]] of the lime (calcium hydroxide). The technique requires no other binding medium and the fixing process  produces a durable crystalline paint layer. However, only a limited range of pigments are suitable for true frescoes and the technique requires careful application under controlled conditions, and relatively low humidity thereafter. In some environments, conventional fresco colours can rapidly accumulate dirt and grime. The decoration of the new [[Houses of Parliament#Royal Gallery|Houses of Parliament]] in the mid-nineteenth century saw an embarrassing failure of true fresco in England but had generated a revival in mural painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-17/conservation-of-lord-leightons-spirit-frescoes-war-and-peace/ Conservation of Lord Leighton's Spirit Frescoes 'War' and 'Peace'] Stephen Rickerby&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gambier Parry developed a spirit medium for use on a specially prepared plaster or canvas ground and in 1862 he published his recipe. Originally it used [[beeswax]], [[Lavender oil|oil of spike lavender]], spirits of [[turpentine]], [[Canarium luzonicum|elemi resin]] and [[copal]] varnish, and was complex both in preparing the wall surface and applying the paint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-17/conservation-of-lord-leightons-spirit-frescoes-war-and-peace/ Conservation of Lord Leighton's Spirit Frescoes 'War' and 'Peace'] Stephen Rickerby&lt;/ref&gt; With commercialisation the process was simplified and became widely known.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parishofmorpeth.org.uk/stjames/pc01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was used by [[Frederic Leighton]] for ''[[Leighton Frescoes|The Arts of Industry as Applied to War]]'' and ''[[Leighton Frescoes|The Arts of Industry as Applied to Peace]]'' at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] (1870-72)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-17/conservation-of-lord-leightons-spirit-frescoes-war-and-peace/ Conservation of Lord Leighton's Spirit Frescoes 'War' and 'Peace'] Stephen Rickerby&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Ford Madox Brown]] on the ''[[The Manchester Murals|Manchester Murals]]''  in [[Manchester Town Hall]] (1879-93).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Arts and Crafts Essays/Of Mural Painting|''Of Mural Painting'']] F.

'''Gustave Achille Guillaumet''' (26 March 1840 – 14 March 1887) was a French artist.  He is best known for his paintings of [[North Africa]].

==Early life==
Gustave Guillaumet was born in 1840 in [[Puteaux]] (now in the [[Hauts-de-Seine]], Paris).

==Career==

In 'The National Gallery'. Retrieved 19:13, April 1, 2012, from http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/gustave-guillaumet&lt;/ref&gt; where he became a student of [[Alexandre Abel de Pujol]].&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Guillaumet.

In 'Art Renewal Center Museum'. Retrieved 09:04, April 2, 2012, from http://www.artrenewal.org/pages/artist.php?artistid=293&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861 Guillaumet entered the Historical Landscape category of the [[Prix de Rome]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} for a scholarship to study at the [[Academy of France in Rome]].  On failing to win, he instead travelled across the Mediterranean to [[Algeria]], in north Africa.  While there he contracted malaria and had to spend three months at the military hospital in Biskra{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}.

Guillaumet visited Algeria ten times between 1861 and 1867.&lt;ref&gt;''Mountains in North Africa, with a Bedouin Camp''. In National Gallery.  Retrieved 18:45, April 2, 2012, from http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/gustave-guillaumet-mountains-in-north-africa-with-a-bedouin-camp&lt;/ref&gt;  He preferred to travel in the south{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} and many of his works depict the life of the people of the desert.

Whereas [[Orientalism]] generally gave a deliberately idealised or anecdotal picture of north Africa, Guillaumet's work was notable for portraying the harshness of life in a desert region. ''The Sahara'' features the carcass of a camel in the foreground with a caravan - or mirage of one - on the horizon and empty desert in-between. It was first exhibited to considerable success at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Le Sahara also called Le désert.  In 'Musée d'Orsay'.

Between 1879 and 1884 ''[[La Nouvelle Revue]]'' published tableaux of Algerian scenes collected together by Guillaumet.  These were later published as a book, ''Tableaux Algériens''.  It includes twelve echings by Guillaumet, Courtry, [[Paul Edmé Le Rat]], [[Adolphe-Alphonse Géry-Bichard]], [[August Müller (orientalist)|August Müller]] and Toussaint; six photogravures by Dujardin and one hundred and twenty-eight engravings in relief from drawings and sketches by Guillaumet, himself.  The book was published in 1888, after Guillaumet's death and is prefaced by a note on his life by [[Eugène Mouton]].&lt;ref&gt;GUILLAUMET (Gustave).  In 'Librería Anticuaria Comellas'.

==Personal life==
His son [[Gustave Guillaume]] (whose family name was changed), born in 1883, became a famous linguist.

==Death==
Guillaumet died in Paris in 1887. Speculation about the circumstances of his death, supposedly of peritonitis, was published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on April 6.  The article claimed that Guillaumet had left his wife and son to live with "a lady who was his senior by many years" but that a few weeks before his death he had shot himself following an argument with his mistress.  {{quote|"The bullet lodged in his intestines, and he lingered from that moment in the agonies of a painful illness, terminated by death. His last words after the bullet had entered his body were for his wife and son, who, on being informed of the tragical occurrence, came and nursed him until his death.  The painter died in his studio, whither he was carried at his own request. He wanted to see his Oriental sketches for the last time."|unattributed|The New York Times, April 6, 1887&lt;ref&gt;''Painter Guillaumet's tragic death''. ''The New York Times'', April 6, 1887.  Retrieved 00:34, April 3, 2012, from https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/04/06/109788711.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Guilaumet is buried in [[Montmartre Cemetery]].  His tomb bears a sculpture by [[Louis-Ernest Barrias]] of a ''Young girl from [[Bou Saâda]]'', dropping flowers onto a portrait of Guillaumet embossed on a medallion.&lt;ref&gt;P1070012 by jimread99.

{{Hungarian art}}

The '''Hungarian National Gallery''' (also known as '''Magyar Nemzeti Galéria'''), was established in 1957 as the national [[art museum]]. It is located in '''[[Buda Castle]]''' in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. Its collections cover Hungarian art in all genres, including the works of many nineteenth- and twentieth-century Hungarian artists who worked in Paris and other locations in the West. The primary museum for international art in Budapest is the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]].

==Exhibitions==
[[Image:Munkacsy - Christ in front of Pilate.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Christ in front of Pilate'', [[Mihály Munkácsy]], 1881]]
[[File:Ronai dottedlady.jpg|thumb|right|Woman Dressed in Polka Dots Robe, [[József Rippl-Rónai]], 1889]]
The National Gallery houses Medieval, Renaissance, [[Gothic art]], and [[Baroque]] [[Hungarian art]]. The collection includes [[wood]] [[altar]]s from the 15th century.&lt;ref name=Steves&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=Rick Steves &amp; Cameron|title=Rick Steves' Budapest|year=2009|publisher=Avalon Travel|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=9781598802177|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum displays a number of works from [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] sculptors such as [[Károly Alexy]], [[Maurice Ascalon]], [[Miklós Borsos]], [[Gyula Donáth]], [[János Fadrusz]], [[Béni Ferenczy]], [[István Ferenczy]] and [[Miklós Izsó]]. It also exhibits paintings and photographs by major Hungarian artists such as [[Brassai]] and [[Ervin Marton]], part of the circle who worked in Paris before [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The gallery displays the work of artists such as [[Mihály Munkácsy]] and [[László Paál]].&lt;ref name=Steves/&gt; The museum also holds paintings by [[Károly Markó the Elder]], [[József Borsos]], [[Miklós Barabás]], [[Bertalan Székely]], [[Károly Lotz]], [[Pál Szinyei Merse]], [[István Csók]], [[Béla Iványi Grünwald]], [[Tivadar Kosztka Csontváry]] (''Ruins of Ancient Theatre, Taormina''), [[József Rippl-Rónai]] (''Models''), and [[Károly Ferenczy]].

==Controversy==
In 2008, the director of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], László Baán, proposed the merging of his museum with the National Gallery, due to the similar exhibition and collection profile of the two. Both museums and the Ludwig Museum of Contemporary Art specialize in 20th-century and [[Contemporary art|contemporary fine art]], much of which was created by Hungarian artists living overseas.&lt;ref name = Melyi&gt;{{cite news|last=Mélyi|first=József|title=Notes for a Budapest Museum Master Plan|url=http://www.artmargins.com/index.php/2-articles/606-notes-for-a-budapest-museum-master-plan-|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=Art Margins Online|date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his request to add an €18million underground extension to the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] — which would have united collections spread across the city — was denied in February 2011, Baán presented an alternative plan to the government to build two new buildings at the cost of €150m. He envisioned the new buildings — one housing contemporary European art and the other Hungarian photography — as a "special museum island" that would complement the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (Műcsarnok) by permanently joining the two collections by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Budapest director's double vision for national museum|journal=The Art Newspaper|date=3 August 2011|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Budapest-directors-double-vision-for-national-museum/24249|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Secretary of State for Culture [[Géza Szőcs]] officially announced plans to build a new structure along [[Andrássy út]] close to [[Városliget|City Park]] and near the existing [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Budapest Museum of Fine Arts]] and [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (Műcsarnok).  This building would house the collections of the current Hungarian National Gallery.&lt;ref name=MTI&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Government commissioner appointed for planned "museum quarter" in Budapest|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20111003/museum-of-fine-arts-director-appointed-as-museums-quarter-government-commissioner/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Realdeal.hu|date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded plan, which would utilize the entire boulevard, is also referred to as the [[Budapest Museum Quarter]] or Andrássy Quarter.&lt;ref name=Foldes&gt;{{cite news|last=Földes|first=András|title=Houdini-cirkusz es fiákerek az Andrássyn|url=http://index.hu/belfold/budapest/2011/09/15/houdini_cirkusz_es_egyeb_megaberuhazasok_a_fovarosban/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=index.hu|date=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 2011, Ferenc Csák — director of the National Gallery since 2010 and critical of the proposed merger of the gallery with the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]]— called the merger process “[v]ery unprofessional, anti–democratic and short–sighted” and announced that he would resign at the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Hungarian national gallery director resigns in protest|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hungarian+national+gallery+director+resigns+in+protest/25182|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=7 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327161327/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hungarian+national+gallery+director+resigns+in+protest/25182|archivedate=27 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 5, 2012, a new director had not been named and the National Gallery was being led by Deputy General Director György Szűcs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact|url=http://www.mng.hu/en/contact|work=Hungarian National Gallery|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian [[rock music|rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] has written, recorded, and performed several [[instrumental]]s throughout its career.

==Studio recordings==

===2112===
{{main|2112 (song)}}

====Overture====
From the ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'' album, "Overture" opens up one of Rush's concept suites. [[Geddy Lee]]'s voice is recorded as an instrument in the early parts of the song, as he sings no words. However, there is, despite the Overture's overall instrumental nature, one line sung at the end, as the piece transitions to "The Temples of Syrinx": "And [[the meek shall inherit the earth|the Meek shall inherit the Earth]]". Like some overtures, music from the ''2112'' Overture is repeated or built upon in other places in the suite, such as "The Temples of Syrinx", "Presentation", "Oracle: The Dream", and "Soliloquy." At the end of Overture, there's a direct quotation from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's]] ''[[1812 Overture]]'', played by Lifeson.

====Grand Finale====
This section of the suite includes some ''spoken'' lines at the end, with the following sentences repeated three times successively: ''"Attention all planets of the Solar Federation"'', and then ''"We have assumed control"''.

'''La Villa Strangiato''' was released on the 1978 album ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]'', and is subtitled "An Exercise in Self-Indulgence". The 9:37 song, the fourth and final track of the album, was Rush's first entirely instrumental piece. The multi-part piece was inspired by a dream guitarist [[Alex Lifeson]] had, and the music in these sections correspond to the occurrences in his dream. The opening segment was played on a nylon-string classical guitar. The next segment introduces the main theme of La Villa, the Strangiato theme. The song progresses to include an increasingly complex guitar solo backed by string synthesizer, followed closely by [[bass guitar|bass]] and drum fills. The Strangiato theme is then revisited before the song ends abruptly with phased bass and drums. The song is divided as follows:

* I: "Buenas Noches, Mein Froinds!" (0:00–0:26)
* II: "To sleep, perchance to dream..." (0:27–1:59)
* III: "Strangiato theme" (2:00–3:15)
* IV: "A Lerxst in Wonderland" (3:16–5:48)
* V: "Monsters!" (5:49–6:09)
* VI: "The Ghost of the Aragon" (6:10–6:44)
* VII: "[[Danforth Avenue|Danforth]] and [[Pape Village|Pape]]" (6:45–7:25)
* VIII: "The Waltz of the Shreves" (7:26–7:51)
* IX: "Never turn your back on a Monster!" (7:52–8:02)
* X: "Monsters! (Reprise)" (8:03–8:16)
* XI: "Strangiato theme (Reprise)" (8:17–9:20)
* XII: "A Farewell to Things" (9:20–9:37)

Live versions of "La Villa Strangiato" have often featured altered sections. For instance, on ''[[Exit...Stage Left]]'', Lee sings part of a nursery rhyme over "Danforth and Pape" (the liner notes include a translation of his words) and adds a short bass solo during "Monsters! (Reprise)." During later tours, as documented on [[Rush in Rio]], a drum/bass vamp was inserted before "Strangiato Theme (Reprise)," over which Lifeson made a [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] rant. The classical guitar introduction was either played on electric guitar or, more commonly, cut out altogether. During the 2010-2011 [[Time Machine Tour]], the piece began with a [[polka]] rendition of "To sleep, perchance to dream," then transitioned into the original arrangement.

The band set out to record the song in one take, however it ultimately required three separate takes. According to Lee, "We spent more time recording 'Strangiato' than the entire ''[[Fly By Night (album)|Fly By Night]]'' album.  It was our first piece without any vocals at all. So each section had to stand up with a theme and musical structure of its own."&lt;ref name="visions"&gt;Banasiewicz, Bill; ''Rush: Visions: The Official Biography'', Chapter 7, Omnibus Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The segments titled "Monsters!" and "Monsters! (Reprise)" are an adaptation of [[Raymond Scott|Raymond Scott's]] popular composition [[Powerhouse (song)|"Powerhouse"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Villa Strangiato / Powerhouse|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/view/39397/Rush-La%20Villa%20Strangiato_Raymond%20Scott-Powerhouse/|publisher=Who Sampled}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Scott's publishers did not attempt to take legal action until the statute of limitations had run out, Rush's management, feeling it was the right thing to do, gave some monetary compensation to Mr. and Mrs. Scott.&lt;ref&gt;Official Raymond Scott Site, FAQ. http://raymondscott.com/#faq&lt;/ref&gt;

"La Villa Strangiato" translates roughly to "The Strange Village" or "Weird City".&lt;ref name="visions"/&gt;

===YYZ===
{{main|YYZ (instrumental)}}
From the ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'' album. "YYZ" (natively pronounced ''why-why-zed'') is the [[IATA airport code|airport code]] for the [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], and the instrumental opens with a rhythm in 5/4 that is [[Morse code]] for "YYZ" (-.-- -.-- --..).  The piece evolved into a drum/bass solo during the 1980s. "YYZ" was the first of six Rush songs (over three decades) to be nominated for a [[Grammy]] in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].

From the ''[[Roll the Bones]]'' album, "'''Where's My Thing?'''" was Rush's second song nominated for a Grammy, losing to [[Eric Johnson]]'s [[Cliffs of Dover (song)|"Cliffs of Dover"]]. The song has a pop-oriented feel, featuring an upbeat tempo and a brass-like synthesizer line.  On the original album, it is humorously subtitled "'''Part IV: 'Gangster of Boats' Trilogy'''."  The song was performed on the ''Roll the Bones'' tour and did not appear in concert again until the 2012 [[Clockwork Angels Tour]], with an added drum solo. This version of the song was titled "Where's My Thing?/Here It Is!" on the live album ''[[Clockwork Angels Tour (album)|Clockwork Angels Tour]]''.

}}
From the ''[[Counterparts (album)|Counterparts]]'' album. During the ''[[Counterparts (album)|Counterparts]]'', ''[[Test for Echo]]'', and ''[[Vapor Trails]]'' tours, and featured on the ''[[Different Stages (Rush album)|Different Stages]]'' and ''[[Rush in Rio]]'' live albums, "Leave That Thing Alone" preceded Peart's drum solo and was played with an extended ending to showcase Lee's bass work. It was then omitted from the set lists until 2010's [[Time Machine Tour]].

This track was the third song nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1994, losing to [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Marooned (song)|Marooned]]."

}}
From the ''[[Test for Echo]]'' album. Like the "2112 Overture," "Limbo" features vocals by Lee; however, he does not sing any lyrics. The song includes spoken samples from [[Bobby Pickett|Bobby "Boris" Pickett]]'s novelty song "[[Monster Mash]]."

===The Main Monkey Business, Hope, and Malignant Narcissism===

Rush's album ''[[Snakes &amp; Arrows]]'' is the first Rush album to feature multiple instrumental tracks: "[[The Main Monkey Business]]", "[[Hope (instrumental)|Hope]]", and "[[Malignant Narcissism (instrumental)|Malignant Narcissism]]". "The Main Monkey Business" is just over six minutes long. As with "Limbo" and "2112 Overture", Lee's voice is briefly heard, but no words are sung. The other two songs, "Hope" and "Malignant Narcissism", are two of the shortest songs ever recorded by Rush, both being just over two minutes long. "Hope" is a solo guitar piece written by Lifeson. "Malignant Narcissism" features Lee playing a [[Fretless guitar|fretless bass]] and Peart on a four-piece drum kit.&lt;ref&gt;Peart, Neil: [http://rush.com/thegameofsnakesandarrows/Rush.Essay4.S&amp;A.pdf The Game of Snakes and Arrows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421054633/http://www.rush.com/thegameofsnakesandarrows/Rush.Essay4.S%26A.pdf |date=2007-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Malignant Narcissism" contains a spoken sample, "Usually a case of malignant narcissism brought on during childhood," from the movie ''[[Team America: World Police]]''. "Malignant Narcissism" became the fifth Rush instrumental to be nominated for a Grammy under the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance, in 2008, losing to Bruce Springsteen's "Once Upon A Time In The West".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/50th_Show/list.aspx#04 GRAMMY.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208065050/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/50th_Show/list.aspx |date=2007-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A live recording of "Hope" from the album ''[[Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace]]'' became the sixth Rush instrumental to be nominated for a Grammy under the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx#04 GRAMMY.com 2009 site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205000233/http://content.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx |date=2008-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It lost to [[Zappa Plays Zappa]]'s "[[Peaches en Regalia]]".

Found on the ''[[Exit...Stage Left]]'' live album, "Broon's Bane" is a short classical guitar arrangement performed by Lifeson as an extended intro to "[[The Trees (Rush song)|The Trees]]." The song is named after [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]], nicknamed "Broon" by the band, who produced ''Exit...Stage Left'' and 10 [[Rush discography|other Rush albums]]. (On the same album, Lee refers to Brown as "T.C. Broonsie" when introducing "Jacob's Ladder.") It is not featured on any other live or studio recording by [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. The song repeats and builds upon the same three-beat line, coming to a climax about one minute into the piece before segueing into "The Trees."

===Cygnus X-1 (Live Recordings)===

On the live album ''[[Rush in Rio]]'', an abridged version of "Cygnus X-1" is performed as an instrumental. The piece consists of the "Prologue" section of the song, without the spoken introduction. The [[Moog Taurus]] synthesizer heard in the studio recording is replaced with a choir-like synthesizer sound.

On the [[R40 Live Tour]], the Prelude of Book II was played, transposed down by one whole step due to Lee's decreased vocal range. Immediately afterward, the band played the first and third parts of Book I as instrumentals, with a Peart drum solo as an interlude between them.

The opening song of Rush's 2004 tour dates featured an instrumental combining sections of one song from each of the band's first six albums.

The songs featured in the medley were:
#"[[Finding My Way (song)|Finding My Way]]'" (''[[Rush (Rush album)|Rush]]'')
#"[[Fly by Night (album)|Anthem]]" (''[[Fly by Night (album)|Fly by Night]]'')
#"[[Bastille Day (song)|Bastille Day]]" (''[[Caress of Steel]]'')

#"[[Cygnus X-1 (song series)|Cygnus X-1 Prologue]]" (''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'')
#"[[Cygnus X-1 (song series)|Hemispheres Prelude]]" (''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]'')

===O'Malley's Break===
During the 2010-11 Time Machine Tour, Lifeson would perform a brief 12-string guitar piece (entitled "O'Malley's Break" on the CD and DVD) that segued into "[[Closer to the Heart]]."

===Peke's Repose===
During the 2012 [[Clockwork Angels Tour]], Lifeson would play a guitar solo (called "Peke's Repose" on the CD/DVD/BD) that served as an introduction to "[[Clockwork Angels|Halo Effect]]".

===Neil Peart's drum solos===
A staple and highlight of Rush's concerts is a [[drum solo]] by Neil Peart. These solos have been featured on every live album released by the band. On the early live albums (''[[All the World's a Stage (album)|All the World's a Stage]]'' and ''[[Exit...Stage Left]]''), the drum solo was included as part of a song ("Working Man/Finding My Way" and "YYZ," respectively). On all subsequent live albums, the drum solo has been included on a separate track. On ''[[A Show of Hands]]'' and ''[[Different Stages (Rush album)|Different Stages]]'', the drum solos were titled "The Rhythm Method" (a pun on the [[calendar-based methods|form of birth control]]); on ''[[Rush in Rio]]'', it was entitled "O Baterista"; and on ''[[R30 Live In Frankfurt]]'' it was titled "Der Trommler". On Rush's 2008 live album, ''[[Snakes &amp; Arrows Live]]'', it is titled "De Slagwerker," and is coupled with "Malignant Narcissism" on the track-list. "O Baterista" was the fourth song nominated for a Grammy, in 2005, losing to [[Brian Wilson]]'s "[[Mrs. O'Leary's Cow (song)|Mrs. O'Leary's Cow]]". For the 2010 [[Time Machine Tour]], the solo was called "Love 4 Sale," but was renamed "Moto Perpetuo" for the CD and DVD release in November 2011.

The titles "O Baterista", "Der Trommler" and "De Slagwerker" all translate to "The Drummer" in Portuguese, German and Dutch respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Drummer | publisher = Woxikon.com | url =http://www.woxikon.com/eng/drummer.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Peart's drum solos include a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, leaving each performance unique.&lt;ref&gt;Drummer translations, Hudson Music, 2005, DVD&lt;/ref&gt; Each successive tour sees the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favor of newer, more-complex ones. Since the mid-late 1980s Peart has utilized [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] [[Sound module|trigger pads]] to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a [[marimba]], [[harp]], [[temple blocks]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], [[glockenspiel]], [[Bell (instrument)|orchestra bells]], [[tubular bell]]s, [[timpani]] and [[vibra-slap]] as well as other, more esoteric percussion. Some purely electronic, description-defying sounds are also used. All are incorporated into each drum solo.

Peart's solos from 1987 until 2007 included [[marimba]] excerpts from "Pieces of Eight," a piece that first appeared as a [[flexi disc]] record in the May 1987 issue of ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' magazine. In addition, all solos since 1991 have contained marimba portions of another Peart composition entitled "Momo's Dance Party," and those from 1991 to 2004 featured a complex pattern from the song "Scars" (from the studio album ''[[Presto (album)|Presto]]''). For the ''[[Vapor Trails]]'' and R30 tours, each solo concluded with a section of the [[Count Basie]] standard "[[One O'Clock Jump]]," which Peart recorded while producing ''Burning For Buddy'', a two-volume tribute album to legendary [[big band]] drummer and bandleader, [[Buddy Rich]]. For the Snakes &amp; Arrows Tour, Peart replaced the finale with an excerpt from "[[Cotton Tail]]," which he recorded with the Buddy Rich Band in the mid-1990s. For the [[Time Machine Tour]], Peart again replaced the finale with an excerpt from the Buddy Rich standard "[[Love for Sale (song)|Love for Sale]]," which he also performed with the Buddy Rich Big Band at a 2008 memorial concert. He initially named the solo after that song, calling it "Love 4 Sale," but eventually changed the name to "Moto Perpetuo" for the CD and DVD release in November 2011.

For the [[Clockwork Angels Tour]], Peart played three short drum solos instead of a single long one: an interlude during "Where's My Thing?" in the first set, then an interlude during "Headlong Flight" and a lead-in to "[[Red Sector A]]" in the second. The solos were respectively named "Here It Is!", "Drumbastica," and "The Percussor - (I) Binary Love Theme / (II) Steambanger's Ball" on the tour's live album/DVD release. "The Percussor" is a mainly electronic drum solo dominated by the sounds of triggered samples assigned to many parts of Peart's kit.

For the [[R40 Live Tour]], Peart played two short solos: the "Drumbastica" interlude during "Headlong Flight" in the first set, and an interlude named "The Story So Far" during "Cygnus X-1" in the second.

&lt;!--Please DO NOT add any Marian, Josephian or Jesus images on this list without properly confirming or seeing a copy of the Papal Bull authorizing their coronation either through social media, the chancery or diocese or at the Papal archives in Rome. The list is continuously being monitored and any attempt to add or remove an entry is scrutinized for authenticity and veracity of the existence of a Papal document from Rome. Just because a Bishop or priest crowns an image DOES  NOT MERIT  that a Pope has expressively authorized such a Pontifical act in a canonical manner. Just because a Pope blesses a crown or places a crown on the image out of piety does not make it canonical or institutional, for many instances has a Pontiff placed a crown out of piety but has not issued a papal document for its canonical effect in the Church.   --&gt;

[[File:Coronación Canónica de María Santísima de la Victoria 5 de mayo de 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Spaniard]] bishop José Vilaplana Blasco, as proxy in the name of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] crowning the image of Santa Maria Victoria in [[Spain]].]] 
[[File:Santissima Bula de la Virgen de Triana.jpg|thumb|The canonical document of [[Papal bull]] for Our Lady of Hope of Triana, legally granting the Marian image the Pontifical right to wear a crown in 1984 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. ]]
 
The following list enumerates the various [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Marian]], [[Saint Joseph|Josephian]], and [[Christological]] images venerated in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], by which a [[Pope]] has officially issued a [[Papal bull]] of '''[[canonical coronation]]''' either by the [[Pontiff]], a [[Papal legate]] or a [[Papal nuncio]].
 
[[File:Papal bull for the Canonical Coronation of Virgen de los Remedios de Pampanga from Pope Pius 12th.jpg|thumb|The Papal decree issued by [[Pope Pius XII]] for the [[canonical coronation]] of [[Virgen de los Remedios de Pampanga]] in 1956.]]

The very first Marian image crowned without a direct papal approval was by Cardinal [[Francesco Sforza Pallavicino]] with ''La Madonna della Oropa'' on 30&amp;nbsp;August 1620. The first Marian image Pontifically crowned was the painted image of ''La Madonna della Febbre'' (Madonna of Fever) on 27 May 1631 by [[Pope Urban VIII]] through the Vatican Chapter located at the Sacristy of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]].

The solemn prescription of ritual to crowning images is embedded in ''[[Ordo Coronandi Imaginem Beatae Mariae Virginis]]'' published by the [[Holy Office]] on 25 May 1981. Prior to 1989, papal bulls concerning the authorization of canonical coronations were handwritten on [[parchment]]. After 1989, the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] began issuing the specific recognition to crown a religious image, spelling out its approved devotional title and authorizing Papal legate. Several venerated  images of the [[Child Jesus]] and [[Saint Joseph]] have also been granted a Pontifical coronation.

|Notre Dame de Bon Secours ||15 August 1880 || Lablachere, [[Ardeche]]&lt;ref&gt;Ad perpetuam rei memoriam. — Dioecesis Vivariensis intra fines in
paroecia de Lablachere conspicuum exstat sanctuarium sub titulo Beatae
Mariae Virginis a Bono Succursu, quod christifideles, non modo a finitimis
locis sed a longinquis etiam regionibus peregrinorum more ad ipsum
confluentes, pie devoteque celebrant. Loco quidem antiquioris et parva®
ecclesiae, quam saeculo decimo septimo vertente, iam quidam pii coniuges
sub eodem titulo fundaverant, hodiernum templum saeculo decimo nono
tantum erectum est; ipsumque, tribus navibus constans, amplitudine molis
atque ornatu, picturis parietum, artisque operibus quibus ditatur, plane
dignum omnium laudibus videtur; adeo ut inter regionis Vivariensis sanctuaria
principem nunc locum facile teneat. Illud autem sanctuarium cuiusvis
ordinis condicionisque christifideles frequentes visitant Beatae Mariae
Virginis de Bono Succursu simulacrum veneraturi, quod ab annis fere
ducentis et quinquaginta inibi servatur et colitur, quodque prodigiis gratiisque
clarum aureo diademate anno MDCCCLXXX Apostolica auctoritate coronatum
est. Eodem in templo divinus cultus nitide peragitur a frugiferae
Congregationis Beatae Mariae Immaculatae sacerdotibus, qui sanctuario
addicti religiosam vitam in adiectis aedibus vivunt bonoque spirituali
peregrinorum prospiciunt.&lt;/ref&gt;||&lt;p align=center&gt;[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_Pope_Leo_XIII.svg|100px]] &lt;p align=center&gt;Leo XIII||[[File:Vierge à l'Enfant - Notre-dame de Bon Secours.jpg|200px]]||[[File:Notredame02.jpg|200px]]

[[File:Mainistir Bhuithe cross Muiredach.jpg|thumb|290px|West-face of Muiredach's High Cross.]]
'''Muiredach's High Cross''' is a [[high cross]] from the 10th or possibly 9th century, located at the ruined monastic site of [[Monasterboice]], in [[County Louth]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. There are two other high crosses at Monasterboice; in local terms Muiredach's cross is also known as the '''South Cross'''. Muiredach's cross is the most impressive surviving example of [[Celtic art|early medieval Irish]] stonework, and the crosses at Monasterboice have been said to be Ireland's greatest contribution to European sculpture. Recently concerns have been raised over the condition of Muiredach's cross; and it has been suggested that the cross should possibly be brought indoors to protect it from the elements.

==Background: high crosses in Ireland==
[[File:High Crosses of Ireland (map).png|left|thumb|Location of [[high cross]]es in Ireland.]]
Irish [[high cross]]es are internationally recognised icons of early medieval Ireland. They are usually found on early church sites and can be either plain or decorated. High crosses served a variety of functions including, [[liturgical]], ceremonial, and symbolic uses. They were also used as markers for an area of [[sanctuary]] around a church; as well as focal points for markets, which grew around church sites.&lt;ref name="H1=37"/&gt; The "greatest",&lt;ref name="H1=37"/&gt; or "classic",&lt;ref name="D1=2930"/&gt; Irish high crosses can be found at [[Durrow Abbey]], the [[Abbey of Kells]], and at [[Monasterboice]]. These high crosses are decorated with panels inscribed with biblical themes; and are thought to be influenced from [[late antiquity]] and early medieval Rome. Such 'classic' high crosses comprise the largest corpus of biblical sculpture in all of Europe, in the last quarter of the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]]. The sculpted panels are thought to have been originally painted, though no traces of paint survive today.&lt;ref name="D1=2930"/&gt; On such high crosses, the east face tends to show scenes from the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]; while the west face shows scenes from the [[New Testament]]. High crosses can be dated from the inscriptions they bear; and it is difficult to date the majority of the plain and undecorated high crosses. The earliest Irish high crosses, at [[Kinnity]], [[County Offaly]], have been dated to 846–862 CE. Both Muiredach's cross and the Cross of the Scriptures at [[Clonmacnoise]] have been dated to about 900–920 CE.&lt;ref name="H1=37"/&gt; High crosses are thought to have originated as stone versions of decorated wooden or metal crosses; and the stone crosses which survive today are considered to be the last phase of development of the high cross. Early forms are thought to have been made of wood, with ornamented panels of [[bronze]] sheeting; and would have been much smaller than the grand high crosses which survive today. Irish high crosses are considered to have been derived from stone crosses in Britain, where they became popular in the 8th century.&lt;ref name="D2=218220"/&gt;

[[File:A high cross and round tower at Monasterboice, Ireland.jpg|thumb|270px|Ruinous [[Monasterboice]] today. Pictured is a [[Irish round tower|round tower]], church ruins and one of the site's three early mediaeval [[high cross]]es.]]
Muiredach's High Cross is one of three surviving high crosses located at [[Monasterboice]] ([[Gaeilge]]: ''Mainistir Bhuithe'', "Buithe's monastery"). The monastic site is said to be founded in the 6th century, by [[St Buithe]]. It is most famous for its 9th and 10th century high crosses—most notably Muiredach's High Cross.&lt;ref name="H1=321324"/&gt; These crosses are all made of [[sandstone]] and are referred to as the ''North'', ''West'', and ''South'' Crosses. It is not certain whether they stand in their original locations. The ''South Cross'' is commonly known as ''Muiredach's cross'' because of an inscription on the bottom of the west-face. The inscription reads &lt;small&gt;''ÓR DO MUIREDACH LAS NDERNAD IN CHROS''&lt;/small&gt;, which translates from Gaeilge as "a prayer for Muiredach who had this cross made". It is thought that this ''[[Muiredach (disambiguation)|Muiredach]]'' is likely Muiredach mac Domhnall (died 923), who was one of the monastery's most celebrated abbots; he was also the abbot-elect of Armagh and also the [[Steward (office)|steward]] of the [[southern Uí Néill]]. There is, however, another abbot named ''Muiredach'' who died in 844. Another possibility is that ''Muiredach'' may refer to Muiredach mac Cathail (died 867); a king whose territory included the site of the monastery.&lt;ref name="H1=321324"/&gt;

The cross measures about {{convert|19|ft|m}} high; including the base, which measures {{convert|2|ft|3|in|m}}. The cross is made of sandstone which is yellow in colour. The main shaft of the cross is carved from a single block of sandstone; the base and the capstone on the top are carved from separate stones. The base is the shape of a truncated pyramid of four sides. It measures {{convert|2|ft|2|in|m}} high and {{convert|4|ft|9|in|m}} at the bottom; it tapers to {{convert|3|ft|8|in|m}} by {{convert|3|ft|4|in|m}} at the top. The main shaft is rectangular, measuring {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m}} high; {{convert|2|ft|2|in|m}} by {{convert|1|ft|8|in|m}} at the bottom. tapering to {{convert|2|ft|4|in|m}} by {{convert|1|ft|7|in|m}} at the top. The topmost stone, or capstone, is carved in the shape of a house, with a sloping roof; and has a crescent-shaped finial at each end.&lt;ref name="A1=134135"/&gt; It is thought that such house-shaped capstones may represent [[reliquaries]],&lt;ref name="K1=915919"/&gt; which, like the [[Monymusk Reliquary]], typically took this form in Irish Christianity.

Every piece of the cross is divided into panels which are decorated with carvings. The carvings are remarkably well preserved, however, they certainly would have originally had much finer detail. Even so, certain details about clothing, weapons, and other things, can still be clearly made out. Biblical themes dominate the carved panels; though there are pieces which feature certain geometric shapes and interlace ornaments.&lt;ref name="H1=321324"/&gt;

20th century Irish [[archaeologist]] [[Robert Alexander Stewart Macalister]] noted that there are 124 figures sculpted upon the panels of the cross—119 of which shown in some form of costume. The cross is not unlike other works of [[Insular art]] where the artist has represented people in [[Early medieval European dress|contemporary costume]]. All, except one, of the figures is depicted bare-headed. The lone figure with headgear is [[Goliath]], who wears a [[cone (geometry)|conical]] helmet.&lt;ref name="M1=3234"/&gt; Generally the hair is worn clipped in a straight line over the forehead, though in some cases it is shown to be distinctly [[curly hair|curly]]. Many of the figures have no facial hair, though several of them wear very long [[moustaches]], with heavy ends which hang down to the level of the chin. There are very few beards represented; those shown with beards are [[Adam]], [[Cain]], [[Moses]] and [[Saul]].&lt;ref name="M1=4142"/&gt; Macalister considered that the artist excelled in the geometric and abstract patterns which appear on the cross. On the ring surrounding the head of the cross, there are 17 different patterns. Macalister stated that geometric patterns fall into three categories: ''[[spiral]]'', ''[[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]]'', and ''key-patterns''.&lt;ref name="M1=49"/&gt;

===Concerns over the conservation of the Cross===
Recently there have been concerns raised over the safety and protection of the cross. In 2004 Barry McGahon, chairperson of the Monasterboice Tour Guides, stated to an [[List of newspapers in Ireland|Irish newspaper]] that it was not well protected; and suggested that a railing around the cross would temporally keep people from interfering with it. McGahon stated that the cross had begun to take longer drying out and that it seemed like rain was seeping into it. He added that [[acid rain]] and [[air pollution|pollution]] from a newly opened [[M1 motorway]] would have adverse effects upon the cross.&lt;ref name="mythicalireland"/&gt; In 2008, Peter Harbison, professor of archaeology, advised that they should be brought indoors to protect them from the elements. He stated that if they were not so-protected they would continue to decay—as sandstone decomposes easily.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt;

===Proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site===
In about 2008 Harbison stated that the crosses at Monasterboice could probably be regarded as Ireland's greatest contribution to [[Sculpture#Europe|European sculpture]]. In April 2009 ''[[The Irish Times]]'' reported that the [[Government of Ireland]] was about to submit a list of sites—among them Monasterboice—to [[UNESCO]] to be considered a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt;

*'''Panel 1'''. This panel depicts two [[hermit]] saints—[[Anthony the Great|Anthony]] and [[Paul of Thebes]]—holding a loaf of bread, with a [[raven]] sitting on the ground beside them. This panel is related to panel 1 on the north face, which shows Anthony and Paul meeting.&lt;ref name="M1=8083"/&gt;
*'''Panel 6'''. It is uncertain what this panel represents. [[J. Romilly Allen]] proposed that this panel may represent a soul being carried to heaven by two angels.&lt;ref name="A1=137"/&gt; Macalister thought it possible that the panel represented the [[Recording angel]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
*'''Panel 7'''. This panel represents [[The Last Judgement]]. It contains more than 45 figures; in the centre, Jesus is standing, holding a floriated sceptre in the right hand and the Cross of the [[Resurrection]] in the left. On the head of Christ there is a bird—possibly a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], the symbol of the Resurrection. At the foot of Christ is a small, kneeling figure with an open book over the head.&lt;ref name="A1=137"/&gt; Macalister considered that this likely represents an angel with the ''[[Book of Life]]''.&lt;ref name="M1=76"/&gt; On the right of Christ is David enthroned, playing a harp, upon which the Holy Spirit rests in the form of a dove; behind are a choir of angels playing instruments. On the left of Christ are the Lost Souls, being driven away from Christ by a devilish creature holding a trident.&lt;ref name="A1=137"/&gt;
*'''Panel 8'''. This panel shows three figures: [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], the [[Devil]], and a human. Michael is shown weighing the soul of a human in a balance. The balance is suspended by a chain upon a cross-bar above. The Devil is lying prostrated below, while attempting to pull down the empty scale of the balance to influence it in his favour. Michael also holds a staff and is thrusting it into the Devil's head.&lt;ref name="A1=137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A1=179181"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M1=7677"/&gt; Macalister stated that this scene is not recorded on any other Irish high cross.&lt;ref name="M1=7677"/&gt;
*'''Panel 9'''. This panel represents the [[Adoration of the Magi]]. Usually the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] are represented as three, because of their three gifts of gold, [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]]. However, in some cases, likely for [[symmetry]]'s sake, they are also depicted in a group of four—as in this panel, being led by a long-bearded and aged [[Saint Joseph]] the Betrothed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/muiredach/muirdacheast.html&lt;/ref&gt; Over the head of Christ is the [[Star of Bethlehem]].&lt;ref name="M1=72"/&gt;
*'''Panel 10'''. This panel depicts [[Moses]] [[Chukat#Water from a rock|drawing water from the rock]]. Moses is depicted standing with a staff, in front of a crowd of thirsty Israelites, while water is gushing forth from a hole. The two rows of Israelites are likely meant to show people standing next to each other; and this is another example of the trouble of perspective in such carvings. The scene is chosen for its New Testament [[typology (theology)|typological]] application, as Christ is the spiritual rock, the source of the living water. The scene is not infrequently used in [[catacomb]]s and other places where [[early Christian art]] is found; but it is very rare in Insular art.&lt;ref name="M1=7172"/&gt;
*'''Panel 11'''. This panel depicts the battle between [[David]] and [[Goliath]]. The two combatants stand in the middle of the panel are likely meant to be in the foreground; there is figure on either side of the combatants which are likely meant to be seen as in the background. David has a shepherd's crook over one shoulder, and in the other hand he holds a sling, hanging open to show that the stone has already been cast. Over his shoulder is suspended a wallet in which the stones were stored. Goliath is depicted on his knees, with a hand against his forehead, to indicate that he has been struck there. He wears a conical helmet; being the only one character depicted on the cross to wear any kind of head-covering. He bears a round shield and a short dagger. To the left of the two combatants is a seated figure, likely King [[Saul]], who also has a round shield and carries a short sword, and is drinking from a horn. The fourth figure, to the right of the combatants, is according to Macalister, likely [[David and Jonathan|Jonathan]], though this figure may also represent Goliath's armourer.&lt;ref name="M1=71"/&gt;
*'''Panel 12'''. This is a double panel, which contains two scenes. The left scene depicts [[Adam]] and [[Eve]], standing under the forbidden tree, which is heavily laden with fruit. Coiled around the tree is the serpent, which is whispering into the ear of Eve, who is handing the apple to Adam. According to Macalister, this is one of the most common scenes sculpted on high crosses (however it is not carved on the tallest cross at Monasterboice). This scene gives an explanation of [[Original sin|how sin entered the world]]; the next scene shows the first murder. The scene on the right depicts [[Cain and Abel]]. Cain is represented as a middle-aged man with a beard, who grasps Abel, pictured as a beardless youth, and buries a cleaver into his head.&lt;ref name="M1=7071"/&gt;
*'''Panel 13'''. This panel shows two animals playing with each other; Macalister thought they were possibly lions.&lt;ref name="M1=70"/&gt;

====Panels ''A'' and ''B''====
These panels appear on the under-side of the cross.
*'''Panel B'''. This panel is located on the under-side of one of the arms of the cross. It shows a hand surrounded by conventionalised clouds. This panel represents the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], or ''Dextra Dei'', which has long been used as a Christian symbol.&lt;ref name="nli.ie"/&gt; With very few exceptions, it was not until about the 12th century that artists presumed to make a full human likeness of God. Before this time the normal way of representing God was showing a hand issuing from the clouds. According to Macalister this scene has no connection with any of the others sculpted on the cross. He considered that since it appears on the under-side, where a bystanders can see the hand above their head, that the Hand of God was outstretched towards the bystander.&lt;ref name="M1=7779"/&gt; The [[Red Hand of Ulster]] may be based upon a mythological motif; however, it may also be based upon the ''Dextra Dei''.&lt;ref name="nli.ie"/&gt;

 | alt2      = Photograph of the west face of the Cross.
 | caption2  = &lt;center&gt;'''West face'''&lt;/center&gt;
}}
*'''Panel 1a'''. The panel depicts Moses on [[Mount Sinai]], with [[Aaron]] and [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]] supporting his hands.&lt;ref name="M1=80"/&gt;
*'''Panel 11'''. This panel depicts the [[Crucifixion of Christ]]. The central figure is Christ upon the cross. He is fully clothed, which is normal in European representations of the Crucifixion at this date. His arms are stretched straight and horizontal. The lance-bearer and sponge-bearer are placed symmetrically on either side of Christ. MacAlister thought that the two circular knobs appearing between them and Christ probably represent the sun and moon, referring to the darkness at the Crucifixion. MacAlister stated that it was uncertain what the bird at the foot of the cross represented. He stated that some thought it is a symbol of the resurrection, and that others thought it represents the [[dove of peace]].  There is a similar bird ''above'' the Crucifixion on the [[high cross]] at Kells. On the outside of the lance-bearer and sponge-bearer are two small figures—a woman, and a man kneeling on one knee, probably representing the [[Virgin Mary]] and John.&lt;ref name="M1=74"/&gt;
*'''Panel 13'''. MacAlister thought that this panel probably represented the [[Great Commission|parting commission]] of the [[Ascension of Christ|ascending Christ]] to his Apostles. The central figure (Christ) is seated; a footstool shaped like an animal's head appears between his feet. He hands a roll to the figure on the left; he hands a book to the figure on the right. MacAlister stated that this figure on the right is [[John the Evangelist|John]], as his symbol of an eagle (likely an [[eagle]]) is shown above his head.&lt;ref name="M1=7374"/&gt;
*'''Panel 14'''. This panel features three figures. The middle figure has his hand raised in benediction. The figure on the left is stretching out his finger and touching the side of the central figure. MacAlister considered this panel to represent the [[Incredulity of Thomas]] ("Doubting Thomas"), which is now the general view; if this is so, it would be quite unique on Irish crosses,&lt;ref name="M1=73"/&gt; though the scene is often found in other Early Medieval Christian art.
*'''Panel 15'''. This panel shows three men; it is thought to represent the [[Arrest of Christ|seizure of Christ]] in the [[garden of Gethsemane]]. The panel shows Christ, in the middle, holding a staff and being arrested by two men with military equipment. A similar representation of this scene occurs in the ''[[Book of Kells]]'', and is also pictured on the Cross of King Flann at Clonmacnois.&lt;ref name="M1=73"/&gt;
*'''Panels A''' and '''B'''. See east face section for detailed description.

===North face===
{{multiple image

 | alt2      = Photograph of the east and south faces of the Cross.
 | caption2  = &lt;center&gt;'''East and south faces'''&lt;/center&gt;
}}
*'''Panel 5'''. It is uncertain what this panel is supposed to represent. The panels shows three angels, a seated figure holding something unintelligible, and two other figures, one of which appears to be un-draped, holding rods. MacAlister proposed that this panel may represent the [[Flagellation of Christ|Scourging of Christ]], but he was not satisfied with his guess.&lt;ref name="M1=79"/&gt;

===South face===

*'''Panel 1'''. This panel shows a horseman, and above a much badly weathered pattern of spirals which are hard to make out. Macalister proposed that this panel could represent one of the mystic riders described in the ''[[Book of Revelation]]''.&lt;ref name="M1=80"/&gt;
*'''Panel 5'''. This panel depicts [[Pilate]] washing his hands.&lt;ref name="M1=79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M1=3637"/&gt; The ''[[Gospel of Matthew]]'' states that before condemning Jesus to death, Pilate washed his hands with water in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; you will see."{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
*'''Panel 9'''. This panel shows a coiling plant; in six of the coils there is an animal kicking up its hind legs. The hind legs of the middle two animals entwine to be part of a [[fretwork]] in the middle of the panel. At the top of the panel are two birds feeding.&lt;ref name="M1=53"/&gt;

'''Multiven Group BV''' is a Netherlands-based provider of independent and decentralised software integrity maintenance and cyber-defence services for multivendor [[Internet Protocol]] [[Computer network|network]] hardware and [[blockchain]] nodes. Its customers include [[Fortune 500|large enterprises]], [[Internet service provider]]s, [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|small, medium businesses]], [[Telecommunication companies|Telecommunications companies]], [[Fortune 500]], [[Academia]] and [[government]] agencies.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Multiven was founded in 2005 in [[Palo Alto]] [[California]] by British-Nigerian technology entrepreneur Peter Alfred-Adekeye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-age.com/multiven-takes-on-giants-with-crowdsourced-network-support-2135848/|title=Multiven takes on giants with crowdsourced network support|last=Reeves|first=Ed|date=December 4, 2012|publisher=Information Age|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His aim was to build a company able to maintain the integrity of the world's Internet infrastructure without a hardware, software or political agenda. 

Headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands, Multiven is today the world's first and only independent provider of software management, maintenance and cyber-defence services for Internet networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.multiven.com/media/advocacy/Multiven,%20Inc.%20v.%20Cisco%20Systems,%20Inc.-dec2008.pdf|title=Multiven v. Cisco - December 1, 2008|date={{date|2008-12-01}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiven has regional sales offices in Paris, France, London, UK, Dubai, UAE.

=== History of Market ===
[[Internet|The Internet]], a short form of the word Internetwork, is an international ubiquitous network of networks. Given the amount of data traversing it, its criticality to personal, corporate and national security cannot be over-emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|title=World Internet Users Statistics and 2018 World Population Stats|website=www.internetworldstats.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet infrastructure comprises software-driven networked [[Network switch|switches]], [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], [[Server (computing)|servers]] and storage hardware that switch, route, protect and store all  voice, video and text data intelligently across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm|title=How Does the Internet Work?|last=Shuler|first=Rus|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet equipment manufacturers like [[Cisco Systems Incorporated|Cisco Systems]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Brocade Communications Systems|etc.]]. have a quasi monopoly on the multi-Billion dollar software maintenance services market for networking equipment through their own maintenance contracts and authorized third party maintenance. Multiven is the only provider offering a one-stop alternative for businesses of all sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.multiven.com/media/advocacy/Multiven,%20Inc.%20v.%20Cisco%20Systems,%20Inc.-dec2008.pdf|title=Multiven v. Cisco - December 1, 2008|date={{date|2008-12-01}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Multiven Open Marketplace ===
In March 2018, Multiven launched the development of the Multiven Open Marketplace, a [[blockchain]] project aiming to transition its existing business into a decentralized organisation. Multiven is developing a blockchain-based open Marketplace to allow customers to buy and sell new and pre-owned [[Information Technology]] hardware, software and services, on a peer-to-peer basis, without intermediaries, solely powered by smart contracts and one global [[Cryptocurrency]], the Multicoin. Multiven's maintenance and cybersecurity services will be accessible on the platform and can be bound to any hardware device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=220567|title=Multiven Announces its Initial Coin Offering (“ICO“) to Build the World’s First Blockchain-Based Marketplace for IT, Telecoms and Network Products and Services|date={{date|2018-02-21}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the Multicoin transaction fees from the Multiven Open Marketplace, funds Multiven B-Fence, a program that proactively defends [[Bitcoin]] nodes and the routers that connect them to other nodes, against centralisation cyberattacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/multiven-launches-the-b-fence-program-to-actively-monitor-and-defend-all-bitcoin-nodes-and-their-689805391.html|title=Multiven Launches the B-Fence Program to Actively Monitor and Defend all Bitcoin Nodes and their Internet Gateway Routers against Cyberattacks|date={{date|2018-08-01}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Controversies ==

===Antitrust lawsuit against Cisco Systems===
On December 1, 2008, Multiven filed a United States Federal [[antitrust]] lawsuit&lt;sup&gt;[3][4][5][6][7][8][9]&lt;/sup&gt; against [[Cisco Systems, Inc.]] in an effort to open up the network maintenance services marketplace for Cisco equipment, promote competition and ensure consumer choice and value. Multiven’s complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and [[Tying (commerce)|tying]] [[Software bug|bug]] fixes/[[Patch (software)|patches]] and updates for its [[operating system]] [[software]] to its maintenance services (“SMARTnet”) and through a series of other illegal exclusionary and [[anticompetitive]] acts designed to maintain Cisco’s alleged [[monopoly]] in the network maintenance services market for Cisco networking equipment.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; In April 2009 during a Cisco-initiated mediation, Cisco offered Multiven a few million dollars as settlement and limited software updates for its customers but insisted that Multiven couldn’t advertise its access to Cisco software updates. Multiven declined this offer as it still limited free and fair competition. The following month in May 2009, Cisco filed a set of false counterclaims against Multiven and alleged that in 2006 ''“Multiven’s CEO or someone under his control”'' viewed Cisco’s ‘protected’ public website 99 times and downloaded Cisco IOS five times with a total value of $14,000, using a Cisco-employee provided credentials.

=== Cisco Fabricated Criminal Charges against Multiven CEO ===
Cisco went on to communicate the exact same false allegations in its civil counterclaims to a local US prosecutor in San Jose and after several months in which US authorities prevented Peter Alfred-Adekeye’s re-entry into the country for participation in Multiven v. Cisco, a special hearing in the case took place at a Canadian hotel from 18 - 20 May 2010, involving a US [[special master]] and four Cisco lawyers. On 20 May 2010, Cisco accused the person who filed the [[antitrust]] suit of hacking and orchestrated his arrest &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042011-former-engineer-who-sued-cisco.html?source=NWWNLE_nlt_daily_am_2011-04-20 |title=Former engineer who sued Cisco now faces criminal charges |author=Robert Mcmillan &amp; Stephen Lawson |date=20 April 2011 |work=Network World |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015005925/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042011-former-engineer-who-sued-cisco.html?source=NWWNLE_nlt_daily_am_2011-04-20 |archivedate=2012-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the court session by Canadian police based on a misleading US arrest warrant while in the middle of testifying against Cisco in Multiven's antitrust hearing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9XZeHcClFg|title=Video: Cisco orchestrated arrest of Multiven CEO on false charges during Multiven v. Cisco Deposition in Canada|date={{date|2010-05-20}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Alfred-Adekeye was released after 28 days in custody but was forced to remain in Canada for another year before he was allowed to return to his home in Zurich, Switzerland. On May 31, 2011, Mr Justice Ronald McKinnon of the Supreme Court of British Columbia stayed the extradition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.multiven.com/media/advocacy/Justice%20McKinnon%20Verdict%20on%20Adekeye%20v%20Canada%20on%20Behalf%20of%20the%20USA.pdf|title=The Ruling of Mr Justice Ronald McKinnon of the British Columbia Supreme Court - USA v. Alfred-Adekeye - May 31, 2011|date={{date|2010-07-19}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ruling that the strict standard of "extraordinary misconduct" was met by the circumstances and speaking of the "audacity of it all", of "Cisco's duplicity", and the "shocking" act of preventing someone's participation in a judicial proceeding by arresting them. False material in the US attorney's letter had misled the judge who signed the Canadian arrest warrant. "Grotesquely inflated" charges and the unjustified portrayal of Alfred-Adekeye as a Nigerian-born scam artist and flight risk had misled the Canadian judicial system further. The underlying civil case by Multiven against Cisco had been withheld from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHpkp2N1HgA|title=Video: Multiven v.

=== Cisco Settles Multiven v. Cisco ===
On July 19, 2010, Cisco settled Multiven's antitrust lawsuit by making its operating system and application software updates, bug fixes and patches available to all Multiven customers worldwide. This settlement agreement transformed Multiven into Cisco's first and only independent competitor in the multi-Billion dollars per year software maintenance services business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://multiven.com/#/advocacy/07192010|title=After weeks of deliberation, Cisco settles Multiven v.

Cisco - Settlement Agreement|date={{date|2010-07-19}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libel Lawsuit Against Cisco ===
On July 20, 2015, Multiven CEO, Peter Alfred-Adekeye initiated a libel lawsuit against Cisco for (1) falsely claiming that ''‘he or someone under his control at Multiven’'' downloaded and ‘stole’ Cisco software five times in 2006 from cisco.com (2) used this lie (a) to orchestrate his illegal arrest in Vancouver, Canada in 2010 during Multiven v. Cisco and (b) to fabricate an ‘indictment’ in August 2011 after the Canadian Supreme Court threw out Cisco/US Government’s extradition request and (3) continuing to knowingly propagate this falsehood till today, with the core purpose of defaming Mr Alfred-Adekeye’s character and that of Multiven’s - Cisco’s only competitor in the global multi-Billion dollar per year services business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.multiven.com/advocacy/2015/07/20/|title=Multiven CEO Peter Alfred-Adekeye Files Libel Lawsuit Against Cisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''novelist''' is an [[author]] or [[writer]] of [[novel]]s, though often novelists also write in other [[genre]]s of both [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]]. Some novelists are professional novelists, thus make a [[living wage|living]] writing novels and other fiction, while others aspire to support themselves in this way or write as an [[avocation]]. Most novelists struggle to get their [[debut novel]] published, but once published they often continue to be published, although very few become literary celebrities, thus gaining prestige or a considerable income from their work.

Novelists come from a variety of backgrounds and social classes, and frequently this shapes the content of their works. [[Audience reception|Public reception of a novelist's work]], the [[literary criticism]] commenting on it, and the novelists' incorporation of their own experiences into works and characters can lead to the author's personal life and identity being associated with a novel's fictional content. For this reason, the environment within which a novelist works and the reception of their novels by both the public and publishers can be influenced by their demographics or identity; important among these [[Cultural identity|culturally constructed identities]] are [[gender]], [[sexual identity]], [[social class]], [[Race (human classification)|race]] or [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[Religious identity|religion]], and [[place-based identity|an association with place]]. Similarly, some novelists have creative identities derived from their focus on different [[genres of fiction]], such as [[crime novel|crime]], [[romance novel|romance]] or [[historical novel]]s.

While many novelists compose fiction to satisfy personal desires, novelists and commentators often ascribe a particular social responsibility or role to novel writers. Many authors use such moral imperatives to justify different approaches to novel writing, including activism or different approaches to representing reality "truthfully".

==Etymology==
{{see also|Novel#Etymology}}
Novelist is a term derivative from the term "novel"  describing the "writer of novels". The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] recognizes other definitions of novelist, first appearing in the 16th and 17th centuries to refer to either "An innovator (in thought or belief); someone who introduces something new or who favours novelty" or "An inexperienced person; a novice."&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; However, the [[OED]] attributes the primary contemporary meaning of "a writer of novels" as first appearing in the 1633 book "{{not a typo|East-India Colation}}" by C. Farewell citing the passage {{not a typo|"It beeing a pleasant observation (at a distance) to note the order of their Coaches and Carriages..As if (presented to a Novelist) it had bin the spoyles of a Tryumph leading Captive, or a preparation to some sad Execution"}}&lt;ref name = OED&gt;{{cite web| title = novelist, n.| work = OED Online| date = December 2013| publisher = Oxford University Press| accessdate = 11 February 2014 | url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/128768?redirectedFrom=Novelist&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Google Ngrams, the term novelist first appears in the Google Books database in 1521.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Novelist&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1500&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2CNovelist%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bnovelist%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BNovelist%3B%2Cc0 | title = Google Ngrams "Novelist" 1680-2014|accessdate = February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process, publication and profession==
{{further|Self-publishing|Author#Relationship between author and publisher}}
[[File:TheFaulknerPortable.jpg|thumb|250px|William Faulkner's [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Underwood]] Universal Portable typewriter in his office at [[Rowan Oak]], which is now maintained by the [[University of Mississippi]] in [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]] as a museum]]
The difference between professional and amateur novelists often is the author's ability to publish. Many people take up novel writing as a hobby, but the difficulties of completing large scale fictional works of quality prevent the completion of novels. Once authors have completed a novel, they often will try to get it published. The publishing industry requires novels to have accessible profitable markets, thus many novelists will [[self-publish]] to circumvent the editorial control of publishers. [[Self-publishing]] has long been an option for writers, with [[vanity press]]es printing bound books for a fee paid by the writer. In these settings, unlike the more traditional publishing industry, activities usually reserved for a publishing house, like the distribution and promotion of the book, become the author's responsibility. The rise of the Internet and [[electronic book]]s has made self publishing far less expensive and a realistic way for authors to realize income.

Novelists apply a number of different methods to writing their novels, relying on a variety of approaches to inspire creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = Alexandra |last = Alter | issn = 0099-9660
| title = How to Write a Great Novel | work = Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 2014-02-15 | date = 2009-11-13 | url = https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703740004574513463106012106
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some communities actively encourage amateurs to practice writing novels to develop these unique practices, that vary from author to author. For example, the internet-based group, [[National Novel Writing Month]], encourages people to write 50,000-word novels in the month of November, to give novelists practice completing such works. In the  2010 event, over 200,000 people took part – writing a total of over 2.8 billion words.&lt;ref name="2010stats"&gt;{{cite web|author=Grant, Lindsey |url=http://blog.lettersandlight.org/post/2068578620/the-great-nanowrimo-stats-party |title=The Office of Letters and Light Blog – The Great NaNoWriMo Stats Party |publisher=Blog.lettersandlight.org |date=December 1, 2010 |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age and experience===
{{further|debut novel|juvenilia}}

Novelists don't usually publish their [[first novels]] until later in life. However, many novelists begin writing at a young age. For example, [[Iain Banks]] (1954-2013) began writing at eleven, and at sixteen completed his first novel, "The Hungarian Lift-Jet", about international arms dealers, "in pencil in a larger-than-foolscap log book".&lt;ref&gt;"Doing the Business: Iain Banks", ''The Guardian'', Saturday 7 August 1999. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/aug/07/fiction.iainbanks]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was thirty before he published his first novel, the highly controversial ''[[The Wasp Factory]]'' in 1984. The success of this novel enabled Banks to become a full-time novelist. Often an important writers' [[juvenilia]], even if not published, is prized by scholars because it provides insight into an author's biography and approach to writing; for example, the [[Brontë family]]'s juvenilia that depicts their imaginary world of [[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]], currently in the [[British Library]], has provided important information on their development as writers.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brontë Encyclopedia|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|editor1-last=Bernard|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Bernard|editor2-first=Louise|pages=126–127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i0NZUTJ_Em8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= GondalPoems&gt;{{cite book|title= Gondal Poems | first = Emily Jane | last = Brontë |year= 1938|publisher= The Shakespeare Head Press| location= Oxford | pages= 5–8|editor= Helen Brown and Joan Mott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= BLPressRelease&gt;{{citation | url= http://pressandpolicy.bl.uk/Press-Releases/The-Bront%C3%ABs-secret-science-fiction-stories-4e7.aspx |date=11 May 2011 |title=The Brontës’ secret science fiction stories |publisher=[[British Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, novelists publish as early as their teens. For example, [[Patrick O'Brian]] published his first novel, ''[[Caesar: The Life Story of a Panda-Leopard]]'', at the age of 15, which brought him considerable critical attention.&lt;ref name=kinglrev&gt;{{cite book |title=Patrick O'Brian:A life revealed |last=King |first=Dean |authorlink=Dean King |year=2000 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |location=London |isbn= 0-340-79255-8 |page =50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Barbara Newhall Follett]]'s  ''The House Without Windows'', was accepted and published in 1927 when she was 13 by the [[Alfred A.

For example, though [[Christopher Paolini]]'s ''[[Eragon]]'' (published at age 15), was not a great critical success, but its popularity among readers placed it on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Children's Books Best Seller list]] for 121 weeks.&lt;ref name="bestchildren1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/books/bestseller/0106bestchildren.html |title=New York Times Best Seller List|date=2008-01-06|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-time novelists of any age often find themselves unable to get works published, because of a number of reasons reflecting the inexperience of the author and the economic realities of publishers. Often authors must find advocates in the publishing industry, usually [[literary agents]], to successfully publish their [[debut novel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2013/10/08/224084404/first-novels-the-romance-of-agents| title =First Novels: The Romance Of Agents| first =Martha| last = Woodroof| publisher = NPR| work = Monkey See|date = October 8, 2013| accessdate = October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes new novelists will [[self-publish]], because publishing houses will not risk the capital needed to market books by an unknown author to the public.&lt;ref name = independent&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/the-big-question-what-should-you-do-if-you-want-to-get-your-first-novel-published-768098.html |title=The Big Question: What should you do if you want to get your first novel published? - Features, Books |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2008-01-04 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kapur |first=Niraj |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/jan/26/howtosellyourfirstnovel |title=How to sell your debut novel &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=The Guardian |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the difficulty of successfully writing and publishing first novels, especially at a young age, there are a number of awards for young and first time novelists to highlight exceptional works from new and/or young authors (for examples see [[:Category:Literary awards honouring young writers]] and [[:Category:First book awards]]).

===Income===
[[File:James Patterson.jpg|thumb|Novelist [[James Patterson]], one of the most monetarily successful contemporary novelists, who made $70 million in 2010]]
In contemporary British and American publishing markets, most authors receive only a small monetary advance before publication of their debut novel; in the rare exceptions when a large print run and high volume of sales are anticipated, the advance can be larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kellaway, Kate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/25/fiction.features7 | title=Kate Kellaway: That difficult first novel &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; |work=[[The Observer]] | date=25 March 2007 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once an author has established themselves in print, some authors can make steady income as long as they remain productive as writers. Additionally, many novelists, even published ones, will take on outside work, such as [[Creative writing#Creative writing in academia|teaching creative writing in academic institutions]], or leave novel writing as a secondary hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.themillions.com/2009/10/working-the-double-shift.html| title = Working the Double Shift| first = Emily | last = St. John Mandel| date = October 6, 2009| accessdate = February 15, 2014|work = The Millions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Wayne&gt;{{Cite web | title = The agony of the male novelist |first = Teddy |last = Wayne |date = Jan 18, 2012 &lt;!-- 07:00 PM CST --&gt;  | accessdate = 2014-02-19 | url = http://www.salon.com/2012/01/19/the_agony_of_the_male_novelist/ |journal = Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few novelist become literary celebrities or become very wealthy from sale of their novels alone. Often those authors who are wealthy and successful will produce extremely popular genre fiction. Examples include authors like [[James Patterson]], who was the highest paid author in 2010, making 70 million dollars, topping both other novelists and authors of non-fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Forbes| url = https://www.forbes.com/2010/08/19/patterson-meyer-king-business-media-highest-paid-authors.html| title = The Highest-Paid Authors| first = Dirk| last = Smillie| date = 2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous literary millionaires include popular successes like [[J.

}}
The personal experiences of the novelist will often shape what they write and how readers and critics will interpret their novels. Literary reception has long relied on practices of reading literature through [[biographical criticism]], in which the author's life is presumed to have influence on the topical and thematic concerns of works.&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Criticism", ''Writing essays about literature: a guide and style sheet'' (2004), Kelley Griffith, University of North Carolina at Greensborough, Wadsworth Publishing Company , pages 177-178, 400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25111810 Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism]" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; Some veins of criticism use this information about the novelist to derive an understanding of the [[Authorial intent|novelist's intentions]] within his work. However, postmodern literary critics often denounce such an approach; the most notable of these critiques comes from [[Roland Barthes]] who argues in his essay "[[Death of the Author]]" that the author no longer should dictate the reception and meaning derived from their work.

Other, theoretical approaches to [[literary criticism]] attempt to explore the author's unintentional influence over their work; methods like [[psychoanalytic theory]] or [[cultural studies]], presume that the work produced by a novelist represents [[Identity (social science)|fundamental parts of the author's identity]]. [[Milan Kundera]] describes the tensions between the novelist's own identity and the work that the author produces in his essay in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' titled "What is a novelist?"; he says that the novelist's "honesty is bound to the vile stake of his megalomania [...]The work is not simply everything a novelist writes-notebooks, diaries, articles. It is the end result of long labor on an aesthetic project[...]The novelist is the sole master of his work. He is his work."&lt;ref name = Kundera&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kundera| first = Milan| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/09/what-is-a-novelist|title = What is a Novelist? |date = October 9, 2006| accessdate = January 8, 2014|journal = [[The New Yorker]] (Life and Letters section) - subscriber only}}&lt;/ref&gt; The close intimacy of identity with the novelist's work ensures that particular elements, whether for class, gender, sexuality, nationality, race, or place-based identity, will influence the reception of their work.

===Socio-economic class===
{{further|Social novel|Proletarian literature}}

Historically, because of the amount of leisure time and education required to write novels, most novelists have come from the upper or the educated middle classes. However, working men and women began publishing novels in the twentieth century. This includes in Britain [[Walter Greenwood]]'s ''[[Love on the Dole]]'' (1933), from America [[B. Traven]]'s, ''[[The Death Ship]]'' (1926) and [[Agnes Smedley]], ''[[Daughter of Earth]]'' (1929) and from the Soviet Union [[Nikolay Ostrovsky]]'s ''[[How the Steel Was Tempered]]'' (1932). Later, in 1950s Britain, came a group of writers known as the "[[Angry young men]]," which included the novelists [[Alan Sillitoe]] and [[Kingsley Amis]], who came from the working class and who wrote about [[working class culture]].&lt;ref name=nytimesobit&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/books/26sillitoe.html|title=Alan Sillitoe, 'Angry' British Author, Dies at 82|accessdate=5 June 2013|date=26 April 2010|author=Bruce Weber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/20807/Sir-Kingsley-Amis| work = Encyclopædia Britannica Online| title =Sir Kingsley Amis| accessdate = 5 Feb 2014| date=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some novelists deliberately write for a working class audience for political ends, profiling "the working classes and working-class life; perhaps with the intention of making propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon; ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Criticism''. (London: Penguin Books, 1999) p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; Such literature, sometimes called [[proletarian literature]], maybe associated with the political agendas of the [[Communist party]] or left wing sympathizers, and seen as a "device of revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica."Novel." Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421071/novel&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British tradition of working class literature, unlike the Russian and American, was not especially inspired by the Communist Party, but had its roots in the [[Chartist movement]], and [[socialism]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hayward, ''Working-Class Fiction: from Chartism to ''Trainspotting''. (London: Northcote House, 1997), pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===National or place-based identity===
{{see also|National literature}}
Novelists are often classified by their national affiliation, suggesting that novels take on a particular character based on the national identity of the authors. In some literature, national identity shapes the self-definition of many novelists. For example, in [[American literature]], many novelists set out to create the "[[Great American Novel]]", or a novel that defines the American experience in their time. Other novelists engage politically or socially with the identity of other members of their nationality, and thus help define that national identity. For instance, critic Nicola Minott-Ahl describes Victor Hugo's ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|Notre-Dame de Paris]]'' directly helping in the creation of French political and social identity in mid-nineteenth century France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Minott-Ahl| first = Nicola| title =Nation/Building: Hugo’s ''Notre-Dame de Paris''; and the Novelist as Post-Revolutionary Historian|journal = Partial Answers: Journal of Literature and the History of Ideas | volume = 10| number = 2 | year = 2012 | pages = 251–271| doi = 10.1353/pan.2012.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some novelists become intimately linked with a particular place or geographic region and therefore receive a [[Place identity|place-based identity]]. In his discussion of the history of the association of particular novelists with place in [[British literature]], critic D. C. D. Pocock, described the sense of place not developing in that canon until a century after the novel form first solidified at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/622292 | issn = 0020-2754 | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 337–347 | last = Pocock | first = D. C. D. | title = Place and the Novelist | journal = Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers | date = 1981-01-01 | jstor = 622292 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often such [[British regional literature]] captures the social and local  character of a particular region in Britain, focussing on specific features, such as dialect, customs, history, and landscape (also called [[British regional literature|local colour]]): "Such a locale is likely to be rural and/or provincial."&lt;ref&gt;J.A Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984, p.560.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hardy]]'s (1840-1928) novels can be described as regional because of the way he makes use of these elements in relation to a part of the West of England, that he names [[Wessex]]. Other British writers that have been characterized as regional novelists, are the [[Brontë sisters]], and writers like [[Mary Webb]] (1881-1927), [[Margiad Evans]] (1909–58) and [[Geraint Goodwin]] (1903–42), who are associate with the [[Welsh border]] region. [[George Eliot]] (1801–86) on the other hand is particularly associated with the rural English Midlands, whereas [[Arnold Bennett]] (1867–1931) is the novelist of the [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]] in [[Staffordshire]], or the "[[Five Towns]]", (actually six) that now make-up [[Stoke-on-Trent]]. Similarly, novelist and poet [[Walter Scott]]'s (1771-1832) contribution in creating a unified identity for [[Scotland]] and were some of the most popular in all of Europe during the subsequent century. Scott's novels were influential in recreating a Scottish identity that the upper-class British society could embrace.

In American fiction, the concept of [[American literary regionalism]] ensures that many genres of novel associated with particular regions often define the reception of the novelists. For example, in writing [[Western novels]], [[Zane Grey]] has been described as a "place-defining novelist", credited for defining the western frontier in America consciousness at the beginning of the 20th century while becoming linked as an individual to his depiction of that space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| jstor=216063| title = Zane Grey and Images of the American West| first =Kevin S.| last = Blake| journal =Geographical Review| volume = 85| number = 2| date =April 1995| pages = 202–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, novelist such as [[Mark Twain]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Eudora Welty]], and [[Flannery O'Connor]] are often describe as writing within a particular tradition of [[Southern literature]], in which subject matter relevant to the South is associated with their own identities as authors. For example, William Faulkner set many of his short stories and novels in [[Yoknapatawpha County]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949/faulkner-bio.html The Nobel Prize in Literature 1949: Biography] ''Nobelprize.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on, and nearly geographically identical to, Lafayette County, of which his hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Margaret Drabble. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996, p.346.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the geographical component of Southern literature, certain themes have appeared because of the similar histories of the Southern states in regard to [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], the [[American Civil War]], and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The [[conservative]] culture in the South has also produced a strong focus by novelists from there on the significance of family, religion, community, the use of the [[Southern American English|Southern dialect]], along with a strong sense of place.&lt;ref&gt;
Kate Cochran, review of ''Remapping Southern Literature: Contemporary Southern Writers and the West'' by Robert H. Brinkmeyer. ''College Literature'' Vol. 29, No. 2 (Spring, 2002), pp. 169-171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southern United States|The South]]'s troubled history with [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] issues has also continually concerned its novelists.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Hobson. ''But Now I See: The White Southern Racial Conversion Narrative'', Louisiana State University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Latin America]] a literary movement called [[Criollismo]] or costumbrismo was active from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, which is considered equivalent to American literary regionalism. It used a realist style to portray the scenes, language, customs and manners of the country the writer was from, especially the lower and peasant classes, ''criollismo'' led to an original literature based on the continent's natural elements, mostly epic and foundational. It was strongly influenced by the wars of independence from [[Spain]] and also denotes how each country in its own way defines ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'', which in [[Latin America]] refers to locally-born people of Spanish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/index.asp?id_ut=elcriollismo  Criollismo] www.memoriachilena.cl Dirección de Bibliotecas, Archivos y Museos Copyright 2013© MEMORIA CHILENA ®.

===Gender and sexuality===
{{further|Feminist literary criticism|Women's writing in English}}
Novelists often will be assessed in contemporary criticism based on their gender or treatment of gender. Largely, this has to do with the dominance of men in the publishing situation. [[Literary criticism]], especially since the rise of [[feminist theory]], pays attention to how women, historically, have experienced a very different set of writing expectations based on their gender; for example, the editors of ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'' point out: "Their texts emerge from and intervene in conditions usually very different from those which produced most writing by men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editors = Blain, Virginia, Isobel Grundy, and Patricia Clements, | title = The Feminist Companion to Literature in English| location = New Haven and London| publisher = Yale University Press| date = 1990| pages = viii-ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a question of the subject matter or political stance of a particular author, but of her [[gender]]: her position as a woman within the literary marketplace. However,  the publishing market's orientation to favor the primary reading audience of women may increasingly skew the market towards female novelists; for this reason, novelist [[Teddy Wayne]] argued in a 2012 ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' article titled "The agony of the male novelist" that midlist male novelists are less likely to find success than midlist female novelist, even though men tend to dominate "literary fiction" spaces.&lt;ref name = Wayne/&gt;

The position of women in the literary marketplace can change public conversation about novelists and their place within popular culture, leading to debates over sexism. For example, in 2013, American female novelist [[Amanda Filipacchi]] wrote a New York Times editorial challenging Wikipedia's categorization of American female novelists [[:Category:American women novelists|within a distinct category]], which precipitated a significant amount of press coverage describing  that Wikipedia's approach to categorization as sexism. For her, the public representation of women novelists within another category marginalizes and defines women novelists like herself outside of a field of "American novelists" dominated by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.npr.org/2013/04/29/179850435/what-s-in-a-category-women-novelists-spark-wiki-controversy | title = What's In A Category? 'Women Novelists' Sparks Wiki-Controversy| first = Lynn| last = Neary| date = April 29, 2013| publisher = NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other commentators, discussing the controversy also note that by removing such categories as "Women novelist" or "Lesbian writer" from the description of gendered or sexual minorities, the discover-ability of those authors plummet for other people who share that identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Is Wikipedia's "American Women Novelists" Category Horribly Sexist? Some people seem to thinks so| author = S.E. Smith| publisher = XO Jane| date = April 26, 2013 | accessdate = February 8, 2013|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/in-support-of-an-american-women-novelists-category-on-wikipedia&amp;rct=j&amp;frm=1&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=ZVbTVJTUFI-B8QWz_4L4BQ&amp;ved=0CBQQFjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFpC7aeGtKuSJak2SAYytNeIIvlFw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, because of the conversations brought by feminism, examinations of masculine subjects and an author's performance of "maleness" are prominent in critical studies of novels. For example, some academics studying [[Victorian fiction]] spend considerable time examining how masculinity shapes and effects the works, because of its prominence within fiction from the Victorian period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Andrew | last = Dowling| title = Manliness and the Male Novelist in Victorian Literature| publisher =Ashgate Press| year = 2001|isbn = 9780754603801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of novelists by genre}}
Some novelists are categorized by the primary genres of production, sometimes marginalizing the works by authors within the marketplace.
----&gt;

==Genre==
{{further|literary merit|literary fiction|genre fiction}}
Traditionally, the publishing industry has distinguished between "[[literary fiction]]", works lauded as achieving greater [[literary merit]], and "[[genre fiction]]", novels written within the expectations of genres and published as consumer products.&lt;ref name = KWright/&gt; Thus, many novelists become slotted as writers of one or the other.&lt;ref name = KWright/&gt; Novelist [[Kim Wright]], however, notes that both publishers and traditional literary novelist are turning towards genre fiction because of their potential for financial success and their increasingly positive reception amongst critics.&lt;ref name =KWright/&gt; Wright gives examples of authors like [[Justin Cronin]], [[Tom Perrotta]] and [[Colson Whitehead]] all making that transition.&lt;ref name = KWright/&gt;

However, publishing genre novels does not always allow novelist to continue writing outside the genre or within their own interests. In describing the place within the industry, novelist [[Kim Wright]] says that many authors, especially authors who usually write literary fiction, worry about "the danger that genre is a cul-de-sac" where publishers will only publish similar genre fiction from that author because of reader expectations,"and that once a writer turns into it, he’ll never get out."&lt;ref name =KWright&gt;{{cite news| title = Why Are So Many Literary Writers Shifting into Genre?| first = Kim| last = Wright|  work = The Millions| url = http://www.themillions.com/2011/09/why-are-so-many-literary-writers-shifting-into-genre.html| date =September 2, 2011|accessdate = February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, very few authors start in genre fiction and move to more "literary" publications; Wright describes novelists like [[Stephen King]] as the exception rather than the norm.&lt;ref name = KWright/&gt; Other critics and writers defending the merits of genre fiction often point towards King as an example of bridging the gap between popular genres and literary merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Erik|title=Stephen King: You can be popular and good |url = http://www.salon.com/2012/07/06/stephen_king_you_can_be_popular_and_good/ |work=Salon | accessdate = 11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=A Defense of Stephen King, Master of the Decisive Moment |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/a-defense-of-stephen-king-master-of-the-decisive-moment/260187/ |work=The Atlantic|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role and objective==
{{see also|Art manifesto}}
Both literary critics and novelists question what role novelists play in society and within art. For example,  [[Eudora Welty]] writing in 1965 for  in her essay "Must the Novelist Crusade?" draws a distinction between novelists who report reality by "taking life as it already exists, not to report it, but to make an object, toward the end that the finished work might contain this life inside it, and offer it to the reader" and journalists, whose role is to act as "crusaders" advocating for particular positions, and using their craft as a political tool.&lt;ref name = PBS&gt;{{cite web| title = Must the Novelist Crusade?| publisher = PBS | first =Eudora |last = Welty| year =1965| accessdate = January 7, 2014| origyear = 1965| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/americancollection/ponder/tg_crusade.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, writing in the 1950s, [[Ralph Ellison]] in his essay "Society, Morality, and the Novel", sees the novelist as needing to "re-create reality in the forms which his personal vision assumes as it plays and struggles with the vivid illusory "eidetic-like" imagery left in the mind's eye by the process of social change."&lt;ref name = Ellison/&gt; However, Ellison also describes novelists of the [[Lost Generation]], like [[Ernest Hemingway]], not taking full advantage of the moral weight and influence available to novelists, pointing to Mark Twain and Herman Melville as better examples.&lt;ref name = Ellison&gt;{{cite book| first = Ralph| last = Ellison|chapter = Society, Morality and the Novel"| title = The Collected Essays of Ralph Ellison | editor =John F. Callahan|origyear = 1957| year = 2003| publisher = The Modern Library| pages = 698–729}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of such essays, such as literary critic [[Frank Norris]]'s "Responsibilities of a Novelist", highlight such moral and ethical justifications for their approach to both writing novels and criticizing them.&lt;ref name =RespONovelist&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=7569| last = Davies| first = Jude| title = The Responsibilities of the Novelist |work= The Literary Encyclopedia| date = 20 October 2001| accessdate = 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When defining her description of the role of the modernist novelist in the essay "[[Modern Fiction (essay)|Modern Fiction]]", [[Virginia Woolf]] argues for a representation of life not interested in the exhaustive specific details represented in [[Literary realism|realism]] in favor of representing a "myriad of impressions" created in experience life.&lt;ref name = Woolf/&gt; Her definition made in this essay, and developed in others, helped define the literary movement of [[modernist literature]]. She argues that the novelist should represent "not a series of gig-lamps symmetrically arranged; [rather] life is luminous halo, a semitransparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of the conscious to the end. Is it not the task of the novelist to convey this varying, this unknown and uncircumscribed spirit, whatever aberration or complexity it may display, with as little mixture of the alien and external as possible?"&lt;ref name = Woolf&gt;{{Cite book | last = Woolf | first = Virginia |chapter =  Modern Fiction | title = The Common Reader | format = text | accessdate = 2014-03-26 | date = 2004-06-01 | url = http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91c/| publisher = EBooks @ Adelaide }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orphism''' or '''Orphic Cubism''', a term coined by the French [[poetry|poet]] [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] in 1912, was an offshoot of [[Cubism]] that focused on pure [[abstraction]] and bright colors, influenced by [[Fauvism]], the theoretical writings of [[Paul Signac]], [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]] and the dye chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul|Eugène Chevreul]]. This movement, perceived as key in the transition from Cubism to [[Abstract art]], was pioneered by [[František Kupka]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Sonia Delaunay]], who relaunched the use of color during the monochromatic phase of Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/o/orphism Tate Glossary] retrieved 31 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the term Orphism was elusive when it first appeared and remains to some extent vague.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10142 Museum of Modern Art, New York, Hajo Düchting, From Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:František Kupka - Katedrála - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|240px|upright|[[František Kupka]], ''[[The Cathedral (Katedrála)|Katedrála (The Cathedral)]]'', 1912-13, oil on canvas, 180 x 150 cm, [[Museum Kampa]], [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
The Orphists were rooted in [[Cubism]] but moved toward a pure [[lyrical abstraction]], seeing painting as the bringing together of a sensation of pure colors. More concerned with the expression and significance of sensation, this movement began with recognizable subjects but was rapidly absorbed by increasingly abstract structures. Orphism aimed to dispense with recognizable subject matter and to rely on ''form'' and ''color'' to communicate meaning. The movement also aimed to express the ideals of Simultanism: the existence of an infinitude of interrelated states of being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/s/simultanism Tate glossary] Retrieved December 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The decomposition of spectral light expressed in [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] color theory of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]] played an important role in the formulation of Orphism. [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Albert Gleizes]], and [[Gino Severini]], all knew Henry personally.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Henry, a mathematician, inventor, esthetician, and intimate friend of the Symbolist writers [[Félix Fénéon]] and [[Gustave Kahn]], met [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]], Signac and [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]] during the last Impressionist exhibition in 1886. Henry would take the final step in bringing ''emotional associational theory'' into the world of artistic sensation: something that would influence greatly the Neo-Impressionists. Henry and Seurat were in agreement that the basic elements of art—the line, particle of color, like words—could be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. "Seurat knows well" wrote Fénéton in 1889, "that the line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an assessable abstract value" in addition, of course, to the particles of color, and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim would have a lasting effect on the works produced in the coming years by the likes of Robert Delaunay.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt; Indeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis for their painting in the domain of color. The Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics, and the Orphists would do so with color too.

The Symbolists had used the word ''orphique'' in relation to the Greek myth of [[Orpheus]], who they perceived as the ideal artist. Apollinaire had written a collection of quatrains in 1907 entitled ''Bestiaire ou cortège d’Orphée'' (Paris, 1911), within which Orpheus was symbolized as a poet and artist. For both Apollinaire and the Symbolists who preceded him, Orpheus was associated with [[mysticism]], something that would inspire artistic endeavors. ''The voice of light'' that Apollinaire mentioned in his poems was a metaphor for ''inner experiences''. Though not fully articulated in his poems, ''the voice of light'' is identified as a line that could be colored and become a painting. The Orphic metaphor thus represented the artist’s power to create new structures and color harmonies, in an innovative creative process that combined to form a sensuous experience.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

==Guillaume Apollinaire==

The term Orphism was coined by poet and art critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] in 1912, referring to the works of [[František Kupka]]. During his lecture at the Section d'Or exhibit Apollinaire presented three of Kupka's abstract works as perfect examples of ''pure painting'', as anti-figurative as music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Cubist_Painters.html?id=qYATQ3Rw6qgC&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Cubist Painters (Les Peintres Cubistes: Méditations esthétiques)'', Guillaume Apollinaire, 1913, translation by Peter Read, University of California Press, 25 oct. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques]]'' (1913) Apollinaire described Orphism as "the art of painting new totalities with elements that the artist does not take from visual reality, but creates entirely by himself. [...] An Orphic painter's works should convey an ''untroubled [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] pleasure'', but at the same time a ''meaningful structure and sublime significance''. According to Apollinaire Orphism represented a move towards a completely new art-form, much as music was to literature. Orphic painters cited analogies with music in their titles; for example, Kupka’s ''Amorpha: Fugue in Two Colors'' (1912) and [[Francis Picabia]]’s abstract composition ''Dance at the Source'' (1912) and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]’s ''Über das Geistige in der Kunst'' (1912). Kandinsky's detailed theoretical essays described the correlations between color and sound. Robert Delaunay, also preoccupied with relations between color and music, highlighted the purity and independence of color, and successfully exhibited with the [[Blaue Reiter]] at the invitation of Kandinsky. [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], as they tended towards abstraction, were also included as Orphists in the writings of Apollinaire.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

Apollinaire stayed with the Delaunays during the winter of 1912, becoming close friends and elaborating on many ideas. Apollinaire wrote several texts discussing their work to promote the concept of Orphism. In March 1913 Orphism was exhibited to the public at the Salon des Indépendants. In his review of the Salon published in ''L’Intransigeant'' (25 March 1913), Apollinaire wrote that ‘it combines painters of totally different characters, all of whom have nonetheless achieved a more internalized, more popular and more poetic vision of the universe and of life’. And in ''Montjoie'' (29 March 1913) Apollinaire argued for the abolition of Cubism in favour of Orphism: ‘If Cubism is dead, long live Cubism. The kingdom of Orpheus is at hand!’

The Herbst salon (Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon, Berlin) of 1913, organized by [[Herwarth Walden]] of [[Der Sturm]], exhibited many works by Robert and Sonia Delaunay, [[Jean Metzinger]]’s ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu]]'' (1913, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris), [[Albert Gleizes]]' ''[[Les Joueurs de football]]'' (1912-13, National Gallery of Art), paintings by Picabia, and Léger, along with several Futurist paintings. This exhibition marked a turning-point in Apollinaire’s relation with R. Delaunay (which would cool markedly), following some remarks in an argument with [[Umberto Boccioni]] about the ambiguity of the term ‘simultaneity’.  This would be the last time Apollinaire used the term Orphism in his critical analyses of art; as he turned his attention increasingly towards Picabia and [[Alexander Archipenko]], but most of all towards the Futurists.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

==The Delaunays==
[[Sonia Terk Delaunay]] and [[Robert Delaunay]], a husband and wife duo, were to become the main protagonists of the Orphic movement, Robert Delaunay also studied different styles of painting, such as Abstract Art. In their earlier works, their styles focused on Fauvist colors with various degrees of abstraction; particularly evident in Sonia's ''Finnish Girl'' (1907) and Robert's ''Paysage au disque'' (1906). The former painting relies heavily on bright colors and smooth transitions between forms, while the latter relies on color and mosaic-like brushstrokes painted under the influence of Jean Metzinger, also a Neo-Impressionist (with highly [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] and [[Fauvism|Fauve]] components) at the time.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

Their works became increasingly identifiable by the 'simultaneous' contrasting of colors and the tendency towards non-representation. In Robert's ''Eiffel Tower Series'', the subject is portrayed as if seen from several viewpoints at once; employing the concept of 'mobile perspective' developed by his close friend Metzinger. Soon, instead of using muted tones as the Cubists, he would paint with bold, bright colors juxtaposed one next to the other (a concept derived from [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] color theory). He often portrayed the tower with reds and pinks with cooler colors throughout. The more Robert painted the tower, the more abstract, fragmented and colorful it became.

In 1913 the Delaunays showed their works in the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] and the Herbst Salon, the latter being the first Orphist Salon, which also hosted works by [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]], [[Jean Metzinger|Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes|Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger|Léger]], and [[Futurism|Futurist]] painters. Unlike others associated with Orphism, the Delaunays would return to this style throughout their lives.

==Eugène Chevreul==
[[Image:Transsiberien.jpg|thumb|right|The last section of ''[[La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France]]'', 1913, a collaborative [[Artist's book|artists' book]] by [[Blaise Cendrars]] and [[Sonia Delaunay-Terk]].]]
One of Robert's biggest influences, besides his wife, was the chemist [[Eugène Chevreul]]. Most famous for discovering [[margarine]], Chevreul delved in dye chemistry as well as the aesthetics of [[contrast effect|simultaneous contrast]] of colors. He had three main ideas to his color theories: "when complementary colors are juxtaposed, each appears to be more intense than when seen in isolation" and "if there is a perceptible difference in dark-light value between the two colors, then the darker will appear to be even darker" as well as that "all colors present in the field of vision at the same time mutually modify one another in specific ways". Chevreul influenced many artists because he understood scientifically what many artists expressed instinctively.

==After 1913==
Even after Apollinaire had separated from the Delaunays and Orphism had lost its novelty as a new art form, the Delaunays continued painting in their personal shared style. They may not have always called their work Orphic, but the aesthetics and theories were the same. Robert continued painting while Sonia delved into other media, including fashion, interior and textile design, all within the realm of Orphism.

==Legacy==
Orphism as a movement was short-lived, essentially coming to an end before [[World War I]]. In spite of the use of the term the works categorized as Orphism were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Artists intermittently referred to as Orphists by Apollinaire, such as Léger, Picabia, Duchamp and Picasso, independently created new categories that could hardly be classified as Orphic. The term Orphism most obviously embraced paintings by František Kupka, Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay, if limited to implications imposed by color, light, and the expression of non-representational compositions. Even Robert Delaunay thought this description misrepresented his intentions, though his temporary classification as Orphic had proved successful. The American painters [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] and [[Arthur Burdett Frost]], two of Delaunay’s pupils, strove to create a similar art-form circa 1912. The [[Synchromism|Synchromists]] [[Morgan Russell]] and [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]] wrote their own manifestos in an attempt to distance themselves from the Orphism of Robert Delaunay, but their art at times inevitably appeared Orphic. Essentially a stylistic sub-category of [[Abstract art]] created by Apollinaire, Orphism was an elusive term from which artists included within its scope persistently attempted to detach themselves.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

A '''photograph conservator''' is a professional who examines, documents, researches, and treats [[photographs]], including documenting the structure and condition of art works through written and photographic records, monitoring conditions of works in storage and exhibition and transit environments.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.conservators-converse.org/2015/02/job-posting-conservator-of-photography-modern-and-contemporary-sfmoma-san-francisco-ca/], Job Posting for Conservator of Photography:Modern and Contemporary, SFMOMA. (2015). Retrieved February 28, 2015 from: http://www.conservators-converse.org/2015/02/job-posting-conservator-of-photography-modern-and-contemporary-sfmoma-san-francisco-ca/.&lt;/ref&gt; This person also performs all aspects of the treatment of photographs and related artworks with adherence to the Code of Ethics outlined by the [[American Institute for Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice#.VULP8M7QkqZ|publisher=American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities ==
Responsibilities of a Photograph Conservator of course vary from museum to museum, however there are some critical functions that all conservators must perform in their roles as protectors of cultural heritage. Preventive conservation, examination and documentation, research, and treatment are core functions at the center of every photograph conservators responsibilities.

=== Preventive conservation ===
[[Collections care|Preventive Conservation]] is a rather new specialty in the field and is in response to the need conservators feel for preserving objects post-treatment. As Barbara Appelbaum states, "The fact that conservators feel responsible for preserving object forever is noble, but, practically speaking, unrealistic."&lt;ref name="Conservation Treatment Methodology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Barbara|title=Conservation Treatment Methodology|date=2007|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Burlington, MA|accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preventive conservation shifts the burden of preservation and protection onto measures like environmental controls such as temperature and relative humidity control, control of light levels present, and control of various contaminants. It also includes [[Museum integrated pest management|integrated pest management]] and [[Emergency response (museum)|emergency preparedness]]. All of these steps should be taken for each object before and after treatment, or in some cases in the place of treatment. The Photograph Conservator should be working on preventive conservation each day, as it is one of the most important ways to preserve objects when treatment isn't practical or necessary.

====Environmental controls====
Control of relative humidity and temperature is critical in the preservation of photographs. "Heat can accelerate deterioration and high relative humidity provides the moisture necessary to promote harmful chemical reactions in materials and, with high temperature encourages mold growth and insect activity" according to the Northeast Document Conservation Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=2.1 Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.1-temperature,-relative-humidity,-light,-and-air-quality-basic-guidelines-for-preservation|website=www.nedcc.org|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Fondos archivo.jpg|thumb|A prime example of proper archive storage and of archival friendly boxes.]]
Proper storage can protect photographs from fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature and/or seasonal changes. Photographic prints and negatives are best stored in individual paper or plastic enclosures. Note that paper enclosures must pass the PAT test or [http://naa.gov.au/records-management/agency/preserve/physical-preservation/pat.aspx Photographic Activity Test] in order to be deemed safe for storage of photographic materials.&lt;ref name="Storing Photograph Collections"&gt;{{cite web|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=Northeast Document Conservation Center|publisher=NEDCC|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the photographs are in their individual enclosures they must be boxed in archival quality boxes. Horizontal storage is usually recommended over vertical storage, as is storing photographs of similar size together to avoid abrasions or misplacing the smaller items.&lt;ref name="Storing Photograph Collections"/&gt; Negatives, which includes black and white or color negatives, slides, lantern slides, collodion wet and dry plate negatives, and silver gelatin wet and dry plate negatives should be stored upright and vertically along their longest edge. Padded boxes with dividers are often necessary as you do not want two glass plate negatives to touch each other. When packing the archival quality boxes, make sure to not pack them too heavy and label them accordingly. Scrapbooks and albums provide a particular challenge to conservators because they often contain a variety of components and media. They should not be stored with other archival collections if it can be avoided. Scrapbooks can either be digitally reproduced or if the original is deemed important enough, can be wrapped in archival quality paper or housed in a custom fitted box.&lt;ref name="Storing Photograph Collections"/&gt;

====Emergency preparedness and response====
The [http://www.aam-us.org/ AAM], or American Alliance of Museums, defines an emergency response plan as "a series of written policies and procedures that prevent or minimize damage resulting from disasters (either man made or natural) and help a museum recover."&lt;ref name=AAM&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing a Disaster Preparedness/Emergency Response Plana|url=http://www.aam-us.org/docs/continuum/developing-a-disaster-plan-final.pdf?sfvrsn=2|website=American Alliance of MuseumsA|publisher=AAM|accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The required elements of such a plan are as follows: tailored to the institutions current facilities and specific circumstances, covers all threats/risks relevant to the institution, addresses staff, visitors, structures, and collections, includes evacuation plans for people, specifies how to protect, evacuate or recover collections in the event of a disaster, and delegates responsibility for implementation. A Photography Conservator would have a vital role to play in the emergency response plan at their institution. It would be their responsibility to detail the needs of the photography collection and the ways to recover that collection in case of a disaster.&lt;ref name="AAM"/&gt; It is widely recommended that the staff partake in monthly training to go over the emergency response plan in order to ensure that each staff member, including the photograph conservator, knows their role in case of an emergency.

=== Examination and documentation ===
Examination is defined by the act of looking at something closely and carefully or a close and careful study of something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam Webster Dictionary: examination|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/examination|website=Merriam Webster Dictionary|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be a crucial duty for all conservators, including Photograph Conservators. Barbara Appelbaum explains that "the contrast between the first impression of an object-which is more or less the impression of the ordinary viewer- and the view that a conservator takes during an examination is a significant one."&lt;ref name="Conservation Treatment Methodology"/&gt; The first step of an examination is examination of an object with one's eye with a bright light, sometimes with the help of magnification or other viewing aids like binoculars. Tactile observations are also critical, and in some cases senses of smell and hearing yield useful information as well, as tapping on a glass plate negative for example can help identify significant discontinuities.&lt;ref name="Conservation Treatment Methodology"/&gt;

It can be argued that documentation is the most important task a conservator carries out. Every step of the process must be fully documented by a conservator. The National Park Service recommends that all conservation treatment should be documented in writing. They should also include visual representations such as photographs, drawings, analytical results, spectra, and digital images. The documentation should be kept in hard copy and in digital files appended to the Collections Database System used by the museum.&lt;ref name="Chapter 8: Conservation Treatment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 8: Conservation Treatment|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/mhi/chap8.pdf|website=NPS.gov|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation is important for the following reasons
* Conservation documentation is a written and visual report of the work that is done. It provides the park staff with detailed information on the condition of the object, including how it has been altered, what parts are composed of original material, and what has been added or removed during previous treatments or restorations.
* It serves as a permanent record of the treatment procedures performed and the materials and methods used.
* It spells out the understanding reached between the curatorial staff and the conservator on the treatment, including the extent and type of any stabilization or restoration treatment.
* It provides information that will help future conservators to assess the condition of an object and devise further treatment. 
* It makes it possible to assess the success or failure of treatment methods and materials over a long period of time.
* It may last longer than the object itself and become the only record.&lt;ref name="Chapter 8: Conservation Treatment"/&gt;

=== Research ===
Photograph conservators must do thorough research before any treatment can take place. This is often the legacy that conservators leave behind, their documentation, research, and treatment. New techniques and less harsh treatments are being discovered all the time by professionals in the field. The Getty Conservation Institute is currently researching methods for characterization of photographs and photographic material. The study is explained as, "both qualitative and quantitative analysis of photographs and photographic material in order to facilitate identification of photographic processes, and to develop a quantitative methodology for analysis of photographic material. The analytical techniques currently being used in this research are:
* X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF)
* Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR)
* Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
* inductively coupled plasmas mass spectrometry (ICP–MS)
* environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM)
* neutron activation analysis (NAA)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research on the Conservation of Photographs|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/photocon/photocon_component2.html|website=The Getty Conservation Institute|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment ===
Treatment is defined by the American Institute for Conservation as, "the deliberate alteration of the chemical and/or physical aspects of cultural property, aimed primarily at prolonging its existence. Treatment may consist of stabilization and/or restoration." Stabilization is meant to maintain the integrity of cultural property and minimize deterioration and restoration is meant to return cultural property to a known or assumed state, often through addition of non original material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of Conservation Terminology|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/related-organizations/definitions#.VT7eNihELww|website=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treating photographs is not all about the aesthetic of the image, it also has to do with the photographs long term survival. Of course a photographs conservator would want the image to look as pleasing as possible, but that is not the primary motive behind conservation treatment. [[Photograph preservation]] is concerned with treating original photographic material and not the digital copy of that image, although making reproductions of images digitally is a treatment plan used by many conservators. This allows for the image and information that image contains to live on and be researched without the original being damaged further. However this is not a replacement for the original photograph as digital scans and copies can easily become obsolete.

A successful treatment was carried out on a broken glass plate interpositive of Abraham Lincoln taken in 1860, at the George Eastman House. This treatment included using materials that stabilized the glass and emulsion and involved research in innovative new methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastman House displays Abraham Lincoln’s favorite image, featuring museum’s conservation of shattered glass plate|url=http://www.eastmanhouse.org/tools/pressroom/view.php?title=lincoln-2009|website=George Eastman HouseA|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skills and knowledge ==
Photograph conservators need to possess a vast knowledge of photographic processes and deterioration of those materials. Conservators should have experience in: 
* examination procedures to determine the materials, method of manufacture, and properties of objects or structures and the causes and extent of deterioration or alteration
* scientific analysis and research to identify historic and artistic methods and materials of fabrication, and to evaluate the efficacy and appropriateness of materials and procedures of conservation
* documentation procedures to record the condition of an object or site at a specific time, or before, during, and after treatment, and to outline treatment methods and materials in detail
* treatment, including interventive procedures, as well as passive measures to stabilize an artifact or retard its deterioration
* restoration to bring a deteriorated or damaged object or structure closer to a previous or assumed appearance or function
* advising on procedures for the safe exhibition and travel of cultural materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Careers in Conservation|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/publications-resources/careers-in-conservation/become-a-conservator#.VT7kcChELww|website=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Paths to becoming a conservator vary but usually include, a graduate degree in conservation or historic preservation with a certificate in or diploma in conservation as well as post graduate fellowships. Study of a foreign language, formal course work in drawing, painting, photography etc., professional experience, and a personal interview and portfolio are sometimes required. A few PhD programs do exist for those that wish to further their studies of conservation sciences. Some programs in North America include:

A '''protocol implementation conformance statement''' or, most commonly, '''PICS''' is a structured document which asserts which specific requirements are met by a given implementation of a [[communications protocol|protocol]] [[Technical standard|standard]].  It is often completed as a record of formal protocol [[conformance testing|conformance test]] results, and some [[automated testing]] systems machine-author a PICS as output.  A potential buyer or user of the implementation can consult the PICS to determine if it meets their requirements.

PICS may be used with [[TTCN-3]].

{{commons category}}
'''Reinier Nooms''' (c. 1623 &amp;ndash; 1664), also known as '''Zeeman''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "sailor"), was a maritime painter known for his highly detailed paintings and [[etching]]s of ships.

Nooms was probably born and died in [[Amsterdam]].  He started painting and drawing in his later years, following a rough, drunken life as a sailor. It is not known how he acquired his skill as an artist. His knowledge of ships is evident from his work: ships and foreign locations are depicted with high accuracy and in great detail, and served as an example to other artists of how to depict ships.

A widely traveled artist, Nooms visited [[Paris]], [[Venice]] and possibly [[Berlin]], and also journeyed along the coast of [[North Africa]].

A favourite subject of his paintings were the Dutch victories in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]. For instance, he painted the ''Amalia'', the flagship of admiral [[Maarten Tromp]], before the [[Battle of the Downs]] in 1639. This painting now hangs in the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[Greenwich]], UK. His painting of the [[Battle of Leghorn]] in 1653 is in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]] in [[Amsterdam]].

In the 1650s, Nooms made a series of etchings of ships and topographical views characterized by a high degree of detail and precision. These etchings served as an example to many artists. The 19th century French etcher [[Charles Méryon]] was highly influenced by Nooms, whose etchings of [[Paris]] cityscapes inspired [[Charles Méryon|Méryon]] to his own series of Paris etchings. [[Charles Méryon|Méryon]] even dedicated some of this work to Nooms in poetic form.

One of Nooms' final works, from 1664, shows a view of the [[Amsterdam]] harbour, with the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] bay and the naval depot's Lands Zeemagazijn, now the home of the [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum]] (Netherlands Maritime Museum). Appropriately, this work now hangs in the Netherlands Maritime Museum.

The book of [[Psalms]], included in the Jewish and Christian scriptures, and said to have been written largely by David, is one of the earliest collections of sacred music, and still plays a role in the liturgies of the two religions.]]

'''Religious music''' (also '''sacred music''') is music performed or composed for [[religion|religious]] use or through religious influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/genre/religious-ma0000004431|title=Religious Music Genre Overview {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Ritual music''' is music, sacred or not, performed or composed for or as [[ritual]].

==Christian music==
{{main|Church music|Christian music}}
According to some scholars, the earliest music in the Christian Church came from Jewish worship music, with some additional [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]] influence.{{sfn|Conomos|2003}} It is believed that this music lay somewhere between singing and speaking, or speaking with an understood ritual cadence.&lt;ref&gt;Foley 2008,{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is another opinion that the roots of early Christian music come from the early ascetic monastic orders.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin and Gibbs 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islamic Music ==
Islamic "songs" come in the form of prayers (In Arabic, prayer is ''Salah)'' that occur 5 times a day. These prayers are conducted by facing Mecca and having both knees to the ground bowing and reciting these prayers and usually are recitations of the Islamic Holy word the Quran.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A. Rasheid|first=Omar|date=|title=Muslim Prayer and Public Spheres: An Interpretation of the Quranic Verse 29:45|url=|journal=Interpretation: A Journal of Bible and Theology|volume=68|pages=41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These prayers occur of the day and connect the Muslim people through a series of melodic prayers that often become amplified through the city. In Islam the implication of prayer and in this case the ''Salah'' is for ritual since it is believed to be the direct word of God that shall be performed as a collective, as well as individually.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== History of Islam Prayer ====
"What shall I say of their prayer? For they pray with such concentration and devotion that I was astonished when I was able to see it personally and observe it with my own eyes.” (Riccold De Monte in the year 1228).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The origin of the art of prayer in all Abrahamic religions is to glorify God and the same goes for Islam. The ''Al Salat'' is the most widely used word to mean institutionalized prayer and is one of the oldest forms of prayer in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khalee|first=Mohammed|date=1999|title=The Foundation of Muslim Prayer|url=|journal=Medieval Encounters|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Islamic prayer, traditions, and ideals had influence from these Abrahamic religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hienz|first=Justin|date=August 2008|title=SIXTH AND SEVENTH CENTURY RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON THE SALĀT RITUAL|url=|journal=THE ORIGINS OF MUSLIMS PRAYER|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of origination of Salah came from the Muslim prophet Muhammad (the Messenger of God) in a cave as he began to worship Allah (God). It is believed that through this act of worship Mohammad interacted with the Abrahamic prophet Moses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Now these "prayers" come in the form of recitations of the Quran and poems written by prophets of the faith.

==== The Spread of Islamic Prayer ====
Besides the spread of Islam through Arabia by prophets it spread through trade routes like the Silk Road and through conflict of war. Through the Silk road traders and members of the early Muslim faith were able to go to countries such as China and create mosques around 627 C. E.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.islamreligion.com/articles/11321/islam-enters-far-east/|title=Islam Enters the Far East - The Religion of Islam|last=waheed|website=www.islamreligion.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As men from the Middle East came to China they would get married to these Asian women, which led to a spreading of the faith and traditions of Islam in multiplicities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Crusades in the 9th and 10th century encouraged the spread of Islam through the invasions of Latin Christian soldiers and Muslim soldiers into each other's land. The whole conflict began on the premises of a Holy Land and which group of people owned these lands that led to these foes invading their respective lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/news/why-muslims-see-the-crusades-so-differently-from-christians|title=Why Muslims See the Crusades So Differently from Christians|work=HISTORY|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the religion itself spread so did its implications of ritual, such as prayer.

The earliest synagogal music was based on the same system as that in the [[Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]]. According to the [[Talmud]], [[Joshua ben Hananiah]], who had served in the sanctuary [[Levite|Levitical]] choir, told how the choristers went to the synagogue from the orchestra by the [[altar]] (Talmud, Suk. 53a), and so participated in both services.

[[Image:Djelfa, 1.jpg|thumb|[[Neolithic]] art in Djelfa.]]
The rock art of the [[Djelfa]] region in the [[Ouled Naïl Range]] ([[Algeria]]) consists of prehistoric cave paintings and petroglyphs dating from the [[Neolithic]] age which have been recognized since 1914. Following the [[Saharan rock art|Saharan]] [[Atlas Mountains]] they follow on from those, to the west, of [[Rock art of south Oran (Algeria)|south Oran]] (the regions of [[Rock art of Figuig|Figuig]], [[Ain Sefra]], [[El Bayadh]], [[Mechta-Afalou|Afalou]] and Tiaret), to which they are related. Comparable [[rock art|engravings]] have also been described further to the east, in the [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine (Algeria)]] region.

== Localities and descriptions ==
Some of the engravings of the Djelfa region seem to have been known since the 1850s (El Idrissia). Among the best-known, those of [[Zaccar]] were discovered in 1907, and Flamand described in 1914 the station of Daïet es Stel. In the mid-1960s the active Djelfa Council of Initiatives undertook to record engravings and paintings, and Father F. de Villaret, who accompanied the visitors, thus made known works from some twenty new stations, notably those of Oued el Hesbaïa and [[Aïn Naga]]. In total more than 1,162 engravings have been discovered in the region.

[[Henri Lhote]] referred to these engravings in his major work, ''Les Gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais'', which he published in 1970 in the series of the ''Mémoires du Centre de recherches anthropologiques préhistoriques et ethnographiques'' (CRAPE).&lt;ref&gt;Edited at Algiers by Mouloud Mammeri (Arts et Métiers graphiques, Paris, 210 pages and photographic reproductions).&lt;/ref&gt; For him they could not "be separated archaeologically from those of south Oran, because they show with some variations the same style, the same technical formulae, the same patinations and the same fauna"(p.&amp;nbsp;194). It may therefore be possible to analyse them making use of the hypotheses and the classification which he developed. The engravings of the Djelfa region appeared to him like "foreign works, which are a copying (always of inferior quality) from those of south [[Oran]]", (p.&amp;nbsp;193), a region which for the author was "the principal centre of the rock art of the pre-Saharan regions." Some belong to the earliest stage of the large-scale Hartebeest school, like "The Apollo of Ouled Naïl", others are more recent or indeed (stylistically) more decadent.

Regretting "the misreading of the importance of the south Algerian rock art" in the work of Lhote, P. Huard and L. Allard published in 1976 in ''Lybica'' (CRAPE, Algiers) an important study on ''Les figurations rupestres de la région de Djelfa, Sud Algérois.'' The authors therein recorded forty-three numbered sites or stations which are with some exceptions located near the interior or at the edges of a triangle formed on the north by the town of Djelfa, on the south-west by the village of [[Sidi Makhlouf]] and on the south-east by the town of [[Messaad]].

[[Image:Gravures préhistoriques, Djelfa, carte.jpg|550px|thumb|left]]

Around the road from Djelfa to Laghouat (just south of Sidi Makhlouf) twenty-three stations are shown: no 28 (Zaccar), 38 (Ishak), 39 (Oued el Youhi), 40 (Guelt el Bidha), 30 (Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur), 31 (Sreissir), 32 (Ben Hallouane), 27 (El Gour), 26 (Ben Hadid), 25 (Kheneg Hilal), 24 (Theniet bou Mediouna II), 23 (Theniet bou Mediouna I), 22 (Theniet el Mzab), 21 (Daïet Geklil), 16 (Oued Mergueb), 20 (Djebel Doum), 19 (Safiet el Baroud), 18 (Morhoma), 33 (Oued Remeila), 34 (Rocher des Pigeons "Pigeon Rock"), 41 (Oued Cheguieg), 17 (Oued el Hesbaïa), 42 (Ntsila). Three stations are in addition mentioned to the east of Djelfa: no 1 (Feidjet Elleben), 2 (Sidi Abdallah ben Ahmed), 3 (Argoub Ezzemla). Three other sites are found to the west: n° 37 (Chouchet Esnober), 36 (Koreiker), 35 (El Idrissia).

Around the road from Djelfa to Messaad (by Moudjbara) twelve stations follow roughly from north to south: no 29 (Saouiet), 4 (Aïn Mouilha), 5 (Daïet es Stel), 6 (Hadjra Mokhotma north), 7 (Hadjara Mokhotma south), 10 (Safiet Bou Khenan), 9 (Station de l'Autruche "Ostrich"), 8 (Daïet el Hamra), 11 (Bou Sekkin), 12 (Aïn Naga), 13(Atef el Ghorab), 14 (Oued Tamdit). To the east of Messad two final stations are named: no 43 (Oued el Bouir) and 15 (Amoura).

The engravings are located near dwelling sites, shown by the presence of worked flints and debitage, "stratified in various levels or at the foot of cliffs of reddish sandstone, the [[patina]] of which can become nearly black, which run along the djebels or stand at the edges of the oueds." They are "by-and-large arranged in little separate groups", the monumental friezes or very richly decorated murals like those of Oued el Hesbaïa or [[Aïn Naga]] being "exceptions".

Recognizing that the engravings of the Djelfa region are "similar to those of south Oran by subject and technique", P. Huard and L. Allard judge however that they have a rich cultural content of their own which, notably, show the ancient buffalo as bearers of attributes of the heads, and the fact that almost all the ovines (sheep) are endowed with classic spheroids or horns enclosed in a ring, which are a later stylization of the motif"(p.&amp;nbsp;67). According to these authors "The introduction in the most ancient stage of the south-Oranian of rams with [[spheroid]]s can hardly tally with the south-Algerian material, where the most accomplished depictions are often associated with men in developed costume, whereas others, associated with cattle, are clearly of a pastoral epoch" (p.&amp;nbsp;71).

What is more "The 'bovidian' stage, which would come only in the fourth place in the sequence of the south-Oranian, where it shows a 'decadent' character, is much more developed in the south [[Algeria]]n." Deducing that these evidences "show that in the two sectors, its origin must certainly be more ancient", Huard and Allard prefer to speak "of a pastoral stage of long duration, with cows and sheep"(p.&amp;nbsp;71).

== The "Hunters" Stage ==

[[Image:Djelfa, 2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Oued el Hesbaïa.]]

In the stage of Hunters the authors gather the depictions of the large wild fauna: ancient [[African Buffalo|buffalo]] (or Hartebeest), elephants, rhinoceros, lions, ostriches and human figures.

Of the seventeen buffalo recorded in the region, twelve belong to the large, naturalistic art and are similar to those of the south-Oranian. They are found at Oued el Hesbaïa (frieze of three buffalo, including one of more than two meters), Aïn Naga (two buffalo in procession), at Station de l'Autruche (buffalo of 1.50 meters surmounted by a hollowed disc), Djebel Doum (buffalo of 2.35 meters of which the left horn supports a "lengthened semi-circular attribute"), Safiet el Baroud, Hadjra Mokhotma north (buffalo of 2.63 meters, where a human figure seems to touch the horns), Kheneg Hilal (buffalo of 1.20 m.) and Ben Hallouane.

Large, medium or small, the twenty-two elephants seem to belong to various ages. The largest (1 to 2 m), naturalistic in style, are found at Aïn Naga, Theniet bou Mediouna I, Oued Remeilia, Aïn Mouilha, Oued el Hesbaïa (where the "[[elephant]] panel", an accumulation of depictions superimposed through the centuries, shows six), Safiet Bou Khenan, [[Zaccar]], Feidjet Elleben and Bou Sekkin.

Seven rhinoceros, of lesser quality and often decadent in style, are recorded at five stations, at Oued Remeila (the oldest), Feidjet Elleben, Bou Sekkin, Aïn Naga, and Oued el Hesbaïa.

Nine representations of Hartebeest antelopes (Bubalis alcelaphus boselaphus) are in naturalistic style. The most famous is that of Zaccar, devoured by a lion (1.50 m in length). A similar scene is found at Daïet el Hamra. At Hadjra Mokhotma north, the animal is confined within a circular trap. Other antelope have been engraved at Safiet el Baroud, Theniet el Mzab and Feidjet Elleben. Otherwise there are numerous antelope-type creatures, often much stylized and in small-scale, like those of Sidi Abdallah ben Ahmed and Safiet bou Khenan, related to the style called ''the Tazina School'', found in south-[[Oran]].

Eighteen in number, the lions represented can be classed into three groups: "naturalistic lions in profile, three times shown in hunting scenes" (Oued el Hesbaïa, Zaccar, Daïet el Hamra, Hadjara Mokhotma north, Oued Remeilia), "fairly large lions with the stylized head facing and the body in profile", "weaker in style and carving method", "late by comparison with the south-Oran prototypes" (Djebel Doum, Kheneg Hilal, Hadjra Mokhotma south), and thirdly the "smaller felines, lightly drawn and generally late", "of mediocre style and carving method"(pp.&amp;nbsp;81–85).

The ostriches, fairly numerous, are (with the exception of the representations at Safiet bou Khenan and at Oued el Hesbaïa) "generally of a poor quality." [[boars]], in a group of three, are on the other hand rare, limited to the stations of El Idrissia (a lost group) and Sreissir.

The human depictions are forty in number notably at Oued el Hesbaïa, El Gour, Theniet bou Mediouna II, Aïn Naga, Daïet es Stel, Oued Remeilia, Safiet bou Khenan, Hadjra Mokhotma south and [[Ben Hadid]]. Authors attribute to them the model of the "twenty-five characteristic traits of physical or psychic valour of the hunter culture" which they have identified "in the [[Nile]] area and in various [[Sahara]]n regions" (p.&amp;nbsp;85).

Thus they explain the images of men under animal skins, the wearing of false tails and phallic protections, masks, the presence of ithyphallic depictions and of men touching animals (buffalo, antelopes and elephants at Hadjra Mokhotma north, Theniet bou Mediouna II and Bou Sekkin). Among the weapons they record bows, long and curved weapons, clubs, a hatchet and a shield. Several traps are depicted as well as the hands. Thus, "all the cultural traits of hunters are attested in the Djelfa region, apart from the lasso and the ''spirale'' (?bolas), which are by compensation strongly represented at [[Tassili]] in the Oued Djerat sector."(p.&amp;nbsp;93).

== Early stages of domestication ==

[[Image:Djelfa, 3.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Aïn Naga.]]

Several antelopes and cattle carry signs of human appropriation, especially collars. But it is above all about thirty representations of rams which belong rather to the world of shepherds than of hunters, stretching "through a long period going all the way forward to an advanced stage of domestication" (p.&amp;nbsp;97). Eight among them are rams with spheroids, of which five are associated with human figures ([[Aïn Naga]], Daïet es Stel, Oued el Hesbaïa, Saouiet).

It is in this group that some of the most famous masterpieces of the region are found, such as the Ram of Aïn Naga, about twice natural size, found by Father F. de Villaret and published by the Djelfa Syndicate of Initiative. The animal, which wears a spheroid framed by feathers, a cheek pendant and a collar with chevrons, is led by a man dressed in a [[loin-cloth]] with buttons, wearing bracelets, whose hair-do falls across the [[nape]] of his neck in three swathes.

Of the other ovines (sc. sheep), sometimes wearing collars, show their horns enclosed in a ring or by discs (only four depictions show only a collar, or appear without attributes). At Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur a group composed of a [[Sheep|ram]], a ewe and a large bull denotes "a well established domestication" (p.&amp;nbsp;106). Other rams can be seen at Khenneg Hilal, Oued el Hesbaïa, Safiet bou Khenan, Theniet el Mzab, Hadjra Mokhotma and [[Aïn Naga]].

The rock art of the Djelfa region shows large naturalistic cattle ([[Zaccar]]) and sub-naturalistic ones (Bou Sekkin), the others dating from the pastoral era. Their horns are similarly closed into a ring and they sometimes wear devices in segments of a circle, or of textile, which are perhaps means of carrying things (Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur, Teniet el Mzab, Hadjra Mohkotma, Ben Hadid, Bou Sekkin, Safiet bou Khenan and Oued Mergueb).

The "pastoral scenes" often associating men and animals are found at Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur, Hadjra Mohkotma sud, Aïn Mouilha (men with "bandes molletières"), Morhoma, Daïet es Stel and Zaccar. Other humanly-signifying depictions, [[ithyphallic]] images and women displaying, are found at Safiet bou Khenan, Theniet bou, Mediouna II, and Daïet el Hamra. [[Image:Djelfa, 1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Aïn Naga, engraving called "The timid lovers".]]At Theniet el Mzab there is also found the famous engraving of a man with three-segmented hair style and square shirt-front, and at Aïn Naga that of the "timid lovers" in which the man carries an object like a [[haricot]], [[shield]] or [[quiver]] surmounted by [[arrow]]s, (as in south Oran at Khreloua), a hairdo or a headpiece with a tuft of hair falling forwards and with three swathes falling over the neck (a detail which one sees again at Aïn Naga and in south Oran) while the woman shows a carefully maintained hair arrangement, held behind with a clip.

One also finds among the engravings of the Djelfa region hounds and horses of various epochs.

In addition, three sites with [[cave painting]]s are located at Djebel Doum, at the Zaccar south site (several archers, a possibly human figure and tortoises) and at Hadjra Mokhotma south.

In 1968, elements of a [[lithic industry]] belonging to the [[Capsian culture|Capsian]] were discovered ''in situ'' by D. Grébénart at Aïn Naga and dated to 5500 B.C., plus or minus 220.

==The probable ancient regional ecology==
North Africa enjoyed a fertile climate during the subpluvial era; what is now the Sahara supported a [[savanna]] type of ecosystem, with [[elephant]], [[giraffe]], and other grassland and woodland animals now typical of the [[Sahel]] region south of the desert. Historian and Africanist [[Roland Oliver]] has described the scene as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[In] the highlands of the central [[Sahara]] beyond the [[Libyan desert]],... in the great [[massif]]s of the [[Tibesti]] and the [[Hoggar]], the mountaintops, today bare rock, were covered at this period with forests of [[oak]] and [[walnut]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], [[alder]] and [[elm]]. The lower slopes, together with those of the supporting bastions — the [[Tassili]] and the [[Tadrart Acacus|Acacus]] to the north, [[Ennedi]] and [[Aïr Mountains|Air]] to the south — carried [[olive]], [[juniper]] and [[Aleppo pine]]. In the valleys, perennially flowing rivers teemed with fish and were bordered by seed-bearing grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Oliver|Oliver, Roland]] (1999), ''The African Experience: From Olduvai Gorge to the 21st Century'' (Series: History of Civilization), London: [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|Phoenix Press]], revised edition, pg 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The aims of the '''Royal Society of Miniature Painters, Sculptors and Gravers'''  are ''to esteem, protect and practice the traditional 16th Century art of miniature painting emphasising the infinite patience needed for its fine techniques.'' Its patron is [[Charles, Prince of Wales]].

The Society of Miniature Painters was founded in May 1896 by [[Alyn Williams]], (1865-25th July, 1941), in which year it had its inaugural exhibition in the [[Modern Gallery, London|Modern Gallery]], 175 New Bond Street, London, and is devoted exclusively to contemporary [[portrait miniature|miniature paintings]]. 

[[King Edward VII]] granted the society a [[Royal Charter]] on 30 May 1904, and it became the Royal Miniature Society or RMS. To highlight the Society's growing importance the President's Jewel was commissioned in 1920. This is a large, elaborate silver chain of office designed and made by Alfred Lyndhurst Pocock, (1881-1962), which is still worn by the current president at formal functions. In 1926 the Society's scope was extended to include sculptors and [[Engraving|graver]]s and its name was changed by the Royal Command of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. The Society's Gold Memorial Bowl Award was established in 1985 and is one of the highest accolades for miniature art in the world. Since its foundation the Society has had eight different Presidents (Alyn Williams was president twice, 1896-1898, 1908-1941), including Sir [[William Blake Richmond]] (1842-1921) and [[Raymond Lister]] (1919-2001). The RMS's annual exhibition of around 650 works is held each October at the [[Mall Galleries]] in London. When the Society was founded the maximum size for a miniature was 12 by 10 inches - today the permitted size, including the frame, is 6 by 4.5 inches (15 x 11.5cm). Elizabeth R Meek, MBE (born 1953), who held the post of president between 2004-2013 and is now the Society's Honorary President, describes working in miniature as the most demanding of all painting genre. She names some of the qualities required as: "Concentration, stillness of mind and body and a dogged perseverance for perfection - the perfect miniature needs to be devoid of errors."

The Society's 122st Annual Exhibition will be held between 28 November and 9 December 2018 at the Mall Galleries, The Mall, London, SW1. There will be around 600 works on view, and while the traditional subject matter of portraiture continues unabated, there will be a very broad range of subject matter, including landscapes, still lifes and wildlife.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4917">'''Running crew''', '''run crew''' or '''stage crew''', is a collective term used in [[theatre]] to describe the members of the [[technical crew]] who supervise and operate ("run") the various technical aspects of the production during a [[performance]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=US6DCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|title=Dance Production: Design and Technology|last=Hopgood|first=Jeromy|date=2015-09-07|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781317635413|location=|pages=12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4sy5DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104|title=The Art of Theatre: Then and Now|last=Downs|first=William Missouri|last2=Wright|last3=Ramsey|first3=Erik|date=2016-10-05|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=9781305954700|location=|pages=104|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the "technical crew" includes all persons other than performers involved with the production, such as those who build and take down the sets and place the lighting, the term "running crew" is generally limited to those who work during an actual performance.

The term is typically not applied to crew or department heads, although there are exceptions. The running crew may include performers if they also function in technical capacities while offstage.

==Crew positions==
A typical running crew will include any or all of the following positions, depending on the nature and size of the production, and the complexity of the technical requirements. Each position is organised by the most common title; depending on the country, type of production, and producing organisation, different titles may be used for the same position.

===Stage management===
* [[Stage management|Assistant stage manager]]: Assists the [[Stage management|stage manager]] in their duties. Generally one assistant stage manager is in charge of running backstage operation during a show.
* [[Theatrical property|Props]]: responsible for maintenance and placement of hand props before scenes as well as their subsequent retrieval after the scene.
* [[Call boy (theatre)|Call boy]]: responsible for alerting actors and actresses of their entrances in time for them to appear on stage, on cue.

===Lighting===
* [[Light board operator]]: operates the [stage lighting|lighting control system]. Sometimes this is integrated with the [[show control]] system.
* [[Electrician_(theater)#Deck_Electrician|Deck Electrician]]: responsible for placing, connecting and/or operating stage lighting units, such as stage lights. Sometimes, they are necessary to have during scene changes, in the case of moving set pieces with lighting equipment inside. Typically, more than one will be backstage.
* [[Master Electrician]]: responsible for the maintenance and operation of dimming &amp; power distribution systems during a performance, including "hot" or "live" patching. Occasionally, some of these duties could also be delegated to the run crew's deck electricians.
* [[Spotlight operator|Spotlight Operator]] (or follow spot operator): operates a type of lighting instrument called a [[follow spot]], which allows a performer to be lit evenly no matter where on stage they may go. Can typically be found in the [[Control Booth|lighting booth]], along with the light board op. Also, some theaters have follow spots located above a false ceiling, on the [[Catwalk (theater)|catwalk]].

===Sound===
* [[Sound operator]] (A1): operates the [[Mixing console|sound board]] and/or audio control system specified by the [[sound designer]], computerised or otherwise. Sometimes this is integrated with the [[show control]] system. There can be multiple sound board ops.
* [[A2 (theater)|Mic wrangler]] (A2): manages microphones and maintains headsets as a show runs. Usually there are several mic wranglers located backstage, in the [[Wings_(theater)#Stage|wings]], with the running crew.

===Stage===
* [[Flymen]] (or fly crew/rail crew): operate the [[fly system]], a system of ropes or wires, pulleys and counterweights by means of which [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]] is "flown" in and out (down and up, respectively) during scene changes.
* [[Stagehand]]: A [[technician]] responsible for moving scenery at the stage level, by manually carrying or rolling set pieces (e.g., [[scenery wagon]]s) between the stage and the wings. This can include carrying on and off furniture, props, or scenery.

===Wardrobe===
* [[Wardrobe]]: A "dresser" (who works for Wardrobe) is responsible for maintenance and placement of [[costume]]s, as well as assisting performers in getting into and out of [[costume]]s.
* [[Makeup]]: responsible for applying or assisting in the application of [[face paint|face]] and [[body painting|body]] paints, [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] and hairpieces, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the [[Second World War]] in 1945, issues surrounding wartime loss and compensation started to arise. Cultural valuables were taken from [[Germany]] and placed in the [[Soviet Union]]. Years later, at the break up of the [[USSR]], the said cultural valuables came to attention as the issue of ownership arose. Following, the debates between the [[Russian Duma]] and the [[Yeltsin]] government began, with the Duma focusing on compensation to Russia for wartime loss, and Yeltsin focusing on maintaining international relationships and agreements. Arising from the debate, were many struggles, but ultimately the enactment of the '''Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation'''.

==Background==
At the end of the [[Second World War]] in 1945, in what some would argue as retaliation, and others as compensation for the massive loss of cultural property the [[Soviet Union]] suffered, cultural valuables (such as books, art, artifacts, etc.) were taken (stolen, or relocated) from [[Germany]]. Since the end of the War the existence of such valuables were kept secret, and their existence was denied. In total during [[World War II]], nearly thirty million Soviet people died as a result of prison camps, torture, starvation and cold blood murder. The [[USSR]] suffered a huge wartime loss, not only through cultural property but also by the deaths of millions of people. In 1991 when the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred, and the rise of the [[Russian Federation]] began, mention of vast amounts of hidden cultural valuables came to light because the issue of ownership arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monten|first=Lina|title=Soviet World War II Trophy Art In Present Day Russia: The Events, The Law, and The Current Controversies|journal=Depual J. Art. &amp; Ent. Law|year=2004–2005|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
===Yeltsin in Favour of Restitution 1992===
In June 1992, a Decree of the [[Russian Government]] created what was called the State Commission for Restitution of Cultural Valuables, which was to decide issues related to restitution. However, the Commission did very little and was at a halt by June 1993, and then was later abolished by March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Also, in 1992, there were many bilateral cultural agreements with a number of countries such as, [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Denmark]], Germany, [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Poland]], and the [[United Kingdom]] for mutual [[restitution]] of displaced cultural valuables; none of which were talked about in the [[Constitutional Court]] ruling in 1999 about the constitutionality of the Russian 1998 law, where international agreements were to be put above domestic laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, in June 1992 there was the only [[restitution]] of books to the west by Russia; there was 600 Dutch books that were returned to the [[Netherlands]]. But, this is only a small portion of the estimated 30,000 Dutch books that had arrived in the USSR. The idea of restitution did not last long, and soon turned into demands for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duma halts restitution 1994===
Starting in 1994, the idea of restitution had completely come to a stop, and the debates started about constructing a law on said cultural valuables. [[Duma]] deputies are responsible for the start of the debate by stating that there is lack of [[international laws]] and the inadequacy of domestic legislation to justify its refusal to permit further restitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came about when Duma deputies refused the return of French archives that were a part of a 1992 agreement. 
Demands for compensation from wartime loss and destruction started to arise from the Duma deputies, suggesting that other countries should be charged storage fees for what was held in Russia secretly for over 50 years; and further that the only possible restitution of cultural valuables that would occur to other nations was in exchange for Russian cultural valuables, because the deputies at this point were arguing that many of the plundered cultural valuables from Russia were being held across the ocean from the United States Zone of Occupation in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, with the support of some legal specialists and Russian legislators argue that all the cultural valuables that were brought to [[Moscow]] under government orders were all done so legally. But, nevertheless there is the other side of the debate, which is also supported by the [[Yeltsin]] government, who argue for compromise and internationally appropriate solutions.

===Duma Proposes Law 1995 and 1996===
For six years the debate continued. In January 1995 a large international conference was held in [[New York City]] titled "Spoils of War", where the international context about the issues surrounding cultural valuables plundered or misplaced at the end of the Second World War came to light. Firstly, it was important to note that no allied agreement that was made ever stated that works of art or other cultural property could be used for compensation purposes. Efforts such as what was done by the British and the Americans, where they carried out an elaborate program of restitution to countries of origin were discussed. Stories such as the [[United States]] had returned over half a million cultural items to the Soviet Union, but Russians were not aware of this, were among many topics discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On an international level, legal concepts and precedents existed during the time of the plundering from Germany in 1945, such as the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]] of 1907. Specifically Article 56 of the Convention "forbids the seizure, damaging and destruction of property of educational and art institutions, … and articles of scientific and artistic value belonging to individuals and societies as well as to the State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such international law did not stop [[Stalin]] from ordering the seizure of cultural valuables as compensatory reparations from Germany. However, Stalin's order is still followed by the Russian position 50 years later, as they would argue that these transfers (seizures) were carried out legally after the war as compensation. On the other side such a point of view is wrong because Russia is not in compliance with international law regarding the protection of cultural property. 
Despite the ongoing debate and Russia's failure to restitute cultural valuables to other [[Europe]]an countries, Russia had an interest in becoming a member of the [[Council of Europe]]. In order for Russia to become a member they had to sign a statement of intent in order to be admitted, which they did and gained admission in late 1995. Russia at this time agreed to negotiate claims for the return of cultural property to other European countries, and to return property that was transferred to Moscow in 1945, in a rapid manner. Surprisingly, nothing to this agreement ever occurred or was of any mention in the Russian press; and less than a year later in May 1996 the Duma passed the first reading of the proposed law nationalizing the spoils of war. The law emphasized compensation to Russia for wartime loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeltsin's Position, July 1996===
It was not long after, in early July 1996, the law was passed almost unanimously, making other European counties very hostile about the law. The passage started a slew of diplomatic protests, and as a result the Russian Upper House, the [[Council of the Federation]], rejected the law strongly because of the outcry from the Yeltsin administration. [[Boris Yeltsin]], president of the [[Russian Federation]] at the time, and his administration stood strong behind this argument for rejecting the law on the basis that it would conflict with numerous international agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duma Passes Law, March 1997===
Nevertheless, the law continued to gain support from other nationalist-oriented parties, and the push for the passage of the law continued. The chair of the Duma Committee on Culture, [[Nikolai Gubenko]], continued to stress that the law was a must, on the basis that all the cultural property that was transported to what was the Soviet Union was all done so legally according to allied agreements, and that the law is way of providing justice to the loved ones, nearly 30 million, that are no longer with us due to the horrific outcomes of the war. With more gained support, and a slightly revised law, the Duma again almost unanimously passed the law on February 5, 1997, and was further passed by the upper house, the Council of Federation on March 5, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeltsin Vetoes the Law, March 1997===
Sticking to what he believed, and despite the ongoing support for the law, President Yeltsin [[vetoed]] the law on March 18, 1997. Making his position clear in his official message to the Duma, Yeltsin stood firm that the law was in contradiction of the Constitution. Further Yeltsin pointed out that the law went against Russian bilateral agreements with other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional Court ruling==
Notwithstanding the President's power to veto the law, the Council of the Federation overrode Yeltsin's veto, with a vote of 141 to 37 in favor of the law on May 14, 1997. Regardless of the fact that the Council of the Federation overrode Yeltsin's veto, he still refused to sign the law, and further cited allegations of voting irregularities; and repeated his position that the law conflicted Russia's international legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
President Yeltsin was forced to sign the law by the [[Constitutional Court]] in a decision on April 6, 1998. The Constitutional Court ruled that they were unable to consider the constitutionality of the law before the President signed it. So, on April 15, 1998, President Yeltsin signed the law making it officially Federal Law. The Law did return to Constitutional Court in 1999 for review on the basis of unconstitutionality, contradiction of Russia's international legal obligation and alleged irregular voting practices. The ruling of July 20, 1999 did rule in fact that parts of the law were unconstitutional and that parts of the voting process were violated; but despite these findings the law was still validated and found not in conflict with the Constitution. The ruling further stated that the cultural valuables that were relocated to now what is known as Russia at the end of the Second World War should not be returned to the former aggressor countries and should remain in Russia as a form of compensation. The law was sent back to the Duma for amendments to be made in November 1999, and then finally May 25th, 2000, the Federal Law received the Presidential signature from the then President [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The law==
The Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of World War II and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation consists of six Chapters and twenty-five Articles. The Law is aimed at governing cultural valuables displaced to know what is known as Russia. The fundamental goals of the Federal Law are "to protect said valuables from misappropriation and prevent their illegal export beyond the borders of the Russian Federation as well as their unlawful transfer to whomsoever; to establish the necessary legal bases for treating said cultural valuables as partial compensation for the damage caused to the cultural property of the Russian Federation as a result of the plunder and destruction of its cultural valuables by Germany and its war allies during World War II; to protect the interests of the Russian Federation in the settlement of disputed issues with foreign states concerning said cultural valuables through consistent compliance with the principle of mutuality; to provide a possibility for acquainting citizens of the Russian Federation and foreign citizens, including specialists in the fields of education, science and culture, with said cultural valuables; and to create favorable conditions for the continuous development of international cooperation in the fields of education, science and culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Documentation Project|url=http://docproj.loyola.edu/rlaw/r2.html|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International criticism==
The Law enacted by the Russian Federation on displaced cultural valuables, has been nothing but been criticized on an international level. A [[Hungary|Hungarian]] specialist cited a large number of issues on how the Russian law violates international law and treaties. But more specifically, emphasized that Hungary is entitled to the restitution of Hungarian property removed to the USSR as a result of the Second World War. Further, similar feelings were expressed by a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] specialist, who argues that [[Ukraine]] and other former Soviet republics should have a say in determining the fate of their cultural valuables, on the basis of international norms and democratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A specific criticism of the law is the notion of a limitation period. This is the idea that a claim must be made within 18 months of the information about a specific cultural valuable is published in an appropriate federal agency publication. This strikes a lot of concerns because who decides and what is an adequate publication, and after the 18 months what happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2009, a Ministry of Culture legal specialist wrote that the passage of the law "would appear as a unilateral Russian rejection of its international obligations and evoke a negative impact on international relations of the Russian Federation with various European governments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Recently, in June 2013, news reports illustrate that the controversy about the appropriation of German artefacts by the USSR, is still on going between Germany's [[Angela Merkel]] and Russia's [[Vladimir Putin]]. During a visit in [[St-Petersburg]], Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, criticized an exhibition at the [[Hermitage Museum]] that contained a number of valuables that were stolen from Germany. President Putin declared that the issue is very sensitive and that both sides would continue to talk to resolve the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Merkel and Putin view exhibition of disputed art|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23001274|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sweet Bunch''''' ({{lang-el|Γλυκιά Συμμορία|translit=Glykia Symmoria|italic=yes}}) is a 1983 [[cinema of Greece|Greek]] dramatic [[experimental film|experimental]] [[independent film|independent]] [[underground film|underground]] [[art film]] directed by [[Nikos Nikolaidis]]. The film, produced by Vergeti Brothers and the Greek Film Center, is the second part of the "Years of Cholera" trilogy beginning with ''[[The Wretches Are Still Singing]]'' (1979) and ending with ''[[The Loser Takes It All]]'' (2002) which deals with the last decades of the twentieth century. The original Greek title directly references the Greek title of the 1969 [[Sam Peckinpah]] film ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' ({{lang-el|Άγρια Συμμορία|translit=Agria Symmoria|italic=yes}}). The film uses as background music the 1958 song "[[Sugartime]]" written by Charlie Phillips and [[Odis Echols]] as well as the 1940 song "Sweet Mara" ({{lang-el|«Γλυκιά Μαράτα,» [[romanization of Greek|tr.]] "Glykia Marata"}}) composed by Leo Rapitis to lyrics by Kostas Kofiniotis which was performed by Kakia Mendri. It was distributed by the Greek Film Center in [[Greece]] and by Restless Wind abroad.

==Plot==
A group of four misfits, Argyris, Andreas, Marina, and Sofia, live together in a house. Andreas just got out of jail. All four have become disillusioned with life and have lost any reason to live or die. They try all criminal experiences with each member of the group choosing a different activity to experiment in: frequenting expansive restaurants and leaving without paying, shoplifting, starring in pornographic films, and creating an anti-state organization. The authorities put them under surveillance, waiting for the slightest false step from any of them before acting violently. The first such misstep occurs when Sofia kills the police chief who monitors their home.

:''For the album by musician Chris Mars, see [[Tenterhooks (album)]]''.

'''Tenterhooks''' are [[hook]]s in a device called a ''tenter''. Tenters were originally large wooden frames which were used as far back as the 14th century in the process of making [[wool]]len [[cloth]]. After a piece of cloth was woven, it still contained [[lanolin|oil]] and dirt from the fleece. A [[craft]]sman called a [[fulling|fuller]] (also called a tucker or wa[u]lker) cleaned the woollen cloth in a [[fulling mill]], and then had to dry it carefully or the woollen fabric would shrink. To prevent this shrinkage, the fuller would place the wet cloth on a tenter, and leave it to dry outdoors. The lengths of wet cloth were stretched on the tenter ({{ety|la|tendere|to stretch}}) using tenterhooks (hooked nails driven through the wood) all around the perimeter of the frame to which the cloth's edges ([[selvedge]]s) were fixed, so that as it dried the cloth would retain its shape and size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trowbridgemuseum.co.uk/fulling-and-tentering/|title=Fulling and Tentering «  Trowbridge Museum|website=trowbridgemuseum.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some manufacturing areas, entire tenter-fields, larger open spaces full of tenters, were once common.

By the mid-18th century, the phrase "'''on tenterhooks'''" came to mean being in a state of tension, uneasiness, [[anxiety]], or suspense, i.e. figuratively stretched like the cloth on the tenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-ont1.htm|title=World Wide Words: On tenterhooks|website=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John_Ford_(dramatist)|John Ford's]] 1633 play ''Broken Heart'' contains the lines: "There is no faith in woman. Passion, O, be contain'd! My very heart-strings Are on the tenters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/editions/broken.htm#5.4|title=John Ford. The Broken Heart.|website=www.luminarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1690 the periodical ''The General History of Europe'' used the term in the modern sense: "The mischief is, they will not meet again these two years, so that all business must hang upon the tenterhooks till then."&lt;ref&gt;The general history of Europe, London [England] 1688–1693, republished in Early English newspapers, Microfilm, Woodbridge, Conn.

In 1826, English periodical ''[[Monthly Magazine|Monthly magazine or British register of literature, sciences, and the belles-lettres]]'' contained the line "I hope (though the wish is a cruel one) that my fair readers, if any such readers have deigned to follow me thus far, are on tenterhooks to know to whom the prize was adjudged."&lt;ref&gt;[http://grammarist.com/usage/on-tenterhooks/ Grammarist], retrieved 14 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of 19th-century British periodicals]]&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to his wife the same year, American educator [[Francis Wayland]] (waiting for his promised appointment as President of [[Brown University]]) wrote "I was never so much on tenter hooks before."&lt;ref&gt;Roelker, William G.

The word ''tenter'' is still used today to refer to production line machinery employed to stretch [[polyester]] films and similar fabrics. The spelling ''stenter'' is also found.

'''''View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm''''', commonly known as '''''The Oxbow''''', is a seminal landscape [[painting]] by [[Thomas Cole]], founder of the [[Hudson River School]]. The painting depicts a Romantic panorama of the Connecticut River Valley just after a thunderstorm. It has been interpreted as a confrontation between wilderness and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Angela|title=The Empire of the Eye|year=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=0-8014-2830-0|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Background==
Between 1833 and 1836, American painter and putative "founder" of ''The Hudson River School,'' Thomas Cole, had been hard at work on his series of paintings ''[[The Course of Empire (paintings)|The Course of Empire]]''. The work was commissioned by New York patron [[Luman Reed]], who had met Cole in 1832, and the two held a friendship largely based on Reed's generosity in buying Cole's paintings. Reed requested ''The Course of Empire'' to comprise no less than five paintings of a historic composition. Cole himself was excited by such a project, but doubt began to set in by the end of 1835. The work was slow and laborious, and Cole found great difficulty in painting the figures. Reed had begun to notice Cole was becoming lonely and depressed, and suggested that he suspend work on ''The Course of Empire'' and paint something that was more in his element for the April 1836 opening of the [[National Academy of Design]]'s annual exhibition. Cole, in replying to Reed in a letter, stated that he felt obliged to finish the series as Reed had been so generous in his support, and instead suggested that he simply complete the last painting in the series and display that at the exhibition. Reed however, did not really like the idea, as he thought it might spoil the unveiling of the series as a whole. He suggested instead that he paint a picture much like the already completed second painting in the series, ''The Pastoral State''. This depicted a peaceful setting which Reed thought "no man ever produced a more pleasing landscape in a more pleasing season." Responding in a letter in March 1836, Cole agreed to take Reed's advice and paint a picture for the exhibition, writing:&lt;ref name=met&gt;Roque, Oswaldo Rodriguez (1982). ''"The Oxbow" by Thomas Cole: Iconography of an American Landscape Painting''. Metropolitan Museum Journal. pp. 63–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Fancy pictures]] seldom sell &amp; they generally take more time than views so I have determined to paint one of the latter.  I have already commenced a view from [[Mount Holyoke|Mt. Holyoke]]&amp;mdash;it is about the finest scene I have in my sketchbook &amp; is well known&amp;mdash;it will be novel and I think effective&amp;mdash;I could not find a subject very similar to your second picture &amp; time would not allow me to invent one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cole also comments that he used a larger canvas, as he was not able to ready a smaller frame in time for the exhibition, and moreover felt compelled to make a statement with the one painting he was to present.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

==Composition==
The painting moves from a dark wilderness with shattered tree trunks on rugged cliffs in the foreground covered with violent rain clouds on the left to a light-filled and peaceful, cultivated landscape on the right, which borders the tranquility of the bending [[Connecticut River]]. In returning to painting landscapes, Cole was faced with the dichotomy of the untamed wilderness and land cultivated by man. While other painters of the [[Hudson River School]] would merge the two peacefully, Cole did not shy away from portraying the two as opposites and showing how the cultivation would destroy the natural wilderness, and as a result never meet in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, James T (1998). ''Random Harvest''. Fordham University Press. p. 145. {{ISBN|0-8232-1731-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the hill in the far background, logging scars in the forest can be observed, which appear to form [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]]. This was first noticed by Matthew Baigell long after the landscape was painted. It reads as [[Noah]] (נֹ֫חַ) If viewed upside down, as if from God's perspective, the word ''[[El Shaddai|Shaddai]]'' is formed, "The Almighty." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://picturingamerica.neh.gov/downloads/pdfs/Resource_Guide_Chapters/PictAmer_Resource_Book_Chapter_5A.pdf|title=View from Mount Holyoke (The Oxbow), 1836|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole gives himself a tiny [[self-portrait]] sitting on the rocks in the foreground with his easel.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmerding, John (2003).

==Ownership==
Cole sold the painting at the exhibition to Charles Nicoll Talbot (1802–1874), merchant in the [[Economic history of China|China trade]].&lt;ref&gt;David Bjelajac, "Thomas Cole's ''Oxbow'' and the American Zion Divided", ''American Art'' '''20''' (2006), pp60–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838 he lent it to the Dunlap Benefit Exhibition, and later to the third annual exhibition of the Artists' Fund Society, which was held in New York in 1862. With his death in 1874, the painting was acquired from his estate by [[Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage]], wife of [[Russell Sage]]. Olivia Sage was a known philanthropist, and her transfer of ''The Oxbow'' to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1908 would seem rather natural.  However, she may have been inspired by a similar gesture in 1904 by Samuel P. Avery, Jr., who donated ''[[The Titan's Goblet]]'', another of Cole's well-known paintings, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Furthermore, Olivia Sage's attorney, [[Robert W. DeForest]], was a secretary on the Board of Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum. The painting today resides in The Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;Parry III, Ellwood C (2003).

'''Third party standing''' is a term of the [[law]] of [[civil procedure]] that describes when one party may file a [[lawsuit]] or assert a defense in which the rights of third parties are asserted. In the [[United States]], this is generally prohibited, as a party can only assert his or her own rights and cannot raise the claims of right of a third party who is not before the court.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''Kowalski v. Tesmer'', 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004) ("We have adhered to the rule that a party ‘generally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.’ ”).&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several exceptions to this doctrine.

For example, a third party may sue where he has interchangeable economic interests with the injured party, as in the case of a bookseller suing to enforce the rights of his patrons to purchase a particular book from his store.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

A third party may assert the rights of another person in order to vindicate them when the other person is unable to do so. For example, the [[US Supreme Court]] has held that a white person bound by a restrictive covenant not to sell realty to a black person may assert the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment rights of black persons not before the court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2966847168977034831&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr ''Barrows v. Jackson''], 346 U.S. 249 (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

A party that represents a class in a certified [[class action]] suit may continue to represent the class even where their own stake in the suit has dissipated. A woman seeking to challenge the constitutionality of a law that prevents divorcees from remarrying within a year may continue to represent the class of similarly situated persons, even if the year passes and she is able to remarry before the case has been decided.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==General rule==

Ordinarily, one may not claim standing in a court to vindicate the constitutional rights of some third party.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath'', 341 U.S. 123, 149-154 (1951) (concurring opinion).&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement of standing is often used to describe the constitutional limitation on the jurisdiction of federal courts to "cases" and "controversies."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Coleman v. Miller'', 307 U.S. 433, 464 (1939)(concurring opinion).&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the jurisdictional requirement, the [[US Supreme Court]] has developed a complementary rule. one of self-restraint for its own governance. which ordinarily precludes a person from challenging the constitutionality of state action by invoking the rights of others.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Ashwander v. TVA''36, 297 U. S. 288, 346-348 (1936) (concurring opinion).&lt;/ref&gt; The common thread underlying both requirements is that a person cannot challenge the constitutionality of a statute unless he shows that he himself is injured by its operation.&lt;ref&gt;''Barrows v. Jackson'', 346 U.S. 249 (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of application of this rule are:

* ''Frothingham v. Mellon'', 262 U. S. 447, 486-489 (1923): federal taxpayer sought to challenge a federal statute in the enforcement of which federal revenues were applied,
* ''Doremus v. Board of Ed.'', 342 U.S. 429, 434 (1952): state taxpayer unable to show that there was "a measurable appropriation or disbursement of .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. funds occasioned solely by the [state] activities complained of."
* ''Tileston v. Ullman'', 318 U.S. 44 (1943): doctor sought a declaratory judgment that a state statute would deprive certain of his patients of their lives without due process of law),
* ''Tyler v. Judges of Court of Registration'', 179 U.S. 405, 410 (1900): landowner sought to challenge the notice provisions for a land registration proceeding in which he had not made himself a party, although he had notice of the proceedings, and even though "his interest in the land would remain unaffected" if the act were subsequently declared unconstitutional.
* ''Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes'', 302 U.S. 464, 478-480 (1938): "John Doe, let us suppose, is engaged in operating a grocery store. Richard Roe, desiring to open a rival and competing establishment, seeks a loan from a manufacturing concern which, under its charter, is without authority to make the loan. The loan, if made, will be ''ultra vires''." John Doe has no standing to sue to enjoin the loan.

==Vicarious standing==

There are recognized exceptions to the general rule in cases where the party whose rights are being invoked is not in a position to assert those right effectively. At times, "it would be difficult if not impossible for the persons whose rights are asserted to present their grievance before any court."&lt;ref&gt;''Barrows'' at 257.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases the courts often allow third parties vicariously to vindicate the rights of a non-litigant rights possessor.

In ''Pierce v. Society of Sisters'',&lt;ref&gt;268 U. S. 510 (1925).&lt;/ref&gt; a state statute required all parents to send their children to public schools. A private and a parochial school brought suit to enjoin enforcement of the act on the ground that it violated the constitutional rights of parents and guardians. No parent or guardian to whom the act applied was a party or before the Court. The Court nonetheless held that the statute was unconstitutional because it "unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control."&lt;ref&gt;''Pierce'' at 534-535.&lt;/ref&gt; The schools were thus permitted to assert in defense of their property rights the constitutional rights of the parents and guardians.

In ''Barrows v. Jackson'', Jackson owned a house in Los Angeles the deed to which contained a covenant against selling to Negroes. Jackson breached the covenant by selling to a Negro and Barrows sued. The courts ruled against enforcement despite Barrows's argument that Jackson was asserting the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights of persons not before the court. The Court said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The relation between the coercion exerted on respondent [Jackson] and her possible pecuniary loss thereby is so close to the purpose of the restrictive covenant, to violate the constitutional rights of those discriminated against, that respondent is the only effective adversary of the unworthy covenant in its last stand. She will be permitted to protect herself and, by so doing, close the gap to the use of this covenant, so universally condemned by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;''Barrows'' at 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''NAACP v. Alabama'',&lt;ref&gt;357 U.S. 449 (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; the state had obtained a court order requiring the NAACP to produce membership lists. Upon its refusal to comply, the NAACP was held in contempt. The Supreme Court reversed, permitting the NAACP to assert the rights of its members and holding that the state court order violated their First Amendment right of freedom of association. The Court noted that because litigation by individual NAACP members would require disclosure of their identity and thus destroy the freedom of association threatened by the court order, the NAACP was a proper party to act on the members' behalf to assert their constitutional rights.

In ''Griswold v. Connecticut,''&lt;ref&gt;381 U.S. 479 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; a doctor and  a birth control official who had distributed contraceptives were prosecuted under an aiding and abetting statute as accessories to the crime of using birth control devices. The Court permitted the defendants to assert the privacy rights of the third-party contraceptives recipients because of the professional relationship between the defendants and the third parties, and because the recipients' rights would be diluted were the defendants not allowed to assert them.

In ''Craig v. Boren'',&lt;ref&gt;429 U.S. 190 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; a liquor vendor and a young man challenged the constitutionality of an Oklahoma statute that prohibited the sale of 3.2% beer to males under 21 years of age and females under 18 years of age. The Court held that the liquor vendor, subject to sanctions and loss of license for violation of the statute, was a proper party in interest to object to the enforcement of the allegedly discriminatory law, because obedience to the law would cause loss of sales and disobedience risked sanctions from the state. "Accordingly," the Court explained, "vendors and those in like positions have been uniformly permitted to resist efforts at restricting their operations by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties who seek access to their market or function."&lt;ref&gt;''Craig'' at 194.&lt;/ref&gt; It is crucial to the vendor's standing that its failure to prevail in the litigation "will materially impair the ability of males 18-20 years of age to purchase 3.2% beer despite their classification by an overt gender-based criterion."&lt;ref&gt;''Craig'' at 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, these cases require the person asserting a third party's rights to be injured in some way by the rights violation. In ''Barrows'', it was being required to pay damages for violating the racial covenant; in ''NAACP'', contempt; in ''Griswold'', criminal prosecution as an aider and abettor. In cases where no such injury is threatened, the courts tend to deny standing.

In ''Kowalski v. Tesmer'',&lt;ref&gt;543 U.S. 125 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; the Court denied standing to Michigan attorneys who sued to challenge state law that restricted appointment of appellate counsel for indigent defendants who had pleaded guilty. The attorneys asserted that the indigent defendants' constitutional rights were being denied. The Court said that its cases had held that a party seeking third-party standing must make two showings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, we have asked whether the party asserting the right has a "close" relationship with the person who possesses the right. Second, we have considered whether there is a "hindrance" to the [rights] possessor's ability to protect his own interests.&lt;ref&gt;''Kowalski'' at 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The attorneys in this case invoked the potential attorney-client relationship to demonstrate the requisite closeness"

&lt;blockquote&gt;Specifically, they rely on a future attorney-client relationship with as yet unascertained Michigan criminal defendants "who will request, but be denied, the appointment of appellate counsel, based on the operation" of the statute. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The attorneys before us do not have a "close relationship" with their alleged "clients"; indeed, they have no relationship at all.&lt;ref&gt;''Kowalski'' at 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court also ruled that it perceived no hindrance to the indigent defendants' asserting their constitutional rights for themselves. The attorneys argued that, without counsel, unsophisticated, ''pro se'' criminal defendants could not "coherently advance the substance of their constitutional claim." The Court rejected that claim. It said that "we do not think that the lack of an attorney here is the type of hindrance necessary to allow another to assert the indigent defendants' rights."&lt;ref&gt;''Kowalski'' at 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] concurred in the judgment but filed an opinion protesting what he considered to be past excesses of the Court in allowing third-party assertions of constitutional rights:

*  "that beer vendors have standing to raise the rights of their prospective young male customers"&lt;ref&gt;''Craig v. Boren'', 429 U.S. 190, 192-197 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;
* "that criminal defendants have standing to raise the rights of jurors excluded from service"&lt;ref&gt;''Powers v. Ohio'', 499 U.S. 400, 410-416 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;
* "that sellers of mail-order contraceptives have standing to assert the rights of potential customers"&lt;ref&gt;''Carey v. Population Services Int'l'', 431 U.S. 678, 682-684 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;
* "that distributors of contraceptives to unmarried persons have standing to litigate the rights of the potential recipients"&lt;ref&gt;''Eisenstadt v. Baird'', 405 U.S. 438, 443-446 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; and 
* "that white sellers of land have standing to litigate the constitutional rights of potential black purchasers"&lt;ref&gt;''Barrows v. Jackson''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], with whom Justices [[John Paul Stevens]] and [[David Souter]] joined, dissented. They argued that only "prudential considerations" rather than constitutional ones prevented allowing the attorneys to assert the prisoners' rights. They said the attorneys had an economic interest in the issue because they "would earn less for representation of indigent appellants than they earned in years prior to the cutback on state-funded appeals." They also asserted that the distinction between existing and prospecting clients was unwarranted since in many cases prospective sellers (such as the beer vendor in ''Craig'', the schools in ''Pierce'', etc.) were allowed to assert the rights of hypothetical customers. As for the hindrance issue, they took issue with the majority's assertion that indigent, uneducated defendants would not face serious obstacles to acting ''pro se''.

==Organizational standing==

Many organizations, such as [[trade union]]s, can also assert third party standing to represent their members. In ''Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm.'' (1977),&lt;ref&gt;432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the interests it seeks to protect are germane to their organization's purpose and neither the claim asserted, nor the relief requested, requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.

There are exceptions to the Third Party Standing rule, such as overbreadth&lt;ref&gt;" Ordinarily, challengers to a law are not permitted to raise the rights of third parties and can only assert their own interests," but so-called "overbreadth is an exception to the usual rules of standing." See generally Monaghan, ''Third Party Standing'', 84 {{smallcaps|Colum. L. Rev.}} 277 (1984); Note, ''Standing to Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii'', 88 {{smallcaps|Harv. L. Rev}}. 423 (1974). But see Monaghan, ''Overbreadth,'' 1981 {{smallcaps|Sup. Ct. Rev}}. 1 (arguing that overbreadth involves first-party, not third-party standing, because the litigant's own conduct may only be regulated by a valid rule of law).&lt;/ref&gt; and vagueness.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|K. M. Sullivan and G. Gunther, Constitutional Law}} 1335 (15th Ed. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third-party standing in intellectual property law==

In patent and copyright cases, courts have at times allowed third-party standing to would-be sellers of goods or services to possessors of rights under patent or copyright law who were not situated in a way to assert the rights themselves.

For example, the owner of patented equipment (such as part of a car) has a right to repair it to keep it in good order. The US Supreme Court has held that a vendor of parts needed for this purpose may assert that right in defense against an infringement claim by the holder of patent rights on the equipment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.]]'', 365 U.S. 336 (1961); see also ''Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.'', 377 U.S. 476 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus. US patent law permits a third party to assert the repair rights of the non-party owner of those rights.

In the UK, where such parts may be protected by a copyright on the drawings for the parts, the House of Lords has held that the [[Doctrine of non-derogation from grants|doctrine against derogation from grants]] may be invoked by a seller of spare parts (such as a tailpipe for a car).&lt;ref&gt;''[[British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.]]'', [1986] 1 All ER 850, [1986] AC 577 (H.L.). Lord Bridge observed in his speech in that case, “What the owner needs, if his right to repair is to be of value to him, is the freedom to acquire a previously manufactured replacement exhaust system in an unrestricted market.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in cases of unlawful patent tying the courts allow interloping would-be suppliers of the tied article to assert the rights of purchasers of the product subjected to the tie in order to aid them to escape from the tying.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co''., 314 U.S. 488, 494 (1942). The Supreme Court said in that case that the reason for allowing interloping suppliers to assert the illegality of a tie-in as a bar to recovery of infringement damages against them when the patentee imposing the tie sues them for patent infringement is this: "It is the adverse effect upon the public interest of a successful infringement suit in conjunction with the patentee’s course of conduct which disqualifies him to maintain the suit."&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law#Standing or right to assert exhaustion|''Helferich Patent Licensing, LLC v. New York Times Co.'']],&lt;ref&gt;778 F.3d 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Circuit]] denied standing to assert the [[exhaustion doctrine]] to a seller of services (Internet news stories) to purchasers of patented equipment (smartphones) on two principal grounds:

First, the defendant seller was not itself a purchaser from the plaintiff patentee. The court ruled that the exhaustion doctrine may be asserted only by an "authorized acquirer" — one who purchases the patented article from the patentee or its authorized seller. Thus, this court opined that third-party standing did not exist.

Second, the defendant did not show that the claims it was accused of infringing were licensed to and used by the purchasers of patented equipment. The patent claims in that case had been drafted so that one set of claims covered sending Internet stories to smartphones and a different set covered receiving stories.&lt;ref&gt;The Federal Circuit remarked that Helferich’s counsel's drafting efforts "reflect[s] painstaking efforts to distinguish the conduct of handset makers and possessors from the conduct of others, such as content providers, and to distinguish claims practiced by the former from claims practiced by the latter." 778 F.3d at 1297.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant was accused of infringing the first set, but the smartphone purchasers and the licensed smartphone manufacturers who sold to them used the second set. The court said that the defendant had not shown that the licensed claims embodied substantially the same invention as the patent claims under which the defendant was sued, so that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply. This is a ruling that the exhaustion doctrine does not apply in these circumstances rather than a ruling on standing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30627">'''Visual arts of Chicago''' refers to [[paintings]], [[printmaking|prints]], [[illustrations]], [[Textile arts|textile art]], [[sculpture]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]] and other visual artworks produced in Chicago or by people with a connection to Chicago. Since [[World War II]], Chicago visual art has had a strong individualistic streak, little influenced by outside fashions. "One of the unique characteristics of Chicago," said [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] curator Bob Cozzolino, "is there's always been a very pronounced effort to not be derivative, to not follow the status quo."&lt;ref name=Loviglio&gt;Joann Loviglio, "Chicago Art Stars in Philly Exhibition", [[Chicago Sun-Times]], Wednesday, February 22, 2006, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago art world has been described as having "a stubborn sense ... of tolerant pluralism."&lt;ref name=Thodos&gt;Diane Thodos, "Self-Portraits 2000", ''[[New Art Examiner]]'', May–June 2001, Vol. 28, no. 8-9, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chicago's art scene is "critically neglected."&lt;ref name=Vine&gt;Richard Vine, "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_/ai_19385182 Where the Wild Things Were]", ''[[Art in America]]'', May 1997, pp. 98-111 {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Andrew Patner has said, "Chicago's commitment to figurative painting, dating back to the post-War period, has often put it at odds with New York critics and dealers."&lt;ref name=Patner&gt;Andrew Patner, "Chicago: Special Report: Contemporary Art", ''[[Art and Antiques Magazine]]'', Summer 1996, p. 53-55&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that Chicago art is rarely found in Chicago museums; some of the most remarkable Chicago artworks are found in other cities (such as the brilliantly warped epic drawings of [[Henry Darger]] at the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in [[New York City]], or [[Carlos Cortez|Carlos Cortez']] collection of early twentieth-century Chicago "Wobbly" ([[Industrial Workers of the World]]) woodcut prints, now in the [http://www.reuther.wayne.edu/taxonomy/term/12 Walter P. Reuther Library] at [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit]]).&lt;ref name=Sherlock&gt;Maureen P. Sherlock, "Missing/Inaction: 'Art in Chicago, 1945-95'", ''[[New Art Examiner]]'', February 1997, Volume 24, no. 5, pp. 23-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early days: before the War==
[[File:Davies-Elysian Fields, undated oil on canvas painting, The Phillips Collection (Washington, D. C.).jpg|thumb|right|Arthur B. Davies, ''Elysian Fields,'' undated, oil on canvas, [[The Phillips Collection]] (Washington, D. C.)]]

The [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] was founded in 1879, from the remains of an earlier school founded in 1866 (thus the school predates the museum of the same name).&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Marzio, "A Museum and a School: An Uneasy But Creative Union", ''Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society'', Spring 1979, Vol. VIII, number 1, pp. 20-23; 44-52&lt;/ref&gt; Early students and faculty were conservative and derivative in their tastes, imitating popular European models. [[Arthur B. Davies]], a former SAIC student and one of "[[Ashcan School|the Eight]]" was considered a disappointment for being a member of a radical group of urban modernists. In 1913, SAIC students held a protest with costumes and bonfires against the Chicago showing of the [[Armory Show]], a collection of the best new modern art; the newspapers described the students' activity as a riot.&lt;ref name=Martinez&gt;Andrew Martinez, "A Mixed Reception for Modernism: The 1913 Armory Show at the Art Institute of Chicago", The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 19, no. 1, 1993, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a year later the African-American [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] [[Archibald Motley|Archibald J. Motley]], graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago; he kept his modern, jazz-influenced paintings secret for some years after.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine D. Woodall, "Looking Backward: Archibald J. Motley and the Art Institute of Chicago: 1914-1930", ''Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society'', Spring 1979, Vol. VIII, number 1, pp. 53-57&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mary Agnes Yerkes, Blue Boat.jpg|thumb|right|''"Blue Boat"'' by Mary Agnes Yerkes, circa 1920, oil on canvas.]]

For many years the Art Institute of Chicago regularly held annual exhibits of local artists,&lt;ref name=Martinez/&gt; but these ended decades ago. [[Mary Agnes Yerkes]], (1886–1989), was an American Impressionist painter and one such exhibitor at AIC from 1912-1915. Born in Oak Park, she studied at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, where she also taught, and the at the currently named School of the Art Institute of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Miss Yerkes' Exhibit|newspaper= Oak Leaves|date= October 23, 1915| pages = 26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is noted for her plein-air painting while camping the American West and its National Parks.

==Interbellum: Chicago arts between the World Wars==
The time period between the World Wars witnessed an outpouring of artistic creativity in Chicago, led by artists of the calibre of  [[Stanislav Szukalski]], [[Todros Geller]]&lt;ref name="occgeller"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oakton.edu/museum/Geller.html|title=Todros Geller (1889-1949)|publisher=Oakton Community College|accessdate=21 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322160221/http://www.oakton.edu/museum/Geller.html|archive-date=22 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albin Polasek]].

The Chicago art scene was not strictly an all-boys club however; [[Sr. Maria Stanisia]] was able to overcome the patriarchal attitudes both within early twentieth century [[Chicago]] and the hierarchy of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to become acclaimed as one of the greatest painters in the field of [[religious art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040428164700/http://stmargaretofscotland.com/stations.htm Stations of Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[Women Artists|woman artist]] [[Gertrude Abercrombie]] who like Stanisia attended the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], sold her [[surrealist]] paintings in art fairs that took place near the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;Warren, Lynne, ''Art in Chicago 1945-1995'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-500-23728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1940s==
Early evidence of Chicago's unique style came with [[Ivan Albright]], with his "excruciatingly detailed surfaces depicting things in states of decay."&lt;ref name=Holg&gt;Garret Holg, "Art of the City: The Imagists -- and Beyond" ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', Sunday, March 22, 1998, Section B, pp. 1, 14&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eldzier Cortor]] documented African-American life for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]].&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;  [[Vera Berdich]], an influential [[surrealist]] printmaker, taught many future [[Chicago Imagists]] at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;

==1950s: individuality, realism, surrealism==
[[Claes Oldenburg]] was born in Sweden and only spent a few years in the 1950s in Chicago, but he sold his first works here, 5 pieces at the [[57th Street Art Fair]] for $25.&lt;ref&gt;David McCracken, "The Art Fair That's Been In the Picture the Longest", [[Chicago Tribune]], June 5th, 1987, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-War art in Chicago was more figurative and less abstract than the [[New York City|New York]] fashion dictated, and was largely ignored by New York dealers and critics.&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;  Chicago artists rejected the abstract aesthetics of New York [[modernists]], preferring strong surrealism, "following their own vision,"&lt;ref name=Loviglio/&gt; and "savage political satire."&lt;ref name=Sherlock/&gt;

==1960s==

[[Claire Zeisler]], a fiber artist, switched from weaving to large, free-standing fiber sculptures which "redefined the art form".&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;

===The Chicago Imagists===
In the late 1960s, a group of former students of the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], many of whom had been mentored by teacher-artist [[Ray Yoshida]],&lt;ref&gt;Larry Finley, "Influential Figure in Chicago Art World: Teacher, Mentor to Artists in Imagism School of 1970s", [[Chicago Sun-Times]], Monday, January 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; organized a series of exhibits at the [[Hyde Park Art Center]].  Their art was notable for its surrealism and cartoon-influenced grotesques.

Strictly speaking, they were three different groups:  The earliest was the "Monster Roster", which included [[Cosmo Campoli]], [[Leon Golub]], [[Nancy Spero]], and [[Karl Wirsum]]; then the "Hairy Who", which included [[Art Green (artist)|Art Green]], [[Gladys Nilsson]], and [[Jim Nutt]]; and finally the [[Chicago Imagists]], which included [[Roger Brown (artist)|Roger Brown]], [[Ed Paschke]], and [[Barbara Rossi (artist)|Barbara Rossi]].&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;

According to Imagist [[Ed Paschke]], the Imagists felt liberated by a lack of critical coverage.  "There was a sense that no one much cared what we did here.  We weren't going to get a whole lot of national attention.  We could do what we wanted to do."&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;  After Paschke's death, in 2004, a New York critic infamously said that Paschke's "contribution to the art of his time was somewhat obscured by his distance from New York."&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Smith, "Ed Paschke, Painter, 65, Dies; Pop Artist With Dark Vision", New York Times, December 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  At that same time, Chicago artists Tony Fitzpatrick and Wesley Kimler and art consultant Paul Klein stirred outrage when they reported that not a single Chicago museum had any of Paschke's work on display (a claim that was later disputed).&lt;ref name=Foumberg&gt;Jason Foumberg, "Art in Chicago 2000-2009: At Zeroes End", [[Newcity]], December 3, 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 the Chicago Imagists were given recognition in a show at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Imagist Art'', Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Illinois 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Chicago Surrealist Group===
Under the leadership of [[Penelope Rosemont|Penelope]] and [[Franklin Rosemont]], the [[Chicago Surrealist Group]] came together with both artistic and political ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jack J.|last=Spector|title=Surrealist Art and Writing, 1919-1939: The Gold of Time|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-55311-3|year=1997|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the group played a major role in organizing the World Surrealist Exhibition at the [[Gallery Black Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.corpse.org/issue_10/critiques/postel.html |title="Women and the Surrealist Revolution: an interview with Penelope Rosemont" by Danny Postel, in 'Exquisite Corpse: A Journal of Letters and Life' |access-date=2014-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020620/http://www.corpse.org/issue_10/critiques/postel.html |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s==

Chicago produced several [[Photorealism|photorealists]], including [[Arne Besser]], and [[Richard Estes]].  Many photorealists were collected by Morton Neumann "against the grain of the prevailing critical thought at the time" (which espoused abstract expressionism),  and exhibited at Chicago's [[Terra Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;"American Super Realism from the Morton G. Neumann Family Collection", Terra Museum of American Art, Evanston, Illinois 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago artists internationally==

Over the last few decades, many contemporary Chicago artists have become internationally successful. A persistent problem for the development of art scenes in Chicago has been the fact that, in the past, a large number of artists began in Chicago, but had to relocate elsewhere before gaining attention. [[Curator]] Robert Cozzolino sees this positively, stating that we must "recognize a powerful Chicago diaspora." Such artists include [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cozzolino, "Post:Correcting the Chicago Record", ''artblog'', February 3, 2006, http://fallonandrosof.blogspot.com/2006/02/correcting-chicago-record.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no overarching theme or style characterizes Chicago's contemporary art, many contemporary critics contend that institutional support has favored Neo-Conceptual work almost to exclusion. Chicago art is nevertheless diverse and pluralistic, as is art in general. Contemporary Chicago artists continue to explore personal styles.  Although abstraction has never been as strong in Chicago as in New York, there are noteworthy Chicago abstract artists, such as [[William Conger]], who paints brightly colored, sprightly designs, and [[Rodney Carswell]], whose work is more formal and cooler; and conceptual artists such as photographer [[Jeanne Dunning]] and installation artist [[Kay Rosen]].&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Holg, "City Focus Chicago: Industrious Evolution", ''[[ARTnews]]'', April 1998, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's other notable contemporary artists are too numerous to name; but a few who would make any list are [[Kerry James Marshall]], [[Dan Peterman]], [[Gregg Bordowitz]], [[Julia Fish]], [[Wesley Kimler]], [[Tony Fitzpatrick (artist)|Tony Fitzpatrick]] and [[Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle]].



===Painters===
[[Robert Guinan]] paints psychologically penetrating portraits of bar patrons and jazz musicians which are very popular in France, but he is almost unknown in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;John Golden, "Hunting Guinan: An Artist Renowned in France Finds Fame Elusive in His Native Land", [[New York Times]], Sunday, March 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Laurie Hogin continues the grotesque Chicago tradition with lush, Dutch-style portraits of cartoonishly savage animals.&lt;ref&gt;Alan G. Artner, "Hogin's Horrors: How a Gifted Representational Painter Became an Angry Philosopher-Activist", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Friday, February 28, 1997, Section 7, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  Ellen Lanyon's paintings show "fairy-tale gentleness and antiquarian whimsy."&lt;ref name=Artner&gt;Alan G. Artner, "Grabner Homes in on Subject Matter: Lanyon Exhibit Combines the Past with the Present, While Lowly Mixes Figures with Landscapes", [[Chicago Tribune]], Thursday, May 27, 1999, section 5, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Riva Lehrer, herself disabled, paints intense, sympathetic, surreal portraits of disabled persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artcritical.com/thodos/DTLehrer.htm Diane Thodos reviews Riva Lehrer at the Chicago Cultural Center, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard Loving paints luminous, spiritual abstractions.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;  [[Tim Lowly]], who has mastered the difficult medium of [[egg tempera]], paints heartbreaking spiritual pictures of seemingly ill children.&lt;ref name=Artner/&gt;  [[Audrey Niffenegger]]  paints beautifully weird surreal images and writes acclaimed fiction as well.&lt;ref name=Thodos/&gt;  Frank Piatek paints not-quite-abstracts of giant, writhing tube-forms.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;  Judith Raphael paints pugnacious little girls posed like classical artworks.&lt;ref name=Thodos/&gt;  [[Patrick Skoff]] leaves his paintings in public places for people to find and keep.&lt;ref name="New City"&gt;New City Chicago Magazine - http://art.newcity.com/2009/07/28/on-the-hunt-patrick-skoff-wants-you-to-take-his-paintings/ 28 July 2009, "On The Hunt: Patrick Skoff Wants You to Take His Paintings"&lt;/ref&gt;[[Matt Lamb]], a self-taught artist, creates luminous expressionist paintings with bold uses of color, whimsical figures and symbols, and unlikely combinations of mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Speer, Richard.

John F. Miller taught for a few decades at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|SAIC]] and, during the bulk of that period, produced paintings and some drawings in an abstract style. Since the late 1990s, Miller has produced most of his work using compters and graphics software.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Nance, "The Outsider With Loads of Talent, Rivaled Only by His Ego", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 29 January 2006.

Accessed on 23 February 2009 at http://www.markstaffbrandl.com/art_in_america/art_in_america.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculptors, textile art===
[[Cat Chow]] constructs dresses out of subversive materials.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Cole, "Artist Spotlight: Cat Chow", ''[[Dialogue (magazine)|Dialogue]]'', May/June 2004, Vol. 27, no. 3, pp. 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Richard Hunt (sculptor)|Richard Hunt]] sculpts ruggedly abstract commentaries on social issues.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;  [[Kerry James Marshall]] paints and sculpts multi-media works commenting on African-American life.&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;

===Photography===
These same impulses also appeared in Chicago's lively [[Street photography]] scene, gaining notoriety through artists centered around the [[IIT Institute of Design|Institute of Design]] such as [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]], [[Aaron Siskind]], [[Leon Lewandowski]] as well as in the work of nanny-savant [[Vivian Maier]]. Ray K. Metzker and Barbara Crane studied at the Institute of Design in the 1950s. They spread the ideas of the Institute of Design teaching photography in the second half of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Metzker was Philadelphia based and Crane was based in Chicago. [[Bob Thall]]'s beautiful, bleak photographs of Chicago-area architecture have also won much acclaim.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;

===Illustration, printmaking===
Contemporary [[illustrators]] include [[Jay Ryan (artist)|Jay Ryan]], whose hand-silkscreened posters have advertised many a rock band,&lt;ref&gt;Anders Smith Lindall, "Off the Wall: Jack Ryan's Whimsical Illustrations Put a Face on the Chicago Rock Scene", ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', Tuesday, December 20, 2005, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and fantasist [[Scott Gustafson]].&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Fenner and Arnie Fenner, ''Spectrum 11: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art'', Underwood Books, Nevada City,&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tony Fitzpatrick (artist)|Tony Fitzpatrick]] etches wild, detailed, tattoo-like pop images.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Carpenter, "Tony Fitzpatrick: Max and Gaby's Alphabet", ''[[Dialogue (magazine)|Dialogue]]'', January/February 2004, Vol. 27, no. 1, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public art===
[[File:Collage of public street art by Hebru Brantley in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of Chicago..jpg|thumb|Collage of Public art located near the CTA Western Brown Line stop in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of Chicago. Artist: Hebru Brantley]]

Chicago had a revival, dating to the 1960s, of public [[mural]] art, involving local artists and community members.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Eric Hoyt, "The Explosion of a Dormant Art Form: Chicago's Murals", ''Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society'', Spring-Summer 1974, Vol. III, number 1, pp. 28-35&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chicago Public Art Group]] is a non profit cultural organization in [[Chicago]] that organizes and promotes creation of community public art. Founded in 1971, several of its recent works have been large [[bricolage]] mosaics in city [[underpass]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/06/29/your-chicago-ornate-underpass-murals/ |title=Your Chicago: Ornate Underpass Murals |publisher=[[CBS]]Chicago|date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeoutchicago2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Lauren|url=http://www.timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/art-design/65809/lake-shore-thrives |title=Lake Shore thrives - Art &amp; Design |publisher=Time Out Chicago|date=2009-07-20|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, [[Jeff Zimmerman (artist)|Jeff Zimmerman]] paints photorealistic portrait murals, which can be found in various neighborhoods and restaurants in Chicago and Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;Richelle Kerns, "Jeff Zimmerman: A Chicago Muralist in the 'Hood", ''[[Dialogue (magazine)|Dialogue]]'', January/February  2004, Vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 50-55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irreverence, satire==
[[File:Cowardly lion2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|W. W. Denslow's illustration of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.]]

Chicago has a strong tradition of satirical, even grotesque art and illustration.  The early books of [[L. Frank Baum]] were illustrated with the strange work of [[William Wallace Denslow]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell P. Macfall, "The Baum Explosion",''Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society'', Spring 1978, Vol. VII, number 1, pp. 59-62&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chicago tradition of political satire is seen in installation artist [[Öyvind Fahlström]], cartoonish artist [[Hy Roth]], and actual cartoonists [[Heather McAdams]] and [[Nicole Hollander]].&lt;ref name=Sherlock/&gt;  Other Chicago cartoonists recognised by the art world include [[Lynda Barry]], [[Dan Clowes]], [[Jay Lynch]] and [[Chris Ware]] (whose work was shown at the 2002 [[Whitney Biennial]]).&lt;ref&gt;Christa Donner, ""Drawing the Line: Midwest Comics &amp; Contemporary Art", ''[[Dialogue (magazine)|Dialogue]]'', Nov/Dec 2002, Volume 25, Number 4, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant comics artists from Chicago include [[Jessica Abel]],&lt;ref&gt;Joy Press, "The Further Adventures of Artbabe: Brooklyn Graphic Novelist Jessica Abel, Up From Underground", ''[[Village Voice]]'', Tuesday, March 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herblock|"Herblock" (Herbert Block)]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert C.

==Self-taught artists and Outsider Art==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Xdx - Manierre Dawson - overall.jpg|right|thumb|Xdx by Manierre Dawson from ca. 1910]]

"Chicago emerged early on as an outpost for [[Outsider Art|outsider art]]," according to critic Andrew Patner.&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;

[[Manierre Dawson]] was an early self-taught artist, who began painting abstracts in 1910.  He was invited to display in the [[Armory Show]].&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;

In the 1990s, a group of Chicago collectors, including Bob Roth, founder of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', and Ann Nathan and Judy Saslow, both of whom have opened acclaimed galleries, organized [[Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art]], which leads tours of Midwestern self-taught artists and has its own exhibition space.&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;

Paul Waggoner, an eccentric himself, was an art dealer and champion of outsider art.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Jenses, "Offbeat Gallery Owner", Chicago Tribune, Saturday, March 22, 2008, section 1, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Hammer, an art dealer in Chicago, has handled much strange, figurative [[outsider art]], including the epic novel, illustrated with hermaphroditic girls traced from coloring books, of [[Henry Darger]], and the naive portraits of society ladies of [[Lee Godie]].  Hammer also represents [[Mr. Imagination (Gregory Warmack)|Mr. Imagination]], a self-taught bottlecap muralist&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt; Mr. Imagination, whose work is in several museums, also participated in the 2007 public art project, "[[Cool Globes: Hot Ideas for a Cooler Planet]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Cool Globes: Hot Ideas for a Cooler Planet: Guidebook", For Her Information Media, Chicago, Illinois 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Troubles and controversies==
In the 1980s, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]], along with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and Chicago's Department of Cultural Affairs, attempted to put on a show of contemporary Chicago art.  Called "The Chicago Show", it was supposed to celebrate Chicago's artistic diversity.  Embarrassingly, 84 of the 90 artists chosen by the 5-member blind jury were found to be white.  The organizers published an apology in the exhibit catalogue and invited twenty minority artists who  had not been juried in to participate.  Half of the invited artists, angered by this condescension, refused and organized a counter-exhibit at the [[Chicago Cultural Center]].&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;

On April 15, 1989, the same night that the [[Hyde Park Art Center]] celebrated its 50th anniversary, a devastating fire destroyed most of an entire block of important galleries and art spaces in the [[River North Gallery District, Near North Side, Chicago|River North gallery district]].&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;

In spring of 1996, the Feigen, Inc. gallery's exhibit of [[Gregory Green (artist)|Gregory Green]]'s "10,000 Doses" and "Recipe for Making '[[LSD]]' in the Kitchen" was raided by the [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police]], who confiscated and broke open the artworks.  No drugs were found.&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;

In 1996 the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]], to get over the embarrassment of "The Chicago Show", attempted a survey of Chicago Art called "Art in Chicago: 1945-1995".  It was criticized by the press as cramped, inadequate, and incomprehensive.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherlock/&gt;  Its catalogue was judged a disappointment by Dennis Adrian, an art critic and participant, who called it "visually ... an atrocity of staggering proportions."&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Adrian, "This Map is Not to Scale", ''[[New Art Examiner]]'', February 1997, Volume 24, no. 5, pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual arts coverage===
In the last decade, all major print publications in Chicago have ceased seriously covering the visual arts .  In 2009, the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', an [[alternative newspaper|alternative]] weekly newspaper, reduced its formerly complete art listings of galleries and museums and regular art reviews by [[Fred Camper]] to "a smattering of listings and pictures".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Jason Foumberg, "Art in Chicago 2000-2009: At Zeroes End", [[Newcity]], December 3, 2009, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', one of Chicago's two major newspapers, never had gallery or art listings and fired its sole dedicated fine arts reporter, [[Alan G. Artner]], in 2009.&lt;ref name=Foumberg/&gt;
And the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', the other of Chicago's two major newspapers, has no gallery or art listings and no dedicated arts reporter, although [[Kevin Nance]] has covered some fine art issues along with movies and popular culture.

Additionally, The ''[[New Art Examiner]]'' (from Chicago) and ''[[Dialogue (magazine)|Dialogue]]'' magazine ([[Columbus, Ohio]]) reported on Chicago and midwestern arts communities until they both folded in 2002, though the ''[[New Art Examiner]]'' relaunched in 2015'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Art Examiner|url=http://www.newartexaminer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Gallery News]]'', a glossy color magazine published three times a year, lists gallery shows but has no articles.  ''[[Gallery Guide]]'' magazine publishes a Chicago/midwest edition which is similar.

However, smaller online and print publications have continued to cover the art scene in Chicago and have increased dramatically in number in recent years. Since 1988, [[NewCity Magazine|New City Magazine]] has covered the visual arts in Chicago, joined in the 1990s by [[Lumpen (magazine)|Lumpen Magazine]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. [[Gapers Block]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gapers Block|url=http://www.gapersblock.com|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Chicago-focused web publication established in 2003, added coverage with their arts and culture section. They were soon followed by Paul Klein's Art Letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Letter|url=http://www.artletter.com/info.html|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 and the [[Bad at Sports|Bad At Sports]] podcast and blog in 2005. In 2008, print-based Proximity Magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proximity Magazine About|url=http://proximitymagazine.com/information/about/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established, joined by two more print publications, Jettison Quarterly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jettison Quarterly|url=http://jettisonquarterly.com/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The School of the Art  Institute's F News Magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=F News Magazine|url=http://fnewsmagazine.com/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 2009. Also in 2009, Chicago Art Magazine broke off of Art Talk Chicago, part of the Chicago Tribune-sponsored blog network, to start their own independent online platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Art Magazine - About|url=http://chicagoartmagazine.com/about/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago Art Review, which ran from 2009-2011 and is currently in hiatus, began in 2009 as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Art Review|url=http://www.Chicagoartreview.com|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Sixty Inches From Center was established and includes The Chicago Arts Archive, a web publication focusing on visual art in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sixty Inches From Center|url=http://sixtyinchesfromcenter.org/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org Chicago Artists Resource], launched by the Department of Cultural Affairs in 2005, provides articles on visual art in addition to providing resources and tools for Chicago artists.

Local artists' interests are represented by the [[Chicago Artists' Coalition]], a nonprofit advocacy organization, which has a monthly newsletter, the ''[[Chicago Artists' News]]''.

'''Young Concert Artists''' is a New York City-based [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to discovering and promoting the careers of talented young [[classical music]]ians from all over the world. The competition, founded in 1961, allows artists from all over the world to compete as individuals or in a [[chamber group]], such as a [[string quartet]]. The number of winners varies from year to year, as there is no specified limit to the number of participants who can win.

Winners of the competition receive a cash prize and are provided the opportunity to perform in concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City and the [[Kennedy Center]] in Washington D.C.  Winners are also provided with an artistic manager who promotes the artist through booking concert engagements both in the United States and abroad, and providing publicity materials, promotion, and career development. Many artists in the program's history have also made their debut recordings through the help of the Young Concert Artists program.

Notable past winners include violinists [[Pinchas Zukerman]], [[Ani Kavafian]], [[Ida Kavafian]], and [[Chee-Yun]]; pianists [[Murray Perahia]], [[Emanuel Ax]], [[Richard Goode]], [[Jean-Yves Thibaudet]], [[Christopher O'Riley]], [[Ruth Laredo]] and [[Olli Mustonen]]; [[flautist]]s [[Paula Robison]], [[Mimi Stillman]], and [[Eugenia Zukerman]]; the [[Tokyo String Quartet|Tokyo]], [[St. Lawrence Quartet|St. Lawrence]], and [[Borromeo String Quartet]]s; [[violist]] [[Antoine Tamestit]]; [[cellist]]s [[Ronald Thomas (cellist)|Ronald Thomas]], [[Fred Sherry]] and [[Carter Brey]]; [[trumpet]]er [[Stephen Burns]]; and [[soprano]]s [[Marvis Martin]] and [[Dawn Upshaw]].

Conductor [[James Levine]] was awarded the Lotus Award ("for inspiration to young musicians") from Young Concert Artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldcat.org/digitalarchive/content/server15982.contentdm.oclc.org/BSYMO/PROG/TRUSVolume13/Pub411_2007-2008_BSO_Vol02_Subscription_Wk22.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
