[[File:Aleko-Lilius.jpg|thumb|right|Aleko Lilius.]]
'''Aleko Axel August Eugen [[Lilius family|Lilius]] ''' (2 April 1890 in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] – 24 June 1977 in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]) was an explorer, businessman, diplomat, writer, journalist, and photographer of [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish Swedish]] and Russian extraction. He has been described as an “English journalist,”  a “Russian Finn,” an "American of Finnish origin,” a “Swedish journalist and adventurer,” and an “Intrepid American journalist.”  He is the author of "I Sailed with Chinese Pirates," an account of the time he spent among pirates of the South China seas.

==Biography==

Aleko Lilius's father was a senior translator in the [[Senate of Finland]], serving as a [[Staff Captain]] in the famous [[Izmaylovsky Regiment]]. His mother was Natalia Starck, born in Caucasus and the daughter of [[Major general|Major General]] Julius Starck. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.saunalahti.fi/arnoldus/lilius.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kenraalit/henkilo/407&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blf.fi/artikel.php?id=9518&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the First World War, Lilius was an enterprising businessman whose colorful exploits attracted much publicity. In 1916, Aleko Lilius was the highest taxed private individual in Finland and a [[Private banking|private banker]] who owned the ''Privatbanken I Helsingfors''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blf.fi/artikel.php?id=9518&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a young man, he explored much of the [[Americas]], [[China]], [[North Africa]], and [[South Africa]], before settling down for a while in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iltalehti.fi/teevee/2011062113925769_tv.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; 

He ran afoul of the law several times. In Hong Kong, he was sentenced, according to an article in The Singapore "The Straits Times" dated September 23, 1929, on"five charges of fraud"... to serve "two months hard labor on each charge, the sentences to run concurrently." &lt;ref&gt; [http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19290923-1.2.80.aspx ''The Straits Times''.] 23 September 1929, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 in the Philippines, he was again convicted of fraud for issuing four checks with insufficient funds to the Luneta Hotel; sentenced to one year and one day of "prison correccional with the accessory penalties prescribed by the law." Lilius appealed and this time the charges were reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[G.R. No. L-38774 December 23, 1933 The People of the Philippine Islands, Plaintiff-Appellee, vs. Aleko Lilius Defendant-Appellant from ChanRobles Virtual Law Library http://www.chanrobles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawsuit involving Lilius in the [[Philippines]] in 1934 &lt;ref&gt;see http://www.asianlii.org/ph/cases/PHSC/1934/75.html&lt;/ref&gt; described him as thus:

{{quote|…The plaintiff Aleko E. Lilius has, for many years, been a well-known and reputed journalist, author, and photographer. At the time of the collision in question, he was a staff correspondent in the Far East of the magazines ''The American Weekly'' of New York and ''The Sphere'' of London…Some of his works have been translated into various languages. He had others in preparation when the accident occurred. According to him, his writings netted him a monthly income of P1,500. He utilized the linguistic ability of his wife Sonja Maria Lilius, who translated his articles and books into English, German, and Swedish. Furthermore, she acted as his secretary…}}

Virtually all of Lilius' output as a writer is based on his wide-ranging travels in places such as [[China]], [[Morocco]], and [[Mexico]]. The first mention of Lilius as a writer is as the author of the script for the 1919 Finnish film ''Venusta etsimässä eli erään nuoren miehen ihmeelliset seikkailut'' (In search of Venus—or—the Marvelous Adventures of a Young Man). During the 1920s and 1930s, Lilius functioned as a foreign correspondent in [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]]. During the 1920s, Lilius worked with linguist Rudolf Schuller as a photographer in Mexico. In the 1930s, Lilius lived in the United States, residing in the famous [https://web.archive.org/web/20111029062627/http://www.josephpelllombardi.com/5homes/newoctagon.html Armour-Stiner Octagon house] in Irvington-on-Hudson in the state of New York. In the 1950s he lived in Morocco. In 1958 he moved to Helsinki, Finland; and later devoted himself to painting.

==Works==
=== ''I Sailed with Chinese Pirates'' ===
Lilius is primarily remembered as the author of "I Sailed with Chinese Pirates," an account of the time he spent among [[pirate]]s of the South China seas. The original review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of 27 July 1931 reads in part:

{{quote|A meeting with a mysterious woman pirate chief, Lai Choi San, with several thousand ruthless buccaneers under command, is described in the volume ''I Sailed with Chinese Pirates,'' which is published today by D. Appleton &amp; Co. Aleko E. Lilius, English journalist, while traveling in the Orient, according to the publishers, succeeded in winning the confidence of this unusual woman, and he accompanied her and some of her desperadoes on one of their expeditions on a junk equipped with cannon. Mr. Lilius’s publishers describe him as the only white man who has ever Sailed with these pirates…}}

The “mysterious woman pirate chief,” [[Lai Choi San]], is widely believed to be the source of inspiration for the character of the [[Dragon Lady]], the oriental ‘’femme fatale’’ in [[Milton Caniff]]’s comic strip, ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]''. Although Lilius did not use the term “Dragon Lady” in his book—he referred to Lai Choi San as “Queen of the Pirates”— Caniff did appropriate the Chinese name for his character. According to one source, this was the cause of a later legal dispute between Lilius and the syndicate that produced the comic strip, Terry and the Pirates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthur-ransome.org/ar/literary/lilius.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the later (1991) [[Oxford University Press]] reprint says that the book is “ …a good read in the sensational nineteen-twenties style of journalism…briskly moving but somewhat superficial…”

"Saturday is Pay Day at the fruit-picking camp. Boy Scouts queue up in a pay parade to collect their pocket money from the Scout master.

An '''allowance''' is an amount of [[money]] given or allotted usually at regular intervals for a specific purpose.  In the context of children, parents may provide an allowance ([[British English]]: '''pocket money''') to their child for their miscellaneous personal spending.  In the construction industry it may be an amount allocated to a specific item of work as part of an overall contract.

The person providing the allowance is usually trying to control how or when money is spent by the recipient so that it meets the aims of the person providing the money.  For example, an allowance by a parent might be motivated to teach the child [[money management]] and may be unconditional or be tied to completion of chores or achievement of specific [[Grading (education)|grades]].&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= May 20, 2011|url = http://money.msn.com/family-money/allowances-welfare-for-kids-weston.aspx|title = Allowances: 'Welfare' for kids?|format = |publisher = [[CNN]]| accessdate = October 4, 2012 | last=Weston| first= Liz|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person supplying the allowance usually specifies the purpose and may put controls in place to make sure that the money is spent for that purpose only.  For example, a company employee may be given an allowance or [[per diem]] to provide for meals and travel when working away from home and may then be required to provide [[receipts]] as proof. Or they are provided with specific non-money tokens or vouchers that can be used only for a specific purpose such as a [[meal voucher]].

==Types of allowance==

===Allowances in business===

====Construction contracting====
In [[construction]], an allowance is an amount specified and included in the construction [[contract]] (or specifications) for a certain item of work (e.g., appliances, lighting, etc.) whose details are not yet determined at the time of contracting. Typically:
# the allowance amount covers the cost of the contractor's material/equipment delivered to the project plus all taxes less any trade discounts to which the contractor may be entitled with respect to the item of work;
# the contractor's costs for labor (installation), overhead, profit and other expenses with respect to the allowance item are included in the base contract amount but not in the allowance amount;
# if the section 1 costs for the item of work are higher (or lower) than the allowance amount, the base contract amount should be increased (decreased) by the difference in the two amounts and by the change (if any) to the contractor's costs under section 2.

The allowance provisions may be handled otherwise in the contract: e.g., the flooring allowance may state that installation costs are part of the allowance. The contractor may be required to produce records of the original takeoff or estimate of the section 2 costs for each allowance item.

'''Bread&amp;&amp;Butter''' is an annual Berlin-based event and a year-round online shopping hub by [[Zalando]].

Access to pre-launches and rare items, with a particular focus on streetwear and sneakers, is part of Bread&amp;&amp;Butter’s DNA. Brands such as [[Vans]], [[adidas]], [[Eastpak]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and many more, create unique products specifically for release at Bread&amp;&amp;Butter.

The next Bread&amp;&amp;Butter weekend takes place at [[Treptow Arena|Arena]] Berlin from August 31- September 2, 2018, with the tagline, “The Pop-Up of Style and Culture” and a “see now, buy now” concept. The three-day weekend showcases fashion, culture, and music, and attracts over 30,000 visitors.

International music artists perform live each evening at the venue, as well as DJ sets scheduled on different stages throughout the day. The weekend draws influencers and celebrities from around the world to Berlin to take part in various activities as well as in live panel discussions on current cultural topics.

Pop-up fashion shows are a key highlight during the weekend, showing new season collections and limited edition products from a selection of brands. A variety of food stalls are set up across Arena and the surrounding areas, offering popular street food dishes and drinks to guests.

== History ==
The original “Bread &amp; Butter” tradeshow was founded by German entrepreneur Karl-Heinz Müller together with Christian Geyr and Wolfgang Ahlers and premiered in July 2001 in [[Cologne]]-[[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]]. It was initially conceived of as a bi-annual fashion industry trade show "for the progressive, contemporary clothing culture". It had a spin-off in Barcelona from 2005 and completely relocated there in 2007. The tradeshow came back to Berlin in the summer of 2009 and relocated to the historical hangars of [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]].

In June 2015, the trade fair was acquired by Berlin-based fashion and tech company [[Zalando]]. The e-commerce platform relaunched it in 2016, turning the fashion industry event into a weekend open to the public. It hosts pop-up stands from the brands available on zalando.com, with the aim to ‘democratize fashion’.

Past music lineups have included various international headliners such as [[ASAP Rocky|A$AP Rocky]], [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A]] and [[FKA Twigs|FKA twigs]], as well as supporting local DJs from Berlin. Each day of the event culminates in an after-party at the venue.

The 2017 fashion shows included collections from [[Hugo Boss|HUGO]], [[Topshop]] and [[G-Star Raw|G-Star]], as well as a retrospective show by couture designers [[Viktor &amp; Rolf]]. The same year, [[Vivienne Westwood]] opened an onsite exhibition dedicated to her work, as well as hosting an inspirational talk on stage at Festsaal.

2017 also saw several panel discussions with a variety of topics. [[Adwoa Aboah]] hosted an empowering Girl’s Talk session and [[Wyclef Jean]] told his life story during an intimate live discussion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/bread-and-butter-by-zalando-2018/|title=Bread&amp;&amp;Butter by Zalando – The Pop-Up of Style and Culture Reveals This Year’s Line-Up|last=|first=|date=2018-07-06|website=High Snobiety|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.de/mode/artikel/bread-and-butter-2018|title=*In sync* mit dem Streetwear-Hype: So wird die Bread&amp;&amp;Butter dieses Jahr|last=|first=|date=2018-07-02|website=Vogue.de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/handel-konsumgueter/modemesse-in-berlin-zalando-setzt-bei-der-bread-und-butter-auf-mode-zum-mitnehmen/22740252.html?ticket=ST-24086-SJkiI2ENaI2KdygwX1Kq-ap1|title=Zalando setzt bei der Bread &amp; Butter auf Mode zum Mitnehmen|last=|first=|date=2018-06-28|website=Handelsblatt.de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Business continuity''' is the planning and preparation of a company to make sure it overcomes serious incidents or disasters and resumes its normal operations within a reasonably short period. This concept includes the following key elements: {{CN|date=October 2018}}
#[[Resilience (organizational)|Resilience]]: critical business functions and the supporting infrastructure are designed in such a way that they are materially unaffected by relevant disruptions. Resilience is established through controls that are preventive or deterrent in nature. Examples include redundancy and spare capacity; 
#Recovery: arrangements have to be made to recover or restore business functions that fail for some reason. Recovery is established through controls focused on detection, mitigation, and correction.
#[[Contingency management|Contingency]]: the organization establishes a generalized capability and readiness to cope effectively with disruptions, including those that were not, and perhaps could not have been, foreseen. Contingency preparations constitute a last-resort response if resilience and recovery arrangements should prove inadequate in practice. 

Typical disasters that business continuity covers include fires, floods, accidents caused by key people, server crashes or virus infections, insolvency of key suppliers, negative media campaigns and market upheavals (ex. stock market crashes). The locations of these disasters and the company real estates may be independent.

== Responsibility ==
The management of business continuity falls largely within the sphere of [[quality management]] and [[risk management]], with some cross-over into related fields such as [[governance]], [[information security]] and [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]].  Risk management is an important tool for business continuity as it provides a structured way to identify the sources of business disruption and assess their probability and harm. It is expected that all business functions, operations, supplies, systems, relationships, etc. that are critically important to achieve the organization's operational objectives are analyzed and included in the business continuity plan. Business Impact Analysis is the generally accepted risk management term for the process of determining the relative importance or criticality of those elements, and in turn drives the priorities, planning, preparations and other business continuity management activities.

If there is no business continuity plan implemented and the organization in question is facing a rather severe threat or disruption that may lead to bankruptcy, the implementation and outcome, if not too late, may strengthen the organization's survival and its continuity of business activities.&lt;ref&gt;Gittleman, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==
One important way to achieve business continuity is the use of international standards, program development, and supporting policies. These standards ensure that proven methods and concepts for business continuity are used. As with many quality management standards though, the primary task of identifying relevant potential disasters, making plans for evacuation, buying spare machines and servers, performing backups and bringing them off-site, assigning responsibility, performing drills, educating employees and being vigilant cannot be replaced by adherence to standards. As such, commitment by management to see business continuity as an important topic and assign people to work on it, remains the most important step in establishing business continuity.

Several business continuity standards have been published by various standards bodies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Business Continuity Plan |publisher=United States Department of Homeland Security |url=https://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/continuity |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*International Organization for Standardization:
**[[ISO 22301]]:2012, "Societal security – Business continuity management systems – Requirements", specifies a management system to manage an organization's business continuity arrangements.  It is formal in style in order to facilitate compliance auditing and certification.  
**[[ISO 22313]]:2012, "Societal security – Business continuity management systems – Guidance", provides more pragmatic advice concerning business continuity management.  
**[[ISO/IEC 27000-series|ISO/IEC 27031]]:2011, "Information security – Security techniques – Guidelines for information and communication technology [ICT] readiness for business continuity", offers guidance on the ICT aspects of business continuity management.
*National Fire Protection Association: [[NFPA 1600]], "Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs".
*[[ASIS International]] (ASIS):
** BCM.01:2010, "Business Continuity Management Systems: Requirements with Guidance for Use", developed in partnership with [[Business Continuity Institute]] (BSI).
** SPC.1-2009, "Organizational Resilience: Security, Preparedness, and Continuity Management Systems—Requirements with Guidance for Use", approved by [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI), is under consideration for inclusion in the DHS PS-Prep, a voluntary program designed to enhance national resilience in an all hazards environment by improving private sector preparedness.
*Standards Australia: 
**HB 292-2006, "A practitioners guide to business continuity management"
**HB 293-2006, "Executive guide to business continuity management"
**AS/NZS 5050 connects far more closely with traditional risk management practices.  This interpretation is designed to be used in conjunction with AS/NZS 31000 covering risk management.
*National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST):
**Special Publication 800-34, "Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems"
*British Standard: (deprecated)
** BS 25999-1:2006, "Business Continuity Management. Code of Practice”, offered pragmatic implementation guidance, but was withdrawn in 2012 when ISO 22313 effectively superseded it.  
** BS 25999-2:2007, "Specification for Business Continuity Management”, formally specified a set of requirements for a business continuity management system.  It too was withdrawn in 2012 when it was (in effect) replaced by ISO 22301.

==Program==

Ongoing management-level process to ensure that necessary steps are regularly taken to identify probable accidents, disasters, emergencies, and/or threats. It also involves (1) assessment of the probable effect of such events, (2) development of recovery strategies and plans, and (3) maintenance of their readiness through personnel training and plan testing. See also business impact analysis

==Policies==

Policies are those things mandated by the management of an organization that will always be performed according to a preset design plan, and supporting all business functions within an organization.

==Business impact analysis (BIA)==

The entire concept of business continuity is based on the identification of all business functions within an organization, and then assigning a level of importance to each business function.  A business impact analysis is the primary tool for gathering this information and assigning criticality, recovery point objectives, and recovery time objectives, and is therefore part of the basic foundation of business continuity.

The BIA can be used to identify extent and timescale of the impact on different levels of an organization. For instance it can examine the effect of disruption on operational, functional and strategic activities of an organization.
Not only the current activities but the effect of disruption on major business changes, introducing new product or services for example, can be determined by BIA.

Most standards require that a business impact analysis should be reviewed at defined intervals appropriate for each organization and whenever any of the following occur:
* Significant changes in the internal business process, location or technology
* Significant changes in the external business environment – such as market or regulatory change &lt;ref&gt;BCI Good Practice Guidelines 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Document management==

In large information technology environments, personnel turnover is inevitable and must be planned as part of business continuity.  The solution to the problems associated with turnover, is complete and up-to- date documentation.  This ensures that new personnel will have the information they need to quickly become knowledgeable and productive with respect to the business functions they are tasked to support.  This also implies that business function related documentation is largely generated (rather than written) from existing systems and managed in an automated manner.

==Change management==
{{main|change management}}
Regulations require that changes to business functions be documented and tracked for auditing purposes and is designated as "change control".  This brings a level of stability to the business functions by requiring the support personnel to document and coordinate proposed changes to the underlying systems.  As this process becomes more and more automated, the emphasis will be less upon personnel control, and more upon regulatory compliance.

==Audit management==

One of the most costly and time-consuming aspects of information technology management is dealing with auditors.  One of the goals of business continuity is [[data center automation]], which includes audit management.  All modern business functions should be designed with the concept of automatically generating the requisite audit compliance information and documentation as part of conducting day-to-day business.  This dramatically reduces the time and cost associated with manually producing this information.

==Service level agreements (SLA)==

The interface between management and information technology is the [[Service level agreement]] (SLA). This provides a written contract stipulating the expectations of management with regard to the availability of a necessary business function, and the deliverables that information technology provides in support of that business function.

==Communications systems==

Another component of business continuity is communications in times of duress. Members of the disaster recovery team must be able to communicate effectively among themselves as well as with managers, directors, customers, partners, and even with the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/buildng-business-continuity.aspx|title= Building Communications Into Business Continuity|publisher= Dell.com|accessdate= 2012-06-22|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110201212950/http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/buildng-business-continuity.aspx|archivedate= 2011-02-01|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid some of the potential problems associated with disrupted communication channels, the business continuity plan should include a lead manager who will be in charge of all communications in that area, the cooperation of executives and public relations people, and scheduled exercises to put the plan into practice.

==Other components==
{{example farm|section|date=September 2018}}

The following is a list of logical entities within an information technology environment which aid business continuity:
* Virtualization (provides a means to achieve resiliency)
* Networking design (can support resiliency by design)
* Resource or service groups
* [[Journaling file system]] is a means to achieve resiliency
* [[High availability]], along with [[Redundancy (engineering)]], describes a principle or means of achieving of resiliency
* [[Continuous monitoring]] (can be a means to maintain resiliency or improve recoverability)

== Planning (BCP)==
{{Main|Business continuity planning}}

Planning, prevention, and preparation are a key part of any business continuity management system and have direct read across from civil contingencies planning.  The activity begins with understanding the business to identify potential risks and threats to critical business activities both internally and from the external environment.  It is also advisable to examine the resilience of suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mbtmag.com/blog/2017/12/holding-it-all-together Demrovsky, Chloe. ''Holding It All Together''. Manufacturing Business Technology Magazine, December 22, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The components of the business continuity methodology required for manifestation into a documented plan include:

Set of documents, instructions, and procedures which enable a business to respond to accidents, disasters, emergencies, and/or threats without any stoppage or hindrance in its key operations. Also called business resumption plan, [[disaster recovery plan]], or recovery plan.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Alan. Constructing a Successful Business Continuity Plan. ''Business Insurance Magazine'', March 9, 2015. http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150309/ISSUE0401/303159991/constructing-a-successful-business-continuity-plan&lt;/ref&gt;

Should also include:  purpose, scope, objectives and assumptions that were used to develop the plan.    Key accountabilities including authority to invoke, instructions subsequent to invocations, and a detailed communications plan must be included in the plan to ensure efficient resumption of operations.

Task of identifying, developing, acquiring, documenting, and testing procedures and resources that will ensure continuity of a firm's key operations in the event of an accident, disaster, emergency, and/or threat. It involves (1) risk mitigation planning (reducing possibility of the occurrence of adverse events), and (2) business recovery planning (ensuring continued operation in the aftermath of a disaster).

Guidelines are those things which are recommended to be performed according to a preset design plan.  However depending upon the needs and requirements of the target business function, these items may or may not be performed, or may be altered during implementation.

[[File:ThompsonWatergate.jpg|thumb|An example of a chairman in action – [[Sam Ervin]] (right), chairing the Senate [[Watergate]] hearings, 1973]]	

The '''chairman''' (also '''chair''') is the highest officer of an organized group such as a [[Board of directors|board]], a [[committee]], or a [[deliberative assembly]]. The person holding the office is typically elected or appointed by the members of the group, and the chairman presides over [[meeting]]s of the assembled group and conducts its business in an orderly fashion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 22|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some organizations, the chairman position is also called ''[[President (corporate title)|president]]'' (or other title),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author = Sturgis|edition = Fourth|year = 2001|title = [[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]]|isbn = 978-0-07-136513-0|publisher = McGraw-Hill|location = New York|page = 163|authorlink2 = American Institute of Parliamentarians|authorlink = Alice Sturgis|first = Alice|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; in others, where a board appoints a president (or other title), the two different terms are used for distinctly different positions.

==Terminology==
{{Wikidata property|P488}}
Other terms sometimes used for the office and its holder include ''chair'', ''chairperson'', ''chairwoman'', ''presiding officer'', ''president'', ''[[moderator (town official)|moderator]]'', ''facilitator'', and ''convenor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Marlis|editor-last=Hellinger|title=Gender across languages: The Linguistic Representation of Women and Men (IMPACT: Studies in Language and Society)|year=2001|publisher=Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|isbn=90-272-1841-2|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chairperson |title=Chairperson |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?query=Moderator&amp;title=21st|title=moderator|work=[[Chambers 21st Century Dictionary]] via Search Chambers |publisher=[[Chambers Harrap]]|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although ''convener'' means someone who summons (convenes) a meeting, the convener may take the chair.  The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd edition, 1989) offers this citation: 1833 Act 3–4 Will. IV, c. 46 §43 "The convener, who shall preside at such committee, shall be entitled to a casting vote." This meaning is most commonly found in assemblies with Scottish heritage.&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of a parliamentary chamber is often called the ''[[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =  http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/Admin/Speaker/Speeches/1/1/9/119e71c13d954e63bd049231bdee91e9.htm|title=Speeches: The many roles of the Speaker|date=2006-02-01|publisher=Office of the Speaker, [[Parliament of New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/principal/lord_speaker.cfm |title=About Parliament: The Lord Speaker |quote=... responsibilities of the Lord Speaker include chairing the Lords debating chamber,... |accessdate=2008-10-23 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609075343/http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/principal/lord_speaker.cfm |archivedate=2008-06-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''chair'' is sometimes used in lieu of chairman, in response to criticisms that using chairman is [[sexist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=Sex and society Volume 1: Abstinence – Gender Identity|year=2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Reference|location=New York|isbn=0-7614-7906-6|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dicrefman&gt;{{cite news | title=Chairman | year=2006 | publisher= | url =http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chairman | work =Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1) | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-22 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zinsser 2007 81"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zinsser|first=William|title=On writing well : the classic guide to writing nonfiction|year=2007|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York |isbn=0-06-089154-8|page=81|edition=30. anniversary ed., 7. ed., rev. and updated, [Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Chairperson | year=2006 | publisher= | url =http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chairperson | work =Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1) | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-27 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used today, and has been used as a substitute for chairman since the middle of the 17th century, with its earliest citation in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dated 1658–1659, only four years after the first citation for chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's dictionary of English usage.|year=1993|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=Springfield, Mass.|isbn=0-87779-132-5|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Wiktionary|chair|chairman|chairwoman|chairperson|preside}}Major dictionaries state that the word derives from "chair" (a seat or office of authority) and "man", a person.&lt;ref name="dicrefman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the ''American Heritage Dictionary'', the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', the online edition of the current Merriam-Webster Dictionary, ''Word Origins'' by Anatoly Liberman (page 88), ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'' (page 235)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===

A 1994 Canadian study found the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' newspaper referring to most presiding men as "chairman", and to most presiding women as "chairperson" or as "chairwoman". The ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' uses "chairman" for men and "chairperson" for women. An analysis of the [[British National Corpus]] found chairman used 1,142 times, chairperson 130 times and chairwoman 68 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Romaine|first= Suzanne|title= Communicating gender|year= 1999|publisher= Erlbaum|location= Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0-8058-2925-3|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Association of Parliamentarians]] does not approve using "chairperson".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing (For writers, editors and speakers)|last = Miller|first = Casey|publisher = iUniverse.com|year = 2000|isbn = 0-595-15921-4|location = Lincoln, NE|pages = 32|last2 = Swift|first2 = Kate|edition = 2nd|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KY_XiQa5PhMC&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[United Press International]] all use "chairwoman" or "chairman" when referring to women, and forbid use of "chair" or of "chairperson" except in direct quotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= editor|first= Paul R.

=== Examples ===
The word ''chair'' can refer to the place from which the holder of the office presides, whether on a chair, at a lectern, or elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During meetings, the person presiding is said to be "in the chair" and is also referred to as "the chair".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Parliamentary procedure]] requires that members address the "chair" as "Mr. (or Madam) Chairman (or Chair or Chairperson)" rather than using a name –  one of many customs intended to maintain the presiding officer's impartiality and to ensure an objective and impersonal approach.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sturgis|2001|p = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the presiding officer of the lower house of a legislative body, such as the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], is frequently titled the ''Speaker'', while the upper house, such as the [[United States Senate|Senate]], is commonly chaired by a ''President''. In his 1992 [[State of the Union address]], then-U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] used "chairman" for men and "chair" for women.

In the British [[music hall]] tradition, the Chairman was the [[master of ceremonies]] who announced the performances and was responsible for controlling any rowdy elements in the audience.  The role was popularised on British TV in the 1960s and 1970s by [[Leonard Sachs]], the Chairman on the variety show ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]''.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Richard Anthony| last1= Baker| year= 2014| title= British Music Hall: An Illustrated History| publisher= Pen &amp; Sword| location= Barnsley| page=207 | isbn= 978-1-78383-118-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Chairman" as a quasi-title gained particular resonance when socialist states from 1917 onward shunned more traditional [[leadership]] labels and stressed the collective control of ''soviets'' (councils or committees) by beginning to refer to executive figureheads as "Chairman of the X Committee". [[Vladimir Lenin]], for example, officially functioned as the head of Soviet Russia not as tsar or as president but in roles such as "Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian SFSR".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 =  Cawthorne| first1 =  Nigel| author-link1 = Nigel Cawthorne| title = Stalin: The Murderous Career of the Red Tsar| url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=2CAEAwAAQBAJ| publisher = Arcturus Publishing| publication-date = 2012| isbn = 978-1-84858-951-3| accessdate = 2015-02-25| quote = [...] Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, Molotov and Abel Yenukidze [...] began discussing the structure of the new government.

Note in particular the popular standard method for referring to [[Mao Zedong]]: "Chairman Mao" (officially: [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]]).

== Roles &amp; Responsibilities ==

=== Duties at meetings ===
[[File:Christina Magnuson group 2016.jpg|thumb|As Chairman, [[Princess Christina, Mrs. Magnuson]] presides over the 2016 annual meeting of the ''Friends of the [[Confidencen|Ulriksdal Palace Theater]]''.]]
In addition to the administrative or executive duties in organizations, the chairman has the duties of presiding over meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such duties at meetings include:

* Calling the meeting to order
* Determining if a [[quorum]] is present
* Announcing the items on the [[order of business]] or [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] as they come up
*[[Recognition (parliamentary procedure)|Recognition]] of members to have the [[Floor (legislative)|floor]]
* Enforcing the rules of the group
* Putting all questions ([[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]]) to a vote
* Adjourning the meeting

While presiding, the chairman should remain impartial and not interrupt a speaker if the speaker has the floor and is following the rules of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=44}}: "The presiding officer must never interrupt a speaker simply because he knows more about the matter than the speaker does."&lt;/ref&gt; In committees or small boards, the chairman votes along with the other members. However, in assemblies or larger boards, the chairman should vote only when it can affect the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#1|title=Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 1)|date=|website=The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher=The Robert's Rules Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112102258/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#1|archivedate=2004-11-12|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2015-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting, the chairman only has one vote (i.e. the chairman cannot vote twice and cannot override the decision of the group unless the organization has specifically given the chairman such authority).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Powers and authority ===
The powers of the chairman vary widely across organizations. In some organizations the chairman has the authority to hire staff and make financial decisions, while in others the chairman only makes recommendations to a [[board of directors]], and still others the chairman has no executive powers and is mainly a [[Spokesperson|spokesman]] for the organization. The amount of power given to the chairman depends on the type of organization, its structure, and the rules it has created for itself.

=== Disciplinary procedures ===
If the chairman exceeds the given authority, engages in misconduct, or fails to perform the duties, the chairman may face disciplinary procedures. Such procedures may include [[censure]], suspension, or [[Declare the chair vacant|removal from office]]. The rules of the particular organization would provide details on who can perform these disciplinary procedures and the extent that they can be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title=Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|date=|website=The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher=The Robert's Rules Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112102258/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|archivedate=2004-11-12|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2015-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, whoever appointed or elected the chairman has the power to discipline this officer.

==Public corporations==
There are three common types of chairman in public corporations.

=== Chairman and CEO{{Anchor|Chairman and CEO}}===

* Chairman and CEO – The CEO may also hold the title of chairman, in which case the board frequently names an independent member of the board as a lead director.

=== Executive chairman ===

* Executive chairman – An office separate from that of CEO, where the titleholder wields influence over company operations, such as [[Larry Ellison]] of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Douglas Flint]] of [[HSBC]] and [[Steve Case]] of the former [[AOL Time Warner]]. In particular, the group chairmanship of HSBC is considered the top position of that institution, outranking the chief executive, and is responsible for leading the board and representing the company in meetings with government figures. Prior to the creation of the group management board in 2006, HSBC's chairman essentially held the duties of a chief executive at an equivalent institution, while HSBC's chief executive served as the deputy. After the 2006 reorganization, the management cadre ran the business, while the chairman oversaw the controls of the business through compliance and audit and the direction of the business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8019235/HSBC-investors-against-Michael-Geoghegan-becoming-chairman.html HSBC investors against Michael Geoghegan becoming chairman].

Telegraph. Retrieved on 2013-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-executive chairman ===

* Non-executive chairman – also a separate post from the CEO, unlike an executive chairman, a non-executive chairman does not interfere in day-to-day company matters. Across the world, many companies have separated the roles of chairman and CEO, often resulting in a non-executive chairman, saying that this move improves corporate governance.

The non-executive chairman's duties are typically limited to matters directly related to the board, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Keith | last = Kefgen | title = The Non-Executive Chairman Comes of Age | date = 2004-05-11 | publisher = HVS | url = http://www.hvs.com/Jump/?aid=1033 | work = HVS web site | accessdate = 2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Chairing the meetings of the board.
* Organizing and coordinating the board's activities, such as by setting its annual agenda.
* Reviewing and evaluating the performance of the CEO and the other board members.

=== Examples ===
Many U.S. companies have an executive chairman, and this method of organization is sometimes called the American model. Having a non-executive chair is common in the United Kingdom and Canada, and is sometimes called the British model. Expert opinion is rather evenly divided over which is the preferable model overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/jan2008/ca2008018_642807.htm |title=Splitting the Chairman and CEO roles |accessdate=2011-04-03 |last=Behan |first=Beverly |date=10 January 2008 |work=BusinessWeek |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416101510/http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/jan2008/ca2008018_642807.htm |archivedate=2011-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vice chairman and deputy chairman==
A ''vice-chairman'' or ''deputy chairman'', subordinate to the chairman, is sometimes chosen to assist the chairman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/vice-chairman|title=vice-chairman|publisher=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to serve as chairman in the absence of the chairman, or when a motion involving the chairman is being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of the chairman and vice chairman, groups sometimes elect a ''chairman [[pro tempore]]'' to fill the role for a single meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some organizations that have both titles, deputy chairman ranks higher than vice chairman, as there are often multiple vice chairs but only a single deputy chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rbccm.com/about/cid-264063.html|title=Leadership|website=Rbccm.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of deputy chairman title on its own usually has only an advisory role and not an operational one (such as [[Ted Turner]] at Time Warner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/ustv/news/a10201/ted-turner-quits-as-aoltw-vice-chairman.html|title=Ted Turner quits as AOLTW Vice Chairman – TV News|author=|date=2003-01-29|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unrelated definition of vice chair and deputy chair describes an executive who is higher ranking or has more seniority than an [[Executive Vice President|executive vice president]] (EVP). Sometimes, EVPs report to a vice chair, who in turn reports directly to the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) (so vice chairs in effect constitute an additional layer of management), while other vice chairs have more responsibilities but are otherwise on an equal tier with EVPs. Executives with the title vice chair and deputy chair are usually ''not'' members of the board of directors. The [[Royal Bank of Canada]] previously used "deputy chair" (i.e. [[Anthony S. Fell]], Deputy Chairman of RBC, who was also Chairman and CEO of RBC Dominion Securities) and "vice chair" (i.e. Peter Currie, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer) in their inner management circle until 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4496">'''Common Impact''' is an American [[nonprofit organization]] headquartered in Boston, [[Massachusetts]]. It catalyzes a new, connected economy by aligning business and social purpose, connecting [[business]] professionals to local nonprofits that need assistance in [[information technology]], [[marketing]], [[human resources]], operations and finance. Common Impact's model for [[social change]] involves [[social innovation]], [[employee engagement]], and [[corporate social responsibility]].

==History==

Theresa M. Ellis co-founded Common Impact in 2000 with Zach Goldstein, both graduates of [[Dartmouth College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.dartmouth.edu/default.aspx?id=495|title=Young Alumni of Dartmouth|accessdate=2008-07-25|publisher=Dartmouth College|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071220234714/http://alumni.dartmouth.edu/default.aspx?id=495|archivedate=2007-12-20|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Ellis helped connect her friend, an IT professional, to a [[Washington, D.C.]] nonprofit needing assistance with a [[database]] while she was working for another nonprofit. She founded Common Impact to help more [[corporate]] professionals [[Volunteering|volunteer]] their professional [[skills]] and help solve [[social problems]] in the areas of [[health]], [[House|housing]] and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://alumni.dartmouth.edu/default.aspx?id=879 |title=Celebrating 35 Years of Women at Dartmouth| accessdate=2008-07-25 |publisher=Dartmouth College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Many of the projects between corporate employees and nonprofit organizations involve improving databases, creating new marketing materials and restructuring human resources tools. Before each project, Common Impact screens the nonprofit and matches it to a trained team of business professionals who are skilled in the project area. A few examples of projects include redesigning a website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/04/12/more_than_a_helping_hand_for_charities/?page=1.com= |title=More than a helping hand for charities |accessdate=2008-07-15 |publisher=The Boston Globe| first=Sacha | last=Pfeiffer | date=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and evaluating marketing materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ca.com/us/about/content.aspx?cid=145489 |title=CA Together in the Spotlight |accessdate=2008-07-22 |publisher=CA Together in the Spotlight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

Common Impact "helps nonprofits evaluate their internal operations. Then it finds corporate volunteers who can work with them to improve their technology, marketing, and human resource functions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/04/12/more_than_a_helping_hand_for_charities/?page=1.com= |title=More than a helping hand for charities |accessdate=2008-07-15 |publisher=The Boston Globe| first=Sacha | last=Pfeiffer | date=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects have generated over $6 million in resources for the [[nonprofit sector]].  Businesses are increasingly recognizing the importance of [[volunteering]] professional skills as more employees want to help their communities &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120940853880850351 |title=The Latest Office Perk: Getting Paid to Volunteer |accessdate=2008-07-25 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal| first=Sarah E. | last=Needleman | date=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 400 corporate employees from companies such as Cisco, Genworth Financial, Fidelity Investments and State Street Corporation have volunteered their skills by working with Common Impact. Some examples of projects Fidelity Investments volunteers worked on are fundraising, case management, databases, and website design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bcccc.net/index.cfm/fuseaction/Page.viewPage/pageId/1620 |title=In Good Company: Fidelity |publisher=Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has connected business professionals to over 150 [[nonprofit organizations]] in [[Greater Boston]], [[New York City]], and [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The [[employee engagement]] relationships Common Impact fosters have translated into an estimated 9,000 hours of skilled volunteer time donated to nonprofit organizations.

'''Denis O'Brien''' (born 19 April 1958) is an Irish businessman and the founder and owner of [[Digicel]] and [[Communicorp]]. He was listed among the World's Top 200 Billionaires in 2015 and is also Ireland's richest native-born citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moriarty-tribunal.ie/|title=Moriarty Tribunal – Inquiry into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters|website=moriarty-tribunal.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carlos_slim" /&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes_world_billionaires&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/14|title=The World's Billionaires|magazine=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32936667|title=Denis O'Brien: High court injunction prevents Irish media reporting on businessman's finances|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|location=London|date=29 May 2015|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His business interests also extend to aircraft leasing ([[Aergo Capital]]), utilities support ([[Actavo]]), petroleum ([[Topaz Energy]], until 2016), and football (soccer), being a minority shareholder of [[Celtic F.C.]]. O'Brien was implicated by the [[Moriarty Tribunal]] as having improperly influenced the decision to award a mobile phone license to the [[Esat Digifone]] consortium, which he chaired.

== Early life ==
O'Brien was born in the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and grew up in the [[Ballsbridge]] area of [[Dublin]]. His father was a salesperson for a veterinary pharmaceutical company, and he often accompanied his father on business trips, where he learned how to "sell and to present". He attended [[The High School, Dublin|The High School]] in [[Rathgar]], and although he was suspended for disciplinary problems, his talent for [[rugby football|rugby]] was such that he was asked to return so that he could participate in a championship for the school.&lt;ref name="carlos_slim" /&gt;

He studied politics, history and logic at [[University College Dublin]], graduating in 1977. After winning a scholarship from [[Boston College]] while attending UCD, he completed an MBA in corporate finance there in 1982. Upon his return to Dublin, he was employed as an assistant manager in a local bank, but left that job and became a [[personal assistant]] to [[Tony Ryan]], owner of an aircraft leasing company.&lt;ref name="carlos_slim" /&gt;

== Career ==
O'Brien owns [[Communicorp]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/denis-o-brien-s-communicorp-sells-latvian-radio-group-1.2365092|title=Denis O’Brien’s Communicorp sells Latvian radio group|language=en-US|access-date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a media holding company which operates across Europe,  particularly in Ireland where it dominates national radio (apart from RTÉ) including stations like [[Newstalk]] and [[Today FM]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' has described him as "the biggest player in Ireland's media landscape" and notes that "his Independent News &amp; Media group controls the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' as well as the ''[[Irish Daily Star]]'', the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'', the ''[[Sunday World]]'', Dublin's ''[[Evening Herald]]'' and regional newspapers,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/30/world/europe/ireland-rte-denis-obrien.html|title=Irish Media, Fearing Lawsuits, Steers Clear of a Billionaire|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; through his minority shareholding in the group. According to [[Fintan O'Toole]], O'Brien has "been allowed to take effective control of the largest Irish newspaper group and of two of [Ireland's] three national talk radio stations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/jun/02/democracy-in-danger-when-one-man-exercises-excessive-private-power|title=Democracy in danger when one man exercises excessive private power|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London|date=2 June 2015|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien also owns telecoms provider [[Digicel]], which operates in 31 markets across the Caribbean, Central America and Oceania.

===Communicorp===
O'Brien established Communicorp in 1989, with the company currently owning 42 radio stations in eight European countries. 

===Esat Digifone===
O'Brien set up and chaired the [[Esat Digifone]] consortium which acquired a mobile phone licence in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lucy|last=Gaffney|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/news-features/we-won-because-ours-was-simply-the-best-bid-55323.html|title=We won because our was simply the best bid|newspaper=The Sunday Business Post|date=27 March 2011|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Esat Digifone's bid defeated five other applicants, some of whom included major international operators, in controversial circumstances that became the subject of investigation by the Moriarty Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Court action on the awarding of the license by the Persona grouping has been signaled.&lt;/ref&gt; The Esat Digifone consortium was 40% owned by O'Brien's interests, 40% owned by [[Telenor]], the Norwegian state telecoms operator, with the balance being owned by International Investment and Underwriting (IIU), an investment vehicle owned by [[Dermot Desmond]].

On 7 November 1997, Esat Telecom Group plc held an initial public offering and was listed on the [[Irish Stock Exchange]], [[London Stock Exchange]], and [[NASDAQ]] Stock Markets. There were differences between O'Brien and Telenor, however, ESAT Digifone boomed. Telenor made a bid for control of the company, but O'Brien chose to sell to BT in 2000.&lt;ref name=telegraph_northedge_splash/&gt; Esat became a wholly owned subsidiary of [[BT Group plc|BT]] and was delisted from the stock market. O'Brien personally netted €317 million from the sale.&lt;ref name="TelegraphOBrien"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Russell|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8399790/Denis-OBrien-paid-minister-to-help-secure-Irish-phone-licence.html|title=Denis O'Brien 'paid minister to help secure Irish phone licence'|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=22 March 2011|accessdate=24 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305152931/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8399790/Denis-OBrien-paid-minister-to-help-secure-Irish-phone-licence.html|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Moriarty Tribunal]] found almost beyond doubt that O'Brien's was awarded this contract due to payments he made to [[Michael Lowry]], the then communications minister, who unduly influenced the bidding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Keena|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/cab-seeks-to-question-denis-o-brien-on-tribunal-findings-1.2490189|title=Cab seeks to question Denis O’Brien on tribunal findings|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=9 January 2016|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Esat===
After the sale of Esat, O'Brien moved to Portugal where he owns the Quinta do Lago golf complex. He later took up residency in [[Sliema]], [[Malta]].&lt;ref name="telegraph_northedge_splash"&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Northedge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2815836/Denis-OBrien-The-man-who-wants-to-make-a-splash-at-Independent-News-and-Media.html|title=Denis O'Brien: The man who wants to make a splash at Independent News &amp; Media – Telegraph|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]]|location=[[London, UK|London]]|issn=0307-1235|oclc=49632006|date=16 September 2007|accessdate=21 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305152450/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2815836/Denis-OBrien-The-man-who-wants-to-make-a-splash-at-Independent-News-and-Media.html|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His spokesperson is [[James Morrissey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/05/29/its-important-people-stand-up-for-democracy/|title='It's Important People Stand Up For Democracy'|date=29 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531230355/http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/05/29/its-important-people-stand-up-for-democracy/|archivedate=31 May 2015|quote=Denis O'Brien's tireless spokesman James Morrissey went on RTÉ Radio One's Today with Sean O'Rourke [hosted by Keelin Shanley] this morning to put forward his client's case for wishing to prevent media outlets reporting Catherine Murphy's speech to the dáil yesterday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/05/31/morrissey-and-mar/|title=Morrissey And Mar'|date=31 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531225937/http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/05/31/morrissey-and-mar/|archivedate=31 May 2015|quote=Denis O’Brien's spokesman James Morrissey and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin engaged in a pre-recorded debate with Richard Crowley for RTÉ's This Week on the ongoing constitutional brouhaha.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aergo Capital===
In 1999, O'Brien co-founded aircraft leasing company [[Aergo Capital]], registered in Dublin, with offices in Johannesburg, Nairobi, Santiago and Singapore. It owns and operates a fleet of 103 commercial aircraft. The company is valued at US$250 million and has debts in the region of US$166 million.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} O'Brien controls about 83 per cent of Aergo and, along with his father, sits on the company's six-member board. Aergo's clients include [[Alitalia]], [[Jet Airways]], [[South African Airways]], [[KLM]] and [[DHL Aviation|DHL]]. In July 2008, Aergo acquired the [[Safair]] aircraft-leasing division of Imperial Holdings for €110 million, taking over the division's 33 planes and leasing a further nine aircraft from the parent company.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} In November 2010, Aergo sold Safair, netting $35 million. Accounts filed in late-2011 showed pre-tax profits increased to $29.4 million over the previous 12 months from $2.68 million in 2009, with the number of employees decreasing from 166 to 15 over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/profits-soar-at-obriens-aircraft-leasing-firm-175764.html|title=Profits soar at O'Brien's aircraft leasing firm|work=Irish Examiner|date=2 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601175806/http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/profits-soar-at-obriens-aircraft-leasing-firm-175764.html|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digicel===
After exiting the Irish mobile phone market, O'Brien started to compete for mobile phone licenses in the Caribbean through his company [[Digicel]].&lt;ref name="pirate"&gt;{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Keena|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0710/1224274381817.html|title=Plucky David or pirate of the Caribbean?|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=10 July 2010|accessdate=25 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305153108/http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/plucky-david-or-pirate-of-the-caribbean-1.620228|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Brien is involved in the Pacific with operations in Samoa, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Nauru and Papua New Guinea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digicelpacific.com/en/about/our-locations|title=Our locations|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305153738/http://www.digicelpacific.com/en/about/our-locations|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Brien is the owner of [[Haiti]]'s largest telecom company, Digicel. O'Brien pledged an immediate €3.5 million of his money to assist desperate Haitians within hours of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Patricia|last1=McDonagh|first2=Jason|last2=O'Brien|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/americas/obrien-pledges-836435m-as-charities-plead-for-money-2013043.html|title=O'Brien pledges €3.5m as charities plead for money|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Denis O'Brien|date=14 January 2010|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Digicel's 900 staff members in Haiti died in the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=Smyth|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/0114/1224262303582.html|title=All Irish citizens in area alive and well, says Foreign Affairs|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=14 January 2010|accessdate=14 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305154006/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/all-irish-citizens-in-area-alive-and-well-says-foreign-affairs-1.1268285|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digicel is Haiti's largest single investor.&lt;ref name="19022010 Silicon Republic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/15316/comms/haiti-names-obrien-goodwill-ambassador |title=Haiti names Denis O'Brien goodwill ambassador |date=19 February 2010 |publisher=''Silicon Republic'' |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224233933/http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/15316/comms/haiti-names-obrien-goodwill-ambassador |archivedate=24 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digicel was involved in an extensive court battle with the Jamaican Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) throughout the 2000s. The issue originally arose after [[Phillip Paulwell]], the then Jamaican minister of industry, commerce and technology, instructed the OUR to refrain from interfering with the pricing policies of Digicel, after the regulator had itself instructed Digicel to amend its interconnectivity fees.&lt;ref name=JO&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Privy-Council-hits-Digicel_7347055|title=Blow to Digicel|newspaper=Jamaica Observer|date=22 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305151436/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Privy-Council-hits-Digicel_7347055|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Paulwell was ruled to have had no power to issue the instruction to the OUR, Digicel unsuccessfully appealed the ruling first at the Jamaican Supreme Court, which overturned the ruling, though it was subsequently upheld by Court of Appeal after a counter-appeal by OUR, and then at Jamaica's Privy Council.&lt;ref name=JO /&gt;

In January 2014, the ''[[Financial Times]]''{{'}}s Telecoms Correspondent wrote of O'Brien's intention to expand Digicel into next-generation mobile and fixed line services, with O'Brien quoted as being excited by the prospect of a "world order [that] is changing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=Thomas|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a74c6b44-80fb-11e3-95aa-00144feab7de.html#axzz3bx5AjUJH|title=Irish billionaire Denis O'Brien plans ‘massive’ telecoms push|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=20 January 2014|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the renaming, Actavo had three divisions — industrial services, networks and structural — and was forecasting revenues of €400m in the same year.

===Topaz Energy===
O'Brien owned [[Topaz Energy]] until early 2016, having bought €300 million of its loans from [[Irish Bank Resolution Corporation]] (IBRC) in 2013. In May 2014, O'Brien appointed former [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]] to the board of Topaz to join himself, his nephew (who was also CEO of Smiles Dental), Sean Corkey (CEO of O'Brien's SiteServ), Lucy Gaffney (chairperson of O'Brien's Communicorp) and Colm Doherty (former managing director of [[Allied Irish Banks]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/topaz-brian-cowen-1445910-May2014/|title=Denis O'Brien owned Topaz appoints Brian Cowen as director: A number of O'Brien's other close associates have also been appointed to the board|work=TheJournal.ie|date=2 May 2014|accessdate=2 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602230141/http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/topaz-brian-cowen-1445910-May2014/|archivedate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, Topaz's parent company Kendrick Investments announced it would buy all of [[Esso]]'s Irish operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/esso-topaz-denis-obrien-buy-out-1832019-Dec2014/|title=Denis O'Brien-owned Topaz to take control of 38 Esso stations|work=TheJournal.ie|date=12 December 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602225719/http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/esso-topaz-denis-obrien-buy-out-1832019-Dec2014/|archivedate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Profits at Topaz increased between April 2013 and March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/topaz-energy-record-profits-14-million-denis-obrien-1945518-Feb2015/|title=Denis O'Brien is making more money from his petrol stations|work=TheJournal.ie|date=18 February 2015|accessdate=18 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602225550/http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/topaz-energy-record-profits-14-million-denis-obrien-1945518-Feb2015/|archivedate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale of Topaz was announced in January 2016. It is estimated that O’Brien sold the network of 444 filling stations for about €450 million, more than double what he paid to gain control of it from the special liquidators of the state-owned Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) in 2013. The sale also included a commercial fuels operation, with over 30 depots and two owned terminals.

In February 2016, [[Alimentation Couche-Tard]], a Canadian company that operates more than 15,000 convenience stores worldwide confirmed that it completed the acquisition of Topaz after European competition regulators approved the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corpo.couche-tard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2016-02-01-Press-Release-Closing-Topaz.pdf |title=COUCHE-TARD COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF TOPAZ IN IRELAND| publisher=Alimentation Couche-Tard |date=1 February 2016| accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmet O’Neill, a nephew of O’Brien and formerly chief executive of Smiles Dental, stepped down as managing director of Topaz following completion of the transaction. 

Topaz had more than 2,000 employees and close to 35 per cent of the consumer market in Ireland at the time of the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/topaz-sale-to-couche-tard-completed-new-md-named-1.2518090|title=Topaz sale to Couche-Tard completed, new MD named|website=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, O'Brien is listed as having a "significant interest" in AIM-listed Sterling Energy.&lt;ref name=sterling_energy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sterlingenergyuk.com/html/investor/capita.html|title=Share Capital|publisher=Sterling Energy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601174350/http://www.sterlingenergyuk.com/html/investor/capita.html|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has production in the United States and a wide portfolio of exploration interests, mostly in West Africa.

==Family==
O'Brien married Catherine Walsh, who helped Communicorp expand into the Czech Republic, in August 1997. The couple have four children.&lt;ref name="carlos_slim" /&gt;

== Moriarty Tribunal ==
{{main article|Moriarty Tribunal}}
The Moriarty Tribunal's second and final report found that [[Michael Lowry]], Ireland's then energy and communications minister, assisted O'Brien in his bid to secure a mobile phone contract for Esat Digifone, a key foundation of O'Brien's personal wealth. The tribunal found that this happened after Lowry received a $50,000 payment from O'Brien via a circuitous route involving a complex arrangement of third parties and offshore accounts. It said that it was "beyond doubt" that Lowry gave "substantive information to Denis O'Brien, of significant value and assistance to him in securing the [mobile] licence" during at least two meetings between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moriarty-tribunal.ie|title=Honourable Justice Michael Moriarty|publisher=[[Moriarty Tribunal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0322/breaking17.html|title=Moriarty says Lowry helped O'Brien win mobile licence|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=22 March 2011|accessdate=22 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305154503/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/moriarty-says-lowry-helped-o-brien-win-mobile-licence-1.873588|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tribunal was not a court of law; its findings were "legally sterile".

On 15 October 2011, Today FM confirmed Sam Smyth's Sunday radio show was being dropped. He had been presenting it for 14 years. Smyth had previously offended his bosses by commenting in a newspaper and on television about Today FM's owner O'Brien's involvement in the Moriarty Tribunal. Smyth said on air the next morning that he had been told not to talk about the end of his show and stopped one of his guests from talking about it too "before someone comes downstairs and pulls a wire we better move onto something else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/today-fms-sam-smyth-changes-topic-during-discussion-about-his-own-sacking-255216-Oct2011/|title=Today FM's Smyth changes topic during discussion about his own sacking|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=16 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305151315/http://www.thejournal.ie/today-fms-sam-smyth-changes-topic-during-discussion-about-his-own-sacking-255216-Oct2011/|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said it was concerned at the development, but Today FM stated that "the decision was made to address a decline in listenership and was part of an initiative to improve programming quality." The Today FM board supported the decision, which was one of several programming changes made by Willy O'Reilly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Charlie|last=Taylor|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/1016/breaking9.html|title=Smyth show to end on Today FM|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=16 October 2011|accessdate=16 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305160530/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/smyth-show-to-end-on-today-fm-1.885361|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Irish Independent'', of which O'Brien is a leading shareholder, reported that Anton Savage was being lined up to replace Smyth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ronald|last=Quinlan|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/savage-to-replace-dropped-smyth-on-today-fm-slot-2907563.html|title=Savage to replace dropped Smyth on Today FM slot|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Denis O'Brien|date=16 October 2011|accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with the media==

===Communicorp===
{{main article|Communicorp}}
O'Brien formed Communicorp in 1989. It launched its radio operations in Ireland that same year and entered the [[Czech Republic]] in 1992. It later added stations in [[Bulgaria]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=finfacts_16072007/&gt; Based in Dublin, the company now owns 42 radio stations in eight European countries, including Ireland's [[Newstalk]], [[Today FM]], [[Dublin's 98FM]], [[SPIN 1038]], [[TXFM]] and [[SPIN South West]]. O'Brien owns a majority of Ireland's radio stations (all stations apart from those run by state broadcaster RTÉ), save some regional and local stations.&lt;ref name=kenny_afraid_of_DeNob/&gt;

O'Brien's Communicorp was the highest bidder for [[Emap]]'s Irish operations when that company decided to sell its radio stations, buying [[FM104]], [[Highland Radio]] and Today FM on 14 July 2007.&lt;ref name=finfacts_16072007&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_1010600.shtml|title=Denis O'Brien's Communicorp to acquire Irish radio stations -Today FM, FM104 and Highland Radio - in €200m deal|work=Finfacts|date=16 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601184902/http://www.finfacts.ie/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_1010600.shtml|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2007/0716/91245-emap/|title=Emap sells radio stations to O'Brien|publisher=RTÉ News|date=16 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305184807/http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0716/91256-obriend/|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=50147|title=O'Brien buys Emap radio stations in €200m deal|newspaper=The Irish Emigrant|date=18 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601184709/http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=50147|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, the [[Broadcasting Commission of Ireland]] (BCI) approved Communicorp's proposed takeover of Today FM and Highland Radio, but not FM104.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/blow-for-obriens-200m-radio-bid-44789.html|title=Blow for O'Brien's €200m radio bid|work=Irish Examiner|date=9 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601185911/http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/blow-for-obriens-200m-radio-bid-44789.html|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Arthur|last=Beesley|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/denis-o-brien-cannot-buy-fm104-as-part-of-200m-deal-1.970714|title=Denis O'Brien cannot buy FM104 as part of €200m deal|work=The Irish Times|date=9 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601185635/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/denis-o-brien-cannot-buy-fm104-as-part-of-200m-deal-1.970714|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was completed by January 2008.&lt;ref name=times_12012008&gt;{{cite news|first=Ciarán|last=Hancock|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/o-brien-seals-200m-deal-for-emap-s-three-irish-radio-outlets-1.927929|title=O'Brien seals €200m deal for Emap's three Irish radio outlets|work=The Irish Times|date=12 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601190146/http://www.irishtimes.com/business/o-brien-seals-200m-deal-for-emap-s-three-irish-radio-outlets-1.927929|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a [[Competition Authority (Ireland)|Competition Authority]] decision, Communicorp was required to sell-on FM104, which it did (to [[UTV Media]]) immediately upon its acquisition.

===Independent News &amp; Media===
{{main article|Independent News &amp; Media}}
In January 2006, O'Brien took a stake in [[Tony O'Reilly]]'s Independent News &amp; Media (INM). At the beginning of June 2007, O'Reilly tabled a resolution to strengthen rules on the disclosure of beneficial interests. This was regarded as a defensive measure that would empower IN&amp;M to monitor any additional accumulation of shares in the company. The resolution passed and empowers IN&amp;M to withhold dividends from investors who do not comply with a request for information on the ownership of a holding of shares. O'Brien, speaking on [[RTÉ Radio]], described the resolution as a "retrograde" measure, saying that the resolution was designed to protect the interests of O'Reilly's family against a hostile bidder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=McEnanaey|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/obrien-branded-a-dissident-and-accused-of-destabilising-company-1329206.html|title=O'Brien branded a 'dissident' and accused of destabilising company|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Denis O'Brien|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, at the same time as completing the purchase of [[Today FM]] (then Ireland's last national radio station independent of O'Brien and state broadcaster RTÉ), O'Brien increased his INM shareholding to become that company's second-biggest shareholder behind Tony O'Reilly.&lt;ref name=times_12012008/&gt;

In 2012, O'Brien seized control of INM from O'Reilly, bringing to an end four decades of that family's ownership. Brett Chenoweth, the chief executive of APN News and Media (INM's Australian arm), was forced to resign in 2013. Its Chairman Peter Hunt and three independent directors – Melinda Conrad, John Harvey and John Maasland – also resigned in a dispute with INM. Shortly before this, INM announced it would sell South African arm of its business for £146 million to a consortium fronted by [[Iqbal Survé]], a former doctor of [[Nelson Mandela]]. This followed the 2010 sale of ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' to Russian billionaire [[Alexander Lebedev]] for £1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/18/independent-news-media-resignation-australia|title=Irish publishing group ousts Australian chief executive|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London|date=18 February 2013|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2012, O'Brien holds a 29.9% stake in INM, making him the largest shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/media/denis-obrien-ups-stake-in-independent-news-and-media-to-299pc-3100593.html|title=Denis O'Brien ups stake in Independent News &amp; Media to 29.9pc|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Denis O'Brien|date=4 May 2012|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to the O'Reilly's family stake of around 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Sweney|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/08/inm-oust-chairman-finance-chief|title=INM investors oust chairman and finance chief|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London|issn=0261-3077|oclc=60623878|date=8 June 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305151707/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/08/inm-oust-chairman-finance-chief|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of Friday 7 December 2012, O'Brien's friend and solicitor Paul Meagher contacted the ''Sunday Independent'' with orders from O'Brien to 'kill' a story concerning environment minister [[Phil Hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Tighe|url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CIiTxqmWwAAkOlM.jpg|title=INM was asked to 'kill' Phil coverage|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday 19 July 2014, group editor of INM [[Stephen Rae (editor)|Stephen Rae]] ordered the presses to be stopped to amend a column written by ''Sunday Independent'' editor [[Anne Harris (journalist)|Anne Harris]] which featured references to O'Brien. Copies of the original article did however appear, allowing comparisons between the two. Harris originally wrote: "Denis O'Brien is the major shareholder in INM. In theory, with 29% of the shares, he does not control it. ''In practice, he does''." Rae had the last sentence deleted. Harris also wrote: "The question is whether he understands newspapers. In order to confront the truths in our society, we must have a free press. ''With the restrictive charter for journalists proposed last year, and some garrotive (sic) new structures, Denis O'Brien does not make this easy.''" This was changed to: "The question is whether he understands newspapers. In order to confront the truths in our society, we must have a free press. ''If the restrictive charter for journalists proposed last year, along with some other structural changes, are anything to go by, it might be instructive for him to listen to journalists, troublesome and all as they are.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jul/28/irish-independent-denis-o-brien|title=Irish newspaper editor's column was changed after going to press|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London|date=28 July 2014|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March 2018 the [[Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement]] (ODCE) in Ireland said it would apply to the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] of Ireland to appoint inspectors to Independent News and Media to investigate an alleged data breach. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2018/0324/949882-corporate-watchdog-inm/&lt;/ref&gt; According to an affidavit filed by the ODCE, invoices associated with the data interrogation were discharged by Blaydon Limited, a company owned by Denis O'Brien, INM's largest shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/inm-to-pursue-wrongdoers-for-cost-of-odce-inquiry-into-corporate-governance-36805525.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media lawsuits===
O'Brien has threatened to sue the journalist and broadcaster [[Vincent Browne]]; as the ''Sunday Independent'' wrote at the time: "Suing the individual journalist is a tactic usually designed to instill a fear of financial ruin into the writer of the allegedly offending article, especially when the potential litigant is somebody of Mr O'Brien's means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/denis-obrien-makes-personal-libel-threat-to-vincent-browne-26883578.html|title=Denis O'Brien makes personal libel threat to Vincent Browne|newspaper=Sunday Independent|date=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2013, O'Brien sued the ''[[Irish Daily Mail]]'' for defamation over his numerous appearances in RTÉ news reports on the relief effort after the Haiti earthquake in an attempt to use the publicity to deflect attention from the Moriarty Tribunal. The court awarded O'Brien €150,000. The case was a landmark one as it was the first time a journalist had attempted to use the honest opinion defence. The newspaper's solicitor said it was a sad day for [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland|freedom of expression in Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0214/367770-defamation-denis-obrien/|title=Denis O'Brien wins defamation case against Irish Daily Mail|work=RTÉ News|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|date=14 February 2013|accessdate=14 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305161225/http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0214/367770-defamation-denis-obrien/|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Fiona|last=Gartland|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2013/0214/breaking46.html|title=O'Brien awarded €150k in Daily Mail defamation case|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=14 February 2013|accessdate=14 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305161526/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/o-brien-awarded-150k-in-daily-mail-defamation-case-1.1255054|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 2015, [[Waterford Whispers News]] (a satirical website similar to America's The Onion) editor-in-chief Colm Williamson received a cease and desist order from a solicitor acting on O'Brien's behalf, for a satirical article published on the website regarding O'Brien.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Colm Williamson on Twitter|url = https://twitter.com/ColmWhispers/status/629345366585016321|accessdate = 6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after lawyers for O'Brien also demanded that a report of the Waterford Whispers News story also be removed from [http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/08/06/meanwhile-in-a-parallel-universe-2/ www.broadsheet.ie] under a threat of legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Denis O’Brien lawyers demand removal of  broadsheet.ie  article|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/denis-o-brien-lawyers-demand-removal-of-broadsheet-ie-article-1.2310440|accessdate = 8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; . 

However this demand was not complied with and the article is still carried on Broadsheet.ie 3 years later in July 2018.

In response to such actions - in particular those relating to the threat of legal proceedings against satirical websites - the comments sections of various Irish related social media outlet featured many negative comments chastising O'Brien for his constant issuing of threats of legal proceedings.

==IBRC and parliamentary privilege==

===IBRC controversy and RTÉ injunction===
In 2015, arguing that revelation of his relationship with his bank was an invasion of his privacy, O'Brien successfully applied for an injunction against RTÉ preventing the state broadcaster from airing a report on how O'Brien was allegedly receiving, on foot of a claimed but disputed&lt;ref name=IBRC-RTE20150617a/&gt; verbal agreement with a former CEO of the [[Irish Bank Resolution Corporation]] (IBRC)&amp;mdash;the former [[Anglo Irish Bank]], and another senior executive, a rate of approximately 1.25% when IBRC "could, and arguably should" have been charging 7.5%.&lt;ref name=greenslade_29052015/&gt; This alleged rate applied to "outstanding sums of upwards of €500 million",&lt;ref name=greenslade_29052015/&gt; or "over €300 million" according to the RTÉ producer's court affidavit.&lt;ref name=IBRC-RTE20150617a/&gt;&lt;ref name=DOB-RTE-Binchy20150605b&gt;{{cite book |url=https://static.rasset.ie/documents/news/dob-v-rte-redacted-judgement.pdf |title=Denis O'Brien-v-RTÉ redacted judgment|author=Mr Justice Donald Binchy|publisher=[[High Court (Ireland)|The High Court]]|page=11|date=3 June 2015|accessdate=18 June 2015|quote=paragraph 20 (e) ...over €300 million}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien then allegedly wrote to IBRC's special liquidator Kieran Wallace to demand that these same favourable terms that were granted him by way of verbal agreement be continued.&lt;ref name=greenslade_29052015/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBRC-IT01a/&gt; The Irish government later appointed Kieran Wallace to conduct a review into various IBRC transactions, including the sale of Siteserv by IBRC to Denis O'Brien.&lt;ref name=IBRC-IT01a&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/catherine-murphy-makes-denis-o-brien-claims-in-d%C3%A1il-1.2229946|title=Catherine Murphy makes Denis O’Brien claims in Dáil|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|author1=Barry O'Keeffe|author2=Cliff Taylor|authorlink2=Cliff Taylor (journalist)|date=28 May 2015|accessdate=3 June 2015|quote=O’Brien says information was false and claims were an abuse of Dáil privilege ...

The terms under which the company, which carries out a wide variety of services, including water meter installation, was sold are part of that review. Separately, Mike Aynsley, the former chief executive of IBRC, released a lengthy statement, taking issue with other comments by Ms Murphy, who was moving a Private Members’ Bill through the Dáil.

Many decent people who had loans transferred to Nama, or had loans with Anglo Irish Bank/IBRC were thrown to the wolves. ...I have known people who took their own lives, people who lost everything including their homes and their marriages. Also many people who have had nervous breakdowns. The toll all this has taken on the “community” that makes up our country is quite shocking.  I think it is regrettable that there is such a feeding frenzy to spread rumours and selectively leak information to point- score, challenge a competitor or simply do somebody down. It is done behind the cloak of secrecy and anonymity and the principle that “my enemy’s enemy is my friend”. Social media being used for this purpose is crowded with cowards.  At a particular point in time when foreign multinationals were at their most nervous about their deposits in Irish banks I decided to be contrarian. I took a decision that Digicel would repatriate its cash deposits from US banks amounting to more than $600 million and place them with two Irish banks as a vote of confidence. Both banks asked my permission to tell a small number of foreign clients of this decision to help stop further outflows and this was granted. At that time, and subsequently, I was talking up Ireland internationally as a recovery story. I wanted to make a significant financial gesture of support at home. This was to show solidarity with Ireland but also to support the efforts of Minister for Finance Michael Noonan in stabilising the Irish banks and slow future outflow of deposits. ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I have been dragged into a media frenzy because of RTÉ’s attempts to publish my private bank details and Deputy Murphy’s desire to distort them. I have never experienced the level of abuse, venom and hatred resulting from taking a stand to protect privacy in relation to my financial affairs.

In 2011, O'Brien donated €2,500 to the campaign of [[Mary Davis (activist)|Mary Davis]] for the [[Irish presidential election, 2011|Irish presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Marie|last1=O'Halloran|first2=Paul|last2=Cullen|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1001/1224305088913.html|title=Campaigns to cost up to €350,000, say candidates|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=1 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305152109/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/campaigns-to-cost-up-to-350-000-say-candidates-1.611291|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===O'Brien and the Clintons===
O'Brien and the Clintons were prominent investors of time and money in [[Haiti]] following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]].&lt;ref name=cements_close_working_relationship/&gt; U.S. government agency [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], overseen by the State Department and headed at the time by [[Hillary Clinton]], donated millions of U.S. tax dollars to O'Brien's Digicel company. USAID's "[[Food for Peace]]" scheme transferred money over Digicel's mobile network, with citizens of the stricken country being given mobile phones and free Digicel accounts, which led Digicel to "significantly expand" its customer numbers. [[Bill Clinton]] also oversaw the building and then opened a luxury Marriott Hotel in Haiti; this hotel was owned by Digicel, which made a $45 million contribution (compared to a $26.5 million contribution from the [[World Bank]]-affiliated [[International Finance Corporation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://freebeacon.com/blog/oh-denny-boy-how-the-clintons-helped-an-irish-telecom-tycoon-makes-millions-in-earthquake-ravaged-haiti/|title=Oh, Denny Boy: How The Clintons Helped an Irish Telecom Tycoon Makes Millions in Earthquake Ravaged Haiti|work=[[The Washington Free Beacon]]|date=7 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601143227/http://freebeacon.com/blog/oh-denny-boy-how-the-clintons-helped-an-irish-telecom-tycoon-makes-millions-in-earthquake-ravaged-haiti/|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Bill Clinton flew to Ireland on O'Brien's private jet to attend the [[Global Irish Economic Forum]].&lt;ref name=kenny_afraid_of_DeNob&gt;{{cite news|first=Elaine|last=Byrne|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/so-whos-afraid-of-denis-obrien-enda-kenny-is-26782500.html|title=So who's afraid of Denis O'Brien? Enda Kenny is|newspaper=Sunday Independent|date=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cements_close_working_relationship/&gt;

In 2012, Clinton bestowed upon O'Brien the title "Clinton Global Citizen" as part of an awards scheme connected with the [[Clinton Global Initiative]] think tank.&lt;ref name=cements_close_working_relationship/&gt;

According to ''The Irish Times'', Clinton's 2013 speaking engagement at Dublin's [[Conrad Hotels|Conrad Hotel]] was "facilitated largely by his friend" Denis O'Brien. When opening his speech, Clinton personally thanked O'Brien "for the invitation."&lt;ref name=cements_close_working_relationship&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/bill-clinton-visit-cements-close-working-relationship-with-denis-o-brien-1.1555547|title=Bill Clinton visit cements close working relationship with Denis O'Brien: Irish billionaire helps to cover cost of trip|work=The Irish Times|date=10 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601135338/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/bill-clinton-visit-cements-close-working-relationship-with-denis-o-brien-1.1555547|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to U.S. accounts, Clinton's average speaking fee for the previous year a minimum of close to $200,000 (though he had received multiples of that fee at some corporate functions).&lt;ref name=cements_close_working_relationship/&gt;

O'Brien's "arrangement" of speeches for Clinton is covered in [[Peter Schweizer]]'s book ''[[Clinton Cash]]''.&lt;ref name=cbs_clinton_cash&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/clinton-cash-publisher-corrects-errors-in-book/|title="Clinton Cash" publisher corrects errors in book|publisher=CBS News|date=14 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601141304/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/clinton-cash-publisher-corrects-errors-in-book/|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton has also praised O'Brien in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'',&lt;ref name=cements_close_working_relationship/&gt; while U.S. media have referred to O'Brien as a "Clinton crony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://freebeacon.com/blog/bill-clintons-irish-billionaire-buddy-under-fire-for-sweetheart-loan-deal/|title=Bill Clinton’s Irish Billionaire Buddy Under Fire for Sweetheart Loan Deal: Media tycoon wins legal injunction to ban media from reporting on scandal|work=[[The Washington Free Beacon]]|date=29 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601143425/http://freebeacon.com/blog/bill-clintons-irish-billionaire-buddy-under-fire-for-sweetheart-loan-deal/|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, during the [[2016 US Presidential election]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Donald Trump]]'s campaign produced a lengthy e-mail to the media criticising Hillary Clinton's relationship with O'Brien.&lt;ref name=RTE-2016-09-28-a&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0928/820019-trump-clinton-obrien/|title=Trump attacks Clinton over links to O'Brien|publisher=[[RTÉ]] News|date=28 September 2016|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien refused to make any comments on Trump's statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/denis-obrien-donald-trump-3001305-Sep2016/|title=Donald Trump Launches Attack on Hillary Clinton|last=|first=|date=|website=www.thejournal.ie|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth and residences in Portugal and Malta==
''[[Forbes]]'' estimates O'Brien's wealth as approximately $6.8 billion.&lt;ref name="forbes_world_billionaires"/&gt;

O'Brien took up residency in [[Portugal]] some time before Esat Telecom's sale to BT in 2000. He netted more than €300 million from that sale but paid no capital gains tax due to a then-existing provision in the Irish-Portuguese tax treaty. While considering the flotation of Digicel on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 2006, it emerged in public that O'Brien had taken up residence in Malta. O'Brien's move to Malta was revealed in a March 2006 filing to the [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|Companies Registration Office]] (CRO), which listed O'Brien's residential address in Malta. Malta charges no tax on worldwide assets or income brought in by permanent residents. Residence, for tax purposes, means renting or buying a property with a minimum value and visiting Malta at least once within one year of becoming a resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Keena|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/front/2006/0915/1158271559252.html|title=O'Brien makes pre-flotation move to Malta|work=The Irish Times|date=15 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305152237/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/o-brien-makes-pre-flotation-move-to-malta-1.1002741|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community recognition ==
He was appointed goodwill ambassador for [[Port-au-Prince]] by the city's mayor and deputy mayor in recognition of his efforts to rebuild Haiti and attract foreign direct investment in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake on 12 January, and on behalf of the Clinton Global Initiative. He is chairman of the Haiti Action Network, which coordinates the activities of approximately 80 support organisations in Haiti.&lt;ref name="19022010 Silicon Republic" /&gt; Most recently, O'Brien reconstructed the [[Marché en Fer|Iron Market]] in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince, the first public building in the city to be rebuilt since the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/09/haiti-anniversary-denis-obrien-vulliamy|title=How an Irish telecoms tycoon became Haiti's only hope of salvation|last=Vulliamy|first=Ed|date=9 January 2011|newspaper=The Observer|accessdate=9 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305154340/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/09/haiti-anniversary-denis-obrien-vulliamy|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also contributed to building 50 primary and secondary schools in 18 months following the earthquake.&lt;ref name="O'Brien Honoured In Haiti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20110629/business/business2.html|title=O'Brien Honoured In Haiti|date=11 June 2011|publisher=Gleaner|editor=Press|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Central"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/opinion/others/Clintons-close-friend-Denis-OBrien-battles-massive-criticism-in-Ireland.html|title=Clinton’s close friend Denis O’Brien battles massive criticism in Ireland|date=8 June 2015|publisher=Irish Central|editor=O'Shea, James|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and recognition==
In 2012, President [[Michel Martelly]] of Haiti awarded O'Brien with the [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] for his investments, contributions and promotion of the country.&lt;ref name="O'Brien Honoured In Haiti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Central"/&gt;

UCD awarded O'Brien an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ucd.ie/news/nov06/111506_dennis_obrien.htm|title=Alma Mater confers Denis O'Brien with honorary Doctor of Laws|date=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dmitriy Aksenov's idea to develop society using cultural instruments was the basis of his conception of RDI Group's cultural centres. Projects based on the participatory planning approach are being implemented in each of the residential estate projects being built by RDI, developing cultural programmes and urban communities for the territories. Thanks to the work of RDI Creative a "third place" with high-quality content is being created for the residents, who are provided with opportunities in the field of culture irrespective of location or income. They can each share the cultural achievements and at the same time learn from the cultural experience of the other communities. For example, in April 2015 the New-Molokovo ([[Moscow region]]) residential estate cultural centre was opened, as were the Out-Of-Town Quarter and the Southern Vidnoe residential estate cultural centres in March 2016 and June 2016 respectively.&lt;br&gt;

In 2015 Aksenov became one of the top hundred people in Russian art for 2014, according to The Art Newspaper Russia, occupying 25th place.

== Charity ==
Founder of the VR Foundation, which develops effective treatments for people suffering from [[vitiligo]].&lt;br&gt;
Founder of the Aksenov Family Foundation, which initiates and supports projects striving to develop cultural and social innovation.&lt;br&gt;
Major donator to the fund for the development of MIPT. Since 2014 – member of the managing committee of the fund managing capital for the development of [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology|MIPT]].&lt;br&gt;
In 2016, with the support and personal participation of Dmitriy Aksyonov and dedicated to the 50th anniversary of [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology|MIPT]], the all-Russian physics and technology test [[:ru:Контрольная "Выходи решать!|"Go and Solve it!"]] was launched.

'''Dominique Cerutti''' (born January 3, 1961 in [[Manosque]], France) is a French businessman and has been Chairman and CEO of the [[Altran]] group since June 2015.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
Dominique Cerutti began his career as an engineer for French company [[Bouygues|Bouygues Construction]] in [[Saudi Arabia]], where he was based for nearly two years.

=== IBM ===
He moved to [[IBM]] in 1986 starting out in sales engineering and sales management. He remained at IBM for more than 20 years.

At IBM, he was promoted to his first management position in 1996 as the Director of Personal Systems Group for Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=83421936&amp;ticker=ICE&amp;previousCapId=20571&amp;previousTitle=GANNETT%20CO|title=intercontinentalexchange gro (ICE:New York)|work=Businessweek|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following decade, Cerutti ascended the ranks of IBM, and worked in roles that were particularly international. In 1998, he became Executive Assistant to the Chairman and CEO, Lou Gerstner.

In 2000, he moved to IBM Global Services, the leading market services provider in Europe, first as General Manager for Western Europe and then for the whole EMEA region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=19091455&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=M0Gd&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=2774862811395063981142&amp;srchindex=2&amp;srchtotal=11&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A2774862811395063981142%2CVSRPtargetId%3A19091455%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary|title=Dominique Cerutti profile|work=Linkedin|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He managed tens of thousands of employees in 17 different sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2009/10/01/04015-20091001ARTFIG00488-dominique-cerutti-rejoint-nyse-euronext-.php|work=Le Figaro|title=Dominique Cerutti rejoint NYSE Euronext |date=October 1, 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Cerutti became IBM’s General Manager for Europe, Middle East and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/60a24ba6-aeea-11de-96d7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2wD2gq890|title=NYSE Euronext picks IBM veteran Cerutti|work=Financial Times|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his former IBM colleagues, Cerutti starkly contrasted with the company’s generally diffident management style, and preferred to clearly outline strategies for his teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/dominique-ceruttile-nouveau-profil-d-ibmapres-avoir-conseille-pendant-un-an-lou-gerstner-p-dg-d-ibm-dominique-cerutti-pilote-la-filiale-de-services-informatiques-du-groupe-en-europe.N102980|title=Dominique Cerutti, le nouveau profil d'IBM|work=Usine Nouvelle|date=2001-08-23|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NYSE-Euronext ===
In 2009 Dominique Cerutti left IBM to join NYSE [[Euronext]], the global exchange group, as President and Deputy CEO.  He was also CEO of Euronext NV, the European subsidiary of NYSE Euronext, and Chairman and CEO of Euronext Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/dominique-cerutti/|title=Dominique Cerutti|work=Forbes|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he was appointed as Board Member of the Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a.WEW4C9lqmM|title=NYSE Names Cerutti to Succeed Theodore as Deputy CEO (Update1)|work=Bloomberg|date=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook one of his first notable projects as a member of the Board: compliance with the EU’s [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive]]. According to him, this directive decreased transparency in financial markets by allowing the creation of alternative exchange platforms at a time when “the need for transparence has never been so acute.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dominique Cerutti met en garde contre l'opacité des marchés actions|url = http://www.lesechos.fr/29/06/2010/LesEchos/20708-161-ECH_dominique-cerutti-met-en-garde-contre-l-opacite-des-marches-actions.htm|website = lesechos.fr|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, he moved up from Deputy CEO of NYSE to become the CEO of Euronext.

In June 2014, he oversaw Euronext’s [[Initial public offering|IPO]] as an independent company after it separated from parent company ICE. As CEO of Euronext, he turned around the strategy of the group, moving away from the legacy of his predecessor, Jean-François Théodore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In September 2014, he embarked on a program to increase operational savings by €60 million over the next three years, with the goal of achieving a 5% annual revenue growth and improve the company's long-term [[EBITDA]] margin from 42% to 53%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thetradenews.com/news/Asset_Classes/Equities/Cerutti_outlines_multi-asset_class_vision_for_Euronext.aspx|title = Cerutti outlines multi-asset class vision for Euronext|date = June 10, 2014|accessdate = October 13, 2014|website = Trade News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cerutti has also spoken against the European Commission's proposal of a [[Financial-transactions tax|financial transactions tax]], arguing that "the political intention of creating such a tax is a noble one, but the current form of the proposal is counter-productive […] this tax is truly the last thing we need now.“&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.leadersleague.com/news/view/id/795c276142f14a11e9de0d3977815f34|title = Portrait : Dominique Cerutti, CEO, Euronext|date = September 26, 2014|accessdate = October 13, 2014|website = Leaders League|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141018052436/http://www.leadersleague.com/news/view/id/795c276142f14a11e9de0d3977815f34|archivedate = October 18, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also spoken out in favor of increased market regulation and transparency as the main way of reducing risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.leadersleague.com/news/view/id/54ab112d5a151b8c5d3293623a9bbff4|title = Dominique Cerutti (Euronext) : "Se repositionner comme un centre majeur de levée de capitaux"|date = September 24, 2014|accessdate = October 13, 2014|website = Leaders League|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141018052340/http://www.leadersleague.com/news/view/id/54ab112d5a151b8c5d3293623a9bbff4|archivedate = October 18, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as CEO, Euronext once again became independent and had an IPO in its own markets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Rijnhard Van Tets, president of Euronext's Surpervisory Board, "Under his direction, the company was able to successfully re-position itself as the leading independent European stock market." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dominique Cerutti va quitter Euronext pour diriger Altran|url = http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2015/04/22/2092196-dominique-cerutti-va-quitter-euronext-pour-diriger-altran.html|website = ladepeche.fr|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, under the leadership of Dominique Cerruti, Altran Group also purchased the company [[Aricent]] for $2.0 billion, which is to date, the Group’s largest acquisition.

The '''Du Pont family''' ({{IPAc-en|dj|uː|ˈ|p|ɒ|n|t}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dupont "DuPont"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] family descended from [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]] (1739–1817). Since the 19th century, the Du Pont family has been one of the richest families in America.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/du-pont/|title=Du Pont  family|work=forbes.com|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many former Du Pont family estates have been opened to the public as museums, gardens, or parks, such as [[Nemours Mansion and Gardens]], [[Longwood Gardens]], and [[Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library]]. The family's first American estate, located at [[Hagley Museum and Library]], has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]]. In recent years, the family has continued to be known for its association with political and business ventures, as well as philanthropic efforts on behalf of various organizations such as [[The Jockey Club]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lunger Estate Makes Major Contribution to Equine Research|url=http://www.jockeyclub.com/default.asp?section=Resources&amp;area=0&amp;archives=show&amp;story=194|website=The Jockey Club|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duvoisin|first1=Marc|title=Family's Reach Influenced Business, Politics And Arts The Du Pont Family Can Take Some Credit For The Creation Of Longwood Gardens, The Atomic Bomb And Nylon Hosiery.|url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-01-28/news/25653867_1_du-pont-eleuthere-irenee-pont-iv|accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=28 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Delaware Art Museum]], and the [[Grand Opera House (Wilmington, Delaware)|Grand Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nagengast|first1=Larry|title=The Past, Present and Future of DuPont|url=http://www.delawaretoday.com/Delaware-Today/April-2014/The-Past-Present-and-Future-of-DuPont/index.php?cparticle=7&amp;siarticle=6#artanc|publisher=Delaware Today|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family fortune as of 2016 was $14.3 billion with over 3,500 living members around the world, most of whom are only marginally related.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

==History==
[[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]] was the son of a Parisian watchmaker and a member of a [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] [[Huguenot]] family, and descendant of a minor [[nobility|noble family]] on his mother's side. He and his sons, [[Victor Marie du Pont]] and [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]], emigrated from France in 1800 to the United States and used the resources of their Huguenot heritage to found one of the most prominent of [[United States|American]] families, and one of its most successful [[corporation]]s, [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], initially established by Éleuthère Irénée as a gunpowder manufacturer.

In 1802, Éleuthère Irénée du Pont established a gunpowder mill on the banks of the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine River]] near [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. The location provided all the necessities to operate the mill: a water flow sufficient to power it, available timber (mainly willow trees) that could be turned into charcoal fine enough to use for gunpowder, close proximity to the [[Delaware River]] to allow for shipments of sulfur and saltpeter, the other ingredients used in the manufacture of gunpowder. There were also nearby stone quarries to provide needed building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanroads.net/happy_trails.winter2014.htm|title=Happy Trails|work=americanroads.net|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time the [[DuPont|Du Pont company]] grew into the largest black powder manufacturing firm in the world. The family remained in control of the company up through the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DuPont Co.'s 19 leaders since 1802|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2015/10/05/duponts-leaders/73422578/|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=Wilmington News Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and family trusts still own a substantial amount of the company's stock. This and other companies run by the Du Pont family employed up to 10 percent of Delaware's population at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Scott|title=Delaware's dilemma: A fading DuPont|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/story/money/industries/2015/10/23/delawares-dilemma-fading-dupont/74329022/|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=Wilmington News Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the Du Pont family maintained their family wealth by carefully arranged marriages between [[inbreeding|cousins]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2003/aug/featkiss Go Ahead, Kiss Your Cousin] by Richard Conniff, From the August 2003 issue, published online August 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which, at the time, was the norm for many families.

The family played a large part in politics during the 18th and 19th centuries and assisted in negotiations for the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] and the [[Louisiana purchase]]. Both [[T. Coleman du Pont|T. Coleman]] and [[Henry A. du Pont]] served as U.S. senators, and [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV]] served as Governor of Delaware.

The family has also played an important role in historic preservation and land conservation, including helping to found the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], preserving President [[James Madison]]'s home [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]], and establishing numerous museums such as Winterthur and the [[Delaware Museum of Natural History]]. The Brandywine Conservancy founded by family member [[George Alexis Weymouth]] owns around {{convert|2350|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land in Pennsylvania and Delaware, and owns permanent conservation easements on an additional {{convert|37000|acres|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bauers|first1=Sandy|title=Conservancy gains easement Winterthur's pastoral beauty is now protected|url=http://articles.philly.com/2002-07-25/news/25358114_1_winterthur-henry-f-du-pont-easement|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=25 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montgomery|first1=Jeff|title=The Brandywine Conservancy: Preserving Nature, Art, and History|url=http://php.delawareonline.com/news/assets/2014/09/WIL_1001_BRANDYWINE_CONSERVANCY_.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=Wilmington News Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Lammot du Pont Copeland]]'s [[Mt. Cuba Center]] contributed over $20 million to purchase land for donation to the federal government to form the [[First State National Historical Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationfund.org/projects/woodlawn-property-a-new-national-park-in-delaware/|title=Delaware's First State National Monument|accessdate=6 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031235716/http://www.conservationfund.org/projects/woodlawn-property-a-new-national-park-in-delaware/|archivedate=31 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[William du Pont, Jr.]] and his sister, [[Marion duPont Scott]], many members of the Du Pont family have been involved in the breeding and racing of [[thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorses]], as well as establishing racehorse venues and training tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emc.vetmed.vt.edu/emcmariondupontscott.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011227114730/http://emc.vetmed.vt.edu/emcmariondupontscott.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 December 2001|title=Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center|publisher=University of Vermont|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spelling of the name==
The stylings “Dupont”, “DuPont”, du Pont" and "Du Pont" for the family name have both been widely used in published writings. In many publications, the styling is "du Pont" when quoting an individual's full name and "Du Pont" when speaking of the family as a whole, although some individual Du Ponts have chosen to style it differently, such as [[Samuel Francis Du Pont]]. The name of the chemical company founded by the family is today styled solid as "[[DuPont]]" in the short form (but the long form is styled as E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company); the stylings "Du Pont" and "DuPont" for the company's short name coexisted in the 20th century, but the latter is now consistently used in the company's branding. The solid styling "duPont" is less common, but the [[Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children]] uses it, as does the [[duPont Registry]]. William S. Dutton's mid-20th-century history of the family business&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dutton |first=William S. |year=1942 |title=Du Pont: One Hundred and Forty Years |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEtZAAAAYAAJ |lccn=42011897 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses "Du Pont" both for the family mentioned generally and for the company's short name but "du Pont" in an individual's full name (for example, "[[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]]", "[[Henry du Pont]]", "[[Alfred V. du Pont |Alfred Victor du Pont]]", "[[Lammot du Pont I|Lammot du Pont]]"); for example, "when he [Lammot du Pont] went to General Henry du Pont with the proposal that the Du Ponts manufacture dynamite, he was answered by a blunt and unqualified 'No!'"&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"/&gt;{{rp|116}}) The first page of Dutton's monograph&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"/&gt;{{rp|3}} contains the following footnote about the surname's styling (the mention of "Samuel Dupont" here refers to the 18th-century Parisian watchmaker, not to [[Samuel Francis Du Pont|his 19th-century descendant]]): "Samuel Dupont used this form of the family name [i.e., Dupont], but beginning in 1763 [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours|his son]] signed himself 'Du Pont.' Later, he added 'de Nemours' to his name to prevent confusion with two other Duponts in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|French Chamber of Deputies]]. Du Pont, in English, is pronounced with the accent on the second syllable. In French, neither syllable is accented."&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"/&gt;{{rp|3}} 

[[French orthography|French orthographic]] tradition for the styling of ''de'' (or its inflected forms) as a surname particle, in either nobiliary or non-nobiliary form, is discussed at ''[[Nobiliary particle#France|Nobiliary particle 
§ France]]''. In non-nobiliary form, the prevalent French styling of the name is "[[Wiktionary:Dupont|Dupont]]", and thus the choice by Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours to begin styling himself so during the monarchical era hints at social ambition. But the influence of French orthography and prerevolutionary class structure on how [[English orthography]] styles surnames today is outweighed by how families and individuals so named style themselves.

'''Earnings management''', in [[accounting]], is the act of intentionally influencing the process of [[financial reporting]] to obtain some private gain.&lt;ref name = "S 1989"&gt;Schipper, Katherine. 1989. “Commentary on Earnings Management.” ''Accounting Horizons'' (December): 91–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Earnings management involves the alteration of [[financial reports]] to mislead [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] about the organization's underlying performance, or to "influence contractual outcomes that depend on reported accounting numbers."&lt;ref name = "HW 1999"&gt;Healy, Paul M., and James M. Wahlen. 1999. “A Review of the Earnings Management Literature and Its Implications for Standard Setting.” ''Accounting Horizons'' 13 (4): 365–383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earnings management has a negative effect on [[earnings quality]],&lt;ref name=NYSSCPA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akers|first1=Michael D.|last2=Giacomino|first2=Don E.|last3=Bellovary|first3=Jodi L.|title=Earnings Management and Its Implications: Educating the Accounting Profession|url=http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2007/807/essentials/p64.htm|work=The CPA Journal|publisher=The New York State Society of CPAs|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may weaken the credibility of [[financial reporting]].&lt;ref name="M 1999"&gt;{{cite web|last=Munter|first=Paul|title=SEC Sharply Criticizes "Earnings Management" Accounting|url=http://www.csus.edu/indiv/l/lundbladg/ACCY%20113/113_WA/SEC%20Sharply....pdf|accessdate=14 January 2014|year=1999|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905162446/http://www.csus.edu/indiv/l/lundbladg/ACCY%20113/113_WA/SEC%20Sharply....pdf|archivedate=5 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in a 1998 speech [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] chairman [[Arthur Levitt]] called earnings management "widespread".&lt;ref name="SEC Speech 1998"&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks by Chairman Arthur Levitt|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1998/spch220.txt|publisher=SEC|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its pervasiveness, the complexity of accounting rules can make earnings management difficult for individual investors to detect.&lt;ref name = "Investopedia What" /&gt;

== Occurrence and response by regulators ==
Earnings management is believed to be widespread. A 1990 report on earnings management situations stated that "short-term earnings are being managed in many, if not all companies",&lt;ref name=NYSSCPA /&gt; and in a 1998 speech, [[Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]] chairman [[Arthur Levitt]] called earnings management a "widespread, but too little-challenged custom".&lt;ref name="SEC Speech 1998" /&gt;  In a 2013 essay, [[Ray J. Ball|Ray Ball]], while opining that [[accounting research]] was not reliably documenting earnings management, wrote: "''Of course'' earnings management goes on. [...] People have been tried and convicted."&lt;ref name = "Ball 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball|first=Ray|title=Accounting Informs Investors and Earnings Management is Rife: Two Questionable Beliefs|journal=Accounting Horizons|year=2013|volume=27|issue=4|pages=847–853|doi=10.2308/acch-10366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC has criticized earnings management as having adverse consequences for financial reporting, and for masking "the true consequences of management's decisions".&lt;ref name="SEC Speech 1998" /&gt; It has called on standard-setters to make changes to [[accounting standards]] to improve [[financial statement]] transparency, and has called for increased oversight over the financial reporting process.&lt;ref name="M 1999" /&gt; The SEC has also pressed charges against the management of firms involved in [[fraud]]ulent earnings management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEC Charges Former Chief Accounting Officer of Beazer Homes for Fraudulent Earnings Management Scheme|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-146.htm|publisher=SEC|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COMMISSION CHARGES TWO FORMER BRISTOL-MYERS OFFICERS FOR FRAUDULENT EARNINGS MANAGEMENT SCHEME|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2005-118.htm|publisher=SEC|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations and methods ==

"Increasingly, I have become concerned that the motivation to meet Wall Street earnings expectations may be overriding common sense business practices.  Too many corporate managers, auditors, and analysts are participants in a game of nods and winks.  In the zeal to satisfy consensus earnings estimates and project a smooth earnings path, wishful thinking may be winning the day over faithful representation."&lt;ref name="SEC Speech 1998"/&gt;
|-
| style="text-align: left;"|—[[Arthur Levitt]], in a speech to the NYU Center for Law and Business, 28 September 1998.
|}
Earnings management involves the manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings, in which case management is said to be carrying out ''income smoothing''.&lt;ref name="Investopedia What"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is earnings management?|url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/191.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opportunistic income smoothing can in turn signal lower risk and increase a firm's market value.&lt;ref name="S 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Subramanyam|first=K. R.|title=The pricing of discretionary accruals|journal=Journal of Accounting and Economics|year=1996|volume=22|pages=249–281|doi=10.1016/s0165-4101(96)00434-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain [[financial ratio|accounting ratios]] due to [[debt]] covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.&lt;ref name = "RTW 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Scott A. |author2=A. Irem Tuna |author3=Min Wu|title=Predicting Earnings Management: The Case of Earnings Restatements|journal=|date=October 2002|ssrn=338681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earnings management may involve exploiting opportunities to make accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the [[financial statements]]. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for [[Bad debt|uncollectible accounts]] can have a significant effect on [[net income]], and a company using [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|last-in, first-out accounting]] for [[inventories]] can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.&lt;ref name=Primer&gt;{{cite web|last=Weil|first=Roman L.|author-link=Roman L.

== Detecting earnings management ==
Earnings management may be difficult for individual investors to detect due to the complexity of accounting rules,&lt;ref name = "Investopedia What" /&gt; although [[accounting research]]ers have proposed several methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price lll|first1=Richard A.|last2=Sharp|first2=Nathan Y.|last3=Wood|first3=David A.|title=Detecting and Predicting Accounting Irregularities: A Comparison of Commercial and Academic Risk Measures|journal=Accounting Horizons|date=December 2011|volume=25|issue=4|pages=755–780|doi=10.2308/acch-50064|url=http://www.aaajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2308/acch-50064|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, research has shown that firms with large [[accruals]] and weak governance structures are more likely to be engaging in earnings management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prawitt|first1=Douglas F.|last2=Smith|first2=Jason L.|last3=Wood|first3=David A.|title=Internal Audit Quality and Earnings Management|journal=The Accounting Review|date=July 2009|volume=84|issue=4|pages=1255–1280|doi=10.2308/accr.2009.84.4.1255|url=http://www.aaajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2308/accr.2009.84.4.1255|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DS 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dechow|first=Patricia|author2=Douglas J.

==Mega Projects==

A number of Mega projects are being conceptualized and developed in the State, the most prominent of which are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emergingkerala2012.org/mega-projects.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supplementary Gas Infrastructure Project'''

A Joint Venture Company, [[Kerala Gail Gas Limited]] (KGGL) has been formed between [[Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation|KSIDC]] and M/s. [[GAIL]] Gas Limited.  KGGL will take up activities like City Gas Distribution in Kerala, CNG Stations for [[Kerala State Road Transport Corporation|KSRTC]] Buses, establishment of [[Gas Training Institute]], laying of Spur Lines from GAIL's main pipeline, setting up of small Gas based small power generating plants etc. The total investment for the project is estimated at Rs.2,000 Crores ($400 million).

'''[[Vizhinjam International Seaport|Vizhinjam International Deepwater Multipurpose Seaport]]'''

The Vizhinjam International Deepwater Multipurpose Seaport is an ambitious project of [[Government of Kerala]], being developed at [[Vizhinjam]] in [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. The project is proposed to follow Landlord Port Model, where dredging, reclamation and basic infrastructure like construction of break-water and quay will be done by [[Vizhinjam International Seaport Ltd]]. (a company fully owned by Govt of Kerala). Port Operation will be on [[public–private partnership]] (PPP) model. Terminal superstructure will be built by private operator who will also operate and maintain it for 30 years. The port development along with the external infrastructure work is envisaged to be carried out in phases with the cumulative cost estimated at around Rs. 7000 Crores ($1.4 billion). The port is envisaged to provide in total 2000m of quay length in three phases and is designed to cater primarily for containers transshipment, besides providing for other type of cargo such as Multi-Purpose, Break Bulk.

'''[[Kochi Metro|Kochi Metro Rail Project]]'''

The Project envisages construction of a world-class Light Mass Rapid Transit System in [[Kochi]] to enhance the quality of life for the Greater Kochi metro area by improving regional connections and reducing overcrowding, traffic congestion, transit time, air and noise pollution. The Project, having a total route length of 25&amp;nbsp;km would be having 21 stations, from [[Aluva]] to [[Pettah, Thiruvananthapuram|Pettah]]. The construction methodology proposed is elevated viaduct carried over pre-stressed concrete ‘U’ shaped girders. A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) by the name ‘[[Kochi Metro Rail Limited]]’ has been formed for the implementation of the project. The estimated project cost is Rs. 4500 Crores ($900 million).

'''[[Thiruvananthapuram Monorail|Monorail Project in Thiruvananthapuram]]'''

This is a prestigious single-rail mass transit project of Government of Kerala having a route length of 28.4&amp;nbsp;km, connecting the towns of [[Kazhakoottam]] and [[Balaramapuram]] in [[Thiruvananthapuram district]]. Monorail is a rail-based transportation system based on a single rail, which acts as its sole support and guideway. The rail will be straightened on a track upon the median that divides the main road. Concerns like land acquisition will be minimum, as only junctions are needed to be widened to incorporate the passage. The running train is to consist of four cars capable of carrying more than 200 persons at a time. The trains would breeze past through the elevated rails at a safe speed of 40Kmph. The total project cost is estimated at Rs. 3408 Crores ($682 million). The detailed Traffic study on the project is being done by [[National Transportation Planning &amp; Research Centre]] (NATPAC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4670">'''Esteban José Handal Pérez''' (born 7 January 1965 in [[San Pedro Sula]]) is a Honduran politician and businessman who is also known as the "Red Bull."&lt;ref name="LT"&gt;[http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=132337 La Tribuna (Honduras), 16 May 2010, accessed 27 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the former President of the Liberal Youth of Honduras and previously sought the nomination to be a Honduran Presidential candidate on behalf of the Liberal Party. He served in the national parliament of Honduras from 1997 to 2001. He is currently leader of the United Liberal Movement and has announced that he will seek the leadership of the Liberal Party in the internal elections scheduled for 2012.

==Biography==
Esteban José Handal Pérez was born in San Pedro Sula, in the department of Cortes, Honduras.

==Education==
Handal Pérez studied at the International School in Sampedrana in his home city. He completed his studies at the [[University of Texas]] and the [[Louisiana State University]], graduating in Industrial Engineering in 1987.

==Political career==
Shortly after his graduation from University, Handal returned to Honduras and became involved in politics supporting the then presidential candidate of the Liberal Party, Carlos Roberto Flores in 1989, although Roberto Flores lost to the National Party candidate, Rafael Leonardo Callejas. Handal was elected President of the Liberal Youth of San Pedro Sula in 1989. Subsequently he was campaign coordinator for Ramon Villeda Bermudez and in August 1993 participated in the Congress of Liberal Youth where he was elected president of the Liberal Youth, serving until 2001. In 1997 he won the nomination for Congress and was elected in the [[Honduran general election, 1997|1997 General election]] for the constituency of Cortes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=137520 Interview in La Tribuna, 29 May 2010] accessed 26 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as deputy, he emphasized always being firm with his convictions, but shortly after winning the Provincial Council, he was nominated by the Liberal Party as a presidential candidate with the "New Generation" movement. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} During his presidential campaign, people began calling him "the Red Bull," a nickname that is recognized throughout Honduras.

During his presidential campaign, Mr. Esteban Handal Perez revamped "the renewal of the Liberal Party of Honduras with young men and women in thought, the democratization of the Liberal Party, the rescue of the liberal principles, and the guarantee of food, health, education, employment, security, and shelter for all Hondurans," among other things. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In the internal elections of the Liberal Party on 3 December 2000, Esteban Handal Pérez, the "Red Bull", received 150,000 votes, which no were not sufficient at that time to win the nomination for the Presidency by the Liberal Party. Professor Rafael Pineda Ponce lost in the general election to Ricardo Maduro Joest of the National Party. After the elections, Esteban Handal temporarily retired from politics to dedicate himself to pastoral and entrepreneurial work.

On 16 May 2010, he publicly announced in an interview with "La Tribuna," a newspaper, his intention to return to national politics and run for the Presidency as a Liberal. He justified his return with the sentiment that "the Honduran people need profound changes in the political system and also because I believe that there should be a greater social awareness by large majorities"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=132337 Vuelve el "Toro Colorado"]&lt;/ref&gt; and their lack of involvement in the events of 28 June 2009. Mr. Handal Pérez currently leads the Liberal Unity Movement and has publicly declared its intention to run in the presidential elections in 2012, with the intentions of "the construction of a new Honduras, with more opportunities for all, more democratic, more free, more developed, more just, and more worthy." {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

A '''financial roadshow''' is a series of [[meetings]] across different [[cities]] in which top [[Executive (management)|executives]] from a [[company]] have the opportunity to talk with current or potential [[investors]].  They can range from two or three [[day]]s in one [[country]] or [[continent]] to [[marathon]], three [[week]] trips to [[financial]] centers around the [[world]].  The most common [[Rationality|reason]] for conducting financial roadshows is an initial [[public]] offerings [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]], in which a privately held company’s shares go public and investors have an opportunity to buy into it.  Another reason for roadshows is [[privatization]] of a [[government-owned corporation]], similar to a [[private company]] going public, in which a company seeks investors to buy new [[stock]] it is issuing to raise [[money]].  Finally, a non-deal roadshow is purely so that executives can hold discussions with current and potential investors, and nothing is offered for [[Sales|sale]].

[[File:françois-joseph-fournier-sépulture.jpg| The tomb of Fournier in Porquerolles|thumb]]
'''François Joseph Fournier''' (December 6, 1857 - January 13, 1935) was a [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]] [[Belgians|Belgian]] [[adventurer]] and [[entrepreneur]]  who explored [[Mexico]] and the island of [[Porquerolles]]. He was born into a family of modest means, in [[Clabecq]], [[Belgium]] and died on Porquerolles.

Fournier purchased the entire island of Porquerolles in 1912, apparently as a wedding present for his wife. He planted 200 [[hectare]]s (about 500 [[acre]]s) of vineyards which produced a wine that was among the first to be [[French_wine#Quality_levels_and_appellation_system|classed]] [[French_wine#Provence|des Côtes de Provence]].

He was President of the Board from 1961 until his death in 1972.&lt;ref name="kring"/&gt; By that time, he had served benevolently 43 years as a member of the Board, promoting diamond trade internationally and the [[Antwerp diamond district|Antwerp diamond industry]] in particular, and representing the Antwerpsche Diamantkring at the World Diamond Congress.&lt;ref name="syndikaat" /&gt;

==Early life==
Israel Beck was born in 1891 in [[Sanok]], southern [[Poland]] (a region which was known as [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]). He married Helena Blitz, with whom he has had three children (Isaac, Edith, and Leopold). In 1907 he joined his future father in law, Louis (Levie) Blitz, to become the third generation of family members in the diamond trade.

==Between World War I and World War II==
Israel Beck co-founded the [[Antwerpsche Diamantkring]],&lt;ref name="syndikaat" /&gt; and became in 1929 a member of its first Board of Directors immediately upon its establishment as the first diamond bourse worldwide for rough [[diamond]] trade. By 1932 he opened a new diamond factory with his brother, in the center of the [[Antwerp diamond district|diamond district]] in Antwerp.

==During World War II==
Israel Beck and his family fled Belgium during World War II, crossing France and finding shelter during the final years of the war as refugees in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.

==After World War II==
The diamond industry in Antwerp had to recover from the many human losses that were suffered during the Second World War. After the War, Israel Beck returned to Antwerp and benevolently dedicated much of his time and attention to the rebuilding of Antwerp’s diamond trade and the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Jewelers Circular Keystone |url=https://books.google.ch/books?ei=i5uTVebYM8rlUvrBgZAG&amp;id=DsoSAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Israel+Beck%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Israel+Beck&amp;hl=en |publisher=[[Chilton Company]] |volume=133 |issue=1-8 |page=96 |date=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1957 Israel Beck became Vice-president of the Board of the Antwerpsche Diamantkring, and in 1961 he was elected President of the Board.

With this financial backing, he went on to create the product of packaged deep fried flavored seaweed, which quickly became successful in Thailand, and was exported to [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[United States]].

A Thai movie, ''[[The Billionaire]]'', was loosely based on his life. The title refers to his status as a billionaire in Thai baht.

== Early life ==
Itthipat herminigildo was born in November 24, 1984 in Thailand and of Chinese ethnicity. He was born into a wealthy family and did not think too much about the future. He attained his education from kindergarten and elementary at Panapun Wittaya School, high school at St. Francis Xavier School and senior from Suankularb Wittayalai Nonthaburi School. He obtained his bachelor's degree in business administration from the [[University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce]].

== Business career ==
When he was still 16 years old, he was addicted to online games. Even though he gained success at playing online games and winning tournament prizes because of his hobby playing online games, he was often underestimated by his teachers at school. He decided to drop out from school to become a chestnut peddler when he was 17 years old. He invested his money into selling fried chestnuts, which became popular in Thailand.

In 2004, Itthipat founded Tao Kae Noi (Little Tycoon) Food and Marketing Co., Ltd. The brand sold fried seaweed snacks, which became highly popular among teenagers and officer workers. In December 2015, the company had its initial public offer (IPO) on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, raising 1.8 billion baht.  His success has made him popular among business circles and media. The company reported a net profit of 160 million baht in its third quarter in 2017. Itthipat has said he targets revenue of 1 billion baht in 7–8 years.

The '''Jameson Cell''' is a high-intensity [[froth flotation]] cell that was invented by Laureate Professor [[Graeme Jameson]] of the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)]] and developed in conjunction with [[Mount Isa Mines]] Limited ("MIM", a subsidiary of [[MIM Holdings Limited]] and now part of the [[Glencore]] group of companies).&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"&gt;G J Jameson, G Harbort and N Riches, "The development and application of the Jameson Cell," in: ''Fourth Mill Operators' Conference, Burnie, Tasmania, 10–14 March 1991'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1991), 45–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:Jameson Cells pictured adjacent to flotation columns at the Mount Isa lead-zinc concentrator.png|thumbnail|Figure 1. Comparison of the sizes of conventional column flotation cells and Jameson Cells with similar capacities.]]

The high intensity of the Jameson Cell means that it is much shorter than conventional [[Froth flotation#Flotation equipment|column flotation cells]] (see Figure 1), and it does not require air compressors to aerate the suspension of ground ore particles and water (known as a ''[[slurry]]'' or ''pulp'') in the flotation cell.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1992"&gt;G J Jameson, "Flotation cell development," in: ''The AusIMM Annual Conference, Broken Hill, New South Wales, 17–21 May 1992'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1992), 25–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a requirement for compressed air and the lack of moving parts means that power consumption is less than for the equivalent mechanical or conventional column flotation cell.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"&gt;M F Young, K E Barnes, G S Anderson and J D Pease, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Jameson%20Cell%20-%20%20The%20Comeback%20in%20Base%20Metal%20Applications%20Using%20Improved%20Design%20and%20Flow%20Sheets.pdf.

Accessed 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In contrast to most types of [[Froth flotation#Flotation equipment|flotation cell]], the Cell introduces the feed and the air to the Cell in a combined stream via one or more cylindrical columns referred to as "downcomers". Other types of flotation cell typically introduce the feed and the air separately to the cell.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1992"/&gt;

The Cell produces fast mineral flotation rates, especially for very fine mineral particles.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; It produces high concentrate grades from fast floating liberated particles &lt;ref name = "Barns2009"&gt;K E Barns, P J Colbert and P D Munro, "Designing the optimal flotation circuit – the Prominent Hill case," in: ''Tenth Mill Operators' Conference, Adelaide, South Australia, 12–14 October 2009'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 173–182.&lt;/ref&gt; and is able to do this from a single stage of flotation.&lt;ref name = "Barns2009"/&gt; The high carrying capacity of the Jameson Cell is particularly beneficial when high yields (mass pulls) are required, such as in recleaning in metals flotation and in the flotation of metallurgical coal, where yields can exceed 80%.&lt;ref name = "Araya"&gt;R Araya, L Huynh, M Young and K Arburo, "Solving challenges in copper cleaning circuits with the Jameson Cell," to be presented at: Procemin 2013,Santiago, Chile, 15–18 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating principles==

Froth flotation is achieved by mixing chemicals known as collectors with the ore slurry. The collectors adsorb onto the surfaces of the particles of select minerals (usually the valuable mineral that is targeted for concentration), making these minerals hydrophobic. Air is passed through the slurry in a tank known as a flotation cell. The air is broken into tiny bubbles by various mechanisms (depending on the design of the flotation cell), and the now-hydrophobic minerals attach to the bubbles, rising with them to the surface of the flotation cell, where they form a [[froth]]. The froth flows over the top edge (or "lip") of the flotation cell and forms the flotation concentrate. Ideally, none of the unwanted mineral particles float, and they remain behind as the flotation [[tailings]].

However, the selectivity of the collection mechanism is not perfect. Some unwanted ("[[gangue]]") minerals are also carried into the froth, largely by entrainment with the water rising with the bubbles. This is particularly the case for particles less than 10&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] in size.&lt;ref name = "Johnson2002"&gt;N W Johnson and P D Munro, "Overview of flotation technology and plant practice for complex sulphide [sic] ores," in: ''Mineral Processing Plant Design, Practice and Control'', Eds A L Mular, D N Halbe and D J Barratt (Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration: Littleton, Colorado, 2002), 1097–1123.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the gangue particles follow the water between the bubbles as it drains back to the underlying pulp. This process can be assisted by the application of sufficient "wash water" to the froth to displace the water entrained with the bubbles and the fine gangue particles brought with them.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1992"/&gt; Column flotation cells, invented in Canada by Boutin and Tremblay in 1961,&lt;ref name = "Clingan"&gt;B V Clingan and D R McGregor, "Column flotation experience at Magma Copper Company, with related experience of other mineral processors," presented at the ''SME Annual Meeting, Denver, Colorado, 24–27 February 1987''. Preprint 87-91.&lt;/ref&gt; grew increasingly popular in the 1980s and 1990s as a way of reducing entrainment of fine gangue particles during "cleaning" of flotation concentrates.&lt;ref name = "Johnson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lane"&gt;G S Lane and R C Dunne, "Column flotation – an Australian perspective," in: ''The AusIMM Kalgoorlie Branch, Equipment in the Minerals Industry: Exploration, Mining and Processing Conference, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, October 1987'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1987), 81–93.&lt;/ref&gt; With heights usually between 6 and 14 meters,&lt;ref name = "Dobby"&gt;G Dobby, "Column Flotation," in: ''Mineral Processing Plant Design, Practice and Control'', Eds A L Mular, D N Halbe and D J Barratt (Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration: Littleton, Colorado, 2002), 1239–1252.&lt;/ref&gt; they could have froth depths up to 2&amp;nbsp;m,&lt;ref name = "Lane"/&gt; providing more residence time than conventional cells and more stable froth surfaces that enable better froth washing.
[[File:FlCell.PNG|thumbnail|Figure 2. A schematic diagram illustrating the operating principles of a conventional, mechanically agitated flotation cell.]]

Froth flotation efficiency is determined by a series of probabilities: those of particle–bubble contact, particle–bubble attachment, transport between the pulp and the froth, and froth collection into the product launder.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"&gt;B W Atkinson, C J Conway and G J Jameson, "Fundamentals of Jameson Cell operation including size–yield response," in: ''Sixth Australian Coal Preparation Conference, Mackay, Queensland, 6–9 September 1993'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a conventional mechanically agitated cell, the void fraction is low (5–10%) and the bubble size is large (2–3&amp;nbsp;mm), which results in a low interfacial area with a low probability of particle–bubble contact.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt; In a conventional flotation column, the void fraction is similarly low, and so the probability of particle–bubble contact is increased by increasing the height of the column to provide greater residence time.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt;

Traditionally, the ore slurry and the air are introduced separately to the flotation cell (see Figure 2). The Jameson Cell differs from this traditional approach by mixing the slurry with the air in the downcomers.
[[File:Jameson Cell downcomer.png|thumbnail|Figure 3. The Jameson Cell downcomer.]]
 
The slurry is introduced at the top of the downcomer as a jet that draws in air through a second pipe to form a stable two-phase mixture (see Figure 3).&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt; The plunging slurry jet shears and then entrains the air.&lt;ref name = "Harbort2004"&gt;G Harbort, J Cowburn and E V Manlapig, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Recovery%20interactions%20between%20the%20froth%20zone,%20pulp%20zone%20and%20downcomer%20within%20a%20Jameson%20Cell.pdf.

Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; before it is discharged into the tank portion of the Jameson Cell (see Figure 4).&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt; The downcomer is designed to provide high-intensity mixing of the air and the slurry to generate a dense foam of fine bubbles and maximise the contact between the target mineral particles and the bubbles.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991a"&gt;G J Jameson and E V Manlapig, "Flotation cell design – experiences with the Jameson Cell," in: ''Extractive Metallurgy Conference, Perth, Western Australia, 2–4 October 1991'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1991), 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The probability of particle–bubble contact is "virtually 100%" with a slurry residence time in the downcomer of 5–10 seconds.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt;
[[File:Diagram of a Jameson Cell.png|thumbnail|Figure 4. A cut-away drawing showing a typical Jameson Cell design.]] 
 
The high probability of particle–bubble contact, and subsequent short residence times (five to ten seconds in the downcomer,&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt; allows for a much more compact column design than conventional column flotation cells (see Figure 1).&lt;ref name = "Jameson1992"/&gt; The fine nature of the bubbles (0.3 to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter&lt;ref name = "Barns2009"/&gt;) gives them enhanced carrying capabilities for fine mineral particles.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1992"/&gt; Fine bubbles also improve the separation of minerals, as they intensify the difference in the flotation kinetics of the valuable minerals from the gangue minerals, thus allowing higher grade concentrates to be produced.&lt;ref name = "Araya"/&gt;

The foam in the downcomer is about 50–60% air.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991a"/&gt; Because of this, the pulp is distributed in the form of thin interfacial slurry films between the bubbles, providing an ideal environment for particle–bubble contact.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt; Collection occurs by migration of the particles within the thin films, which are not much thicker than the diameter of the particles.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991a"/&gt;
 
The best collection occurs when the volume of air roughly equals that of the injected slurry.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991a"/&gt;

The Cell is operated by initially closing the air inlet at the top of the downcomer and feeding the flotation pulp in through the nozzle.&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; The air in the downcomer is entrained in the pulp, creating a partial vacuum that draws pulp from the tank up into the downcomer.&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; The pulp level quickly reaches the nozzle, which is at a level above that of the liquid level in the tank.&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; This creates a hydrostatic head in the downcomer, meaning that the pressure inside the top of the downcomer is lower than the atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; When the inlet is opened, air is drawn into the top space of the downcomer by this lower pressure, where it too is entrained into the downcomer contents by the plunging jet.&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; At the same time, a downward flow is established in the pulp in the downcomer that is sufficient to counter the buoyancy of the bubbles, and the aerated pulp discharges into the tank.&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt;

Once in the tank, the wider cross sectional area of the tank reduces the downward superficial velocity of the mixture,&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; allowing mineral-laden bubbles to disengage from the liquid&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; and rise to the surface as they would in a conventional cell, where they form the froth.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt; The velocity of the mixture discharging into the tank, and the large density differential between it and the remainder of the pulp in the tank, results in recirculating fluid patterns that keep the particles in the tank in suspension without requiring mechanical agitation.&lt;ref name = "Harbort2004"/&gt;

The purpose of the tank is simply for bubble–pulp separation, so the volume of the tank is small compared with alternative technologies.&lt;ref name = "Barns2009"/&gt;

The froth that forms at the top of the tank flows over its lip to be collected. This froth can be "washed" by a light flow of water, if desired.&lt;ref name = "Readett"/&gt; The bubbles flowing over the lip of the cell are smaller in diameter than those that flow over the lip of conventional flotation columns.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt;

The non-floating tailings are discharged through a hole in the bottom of the tank.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1992"/&gt;

The Cell has no moving parts and no requirement for compressed air or sparging mechanisms.&lt;ref name = "Carretta"&gt;M F Carretta, J N Graham and W J Dawson, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Goonyella%20Scale-Up%20Paper.pdf. "Jameson Cell scale-up experiences at BHP Coal's Goonyella coal preparation plant,"] Presented at: ''Coal Prep '97, Lexington, Kentucky, 29 April – 1 May 1997''. Accessed 29 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This results in lower power consumption than the equivalent mechanical or column flotation cells.&lt;ref name = "Barns2009"/&gt; Maintenance costs are also lower because the only wearing part is the slurry lens used to create the jet in the downcomer.&lt;ref name = "Barns2009"/&gt;

==History==

The Jameson Cell grew out of a long-term research program aimed at improving the recovery of fine particles by flotation. The work started at [[Imperial College London]], and continued when Jameson moved in 1978 to the University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia, where he is Laureate Professor (2015).

===Academic research  (1969–1990)===

Jameson’s research into flotation began when he was at Imperial College London, in 1969. A colleague, Dr J A Kitchener of the Royal School of Mines, pointed out that many of the new mineral deposits being found around the world required fine grinding to separate the valuable particles from the rock in which they were embedded, and the flotation technologies available at the time were relatively inefficient for recovering fine particles. Kitchener felt that improvements could best be achieved by an increased knowledge of the physics of flotation, rather than the chemistry of the reagents. Jameson had gained some expertise in the properties of bubbles and particles in suspensions whilst a PhD student at Cambridge. He began research into the fluid mechanics of the flotation process and set in train a series of experimental projects into the effect of particle diameter and bubble size on the flotation rate constant. Much of the research was conducted by honours students in chemical engineering. Jameson accepted the challenge of coming up with practical solutions to remedy the situation, if these could be identified.

Jameson’s research showed that the kinetics of flotation of fine particles was a strong function of the bubble diameter&lt;ref name = "Collins1976"&gt;Collins, G.L. and Jameson, G.J., 1976. Experiments on the flotation of fine particles - the effect of particle size and charge. Chemical Engineering Science 31, 985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ahmed1985"&gt;Ahmed, N.A. and Jameson, G.J., 1985. The effect of bubble size on the rate of flotation of fine particles, International Journal of Mineral Processing 14, 195-215.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the way to improve recoveries was to use small bubbles in the order of 300&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter. What was needed was a practical method of making such bubbles in large quantities, of the order of billions per second. The device needed to be simple to construct and operate, capable of running for long periods with minimal maintenance, and should be resistant to blockage by stray large particles in the feed. He began to look at the theory of bubble breakup in sheared flows, that is, in flow fields in which layers of liquid slide over each other. Lewis and Davidson&lt;ref name = "Lewis1982"&gt;Lewis, D.A. and Davidson, J.F., 1982. Bubble splitting in shear flow. Trans IChemE, 60: 283-291.&lt;/ref&gt; had recently published a theory to predict the maximum size of bubbles in a well-characterised flow environment. By balancing the forces acting on a bubble in a shearing flow, including the disruptive dynamic stresses from the liquid motion and the restoring force of surface tension, it was possible to predict the critical shear rate required to produce a bubble of given size. Jameson then looked for simple and practical ways of generating the required shear rates, and found inspiration in the kitchen sink. If a jet of water from a tap plunges into a basin full of water, a shear layer develops around the jet, that entrains air from the atmosphere into the water, and at the same time, breaks up the entrained air into fine bubbles. The effect is magnified if there is a detergent in the water. Detergents, known as frothers, are used in flotation to prevent bubble coalescence, and to create stable froths. By the correct choice of jet velocity and diameter, it is possible to provide a controlled shear environment that can generate bubbles of a suitable size for flotation, with the added advantage that the air is naturally aspirated by the jet, so there is no need for a compressor or blower. Thus the idea of the Jameson Cell was born.

After a number of failures, the radical new process for flotation emerged in the laboratory at the University of Newcastle. Jameson filed a provisional patent application in 1986. After an initial trial at the [[Renison Bell]] tin mine in Tasmania, certain design features were modified. He led a further plant trial with a small cell in the lead-zinc concentrator at [[Mount Isa Mines|Mt Isa Mines Ltd]] in Queensland, initially working alone. The plant metallurgists took an interest in the technology and helped to refine it, particularly checking the scale-up procedures that Jameson had devised. In 1988 a recent graduate was assigned full-time for a year to verify and validate the performance of the Cell. In 1989 a worldwide exclusive license was negotiated between Tunra Ltd on behalf of the University of Newcastle, Jameson, and MIM Holdings Limited, for the use of the Cell for metallurgical purposes. Summary papers on the theory&lt;ref name = "Jameson1993"&gt;Jameson, G.J., 1993. Bubbles in motion, Transactions of the Institution of Chemical Engineers A71, 587-594.&lt;/ref&gt; and practice&lt;ref name = "Evans"/&gt; have been published.

There have been ongoing significant changes to the design of the Cell since it was first developed in the late 1980s.

===Trouble in the mill (1980s)===

The commercial development of the Cell occurred indirectly as a result of problems being experienced in MIM's Mount Isa lead–zinc concentrator (sometimes referred to as a "mill" in the mining industry). MIM had been operating a lead–zinc concentrator at Mount Isa since 1931,&lt;ref name = "Young2000"&gt;M F Young, J D Pease and K S Fisher, "The George Fisher project to increase recovery in the Mount Isa lead/zinc concentrator," in: ''Seventh Mill Operators' Conference, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, 12–14 October 2000'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2000), 157–163.&lt;/ref&gt; although lead–zinc ore was substituted with copper ore for a time between mid-1943 and mid-1946.&lt;ref&gt;G Blainey, ''Mines in the Spinifex'', (Angus and Robertson: Sydney, 1960), 182–191.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the lead, zinc and other mineral grains in the ore became progressively finer, the ore grade decreased and it became more difficult to treat.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"&gt;M F Young, J D Pease, N W Johnson and P D Munro, "Developments in milling practice at the lead/zinc concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited from 1990," in: ''AusIMM Sixth Mill Operators' Conference, Madang, Papua New Guinea, 6–8 October 1997'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1997), 3–12.&lt;/ref&gt; These trends, combined with an increase in the concentrator's throughput, significantly reduced the concentrator's performance in the 1980s, resulting in a "tense" period of "an endless circle of circuit changes, reagent changes, operator changes, metallurgist changes, and so on".&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt; The decreasing grain size and pushing the grinding circuit beyond its design throughput meant a reduction in the degree of separation of the individual mineral grains (referred to as "liberation") during grinding. From 1984 to 1991, the liberation of [[sphalerite]] (the zinc-bearing mineral, ZnS) decreased from almost 70% to just over 50%.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt; This decrease in liberation resulted in a reduction in the recovery of zinc to saleable zinc concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt;

The initial response to the problem of decreased zinc recovery was in 1986 to start to produce a lower-grade concentrate that was a mixture of zinc and lead (known in the industry as a "bulk concentrate" and referred to at Mount Isa as the "low-grade middlings concentrate").&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt; This concentrate typically contained 34% zinc and 13% lead, compared to the normal zinc concentrate composition of at least 50% zinc and less than 3% lead.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt;

By producing the bulk concentrate, the total recovery of zinc for sale was maintained at over 70% until 1989.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt; However, the high lead content meant that the bulk concentrate could not be treated by the [[Zinc smelting#Electrolysis process|electrolytic zinc process]], and it had to be sold to zinc smelters using the more-expensive [[Zinc smelting#Blast furnace process (Imperial Smelting Process)|Imperial Smelting Process]]. Initially, MIM received good revenue from its bulk concentrate, but as the nature of the ore continued to deteriorate, the production of the bulk concentrate increased and saturated the market. Payment terms declined until MIM received less than half the payment for zinc in the bulk concentrate than it received for zinc in the zinc concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt;

The problems in the concentrator also affected the performance of MIM's Mount Isa lead smelter.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pease1997"&gt;J D Pease, M F Young, C J Greet, N W Johnson and P D Munro, "Application of fine grinding to improve galena flotation at the Mt Isa Mines lead/zinc concentrator," presented at: ''39th Annual AMIRA Technical Meeting, Adelaide, 11 September 1997''.&lt;/ref&gt; The lead–zinc ore also contained increasing amounts of fine-grained, carbonaceous [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt; This material was naturally hydrophobic and floated without the aid of a collector into the lead concentrate, diluting it. The additional sulfur from the pyrite in the lead concentrate reduced the lead smelter's lead production because the ability to eliminate sulfur from the concentrate was lead smelter's capacity bottleneck.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt;

As part of the effort to try to fix the problems, MIM installed some column flotation cells in the zinc concentrate and bulk concentrate sections of the plant.&lt;ref name = "Young1997"/&gt; In those days, the air was introduced into flotation columns using air spargers, usually in the form of a bag or sheath around a pipe.&lt;ref name = "Lane"/&gt; The spargers were high-maintenance items, and their performance was critical to the operation of the column.&lt;ref name = "Lane"/&gt;

===Inception and early development (1985–1990)===

====Lead and zinc flotation====

In 1985, MIM commissioned Jameson to undertake a project to improve the sparger design for flotation columns.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"&gt;J A Cowburn, R Stone, S Bourke and B Hill, "Design developments of the Jameson Cell," in: ''Centenary of Flotation Symposium, Brisbane, Queensland, 6–9 June 2005'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2005), 193–199.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he developed the concept of using a jet in a downcomer to create the bubbles and eliminate the need for a sparger in conventional flotation columns.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;
 
The concept of the Cell followed when further investigations showed that most of the bubble–particle interactions were occurring in the downcomer, rendering unnecessary the collection zone of flotation columns.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; The idea of the downcomer and short separation tank was developed and a provisional patent application was lodged in 1986.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; This patent was later assigned to TUNRA Limited ("TUNRA"),&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; the technology transfer company of the University of Newcastle that is now known as "Newcastle Innovation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bulksolids.com.au/about_us.html "TUNRA Bulk Solids – Who We Are."] Accessed 1 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newcastleinnovation.com.au/about-newcastle-innovation#.UampkPWQ8-U "About Newcastle Innovation."] Accessed 1 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pilot two tonne per hour (t/h) Jameson Cell with a 100&amp;nbsp;mm downcomer and using an orifice plate to create the jet was tested in MIM's lead–zinc concentrator.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; Subsequently, in 1988, MIM tested the flotation of a stream of fine lead-bearing particles in a conventional mechanical flotation cell, a conventional column and the Jameson Cell.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; The Cell gave the best recoveries.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; This was thought to be a combination of the short residence time of the particles in the Cell and the fact that the [[hydrophobicity]] of the lead particles decreased over time.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

As a result of this work, in 1989 MIM ordered four full-scale Cells, two for the Mount Isa lead–zinc concentrator and another two for the new Hilton lead–zinc concentrator&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; to be built at the Hilton Mine, located about 20 kilometers north of Mount Isa.&lt;ref name = "Rohner"&gt;P Rohner, "Lead-zinc-silver ore concentration practice at the Hilton Concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld," in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Second Edition'', Eds. J T Woodcock and J K Hamilton (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993), 504–507.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mount Isa cells had diameters of 1.9&amp;nbsp;m,&lt;ref name = "Munro1993"&gt;P D Munro, "Lead-zinc-silver ore concentration practice at the lead-zinc concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld," in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Second Edition'', Eds. J T Woodcock and J K Hamilton (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993), 498–503.&lt;/ref&gt; with three downcomers each,&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; while those at Hilton were 1.3&amp;nbsp;m in diameter&lt;ref name = "Rohner"/&gt; and had two downcomers each.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

====Coal flotation====

In parallel with this work, the Cell was tested for the recovery of fine coal at the [[Newlands coal mine]], also owned by MIM Holdings Limited.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; This fines stream was [[Hydrocyclone|cyclone]] [[Hydrocyclone#Design|overflow]], which contained 15–50% ash and was previously discarded.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt; The particle size of this stream was less than 25&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt; Pilot plant testing showed that it was possible to achieve greater than 90% recovery of coal, with less than 10% ash in the product.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;

Subsequently, a full-scale plant was commissioned at Newlands in the 1988–89 financial year, with six rectangular Cells (1.5&amp;nbsp;m × 3.5&amp;nbsp;m) installed in a two-stage arrangement.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; The cells in the first stage had seven downcomers, while those in the second had six.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;
These cells were in continuous operation at Newlands for 15 years until a new washing plant was built to replace the old one in 2006.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;

Two additional Cells were installed at MIM Holdings' Collinsville Coal operations in 1990. These had 10 downcomers each.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

====Copper flotation====

Also in 1989, Peko Mines, then a division of [[North Broken Hill Peko Limited]], also engaged Jameson to undertake test work in its Warrego concentrator near [[Tennant Creek]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt; The objective was to determine the Jameson Cell's performance in [[Froth flotation#Cleaning|cleaning]] copper concentrate to improve its grade by removing gangue minerals, including pyrite, [[magnetite]], [[hematite]] and [[quartz]].&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt; Peko Mines personnel also tested a conventional flotation column for comparison. Following the test work, Peko Mines installed two full-scale, 1.4&amp;nbsp;m diameter Jameson Cells in the concentrator, each with three downcomers.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt;
 
Peko Mines' decision was based on:

* metallurgical performance during pilot plant test work
* lower capital expenditure and installation costs
* shorter construction and installation times
* ease of operation and lower expected maintenance costs.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt;

Peko Mines reported a payback on the investment in the Cells of two months.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt;

====Electrolyte cleaning in solvent extraction – electrowinning plants====

[[Solvent extraction]] – [[electrowinning]] (often referred to as "SX–EW") is a process frequently applied for recovering copper from low-grade and/or oxidised copper ore. It involves leaching the copper from the ore using an acidic solution, collecting the leach liquor containing the copper and contacting this solution with an organic extractant. The copper ions in the leach liquor transfer to the organic extractant, moving from a relatively low concentration to a higher concentration. The extractant is subsequently brought into contact with a second aqueous solution that is more acid than the original leach liquor, and the copper again moves, this time from the extractant into the aqueous solution. The result is an acidic solution of copper in which the copper concentration is high enough for it to be recovered by electrowinning. The solution destined for electrowinning is known as the [[electrolyte]].&lt;ref&gt;P Hayes, ''Process Principles in Minerals &amp; Materials Production'' (Hayes Publishing Company: Sherwood, Queensland, 1993), 227–314.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The electrolyte solution usually contains traces of the organic extractant that exist as tiny droplets within it.&lt;ref name = "Readett1993"&gt;D Readett, "Copper recovery by heap leaching, solvent extraction, and electrowinning at Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld," in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy – The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, 2nd Edition'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993), 721–725.&lt;/ref&gt; These need to be removed before the copper can be recovered in the electrowinning process, as the presence of minimal amounts of the extractant can cause difficulties by stripping and damaging the cathodes with a subsequent loss of cathode copper quality.&lt;ref&gt;Xstrata Technology, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/Documents/brochure_en.pdf "Jameson Cell – Rising to the Challenge."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, MIM built an SX–EW plant at Mount Isa to recover copper leached from low grade ore stockpiled while mining its [[Mount Isa Mines#From survival to prosperity (1946–1973)|Black Rock open cut]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name = "Readett1993"/&gt; In a world first, a Jameson Cell was used to clean the electrolyte solution by removing the remaining organic solvent.&lt;ref name = "Readett1993"/&gt; This replaced the sand filters traditionally used.&lt;ref name = "Readett"/&gt;

The cell was 3&amp;nbsp;m high, twice the height of the early Cells used in MIM's lead–zinc concentrators, as it was thought that additional residence time would enhance recovery.&lt;ref name = "Readett"/&gt; It used a single downcomer.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; The downcomer was used to contact the electrolyte with air and the droplets of the organic extractant attached themselves to the air bubbles created in the downcomer.&lt;ref name = "Readett1993"/&gt;

After some initial modifications to the orifice size, the Cell was able to remove 70–90% of the entrained organic extractant.&lt;ref name = "Readett"/&gt;

====Early spread of the technology====

In April 1989, MIM Holdings Limited acquired the world rights to the Jameson Cell from TUNRA, with TUNRA retaining the rights to use the Cell for waste water treatment.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

After the initial applications within the MIM Holdings group of companies, the years to 1994 saw Jameson Cells installed by various base and precious metals companies in Asia, South Africa, Canada and the United States, mainly in concentrate cleaning duties, but also in SX–EW electrolyte cleaning duties.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; The installation by Phelps Dodge (now [[Freeport-McMoRan]]) for electrolyte cleaning at its Morenci operation in Arizona was notable for having a large cell 6.5&amp;nbsp;m in diameter with 30 downcomers.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; The Morenci Jameson Cell consistently recovered over 82% of the organic extractant.&lt;ref name = "Readett"/&gt;

Toward the end of the period, Cells were installed in coal preparation plants operated by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance and by Peabody for fines recovery.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

====Early design developments====

Improvements to this early design included a focus on the weight and wear of the downcomer.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; The downcomer was originally built with [[polyurethane]]-lined steel, and then changed to a [[high-density polyethylene]] ("HDPE") construction with seven elements.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

The orifice plate used to generate the slurry jet was a high-wear item and its materials of construction were also a focus of the development effort.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; After testing high-chromium hardened steel and various ceramics, high-density alumina was found to have excellent wear properties, and it became the standard.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

===The Mark II Cell (1994–1999)===

====Mark II improvements====

The original Jameson Cell design had the following features:
* small (200&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) downcomers
* no wash water
* no tailings recycle
* no bubble dispersers
* low capacity.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;

In 1994 MIM launched the Mark II model Cell.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt; It incorporated the following changes:
* the downcomer diameter was increased to 280&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;
* wash-water trays were included for froth washing&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;
* a tailings recycle system was added to maintain constant downcomer flow and higher recoveries&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;
* conical bubble dispersers were added&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;
* increased depth of tank from the bottom of the downcomer&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;
* increased distance between the downcomers.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; 
[[File:Jameson Cell external recycle mechanism.png|thumbnail|Figure 5. Drawing of a Jameson Cell fitted with an external tailings recycle mechanism.]]

These changes resulted in a higher capacity design.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;

One of the problems encountered with the Mark I Cell was that its performance was reduced if the feed rate to the cell varied, which was a common occurrence arising from normal fluctuations in operating concentrators.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; This problem was resolved by recycling some of the tailings to the cell feed via an external splitter box called an "External Recycle Mechanism" or "ERM" box separate to the flotation cell.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; Thus, when the production of the feed stream to the Jameson Cell decreased as a result of a fluctuation elsewhere in the concentrator, a higher percentage of the tailings was automatically recycled to the downcomers, producing a constant flow rate, hence feed pressure, to the cell.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; This had the added benefit of giving a proportion of the tailings (typically 40%) a second pass through the system, which resulted in higher recoveries.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; In coal fines flotation, this allowed a single Cell to achieve the same recovery of combustibles as had previously been achieved in some two-stage Cell systems.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt; 
 
Subsequently, an internal recycling system, referred to as the "internal recycle control" or "IRC" was developed. This was mainly used in integrated rectangular cells (see Figure 6), where the feed tank and tailings recycling system could easily be built in a single unit with the flotation cell. This system reduced the cell installation costs and made the cell more compact.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt;
[[File:Jameson Cell with internal tailings recycle mechanism.png|thumbnail|Figure 6. Drawing of a Jameson Cell designed with an internal tailings recycling system.]]
 
During this period, the orifice diameter was increased from the 28&amp;nbsp;mm design used in 1990 to 34&amp;nbsp;mm with the Mark II model and 38&amp;nbsp;mm in 1997.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; This, together with the larger Mark II downcomer diameter, allowed the slurry flow per downcomer to be doubled from 30&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h in 1990 to 60&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h in 1997.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

The increased distance between the downcomers reduced the interaction of aerated slurry discharging from adjacent downcomers.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; This interaction could reduce overall cell recovery by causing particles collected by bubbles in the downcomer to detach in the pulp tank.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

There was significant turbulence in the areas beneath the downcomers.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; that could result in particles detaching from bubbles.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; These turbulent areas were calmed by the addition of conical diffusers beneath each downcomer.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; They allowed uniform bubble rise velocities across the surface of the cell by slowing the superficial gas velocity in the high void-fraction area immediately around the downcomer and provided a more even bubble dispersion.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; It was reported that the diffusers reduced the turbulence by 69% compared with a standard downcomer with no diffuser.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

====New applications====

While the JamesonCell continued to expand in base metals concentrate cleaning, SX–EW electrolyte cleaning and coal fines recovery applications, it also found new applications in cleaning potash slimes&lt;ref name = "Burns"&gt;M J Burns, G Coates and L Barnard, "Use of Jameson Cell flotation technology at Cleveland Potash Ltd, North Yorkshire, England," ''Transactions of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy (Section C: Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy)'', May–August 1994, C162–C167.&lt;/ref&gt; and was adopted by the Philex Mining Corporation as the sole flotation machine for its Benguet copper concentrator.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"&gt;G J Harbort, A S Murphy and A Budod, "Jameson Cell developments at Philex Mining Corporation," in: ''AusIMM Sixth Mill Operators' Conference, Madang, Papua New Guinea, 6–8 October 1997'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1997), 105–113.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the normal application for the Cell. No other metals concentrator operates solely using Jameson Cells.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

=====Potash flotation=====

Cleveland Potash Limited extracts and refines sylvinite ore from a deposit in North Yorkshire, England.&lt;ref name = "Burns"/&gt; Its processing plant uses froth flotation to produce a product rich in [[potassium chloride]] ("KCl").&lt;ref name = "Burns"/&gt; After a test work campaign in which it compared the performance of the Cell with  mechanical flotation cells in various duties in the flotation circuit, Cleveland Potash ordered a Cell with 6 downcomers for recovering potash slimes.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; The test work had shown a 4.8% increase in the recovery of potash slimes, equivalent at the time to an increase in revenue of approximately £518,000 per year.&lt;ref name = "Burns"/&gt;

=====Copper rougher flotation=====

In 1993 Philex Mining Corporation, a Philippines mining company, replaced the mechanical cleaner circuit with Cells at its Benguet copper concentrator.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt; Following their successful operation, Philex replaced the mechanical cells in its cleaner-scavenger circuit in 1994 and began the phased introduction of Cell rougher and scavenger lines that was completed in early 1996.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt; This was the first operation in which the external recycle mechanism system was applied.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; By the time the last Jameson Cell was installed, the entire flotation circuit was composed of Jameson Cells.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt;

The motivation for installing Jameson Cells was, in part, to take advantage of their space-saving capabilities and to improve copper recovery at a minimum cost.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt; The Cell circuit occupied 60% less floor area and achieved equivalent results to the mechanical banks with 40% of their residence time.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt; They provided a power saving of 18%.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt;

In addition to these benefits, the use of the Jameson Cells in the rougher and rougher–scavenger section of the plant resulted in a 3.3% increase in copper recovery and a 4.5% increase in gold recovery.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt; When combined with the other Cells in the cleaner, recleaner and cleaner–scavenger section, there was a 2.6% increase in final copper concentrate grade and a 3.5% increase in plant copper recovery, with a 2.6% increase in plant gold recovery.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt;

===The Mark III Cell (2000–2008)===

====Mark III improvements====
[[File:Jameson Cell Mark IV slurry lens.png|thumbnail|Figure 7. The Jameson Cell Mark IV slurry lens.]]

The Mark III design encompassed the greatest improvement in the technology since its commercialisation. The focus was to make the technology more robust and easier to use in operations. The total redesign of the downcomer assembly allowed it to be isolated and unblocked much more easily compared to the Mark II design. The Mark III design also saw slurry flow per downcomer to be increased from 60&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h to 75–85&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h using larger orifice sizes in the slurry lenses.&lt;ref name = "LH"&gt;Personal communication, L Huynh, Jameson Cell Manager, Xstrata Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mark III Cell was introduced in 2000. It included the following improvements:
* a new slurry lens orifice design (see Figures 7 and 8)
* a new design downcomer and nozzle
* a new design flat plate bubble dispersers
* a stainless steel adjustable above and in-froth wash water system (see Figure 9)
* automated air and wash water flow control
* air-isolating slurry-eliminating valves ("AISE valves") 
* a bottom-fed new slurry distributor.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;
[[File:Photograph of Jameson Cell slurry lens.png|thumbnail|Figure 8. A Jameson Cell slurry lens being inserted into the top of a downcomer.]]

The earlier models of the Jameson Cell used [[orifice plate]]s to generate the downcomer jet.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; The new slurry lens design had a smooth, shallow entry angle that created an optimum flow regime over the ceramic, reducing wear and extending its life.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; The shape resulted in a decrease in power consumption by the feed slurry pump by up to 10% and resulted in better jet formation that improved air entrainment.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;
[[File:Jameson Cell coal froth washing.png|thumbnail|Figure 9. A stainless-steel wash water system fitted to a Jameson Cell being used for floating coal fines.]]
 
For coal applications, the wash water addition system was changed from a tray to stainless-steel circular rings attached to a manual lifting system.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; This allowed the flexibility of an easy transition from above-froth wash water addition to the in-froth addition that might be necessary for high concentrate-grade operations.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt; For metals applications, new design wash water trays consisting of removable rubber mats for easy maintenance were used.&lt;ref name = "LH"/&gt; 
 
The AISE valves were developed to prevent solids being sucked back into the air lines when individual downcomers become blocked. Solids depositing in the air lines and their build up in the air distributor decreases flotation performance as it prevents air from being efficiently entrained in the downcomers.&lt;ref name = "Cowburn"/&gt;

====New applications====

This period was one of rapid growth for the Jameson Cells in the existing applications.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; Seventy-seven  Cells were installed in concentrators around the world, mainly in coal and base metal operations.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; However, during this time, the Cell also moved into the Canadian [[oil sands]] industry for the flotation of bitumen.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

=====Bitumen flotation=====

Flotation is one of the unit processes used to separate the bituminous component of oil sands as part of the process of oil extraction.&lt;ref name = "Neiman"&gt;O Neiman, B Hilscher and R Siy,  [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Secondary%20Recovery%20of%20Bitumen%20using%20Jameson%20Downcomers.pdf "Secondary recovery of bitumen using Jameson downcomers,"] in: ''Proceedings of the 44th Canadian Mineral Processors Operators Conference, Ottawa, Ontario, 17–19 January 2012'' (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum), 115–124. Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the bitumen is not recovered in the primary separation vessel and reports to the tailings.&lt;ref name = "Neiman"/&gt; These tailings are typically retreated in a scavenging operation to try to recover some of the remaining bitumen.&lt;ref name = "Neiman"/&gt;

Three industrial-size single downcomer Jameson Cells were sold by Xstrata Technology to [[Shell Canada]] in 2007 for a large scale pilot plant project and eight 500&amp;nbsp;mm downcomers were sold to [[Syncrude|Syncrude Limited]] in 2008.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; In the latter case, the downcomers were used to treat middlings in an existing tertiary oil recovery vessel in a bitumen recovery process patented by Syncrude.&lt;ref name = "Neiman"/&gt;

===The Mark IV Cell (2009– )===

====Mark IV improvements====
[[File:Jameson Cell downcomer quick-release clamps.png|thumbnail|Figure 10. Photograph of the quick-release clamps used to attach the slurry line to the top of the Jameson Cell downcomer.]]

The Mark IV Cell design was introduced in 2009. It included the following improvements:
* a flexible hose for easier alignment of the downcomer
* clamping of the slurry lens onto the downcomer (see Figure 10)
* stainless steel quick-release clamps in the downcomer assembly
* long-lasting rubber flaps in the AISE valves.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;

==Current applications==

===Base and precious metals flotation===

In base and precious metals flotation, the Jameson Cell has established itself as being particularly useful in several applications in flotation circuits that also use other types of flotation cells, such as mechanical cells. These applications include:

* preflotation roughers for removing naturally hydrophobic gangue materials&lt;ref name = "XT"&gt;Xstrata Technology, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/Documents/brochure_en.pdf Jameson Cell brochure.]  Accessed 2 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (such as carbon, talc and elemental sulfur), where the Jameson Cell minimises the entrainment of the valuable minerals while eliminating naturally floating gangue minerals that would otherwise contaminate the concentrate&lt;ref name = "Smith"&gt;T Smith, D Lin, B Lacouture and G Anderson, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Removal%20of%20Organic%20Carbon%20with%20a%20Jameson%20Cell%20at%20R.pdf "Removal of organic carbon with a Jameson Cell at Red Dog mine,"] in: ''Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Ottawa, Ontario, 22–24 January 2008'' (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum), 333–346.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Carr"&gt;D Carr, G Harbort and V Lawson, "Expansion of the Mount Isa Mines copper concentrator phase one cleaner circuit expansion," in: ''Eighth Mill Operators' Conference, Townsville, Queensland, 21–23 July 2003'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2003), 53–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pokrajcic"&gt;Z Pokrajcic, G J Harbort, V Lawson and L Reemeyer, "Applications of the Jameson Cell at the head of base metal flotation circuits," in: ''Centenary of Flotation Symposium, Brisbane, Queensland, 6–9 June 2005'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2005), 165–170.&lt;/ref&gt;
* rougher-scalper and roughing duties where selectivity and froth washing produce high-grade concentrate. In this application, the recovery in one Jameson Cell is normally equivalent to several mechanical cells, and where the feed contains fast-floating liberated particles, the Cell can produce final-grade product, thus reducing the number of mechanical cells required in a flotation circuit&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D Curry, M Cooper, J Rubenstein, T Shouldice and M Young, "The right tools in the right place: how Xstrata Nickel Australasia increased Ni throughput at its Cosmos plant," in: ''Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Ottawa, Ontario, 19–21 January 2010'' (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum), 215–234.&lt;/ref&gt;
* cleaner-scalper duties, in which the Jameson Cell recovers fast floating minerals to produce a final-grade concentrate, thus reducing the load on the rest of the cleaning circuit and reducing its size.&lt;ref name = "Barns2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt; In this application, it can also be used as a low-cost way of expanding the capacity of an existing cleaner circuit&lt;ref name = "Seaman"&gt;D R Seaman, F Burns, B Adamson, B A Seaman and P Manton, "Telfer processing plant upgrade – the implementation of additional cleaning capacity and the regrinding of copper and pyrite concentrates," in: ''11th Mill Operators' Conference 2012, Hobart, Tasmania, 29–31 October 2012'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2012), 373–381.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bennett"&gt;D Bennett, I Crnkovic and P Walker, "Recent process developments at the Phu Kham copper–gold concentrator, Laos," in: ''Proceedings of the 11th Mill Operators' Conference, Hobart, Tasmania, 29–31 October 2012'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2012), 257–272.&lt;/ref&gt;
* final cleaning duties where mechanical cleaning circuits are unable to consistently produce final grade concentrate because of entrained gangue, the Jameson Cell with its enhanced selectivity and froth washing, is able to remove the gangue&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lauder"&gt;D W Lauder, M Mavotoi and J W Glatthaar, "Fluorine removal from OK Tedi copper/gold concentrates," in: ''Eighth Mill Operators' Conference, Townsville, Queensland, 21–23 July 2003'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2003), 203–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal flotation===

The Jameson Cell has been found to be particularly effective in cleaning and recovering fine coal particles. For example, at BHP Coal's Goonyella mine (now part of the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance) eight Cells were installed to replace the entire 32 mechanical cell flotation circuit in 1995 in its 1800 t/h coal flotation plant.&lt;ref name = "Osborne"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Carretta"/&gt; The result was an overall increase in yield for the plant of 3.5% (better than the predicted yield of 2.1% that was used to justify the project) and the production of a low-ash product.&lt;ref name = "Carretta"/&gt;

Since then, Jameson Cells have been installed in many coal preparation plants around the world,&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; with the largest installation at the [[Curragh coal mine]] in Australia, where 12 Cells treat over 5&amp;nbsp;million t/y of coal fines.&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;

The Cell can also be applied to coal preparation plant tailings to recover fine coal previously discarded.

===SX–EW plants===

The Jameson Cell is used to recover the organic solvent in solvent extraction – electrowinning plants from both the electrolyte and [[raffinate]] streams.&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;

Contamination of the electrolyte increases operating costs and reduces the quality of the copper product.&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;  Any solvent remaining in the raffinate stream represents a loss of solvent and hence an increase in operating costs.&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;

Major users of the Cell in SX–EW plants include Freeport McMoRan at its Morenci operations, BHP Billiton at its [[Olympic Dam mine|Olympic Dam]] operations and Grupo México at its Cananea and La Caridad operations.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; In all, Xstrata Technology reports 41 SX–EW applications.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

Recent developments in the Cell design for SX–EW applications include large, flat-bottomed cell design to allow it to sit on the ground and large (500&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) downcomers that can have multiple liquor (there being no slurry in SX–EW applications) lenses fitted to each downcomer.

The biggest operating Cell is at the Olympic Dam operations, treating 3000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h of raffinate.&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;

===Potash===

The first potash application was in England in 1993, where Jameson Cells were used to treat potash slimes (see [[Jameson Cell#Potash flotation|Potash flotation]]).&lt;ref name = "Burns"/&gt; It has subsequently been applied at Israel Chemicals Limited's Dead Sea Works and by an unnamed producer in the Saskatchewan province of Canada.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

===Oil sands===
The Jameson Cell has been adopted by Shell Canada and Syncrude for floating bitumen in the oil sands industry (see [[Jameson Cell#Bitumen flotation|Bitumen flotation]]).&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt; Syncrude bought an additional eight 500&amp;nbsp;mm downcomers for its plant in 2012.&lt;ref name = "Installations"/&gt;

===Iron ore===

The Jameson Cell can be used for the reverse flotation of silica from iron ore, where flotation columns have traditionally been used.&lt;ref name = "LH"/&gt;

===Phosphate flotation===

Phosphate processing operations that use flotation as the principal mechanism to concentrate the phosphate-bearing minerals usually discard particles smaller than 20&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter.&lt;ref name = "Teague"/&gt; This is because the fine particles have had poor flotation performance and because their presence decreases the flotation performance of the coarse particles.&lt;ref name = "Teague"/&gt;

Legend International Holdings Incorporated ("Legend") owns major phosphate deposits that average 20–60% particles less than 20&amp;nbsp;µm that contain up to 50% of the phosphate.&lt;ref name = "Teague"/&gt; This makes the traditional phosphate concentration practice uneconomic for these deposits.&lt;ref name = "Teague"/&gt; In response, Legend developed a process based on using the Jameson Cell in a rougher-scavenger-cleaner configuration to recover at least 80% of the phosphate at a grade of at least 32% P&lt;sub&gt;2&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; from a feed with a particle size distribution of up to 80% less than 20&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name = "Teague"/&gt;

==Advantages ==

The Jameson Cell reportedly has the following advantages:
* ''relatively low energy use'' – the only energy that is required to operate the Cell is to pump the slurry through the slurry lens. This means that it requires significantly less electricity than conventional mechanical or column flotation cells.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; In addition, the better particle–bubble contact means that fewer Cells are required for the equivalent duty of mechanical cells, giving an even bigger power saving.&lt;ref name = "Harbort1997"/&gt; 
* ''high recovery of fines'' – The Cell is able to achieve final product specification from previously discarded coal fines at very high recoveries (95–98%) in a single pass.&lt;ref name = "Young2013"/&gt; It has also been shown to be effective in recovering fine particles in base metals, potash and phosphate applications.
* ''effective froth washing'' – The Cell uses froth washing as standard to control concentrate grade. A conventional flotation cell has problems with recovering fine particles at high grades due to the entrainment of gangue minerals in the froth.&lt;ref name = "Araya"/&gt; The high throughput of the Jameson Cell means that the froth is produced in a small surface area so it is economic to apply froth washing to all cells&lt;ref name = "Seaman"/&gt;
* ''easily scaled up'' – the hydrodynamic conditions for particle collection inside the downcomer and separation in the tank are identical between the laboratory, pilot plant and industrial-scale Jameson Cell, meaning that there is direct scale-up. This makes predicting plant performance for small-scale tests straightforward.&lt;ref&gt;Xstrata Technology, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/JamesonCellAdvantages/Pages/AccurateDesignandScaleUp.aspx "Accurate design and scale-up."] Accessed 9 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, factors have to be used to scale-up the design of mechanical and column flotation cells.
* ''relatively small footprint'' – the high intensity of bubble-particle contact means that very low residence times are required in the Cell (residence time in the downcomer is 5–10 seconds&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt; and the separation tank volume is small compared with alternative technologies&lt;ref name = "Barns2009"/&gt;). This means that the total volume of the Cell is lower than the alternatives.
* ''fast response to process changes'' – process variables such as air flow rate, froth depth and wash water are all automated making optimisation straightforward.&lt;ref&gt;Xstrata Technology, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/JamesonCellAdvantages/Pages/EasytoTune.aspx "Easy to tune – quick to respond."] Accessed 1 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The small tank volumes means very short residence times in the tank (typically 1–3 minutes) so changes made, whether they are deliberate or from normal plant fluctuations, are observed almost instantly. 
* ''rapid start-up and shutdown'' – the small volume of the tank means that the Cell can be filled and drained quickly so with plant upsets the Cell can reach steady state very quickly. 
* ''low maintenance costs'' – the  Cell has no moving parts and is designed to provide easy access to serviceable parts. The slurry lens orifice has a service life exceeding 5 years under normal operating conditions and the service life of the other wet-end wear parts is reported to be over 10 years under normal operating conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Xstrata Technology, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/JamesonCellAdvantages/Pages/MinimalMaintenance.aspx "Minimal Maintenance – High Availability."] Accessed 7 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''low capital cost''&lt;ref name = "Carretta"/&gt; – the small footprint of the Cell reduces the amount of steel required in its construction and, coupled with the simplicity of its design, has lower installation costs when compared with conventional or column flotation cells. 
* ''low operating costs'' – the lack of moving parts with a consequent lower power consumption, long wear life and easy access results in low operating costs.
* ''short payback periods'' – Cell users typically report short payback periods for their investments in the technology. For example, the 2007 installation of a 5.4&amp;nbsp;m diameter Jameson Cell with 18 downcomers to treat preflotation concentrate recovered up to 90% of the zinc previously lost to the tailings disposal facility and had a payback of approximately one year at the zinc prices of the day.&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt; Peko Mines reported a payback period of two months for its Cell installation.&lt;ref name = "Jameson1991"/&gt; The complete replacement of 32 mechanical cells with eight Jameson Cells at the Goonyella coal mine had a payback of 17 months.&lt;ref name = "Carretta"/&gt; More recently, the installation of a Cell ahead of each of two cleaner trains at the [[Telfer Mine]] had a payback of between two and seven months.&lt;ref name = "Seaman"/&gt;

'''''Le chant du Styrène''''' (lit. "the song of the [[styrene]]") is a 13 minutes long French documentary film from 1958 directed by [[Alain Resnais]].

The film was an order by French industrial group [[Pechiney]] to highlight the merits of plastics. The commentary, narrated by [[Pierre Dux]], is a poem written by [[Raymond Queneau]], all in [[alexandrine]]s, whose title is a pun from styrene's phonetic resemblance to [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]].

In 1985, he was&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; appointed as Chief Engineer of Ryazantruboprovodstroy. In 1987, he became General Director of Kuibishevtruboprovodstroy. In 1991, Kuibishevtruboprovodstroy was one of the first companies to undergo privatization after the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]].

Mikhelson continued as Managing Director at the company, which has been renamed NOVA, until October 1994. He then became General Director of its holding company, Novafinivest, which later became known as NOVATEK. From 2008 until 2010 Mikhelson was Chairman of the Board of Directors for OAO [[Stroytransgas]] and OOO Art Finance. He currently holds the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors of ZAO [[Sibur|SIBUR]] and serves on the Supervisory Board of OAO Russian Regional Development Bank.

SIBUR is a gas processing and petrochemicals company operating 26 production sites across Russia with headquarters in [[Moscow]]. Mikhelson owns 57.5% interest in Sibur.

[[File:Gambling table - Zensar (3630410644).jpg|thumb|The gamble of outsourcing - as demonstrated at an outsourcing summit in London in 2009]]
'''''Outsourcing''''' is "an agreement in which one company hires another company to be responsible for an existing internal activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Ian|last2=Anagnostou|first2=Angela|title=The impact of outsourcing on the transaction costs and boundaries of manufacturing|journal=International Journal of Production Economics|volume=88|issue=1|pages=61–71|doi=10.1016/s0925-5273(03)00183-x|year=2004|citeseerx=10.1.1.468.9139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often involves the [[contract]]ing of a [[business process]] (e.g., payroll processing, claims processing), operational, and/or non-core functions, such as manufacturing, [[facility management]], [[call center]] support). The term "outsourcing" came from "outside resourcing" and dates back to at least 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | outsourcing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | outsource}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one [[firm]] to another. Outsourcing is also the practice of [[Privatization|handing over control of public services to private enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Dave, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/afscme-public-interest-privatization_n_3530817.html "Public Interest Group Challenges Privatization Of Local, State Government Services"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211181510/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/afscme-public-interest-privatization_n_3530817.html |date=2013-12-11 }}, The Huffington Post, July 1, 2013. Retrieved 2013-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting,&lt;ref name="Hira, Ron 2008"&gt;Hira, Ron, and Anil Hira. Outsourcing America: What's behind Our National Crisis and How We Can Reclaim American Jobs. New York: AMACOM, 2008. Print # 67-96.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes includes [[offshoring]] (relocating a business function to a distant country)&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Paul. ''What's This India Business?: Offshoring, Outsourcing, and the Global Services Revolution''. London: Nicholas Brealey International, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[nearshoring]] (transferring a business process to a nearby country). Outsourcing is often confused with offshoring, however, they can be distinguished: a company can outsource (work with a service provider) and not offshore to a distant country. For example, in 2003 [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] outsourced their facilities' management support, but it did not involve offshoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2012/07/09/11898/5-facts-about-overseas-outsourcing/|title=5 Facts About Overseas Outsourcing|date=2012-07-09|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial savings from lower international labor rates can provide a major motivation for outsourcing or offshoring. There can be tremendous savings from lower international labor rates when offshoring.

In contrast, [[insourcing]] entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house, and is sometimes accomplished via [[vertical integration]]. However, a business can provide a contract service to another organization without necessarily insourcing that business process.

==Overview==
Two organizations may enter into a contractual agreement involving an [[Financial transaction|exchange]] of [[Service (economics)|services]], expertise, and [[payments]]. Outsourcing is said to help firms to perform well in their core competencies, fuel innovation, and mitigate a shortage of skill or expertise in the areas where they want to outsource.&lt;ref&gt;Overby, S (2007) [http://www.cio.com/article/40380/ABC_An_Introduction_to_Outsourcing ABC: An Introduction to Outsourcing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630130752/http://www.cio.com/article/40380/ABC_An_Introduction_to_Outsourcing |date=2007-06-30 }}. CIO.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, businesses increasingly outsourced to suppliers outside their own country, sometimes referred to as offshoring or [[offshore outsourcing]]. Several related terms have emerged to refer to various aspects of the complex relationship between economic [[organizations]] or [[Business networking|networks]], such as [[nearshoring]], [[crowdsourcing]], [[multisourcing]],&lt;ref&gt;(Q4 2006)[http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=mandatory-multisourcing-discipline&amp;page=ss-viewresearch Mandatory Multisourcing Discipline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142453/http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=mandatory-multisourcing-discipline&amp;page=ss-viewresearch |date=2007-09-28 }} Business Trends Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2006/gb20061108_738883.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business Mandatory Multisourcing Discipline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119082031/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2006/gb20061108_738883.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business |date=2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[strategic alliances]]/[[strategic partnerships]], strategic outsourcing.,&lt;ref&gt;see Holcomb &amp; Hitt, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[vested outsourcing]].

Outsourcing can offer greater budget flexibility and control. Outsourcing allows organizations to pay for the services and business functions they need, when they need them. It also reduces the need to hire and train specialized staff, brings in fresh [[engineering]] expertise, and can reduce capital, operating expenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olive|first=B|title=Outsourcing Growing, Despite Controversy|journal=Power|year=2004|pages=148(4), 19–20.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and risk.

"Do what you do best and outsource the rest" has become an internationally recognized business tagline first "coined and developed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haus|first1=Marian|title=Best 10 Peter Drucker quotes|url=http://pmseed.com/best-10-peter-drucker-quotes/|website=pmseed|publisher=pmseed|accessdate=26 April 2015|date=2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416043146/http://pmseed.com/best-10-peter-drucker-quotes/|archivedate=16 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s by the "legendary management consultant" [[Peter Drucker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vitasek|first1=Kate|title=A New way to Outsource|journal=Forbes|date=1 June 2011|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/01/vested-outsourcing-microsoft-intel-leadership-managing-kate-vitasek.html|accessdate=26 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132447/http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/01/vested-outsourcing-microsoft-intel-leadership-managing-kate-vitasek.html|archivedate=15 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. It has been said that Mr. Drucker began explaining the concept of "Outsourcing" as early as 1989 in his ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' article entitled "Sell the Mailroom."&lt;ref&gt;Drucker Peter F, (1989) "Sell the Mailroom," ''Wall Street Journal'', accessible at {{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113202230063197204 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522111235/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113202230063197204 |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Drucker's perspective, a company should only seek to subcontract in those areas in which it demonstrated no special ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wartzman|first1=Rick|title=The Drucker Difference:  Insourcing and Outsourcing: the Right Mix|journal=Bloomberg Business|date=5 February 2010|url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|accessdate=6 May 2015|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522173550/http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|archivedate=22 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The business strategy outlined by his slogan recommended that companies should take advantage of a specialist provider's knowledge and economies of scale to improve performance and achieve the service needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Gwynne|title=Warehouse Management: A Complete Guide To Improving Efficiency and Minimizing Costs In the Modern Warehouse|date=2014|publisher=Kogan Page Limited|location=Walnut Street Suite 1100 Philadelphia PA 19102|isbn=978 0 7494 6934 4|page=316|edition=Second|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oimhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=Do+what+you+do+best+and+outsource+the+rest+drucker+drucker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rE56Ap5bc9&amp;sig=g4gAp2w9iinUOujS7uJnJFDqqHI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Iac7VZH3DsKWNvDYgKgI&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Do%20what%20you%20do%20best%20and%20outsource%20the%20rest%20drucker%20drucker&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053857/https://books.google.com/books?id=oimhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=Do+what+you+do+best+and+outsource+the+rest+drucker+drucker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rE56Ap5bc9&amp;sig=g4gAp2w9iinUOujS7uJnJFDqqHI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Iac7VZH3DsKWNvDYgKgI&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Do%20what%20you%20do%20best%20and%20outsource%20the%20rest%20drucker%20drucker&amp;f=false|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 by way of recognition, Peter Drucker posthumously received a significant honor, when he was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wartzman|first1=Rick|title=Insourcing and Outsourcing: the Right Mix|journal=Bloomberg Business|date=February 2010|url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|accessdate=26 April 2015|publisher=Bloomberg Business.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522173550/http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|archivedate=22 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outsourcing models ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}
A serial report published in the 2010s looking at outsourcing models in [[clinical development]] described seven distinct models: Preferred Provider, Fee-for-Service, Functional Service Provider (FSP), Hybrid Full Service/FSP, In-Sourced, Compound/Program-based, and Sole-Source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Miseta|first=Ed|date=August 20, 2018|title=Clinical Outsourcing Models: Still A Lot Of Churn And Uncertainty|url=https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/clinical-outsourcing-models-still-a-lot-of-churn-and-uncertainty-0001|department=From the Editor|magazine=Clinical Leader|type=Interview of Andrew Schafer|publisher=VertMarkets, Inc.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for outsourcing===
Companies primarily outsource to reduce certain costs, which may include peripheral or "non-core" business expenses,&lt;ref&gt;Forey, Gail, and Jane Lockwood. Globalization, Communication and the Workplace: Talking across the World. New York: Continuum, 2011. Electronic Book #21-26.&lt;/ref&gt; high taxes, high energy costs, excessive government regulation or mandates, and production or labor costs. The incentive to outsource may be greater for U.S. companies due to unusually high corporate taxes and mandated benefits like [[social security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and safety protection ([[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] regulations).&lt;ref&gt;Buchholz, Todd G. Bringing the Jobs Home: How the Left Created the Outsourcing Crisis&amp;nbsp;— and How We Can Fix It. New York: Sentinel, 2004. Print 97-118.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it appears U.S. companies do not outsource to reduce executive or managerial costs. For instance, [[executive pay in the United States]] in 2007 was more than 400 times more than average workers—a gap 20 times bigger than it was in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Albert R. "Letter From Washington: As U.S. rich-poor gap grows, so does public outcry" NY Times 2/18/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons include:
*Reducing and controlling operating costs.
*Improving company focus.
*Gaining access to world-class capabilities.
*Freeing internal resources for other purposes. 
*Streamlining or increasing efficiency for time-consuming functions. 
*Maximizing use of external resources.

===White-collar outsourcing===
Outsourcing of [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] work has grown rapidly since the early 21st century, despite a focus on manufacturing outsourcing. The [[digital workplace|digital workforce]] of countries like [[India]] and [[China]] are only paid a fraction of what would be [[minimum wage]] in the US. On average, [[software engineers]] are getting paid between 250,000 and 1,500,000 rupees (US$4,000 to US$23,000) in India as opposed to $40,000–$100,000 in countries such as the [[US]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Gillis"&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/203549187 Gillis, A. (2001, Digital sweatshops. This, 34, 6-6.]&lt;/ref&gt; Outsourcing has also expanded to include many different countries; [[Costa Rica]] has become a big source for outsourcing work as it offers the advantage of a highly educated labor force, a large bilingual population, stable democratic government, shares similar time zones with the United States, and it takes only a few hours to travel between Costa Rica and the US. Companies such as Intel, Procter &amp; Gamble, HP, Gensler, Amazon and Bank of America have big operations in Costa Rica.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the recent years there has been an exponential growth in white collar work with service providers emerging in a wide range of activities, from banking and legal services to companies like Resources US,&lt;ref name="Resources US"&gt;[http://www.resourcesus.net Resources US pioneer in outsourcing services to US architecture firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611173821/http://www.resourcesus.net/ |date=2016-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneer in outsourcing services for architecture firms in United States. Unlike outsourced manufacturing, outsourced white collar work, offers workers the flexibility to choose their working hours, and which companies to work for. With many individuals [[telecommuting]] from home, the companies that require this type of work do not need to allocate additional funds for setting up of office space, management salary, and employee benefits as these individuals are [[independent contractor|contracted workers]].&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Ross, J; Irani, L; Silberman, M.S.; Zaldivar, A; Tomlinson, B (2010). "Who are the Crowdworkers? Shifting Demographics in Mechanical Turk". CHI 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

===For business===

====Management processes====
Globalization and complex [[supply chains]], along with greater physical distance between higher management and the production-floor employees often requires a change in management methodologies, as inspection and feedback may not be as direct and frequent as in internal processes. This often requires the assimilation of new communication methods such as [[voice over IP]], [[instant messaging]], and [[Issue tracking]] systems, new [[time management]] methods such as [[Comparison of time tracking software|time tracking software]], and new cost- and schedule-assessment tools such as [[Comparison of development estimation software|cost estimation software]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Communications and customer service====
In the area of [[call center]] outsourcing, organizations that are not experienced in working with outsourced call centers may suffer from lower end-user-experience as a result of outsourcing. This is exacerbated when outsourcing is combined with offshoring in regions where the first language and culture are different.&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620105537/http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf |date=2010-06-20 }}. Cultural Sociology.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, foreign [[call center]] agents may speak with different [[linguistics|linguistic]] features such as [[Accent (dialect)|accents]], word use and phraseology, which may impede comprehension. The visual cues that are missing in a  [[telephone call]] may lead to misunderstandings and difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Alster, N (2005) [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/4390954/c_2984406/?f=archives Customer Disservice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702092211/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/4390954/c_2984406/?f=archives |date=2007-07-02 }} www.CFO.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Governance====
In 1979, Nobel laureate [[Oliver E. Williamson]] wrote that the governance structure is the "framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided." Adding further that "because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction."&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," Journal of Law and Economics: Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: {{cite web |url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919093134/http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3/ |archivedate=2016-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Tennessee researchers have been studying complex outsourcing relationships since 2003. Emerging thinking regarding strategic outsourcing is focusing on creating a contract structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex business arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, ﬂexible, and credible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate, et. al.|title=The Vested Outsourcing Manual|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0230112684|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Security====
Before outsourcing, an organization is responsible for the actions of their entire staff, sometimes a substantial liability. When these same people are transferred to an outsource service provider, they may not even change desks. But their legal status changes. They are no longer directly employed by (and responsible to) the organization. This creates legal, security and compliance issues that are often addressed through the contract between the client and the suppliers. This is one of the most complex areas of outsourcing and sometimes involves a specialist third-party adviser.

Fraud is a specific security issue as well as criminal activity, whether it is by employees or the supplier staff. However, it can be disputed that fraud is more likely when outsourcing is involved. For example, in April 2005, a high-profile case involved the theft of $350,000 from four [[Citibank]] customers when call-center workers acquired the passwords to customer accounts and transferred the money to their own accounts opened under fictitious names. Citibank did not find out about the problem until the American customers noticed discrepancies with their accounts and notified the bank.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro, J (2005) [http://www.infoworld.com/article/2668975/application-development/indian-call-center-workers-charged-with-citibank-fraud.html Indian call center workers charged with Citibank fraud] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042721/http://www.infoworld.com/article/2668975/application-development/indian-call-center-workers-charged-with-citibank-fraud.html |date=2015-09-24 }}. www.infoworld.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insourcing===
Outsourcing has gone through many iterations and reinventions. Some outsourcing contracts have been partially or fully reversed, citing an inability to execute strategy, lost transparency &amp; control, onerous contractual models, a lack of competition, recurring costs, hidden costs, and so on. Companies shifting to [[insourcing]] often cite the desire to increase control, compliance and to gain competitive differentiation through vertical integration or the development of shared services, commonly called a [[center of excellence]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Further, the label ''outsourcing'' has been found to be used for too many different kinds of exchanges often in confusing ways. For example, global software development, which often involves people working in different countries, cannot simply be called outsourcing. The outsourcing-based market model fails to explain why these development projects are jointly developed, and not simply bought and sold in the marketplace. Recently, a study has identified an additional system of governance, termed algocracy, which appears to govern global software projects alongside bureaucratic and market-based mechanisms. The study&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Aneesh|Aneesh]], A. Global Labor: Algocratic Modes of Organization, Sociological Theory 27:4 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes code-based governance system from bureaucracy and the market, and underscores the prominent features of each organizational form in terms of its ruling mechanism: bureaucracy (legal-rational), the market (price), and algocracy (programming or algorithm). So, global software development projects, though not insourced, are not outsourced either. They are in-between, in a process that is sometimes termed "remote in-sourcing."&lt;ref&gt;BPM Watch: {{cite web |url=http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/in-sourcing-a-closer-look-at-an-emerging-outsourcing-trend/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303212216/http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/in-sourcing-a-closer-look-at-an-emerging-outsourcing-trend/ |archivedate=2013-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects are developed together where a common software platform allows different teams around the world to work on the same project together.

===Standpoint of labor===
From the standpoint of labor, outsourcing may represent a new threat, contributing to worker insecurity, and is reflective of the general process of [[globalization]] and [[Polarization (economics)|economic polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]] (2006). "Feeling No Pain." ''New York Times'', March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2009, [[Jeff Immelt]], the CEO of [[General Electric]], called for the United States to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the workforce, commenting that the U.S. has outsourced too much and can no longer rely on consumer spending to drive demand.&lt;ref name=Immelt&gt;Bailey, David and Soyoung Kim (June 26, 2009).[https://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/8578904 GE's Immelt says U.S. economy needs industrial renewal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611181851/http://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/8578904 |date=2015-06-11 }}.''UK Guardian.''. Retrieved on June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standpoint of government===
Western governments may attempt to compensate workers affected by outsourcing through various forms of legislation. In Europe, the [[Acquired Rights Directive]] attempts to address the issue. The Directive is implemented differently in different nations. In the United States, the [[Trade Adjustment Assistance]] Act is meant to provide compensation for workers directly affected by international trade agreements. Whether or not these policies provide the security and fair compensation they promise is debatable.

====Policy-making strategy====
A main feature of outsourcing influencing policy-making is the unpredictability it generates regarding the future of any particular sector or skill-group. The uncertainty of future conditions influences governance approaches to different aspects of long-term policies.

=====Competitiveness strategy=====
Economic growth requires change, therefore a governance disposed to helping social and economic structures adapt to the changing environment will facilitate growth and a stable transition to new economic structures&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006"&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006). "Globalisation: the great unbludning(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; until the economic structures become detrimental to the social, political and cultural structures.

In [[Developing country|developing countries]], policies that embrace the global phenomenon of outsourcing are a logical response to the ongoing movement towards "open markets" and "trade liberalization." Outsourcing, when interpreted as a trade phenomenon, complements trade liberalization strategies not only by promoting technological spillovers and capital inflows but also by offsetting the increasing levels of unemployment which result from opening up domestic markets. As prices adjust to those in the global market they no longer reflect domestic productivity, driving lower-productivity firms in the previously protected sectors out of business. Economic theorists argue that the resulting unemployment is only temporary as workers readjust and are eventually incorporated into the country's most productive sectors, namely those which enjoy a competitive edge over other players in the international market. Nonetheless, rapid liberalization of markets in developing countries has not maximized the productivity potential of the region. In the Global South, where technological development is drastically lower than in the North, the redeployment of human and capital resources into new export markets has not come at the cost of necessarily low-productivity sectors but rather underdeveloped ones. In other words, many of the previously protected sectors were not competitive yet on a global scale, not because they naturally lacked the comparative advantage, but because industry efficiency had not yet been reached.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz, J. And Charlton 2005"&gt;Stiglitz, J. And Charlton, A., (2005). "Trade can be Good for Development," Ch. 2 in Fair Trade for All, Oxford University Press, Oxford, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases where liberalization stunts the growth of potential industries, unemployment is a reflection of many underemployed resources.

Outsourcing fills in the gap of receding protected national industries, improving employment and living standards. Among other economic externalities, outsourcing promotes capital inflows and infrastructure. In Mexico, wage convergence was faster in cities where outsourcing first took hold through [[maquiladora]]s, along the [[Mexico–United States border]]. Studies suggest that for every 10% increase in US wages, northern cities in Mexico which are most influenced by outsourcing would experience wage rises of 2.5%, about 0.69% higher than in inner cities.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, G. (2003), "What Has Happened to Wages in Mexico Since NAFTA", NBER Working Paper Series, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption and reduced tax revenues after the signing of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] have limited the economic resources available to the Mexican government, thus explaining the difference in investment policies between Mexico and China.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz, J. And Charlton 2005" /&gt; Conversely, one of the successes of Asian countries in the twentieth century has been their promotion of higher rates of saving and investment. Studies suggest that the increase in capital input fueled the ‘Asian miracle’ rather than improvements in productivity and industrial efficiency. Though the previous conclusion suggests production conditions in the region remained static, the situation in East Asia experienced rapid transformations. Not only were national educational rates raised drastically, but there was also an increase in patenting and research and development expenditures. Rising levels of education, urbanization and even of patenting illustrate the active role of the government in advancing education as well as encouraging research and development.&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, P., Obtsfeld, M. And Melitz, M., (2012) "East Asia: Success and Crisis", in International Economics: Theory and Policy, Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Education strategy=====
Jobs become outsourced not based on the skill-level group it represents, but rather based on a variety of other factors including transportation cost of ideas, wage and labour productivity edge.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006"/&gt; Because of the overall uncertainty regarding the future dynamics of outsourcing it is not possible to predict the nature of labour demand in different regions. To better prepare the domestic workforce to future industry demands, therefore, national education programs ought to focus on flexibility and diversity of skills rather than on any specific task-oriented skills. Emphasis should go on preparing students both to succeed in non-habitual tasks and to adapt to changes in labour demands in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Blinder, A. (2006), "Offshoring: The Next Industrial Revolution?" Foreign Affairs, 85:2, 113.128&lt;/ref&gt; A specific goal that ought to be adopted is teaching students how to learn rather than teach them particular skills. This strategy would help students adapt to changing skill requirements in the future thus reducing friction from structural unemployment.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006"/&gt;

=====Welfare state strategy=====
The uncertainty regarding the domestic productivity edge renders caution a key element of governance to ensure a sustainable regional developmenloyed{{Neologism inline|date=May 2017}} re-enter the work force and smoothly transition into high-demand labour opportunities, potentially through re-training programs, the government{{Who|date=May 2017}} should also address the socioeconomic struggle and other welfare concerns of displaced employees.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006). "Globalisation: the great unbludning(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative welfare effects of outsourcing have gathered substantial public attention. The possibility of outsourcing has internationalized labour markets which used to be local, opening up jobs which were traditionally non-traded to international competition. The resulting combination of lower wages and unemployment for certain jobs has driven the perceived ‘losers’ to engage in heated political debate.

Labour unions in the European Union have succeeded in pushing through protectionist policies in favour or lower-skilled groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including the Common Agricultural Policy on farming.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006" /&gt; Interest groups opposing outsourcing have been more active to voice their disapproval because the negative outcomes of the phenomenon are more concentrated on specific groups of people, namely those losing jobs to external competition, whereas the benefits from it become dissipated among the population at large. Overall lower prices and greater quality and variety of goods in domestic markets are some of the benefits of exploiting a country's comparative advantage through outsourcing.

Unlike the alleged ‘losers’ from outsourcing, those affected positively by it lack the motivation to organize to voice their support. There has been a wave of protectionism{{When|date=May 2017}} concerned with deep changes in the social structure allegedly imposed on the global system through globalization and outsourcing. The activists{{Who|date=May 2017}} see a readjustment of class systems and highlight an increased fracture in societies between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ as different groups adjust to increasingly or decreasingly advantageous positions in the system of outsourcing. Opponents of outsourcing have also denounced it as a threat to local cultural integrity.

The argument on cultural disintegration points to the standardization of practices and norms as multinational corporations become involved with industries in regions culturally different from those in the country of origin. The alleged diffusion of culture has raised concern over the endurance of cultural norms and values, sociopolitical institutions and frameworks, or even cultural preferences and traditions in a context of increasing foreign presence.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrik, D., (2007), "Globalization for Whom", Ch. 9 in One Economics Many Recipes, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased uncertainty regarding future socioeconomic security ought to be met with policies promoting equality and a fair redistribution of economic gains for a government to maintain its voters’ favour. Because of overall unpredictability, governments will likely need to reassure civilians that the burden of employment jobs resulting from outsourcing will be shared among taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006" /&gt;

The fluctuations in employment levels are determined by the types of jobs which can be profitably outsourced or offshored. Domestic jobs become offshored or outsourced when lower productivity in other regions is compensated by lower wages, making outsourcing profitable even despite the added costs of transportation. The overall cost-effectiveness of the spatial unbundling of the industrial process thus depends on the cost of transporting specific services or ideas given the available technology. Because of these technological advancements such as the telecommunications revolution, air shipping or the Internet have deeply accelerated outsourcing and may continue to boost this process.

The future results of technological ingenuity and innovation are unknown, as are its potential impacts employment levels on any given task or job across regions.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006" /&gt; In the [[Global South]], policies attracting multinational corporations can help increase employment levels and promote growth. Governments that pursue these policies facilitate welfare protection given the context of increased unemployment in industries which cannot compete with the international market due to trade liberalization policies.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz, J. And Charlton 2005" /&gt;

=====Industrial policy=====
Outsourcing results from an internationalization of labor markets as more tasks become tradable. According to leading economist Greg Mankiw, the labour market functions under the same forces as the market of goods, with the underlying implication that the greater the number of tasks available to being moved, the better for efficiency under the gains from trade. With technological progress, more tasks can be offshored at different stages of the overall corporate process.&lt;ref&gt;Mankiw, G. and Swagel, P. (2005). "The Politics and Economics of Offshore Outsourcing," working paper for the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Environmental policy=====
There are widespread claims that outsourcing has pushed environmental standards down in developing regions as countries compete to attract foreign projects and investment. Similar to lower wages, lower health and environmental regulations contribute to giving a country a comparative advantage over another due to lower production costs. The controversy this raises, however, is that unlike wages, lower health or environmental standards does benefit the new employees joining the workforce.
Import competition has caused a de facto ‘race-to-the-bottom’ where countries lower environmental regulations to secure a competitive edge for their industries relative to other countries. As Mexico competes with China over Canadian and American markets, its national Commission for Environmental Cooperation has not been active in enacting or enforcing regulations to prevent environmental damage from increasingly industrialized Export Processing Zones. Similarly, since the signing of NAFTA heavy industries have increasingly moved to the US which has a comparative advantage due to its abundant presence of capital and well-developed technology. A further example of environmental de-regulation with the objective of protecting trade incentives have been the numerous exemptions to carbon taxes in European countries during the 1990s. The evidence suggests that even if outsourcing has promoted lower environmental protection, there are no intrinsic geographic implications that the Global South has been more negatively affected than the North. o Although outsourcing can influence environmental de-regulatory trends, the added cost of preventing pollution does not majorly determine trade flows or industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, B. (2007), "Trade and the Environment: What do we do now", Ch. 39 in Handbook on International Trade Policy, ed. Kerr, W and Gaosford, J., Edward Elgar Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization and socio-economic implications===
{{Main|Globalization}}

====Global inequality and development====

=====Industrialization=====
Outsourcing has contributed to further levelling of global inequalities as it has led to general trends of industrialization in the Global South and deindustrialization in the Global North.

Even though outsourcing has promoted a movement of industrial sites from the Global North to Global South regions, it has not been the only reason for the concurrent deindustrialization and industrialization of the North and South respectively. Deindustrialization in more economically and technologically developed regions has also been affected by increased industrial productivity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006). "Globalisation: the great unbundling(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in industrial efficiency which characterized development in developed countries has occurred as a result of labor-saving technological improvements. Although these improvements do not directly reduce employment levels but rather increase output per unit of work, they can indirectly diminish the amount of labor required for fixed levels of output.&lt;ref&gt;Easterly, W. (2002), "Solow's Surprise: Investment is not the Key to Growth", Ch. 3 in The Elusive Quest for Growth, The MIT Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a trending shift in demand towards non-tradable services such as those in the health-care or government sectors has further accelerated deindustrialization in the Global North. Since these tasks cannot be outsourced, the demand for them needs to be met domestically abiding by the local market price. Consequently, a shift in the labor force towards fulfilling these profitable services has mostly taken place at the expense of industry since the agricultural sector in the early industrializing Global North had already been maximizing its labour capacity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite the variety of domestic and international factors affecting deindustrialization in the Global North, those concerning the external influence of the global market have been the most influential ones since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Rowthorn, R. and Coutts, K. ( 2004), "Deindustrialization and the balance of payments in advanced economies," UNCTAD Discussion Paper No.170&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent industrialization process outsourcing has encouraged in the Global South has taken place at a much faster pace than it did during its beginnings in the North, given that the well-developed technology was already developed, and merely spread to further regions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====Growth and income=====
The almost simultaneous industrialization of the developing Global South and deindustrialization of the more developed Global North resulted in an international convergence of incomes.

Outsourcing has been characterized by rapid rates of growth and industrialization in the Global South. Conversely, the Global North has experienced a moderate slowdown in growth. Patterns of global industrialization and deindustrialization are explained by a combination of models in economic geography and economic growth. Models in economic geography illustrate that decreasing communication costs reduce the spatial clustering of industrial development. The lower cost to the spread of ideas improved coordination and communication within corporations across greater geographic distances. This process originated roughly after the international chaos of the World Wars, as a consequence of advancements in information technology during the 1960s. Further adaptations to technological progress, particularly the spread of the internet and liberalization of the telecommunications industry, permitted an acceleration of the movement of ideas and consequently of outsourcing since about the 1980s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====Urbanization=====
The pace of urbanization in the Global North decreased considerably relative to its high levels following the Industrial Revolution. Rates of urban growth have been higher in the Global South.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006), "Globalisation: the great unbundling(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade====
Outsourcing emerged with a new wave of globalization marked by high volumes of trade and capital flows. The increased movement of capital and goods contrasted starkly with the barriers and protectionism prevalent throughout the World Wars and the Great Depression during the Interwar Years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Migration====
The level of migration has remained relatively low, particularly compared to the mass migratory trends which characterized the Industrial Revolution roughly between 1850 and 1914.,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; probably because labor markets are not free now. Countries now have discrimination labor laws, only allow people with citizenship cards live and work free in their territories, even getting a citizenship card is difficult for some one not born in their territory. Free labor markets, discrimination based with a person skills would help reduce outsourcing problems, letting people freely follow their jobs in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=Howard|title=Cultural Communities in a Global Labor Market: Immigration Restrictions as Residential Segregation|year=2007|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Law School|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Domestic inequality====
Outsourcing in the Global North led to a rising divergence in domestic employment levels in different tasks within a given industry, making tackling unemployment more difficult for governments as job losses ceased to be primarily sectoral.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==By country==

===United States===
"Outsourcing" has become a continuing political issue in the United States, having been conflated with offshoring, during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]]. The political debate centered on outsourcing's consequences for the domestic U.S. workforce. [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] U.S. presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] criticized U.S. firms that outsource jobs abroad or that incorporate overseas in [[tax haven]]s to avoid paying their "fair share" of [[Taxation in the United States|U.S. taxes]] during his 2004 campaign, calling such firms "[[Benedict Arnold]] corporations".

Criticism of outsourcing, from the perspective of [[U.S. citizen]]s, generally revolves around the costs associated with transferring control of the labor process to an external entity in another country. A [[Zogby International]] poll conducted in August 2004 found that 71% of American voters believed that "outsourcing jobs overseas" hurt the economy while another 62% believed that the U.S. government should impose some legislative action against companies that transfer domestic jobs overseas, possibly in the form of increased taxes on companies that outsource.&lt;ref&gt;Zogby International survey results online at [http://www.zogby.com/news/2004/09/22/majority-of-americans-71-say-outsourcing-jobs-overseas-bad-for-us-economy-china-viewed-as-greatest-e/ zogby.com]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; One prediction (form 2010) claims that, by 2014, more than 1.3 million positions will disappear because of "the accelerated movement of work to India ..." and some other countries willing to accept outsourced jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Bonasia, J. (2010, December 03). Offshoring, for good or ill, comes of age putting India on the map competitive world markets demand outsourcing, but it does drain domestic jobs. Investor's Business Daily. A04.&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama promoted an act titled '[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3364 Bring Jobs Home Act]' that would help reshore jobs by giving incentives such as a tax cut or a 20 percent tax credit for moving operations back to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Documents and Publications.

Labor advocates accuse [[union busting]] as one possible cause of outsourcing. They argue that as unions are disadvantaged by union busting legislation, workers lose bargaining power and it becomes easier for corporations to fire them and ship their job overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another rationale is the high corporate income tax rate in the U.S. relative to other OECD nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1466.html |title=U.S. Lagging Behind OECD Corporate Tax Trends |publisher=The Tax Foundation |date=2006-05-05 |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706032603/http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1466.html |archivedate=2009-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Tamny |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODZjNjI4ZTNjZmNiOGMxYjAwOTg1ZGI0NmFiOWFjZjI= |title=John Tamny on Hillary Clinton Economics on NRO Financial |publisher=Article.nationalreview.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109171714/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODZjNjI4ZTNjZmNiOGMxYjAwOTg1ZGI0NmFiOWFjZjI= |archivedate=2009-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=June 2018}} and the practice of taxing revenues earned outside of U.S. jurisdiction, a very uncommon practice. However, outsourcing is not solely a U.S. phenomenon as corporations in various nations with low tax rates outsource as well, which means that high taxation can only partially, if at all, explain US outsourcing. For example, the amount of corporate outsourcing in 1950 would be considerably lower than today,{{when|date=June 2018}} yet the tax rate was actually higher in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also suggested that lowering the corporate income tax and ending the double-taxation of foreign-derived revenue (taxed once in the nation where the revenue was raised, and once from the U.S.) will alleviate corporate outsourcing and make the U.S. more attractive to foreign companies. However, while the US has a high official tax rate, the actual taxes paid by US corporations may be considerably lower due to the use of tax loopholes, tax havens, and "gaming the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/high-corporate-tax-rate-is-misleading-22463/ |title=High Corporate Tax Rate Is Misleading at |publisher=Smartmoney.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210200332/http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/high-corporate-tax-rate-is-misleading-22463/ |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than avoiding taxes, outsourcing may be mostly driven by the desire to lower labor costs (see standpoint of labor above). [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] has also been cited as a factor for corporate flight from U.S. jurisdiction.

Where outsourcing involves the transfer of an undertaking, it is subject to Council Directive 77/187 of 14 February 1977, on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (as amended by Directive 98/50/EC of 29 June 1998; consolidated in Directive 2001/23 of 12 March 2001). Under that directive, rights acquired by employees with the former employer are to be safeguarded when they, together with the undertaking in which they are employed, are transferred to another employer, i.e., the contractor. An example of a case involving such contracting-out was the decision of the European Court of Justice in Christel Schmidt v. Spar- und Leihkasse der früheren Ämter Bordesholm, Kiel und Cronshagen, Case C-392/92 [1994]. Although subsequent decisions have disputed whether a particular contracting-out exercise constituted a transfer of an undertaking (see, for example, [[Süzen v Zehnacker Gebaeudereingung GmbH|Ayse Süzen v. Zehnacker Gebäudereinigung GmbH Krankenhausservice]], Case C-13/95 [1997]), in principle, employees of an enterprise outsourcing part of its activities in which they are employed may benefit from the protection offered by the directive.

Seeking to implement the cost-cutting solutions, many Western European firms have been transferring tech projects eastward. For example, Deutsche Bank has some of its software developed in Ukraine, Siemens possess R&amp;D center in Romania. Europe Outsourcing has produced outstanding results and henceforward they are increasing them in numbers.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Despite unfavorable economic conditions from 2007 to 2009, the outsourcing services market continued to flourish in Central and Eastern European. In 2008 when the inflow of investment in Western Europe was down by 48%, it fell by only 9% in Central and Eastern Europe. In [[Poland]] alone, during 2009, the year following the global economic downturn, approximately 10,000 jobs were created in [[business process outsourcing]] (BPO).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Co-sourcing==
'''Co-sourcing''' is a business practice where a service is performed by staff from inside an organization and also by an external service provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=80237620 | title='Co-Sourcing' and More | publisher=hreonline.com | date=March 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 | author=McIlvaine, Andrew R. | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513092203/http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=80237620 | archivedate=May 13, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/6502924 | title=Out With 'Outsourcing' And In With 'Co-Sourcing' | publisher=informationweek.com | date=September 2, 2002 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 | author=Khirallah, Diane Rezendes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be a service performed in concert with a [[customer|client]]'s existing internal [[audit]] department. The scope of work may focus on one or more aspects of the [[internal audit]] function. Co-sourcing can serve to minimize sourcing risks, increase transparency, clarity and lend toward better control over the processes outsourced.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary: {{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/co-sourcing.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819235940/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/co-sourcing.html |archivedate=2016-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of co-sourcing services are supplementing the in-house internal audit staff with specialized skills such as information [[risk management]] or integrity services, providing routine assistance to in-house auditing for operations and control evaluations in peak period activity and conducting special projects such as fraud investigation or plant investment appraisals. Another example of co-sourcing is outsourcing part of [[software development]] or [[software maintenance]] activities to an external [[organization]], while keeping part of the development in-house. Other internal business activities such as [[Human Resources|HR]] and administrative tasks can also be co-sourced by [[Professional Employer Organization|employee leasing]] companies.

===Identity management co-sourcing===
It is an approach to enterprise [[identity management]] in which the identity service interacts directly or through some technical footprint with an organization's [[Information Technology]] (IT) identity back-end infrastructure: [[directory service|directories]], [[database]]s, and other identity repositories. The organization and the external service provider typically have a shared responsibility for building, hosting and operating the identity service. The balance of this responsibility can vary depending on the service levels required, and span from an all on-premises deployment, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated within the organization's [[IT infrastructure]] and managed on-premises by the external service provider. This contrasts with an "all in-the-cloud" service scenario, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated by the service provider in an externally hosted, [[cloud computing]] infrastructure.

==Counterwave outsourcing==
Some firms have reversed the decision to outsource because the results were not entirely as expected. The circumstances which allow firms to unbundle the different tasks or stages of its manufacturing process into different locations have not been fully determined. Though the nature of the tasks plays a role determining their interconnectedness, other factors such as innovation in the manufacturing process or advances in transport and communication technology also affect the need for direct contact among employees. As the process which ties tasks together within firms remains unclear, there is a degree of uncertainty about which tasks need to remain geographically clustered together. In many cases firms took risks experimenting with outsourcing while lacking a firm understanding of the relationship among internal tasks and its spatial implications.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite saving money, companies have often faced unexpected drawbacks from outsourcing, such as miscommunication or lower quality of intermediate products, which end up delaying the overall production process. Another reason for a decrease in outsourcing is that many jobs that were subcontracted abroad have been replaced by technological advances.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

According to a Deloitte Consulting survey carried out in 2005, a quarter of the companies which had outsourced tasks reversed their strategy. Many big companies like Lenovo considered turning around outsourcing strategies of outsourcing.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring|title=Here, There and Everywhere|publisher=''[[The Economist]] [London] n.d.: n. pag.|date=17 January 2013|accessdate=19 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118202607/http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring|archivedate=18 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion in the US and other Western powers opposing outsourcing was particularly strengthened by the drastic increase in unemployment as a result of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In the first decade from 2000 to 2010, the US experienced a net loss of 687,000 jobs due to outsourcing, primarily in the computers and electronics sector. Public disenchantment with outsourcing has not only stirred political responses, as seen in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 US presidential campaigns]], but it has also made companies more reluctant to outsource or offshore jobs.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

A 2016 Deloitte survey suggested that companies are no longer reluctant to outsource.&lt;ref&gt;"Outsourcing accelerates forward," (2016) Deloitte 2016 Global Outsourcing Survey accessed 18 August 2016 at {{cite web |url=http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-cons-sdt-gos-exec-summary-2016.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112100552/https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-cons-sdt-gos-exec-summary-2016.pdf |archivedate=2017-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deloitte's survey identified three trends: 
*Companies are broadening their approach to outsourcing as they begin to view it as more than a simple cost-cutting play
*Organizations are "redefining the ways they enter into outsourcing relationships and manage the ensuing risks."  
*Organizations are changing the way they are managing their relationships with outsourcing providers to "maximize the value of those relationships."

'''Sir Edward Owen Cox''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|GBE}} (21 January 1866 &amp;ndash; 30 July 1932), known as '''Owen Cox''', was a [[Wales|Welsh]]-born  [[Australia]]n businessman and politician.

Cox was born in [[South Wales]], was educated at [[Christ's Hospital]], and went to sea at the age of fourteen. He left his first ship at [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], however, and went into the [[banking]] business.&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radi|first1=Heather|title=Cox, Sir Edward John Owen (1866–1932)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/cox-sir-edward-john-owen-5798|website=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few years he returned to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], but then sailed to Australia and settled in [[Sydney]]. He became chairman of Birt &amp; Co and a [[board of directors|director]] of the [[New Zealand Shipping Company|Federal Steam Navigation Co Ltd]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; He was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] in 1922.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Edward Owen Cox (1866-1932)|work=Members of Parliament|publisher =[[Parliament of New South Wales]]|url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/members/Pages/member-details.aspx?pk=1165|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his war services, Cox was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in  the [[1918 New Year Honours]] and promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GBE) in the Dominion war honours of 1920.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Cox died in [[Monte Carlo]], aged 66, after an illness lasting several months.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

A '''"Predictable Surprise"''' describes a situation or circumstance in which avoidable crises are marginalized in order to satisfy economic and social policies.

==Definition==
[[Max H. Bazerman]] and [[Michael D. Watkins]] define "predictable surprises" as problems that 
* at least some people are aware of, 
* are getting worse over time, and 
* are likely to explode into a crisis eventually,
* but are not prioritized by key decision-makers or have not elicited a response fast enough to prevent severe damage. 

The problems behind "predictable surprises" tend to require a significant investment in the near term that will not pay off until later. This could involve changes to established organization culture and/or changes that competing interests do not benefit from.


== Examples of predictable surprises ==

* [[Iraq War]]
* [[Enron scandal]]
* [[Subprime mortgage crisis]]&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, M (2007)[http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/dec2007/ca20071213_764745.htm BusinessWeek (December 17) Subprime: A Predictable Surprise]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina|Hurricane Katrina Response]]&lt;ref&gt;Irons, L (2005) [http://www.hsaj.org/pages/volume1/issue2/pdfs/1.2.7.pdf Homeland Security Affairs Hurricane Katrina as A Predictable Surprise]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Global Warming]]&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman, M (2006) Climate change as a predictable surprise.''Climatic Change'' 77:79-193&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases]]

The '''Presidential Communications Group''' or simply the '''Communications Group''', is the collective name for the newly formed{{when|date=November 2018}} offices within the [[Office of the President of the Philippines]] and refers to the following positions and offices: the Presidential Spokesperson and the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO)—formerly the Office of the Press Secretary.

The Communications Group is primarily responsible for planning, programming, and coordinating the activities that will most effectively collect information about what is happening in the Executive branch of the government, and getting this information to the [[Mass media|media]]. The Group's other role is to help Filipinos understand government policies and programs, and to shore up support for them.

==Presidential Spokesperson==
[[File:Ph seal office of presidential spokesperson (English).png|right|110px]]
The Presidential Spokesperson speaks on behalf of the President about matters of public interest. Considering the restricted level of access that the media has to the Chief Executive, the Spokesperson is expected to be the primary source of presidential directives in the absence of the President of the Philippines.

The Presidential Spokesperson is not subject to confirmation by the [[Commission on Appointments (Philippines)|Commission on Appointments]], and does not have any specific item or template in government.

The current Presidential Spokesperson is [[Salvador Panelo]] (who succeeded [[Harry Roque]]) while the Assistant to the Presidential Spokesperson is [[China Jocson]] of the [[Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte|Duterte Administration]].

==Presidential Communications Operations Office==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PCOO-logo.png|Presidential Communications Operations Seal|right|110px]] --&gt;

The Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) is in charge of disseminating the government’s message to private media entities. It exercises supervision and control over state-owned media entities to disseminate the official messages properly and effectively in accordance with the communications plan. It is responsible for the accreditation and authentication of the credentials of foreign media correspondents in line with its primary task to cultivate relations and assist private media entities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ph/2010/08/09/briefing-on-presidential-communications-reforms/&lt;/ref&gt; During the administration of [[Benigno Aquino III]], the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) was named the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO).

The PCOO head holds a cabinet rank. He/she is assisted by an undersecretary for administration and finance, an undersecretary for operations, a chief of staff, an assistant secretary for legislative affairs, and an electronic data processing division chief.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ph/2010/07/30/executive-order-no-4/&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCOO is composed of the following units and agencies:
* News and Information Bureau
* [[Philippines News Agency]]
* [[Philippine Information Agency]]
* [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]]
* [[People's Television Network]]
* [[Philippine Broadcasting Service]] - Bureau of Broadcast Services (Radyo Pilipinas)
* PBS-Radio-Television Malacañang
* Bureau of Communications Services
* National Printing Office
* APO Production Unit
* OP Web Development Office (commonly referred to as the President's New Media Team)
* Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office (PCDSPO)

==Units under the Presidential Communications Operations Office==

===Presidential News Desk===
The Presidential News Desk (PND) functions as the [[newsroom]] of [[Malacañang Palace]]. It gathers and disseminates information, such as [[press release|press]] and [[photograph|photograph releases]], and official statements from the Palace, on a daily basis.

The PND operates from Sundays to Saturdays, 5:00&amp;nbsp;AM to 7:00&amp;nbsp;PM.  It is headed by a chief [[editing|editor]] and is composed of a [[managing editor]], [[deskman|deskmen]], and [[reporter]]s. Other units, which support the PND are Electronic Data Processing, Transcription and Monitoring, and Photographs.

[[Francisco Tatad]] conceived the PND. He was the Press Secretary to [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. It was then called the Central Desk and was located in the Mabini Building. During the [[administration (government)|administration]] of President [[Corazon C. Aquino]], Press Secretary Benigno Teodoro relegated the Central Desk, which became the News and Reportorial Section, as a section of the Presidential Press Staff. Under the [[Fidel V. Ramos|Ramos]] administration, Press Secretary Rodolfo Reyes strengthened presidential coverage and set up the PND.

===Philippine Information Agency===
[[File:Philippine Information Agency Logo.svg|60px|right]]
The Philippine Information Agency (PIA), established by Executive Order No. 100, is the main development communication arm of the government. It is under the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO). 

The PIA directly serves the Presidency and the executive branch of the national, regional and provincial levels through its 16 regional offices and 71 provincial information centers. 

Its core services include: information gathering/research, production and dissemination, and institutional development and capacity-building focusing on alliance-building, networking, communication-related training, consultancy and technical assistance. The PIA is also the advertising arm of the government.

It is currently headed by Harold E. Clavite (director general) and Gregorio Angelo C. Villar (deputy director general), assisted by staff directors in the central office, regional directors in the regional offices, and more than 500 permanent and contractual employees.

Its tagline is "Empowering Communities". The PIA works with community stakeholders, including local government units, line agencies, private entities, schools, colleges and universities, civil society organizations, and other groups in ensuring proper dissemination of information at the grassroots level. The agency advocates responsible sharing of information and responsible use of social media. Its current management and personnel work with the mantra and belief that "a well-informed Filipino is an empowered Filipino".

In 2017, the PIA was tasked by PCOO to take the lead in promoting the 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit and established information kiosks in more than 90 locations in the country and conducted community fora and dialogue with community leaders and local townsfolk.

===Bureau of Communication Services===
The Bureau of Communication Services is the attached agency of the PCOO that is tasked to provide materials and services related to various functions of the Presidency, PCOO and the general public.

It also produces information materials for state events such as the anniversary of the [[People Power Revolution]], ''[[Araw ng Kalayaan]]'' celebrations, and others. Director IV John S. Manalili is the bureau's current director.

===Presidential Broadcast Staff - Radio TV Malacañang===
Created by President Corazon C. Aquino&lt;ref&gt;under Executive Order No. 297 on July 25, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;, the Presidential Broadcast Staff - Radio Television Malacañang is tasked to provide the necessary media services, video and audio, to the incumbent President, to document all official engagements, and to make available to the public accurate and relevant information on the activities, programs and pronouncements of the national leadership.

The agency is involved in television coverage and documentation, news and public affairs syndication of all the activities of the President, either live or delayed telecast through government or private collaborating networks.

===Media networks===
There are two government-run television networks, which are the [[People's Television Network]] (PTV-4) and the [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] (IBC-13). The [[Philippine Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) constitutes the government radio network.

IBC-13 and RPN-9 were sequestered by the government after the fall of the Marcos dictatorship. However, plans are being made to [[Privatization|privatize]] IBC-13 and RPN-9 within two years to raise money. According to the 2009 report of the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG), IBC-13 is valued at PHP 3.074 billion while RPN-9 is valued at PHP 1.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100817-287204/Marcos-bucks-plan-to-sell-2-TV-networks Marcos bucks plan to sell 2 TV networks] ''Inquirer.net'' 2010-08-10. Retrieved 2010-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/08/10/10/pcgg-urges-gov%E2%80%99t-fast-track-sale-rpn-9-ibc-13 PCGG urges gov’t to fast-track sale of RPN-9, IBC-13] ''ABS-CBNnews.com.'' 2010-08-10. Retrieved 2010-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Printing Office===
[[File:National Printing Office (NPO).svg|right|120px]]
The National Printing Office (NPO) was established by Executive Order.&lt;ref&gt;No. 285 on July 25, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  Executive Order 285 abolished the General Services Administration and transferred its functions to other agencies. Its Government Printing Offices were merged with the printing units of the PIA. The NPO is mandated by Executive Order 285 to print [[form (document)|forms]], official [[ballot]]s, public documents, and public information materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://npo.gov.ph/about-us/mandate/|title=Mandate {{!}} National Printing Office|website=npo.gov.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News and Information Bureau===
The News and Information Bureau's main aim is to provide services relating to the development and formulation of a domestic and foreign information program for the Government in general, and the Presidency in particular, including the development of strategies for the dissemination of information on specific government programs. It is composed of the following divisions:
*Finance and Administrative Division
*Presidential Press Staff
*Media Accreditation and Relations Division/International Press Center
* Philippines News Agency

===OP Web Development Office===
The OP Web Development Office, commonly referred to as the President's New Media Team, is responsible for the establishment and management of the President's Official Website and Official Presence on social networking channels such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]]. It is also partly responsible for the feedback mechanism of the President wherein it receives the comments, concerns and suggestions through the Contact Us section of the President's website. It is also responsible for the President's Social Media engagement and in maximizing the use of new technologies to further the President's agenda, policies and programs.

===Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office===
[[File:PCDSPO.jpg|right|110px]]
The Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office (PCDSPO) ensures that all aspects of communications are covered, to ensure that the administration’s message has been delivered successfully. This includes market research and polling. It devises the communications strategy to promote the President’s agenda throughout all media, and among the many people with whom the administration interacts. This can include, but is not limited to, the State of the Nation address, televised press conferences, statements to the press, and radio addresses. This office also works closely with cabinet-level departments and other executive agencies, in order to create a coherent strategy through which the president’s message can be disseminated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ph/2010/08/09/briefing-on-presidential-communications-reforms/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the administration of former president [[Benigno Aquino III]], the PCDSPO head held a cabinet rank. The head was supported by a deputy of undersecretary rank, a chief of staff, an assistant secretary for messaging, and an electronic data processing division chief.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ph/2010/07/30/executive-order-no-4/&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Rodrigo Duterte]] became the President in 2016, the PCDSPO was merged with the PCOO, thus effectively abolishing the PCDSPO. The PCOO was renamed as the Presidential Communications Office before it was reverted to Presidential Communications Operations Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/06/16/1593534/martin-andanar-eyes-renaming-pcoo  Martin Andanar eyes renaming PCOO], Patricia Lourdes Viray, [[The Philippine Star]], June 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to June 30, 2016, the PCDSPO was composed of the following units and agencies, all of which were under the PCOO:
* Presidential Message Staff
* The OP Correspondence Office (previously placed under the Office of the Communications Director from the Presidential Management Staff per E.O. No. 348, 11 August 2004)
* Media Research and Development Staff&lt;ref&gt;created by E.O. No. 297, 25 July 1987, from the Office of the Press Secretary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
The PCOO has been criticized for various errors and lapses committed by the office,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/opinion/2017/06/02/seares-calling-out-state-medias-mistakes-545378|title=Seares: Calling out state media’s mistakes|last=Seares|first=Atty.

== History ==
Prince Warehouse Club Incorporated started in April 1990 with Robert L. Go as its chairman. Their first branch is at North Reclamation Area (today's Prince Wholesale Center NRA) when they converted a plain warehouse into a store with a single cash register. Initially they sold glassware, kitchenware, plastic ware and other household items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://metrocebu.com.ph/2014/07/prince-hypermart-all-set-for-9th-sari-sari-store-festival/|title=Prince Hypermart All Set For 9th Sari-Sari Store Festival|newspaper=MetroCebu News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It expanded in 1993 with their second branch in A.C. Cortes, Mandaue City as Prince Hypermart Mandaue. Currently, Prince Hypermart Mandaue is managed by Prince Mandaue Chain of Stores (Prince Warehouse Club Mandaue Inc.) and separated from the Prince Warehouse Club Inc.
Robert's brother is Prince Mandaue's managing supervisor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.princeretail.com/about-us/|title=About Us - Prince Retail|newspaper=Prince Retail|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emis.com/php/company-profile/PH/Prince_Warehouse_Club_Mandaue_Inc_en_2341505.html|title=Prince Warehouse Club Mandaue Inc Company Profile {{!}} EMIS|website=www.emis.com|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince later initiated programs to help the [[sari-sari store]] owners with their Prince Warehouse Club’s Sari-Sari Store Society (SSS). The program became a tool for Prince to help  sari-sari store owners to grow their business and can buy goods at Prince Hypermart with discounts and perks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/business/2016/07/18/prince-hypermart-holds-sari-sari-store-festival-486063|title=Prince Hypermart holds Sari-Sari Store Festival|date=2016-07-18|newspaper=Sun.Star|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/business/2015/08/16/sari-sari-connections-425046|title=‘Sari-sari’ connections|date=2015-08-16|newspaper=Sun.Star|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their operations in Cebu soon expanded to nearby towns and provinces within Visayas Region. Like their giant rival Gaisano, they expanded outside Cebu when they knew the Cebu is becoming "saturated" with a lot of their stores along the province.&lt;ref name="Cebu’s retail scene expands"/&gt;

In 2013, Prince expanded their operations in Mindanao with its first branch in [[Oroquieta|Oroquieta City]], [[Misamis Occidental]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.affordablecebu.com/load/directory/prince_warehouse_oroquieta_city_branch_124_phone_number/26-1-0-29522|title=Prince Warehouse (Hypermart) Oroquieta City Branch {{!}} Phone Number|website=www.affordablecebu.com|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/business/2015/07/28/retail-chain-open-4-stores-visayas-mindanao-year-421498|title=Retail chain to open 4 stores in Visayas, Mindanao this year|date=2015-07-28|newspaper=Sun.Star|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their operations in Mindanao soon expanded in [[Zamboanga del Norte|Zamboanga Del Norte]], [[Agusan del Sur|Agusan Del Sur]], [[Agusan del Norte|Agusan Del Norte]], [[Surigao del Sur|Surigao Del Sur]], [[Surigao del Norte|Surigao Del Norte]] and [[Misamis Occidental]].

==Biography==
Rezart Taci was born and raised in Tirana, Albania.  In 1998, he began a career in the trading industry of finished oil products where he worked to establish his name. Mr. Taci has established a portfolio of companies in Energy and Media.{{citation needed|reason=recognized by who?|date=November 2014}} In 2003 Taci established Taçi Oil International Trading and Supply Company Sh.A (Taci Oil). At its inception the company had only six employees and leased storage facilities in Shengjin-Lezhe, a port on the northern coast of Albania.  Later, Taci Oil acquired this facility and expanded operations with additional tankers and added facilities in Porto-Durrës.  The combined storage for the two facilities is over 80,000 cubic meters and expanding. In 2004,  Taci established Anika Enterprises S.A. (ANIKA), a Switzerland-based company acting as the trading arm of Taci Oil, to support his operations and expand his international partnerships.  In 2006, Taci established KUID Sh.p.k (KUID) in order to expand into the retail sector of refined products.  The company began by operating 29 petrol stations. By 2009 the network of petrol stations had expanded to 84.  As of 2012 there were over 300 Taci Oil petrol stations and 1400 employees. In 2008, Taci participated in the international tender for the privatization of Albanian Refining and Marketing of Oil Sh.A (ARMO). Taci was awarded the tender and acquired 85% of the shares of ARMO.  In 2013 Taçi Oil sold 80% of the assets of ARMO, the oil refining business to [[Heaney Assets Corporation]], an Azerbaijan corporation.&lt;ref name="Qoraj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=28332&amp;kat=87|title=Azerët, nga sot pronarë të ARMO-s, firmoset marrëveshja|publisher=Shekulli|date=7/8/13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313150123/http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=28332&amp;kat=87|archivedate=2014-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Topchannel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top-channel.tv/english/artikull.php?id=9724|title=ARMO changes owners|publisher=Top Channel|date=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A close friend of [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Fionnan|last1=Sheahan|first2=Lyndsey|last2=Telford|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/taoiseach-in-shock-as-junior-minister-shane-mcentee-dies-suddenly-3333654.html|title=Taoiseach in shock as Junior Minister Shane McEntee dies suddenly|date=21 December 2012|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; McEntee's election candidacy began in 2004 when he was selected as the Fine Gael candidate in the [[Meath by-election, 2005|Meath by-election]], which was triggered by the resignation from [[Dáil Éireann]] of Fine Gael's former leader, [[John Bruton]]. Polling was on 11 March 2005, and McEntee narrowly beat the [[Fianna Fáil]] candidate [[Shane Cassells]], and was elected to the [[29th Dáil]].

McEntee was re-elected at the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007]] and [[Irish general election, 2011|2011]] general elections.&lt;ref name=elecs_irl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=6731|title=Shane McEntee|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the Fine Gael deputy spokesperson on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with special responsibility for Food and Fisheries from 2007 to 2011. On 10 March 2011, he was appointed as the [[Minister of State for Food, Horticulture and Food Safety]].

McEntee was also a successful campaigner on behalf of families in counties Dublin, Meath and Kildare whose homes had been damaged by [[pyrite]] in stone used in the foundations.

During the 2010 Fine Gael leadership heave McEntee gave an impassioned speech in defence of party leader Enda Kenny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Fionnan|last1=Sheahan|first2=Fiach|last2=Kelly|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/a-rousing-speech-that-helped-to-save-kennys-leadership-3334028.html|title=A rousing speech that helped to save Kenny's leadership|date=22 December 2012|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1991">'''Shlomo Zabludowicz''' ({{lang-he|שלמה זבלודוביץ'}}; 1914&amp;ndash;1994) was a Polish-born Israeli businessman. He gained wealth through the armament trade between the Finnish weapons manufacturer [[Tampella]] and Israel.&lt;ref name="HS"&gt;{{cite news |last=Miettinen |first=Anssi |date=September 2011 |title=Isänsä poika |url= |newspaper=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] Kuukausiliite |pages=25–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zabludowicz was born in a Jewish family in [[Łódź]], Poland. His father was  a rabbi. Zabludowicz and his family was interned at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], where only he and his wife Pola survived. After the war, he immigrated to Finland via Sweden.&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt; In Finland, he had two children, business magnate [[Poju Zabludowicz]] and ophthalmologist [[Rebecka Belldegrun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Coren |first=Ora |date=12 October 2004 |title=Soltam heirs near end of feud over father's $200-300m fortune  |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/soltam-heirs-near-end-of-feud-over-father-s-200-300m-fortune-1.137164 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, he immigrated to Israel.&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt;

Zabludowicz founded the investment firm [[Tamares]] that is currently owned by his son Poju. Zabludowicz was a prominent figure in creating the joint enterprise between Tampella and [[Solel Boneh]], [[Soltam Systems]]. In the 1980s, he distanced himself from the arms industry and began moving his investments to property.&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt;

'''TAP Air Portugal''' is the [[flag carrier]] [[airline]] of [[Portugal]], headquartered at [[Lisbon Airport]] which also serves as its [[airline hub|hub]]. TAP – Transportes Aéreos Portugueses – is a member of the [[Star Alliance]] since 2005 and operates on average 2,500 flights a week to 87 destinations in 34 countries worldwide. The company has a fleet of 90 airplanes, 68 of which were manufactured by [[Airbus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.planespotters.net/airline/TAP-Air-Portugal|title=TAP – Air Portugal Fleet Details and History|website=www.planespotters.net|language=en|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the remaining 22 by [[Embraer]] and [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]], operating on behalf of the regional airline [[TAP Express]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.planespotters.net/airline/TAP-Express|title=TAP Express Fleet Details and History|website=www.planespotters.net|language=en|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015 the company was semi-privatised and became majority-owned by the Atlantic Gateway Consortium, led by [[David Neeleman]], who founded [[JetBlue]] and [[Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras|Azul]] and co-founded [[WestJet Airlines Ltd.|WestJet Airlines]], together with Portuguese entrepreneur Humberto Pedrosa. The Atlantic Gateway Consortium purchased 61% of the carrier from the government of Portugal on 24 June 2015, with an option to buy the Portuguese government's remaining 34 percent stake in 2018. This deal has been surrounded in controversy because it was completed at the end of the center-right government's mandate with wide opposition from TAP employees. On October 2015, a new left-wing government has sought to return majority control of the airline to the state, having signed in February 2016 a deal with the private consortium, which indicates that the company is 50% owned by the Portuguese state, 45% by the Atlantic Gateway Consortium and 5% available shareholder to collaborators and employees of TAP Air Portugal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://centreforaviation.com/analysis/tap-portugal-ownership-changes-almost-complete-while-azul-relationship-starts-to-bear-fruit-277331|title=TAP Portugal: ownership changes almost complete, while Azul relationship starts to bear fruit|website=CentreForAviation.com|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Early postwar operations===
[[File:Douglas C-54A CS-TSA TAP LAP 06.54 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Douglas DC-4]] of TAP arriving at [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow Airport]] from Lisbon in 1954]]The airline, founded on 14 March 1945 as ''Transportes Aéreos Portugueses'' (''Portuguese Air Transportations''), began commercial services on 19 September 1946, with a flight from [[Lisbon]] to [[Madrid]] using a [[Douglas DC-3]]. On 31 December, TAP Air Portugal began its ''Linha Aérea Imperial'', a twelve-stop colonial service including [[Luanda]], [[Angola]] and [[Lourenço Marques]] (now [[Maputo]]), [[Mozambique]]. It covered 24.450&amp;nbsp;km within 15 days (both ways), making it the longest air service operated with twin-engine airliners.

In 1947 domestic services commenced from Lisbon to [[Porto]] as well as from [[São Tomé]] to [[London]]. Four [[Douglas DC-4]] Skymasters were purchased in this year, remaining in service until 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lumotransport.eu/air-transport/documentos/invent%C3%A1rios/1464-tap-fleet-douglas-dc-4-c-54a-skymaster-pax.html|title=LUMO Transport – TAP Fleet – Douglas DC-4 (C-54A Skymaster) Pax|last=Moreira|first=Luis|website=www.lumotransport.eu|language=pt-pt|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were used on the routes to Africa and to major European destinations including London.

The airline was privatised for the first time in 1953, changing from a public service to a public limited company ([[Public limited company|plc]]) and began in the same year services to [[Tangier]] and [[Casablanca]].

[[Lockheed Constellation|Lockheed Super Constellation]] four-engined pressurised airliners, acquired in late 1955, were immediately introduced on the TAP African scheduled services to Luanda and Lourenço Marques.&lt;ref&gt;Marson, 1982, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; That same year [[Carlos Viegas Gago Coutinho|Admiral Gago Coutinho]] made a test flight to Rio de Janeiro.

===The jet era – mid-1960s onwards===
[[File:Sud SE.210 VIR CS-TCA TAP LAP 13.03.66 edited-4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] VI-R of TAP at [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow Airport]] in 1966]]
Beginning in 1960, TAP Air Portugal launched Rio de Janeiro as its first destination in Brazil, in a jointly-operated air service named "[[Voo da amizade|Voo da Amizade]]" ("Friendship Flight") with [[Panair do Brasil]] (1960-1965) and [[Varig]] (1965–1967). A route from Lisbon to [[Goa]], a 19-hour flight with five stopovers, was added to the network in the beginning of the 1960s.

TAP entered the jet era in July 1962, when three [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] twin-jet airliners were acquired and operated on the airline's most competitive European routes.&lt;ref&gt;Chillon, 1980, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Lisbon - Rossio at Night (2678755642).jpg|thumb|left|[[Rossio Square]], [[Lisbon]], in June 1968, showing a TAP commercial in the background at night]]
[[File:TAP Air Portugal Boeing 747-200 Aragao.jpg|thumb|right|TAP [[Boeing 747-200B]] in 1985]]
The one-millionth passenger flew on TAP on 19 June 1964, 18 years after the airline began operations. In 1966 TAP operated its first sole flight to Brazil, when a company Boeing 707 landed at Galeão Airport in Rio de Janeiro, on 17 June at 17:32 GMT. Precisely at the same time and on the same day as the hydroplane ''Santa Cruz'' moored in Guanabara Bay in 1922, when [[Artur de Sacadura Cabral|Sacadura Cabral]] and [[Carlos Viegas Gago Coutinho|Gago Coutinho]] made their historic South Atlantic crossing. The route to Brazil was inaugurated.

In 1967, the airline achieved a milestone: it became the first European airline to fly exclusively with jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://upmagazine-tap.com/en/pt_artigos/tap-portugal-in-the-air/#|title= TAP – Portugal in the air|website=upmagazine-tap.com|language=English|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, service to [[New York City]] via [[Santa Maria Island]] began.  [[Boston]] was added to the New York service in 1970.

The first of four Boeing 747-200s was received in 1972.

TAP began 1974 with 32 aircraft operating to more than 40 destinations on four continents, it began offering computerised reservations, load control and check-in (known as Tapmatic), and became the first European airline to carry out major comprehensive overhauls of Boeing 747 engines. By the end of 1974, TAP had carried more than 1.5 million passengers, flown 68,210 hours over a network of almost 103,000 kilometres and had a staff of over 9,000. Following the [[Carnation Revolution|25 April 1974 revolution]], Portugal was caught up in the wave of nationalisations during the following year and TAP was no exception, thus becoming a state-owned corporation in 1975.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

After the independence of Angola and Mozambique, the important African market decreased tremendously and two Boeing 747s were sold in 1976.

=== Fleet modernisation and expansion ===
[[File:TAP Air Portugal L-1011-500 CS-TEF LIS 1988-6-30.png|thumb|A TAP Air Portugal L-1011-500 at [[Lisbon Portela Airport]] in 1988]]
During the 1980s, the fleet of [[Boeing 707]]s and 747s was replaced with [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]]s and [[Airbus A310]]s on long-haul routes. In 1985 TAP established its charter subsidiary [[Air Atlantis]], providing leisure flights to most European cities, which operated Boeing 707, [[Boeing 727]] and [[Boeing 737]] jets. By the late 1990s, TAP had expanded its fleet by selling its older Boeing 727s and Boeing 737s, and had replaced them with [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A319|A319]], [[A320]] and [[A321]] aircraft.  The TriStars were sold to [[Air Luxor]] and were replaced by [[Airbus A340]]s, giving TAP an Airbus-only fleet.

In 1989, TAP became a publicly traded company (''Sociedade Anónima'') and their New York service moved to [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK]] and in 1991 introduce the service to Berlin. In 1993, TAP began flying to [[Tel Aviv]]. In 1994, TAP signed for a [[code sharing]] arrangement with [[Delta Air Lines]] for North Atlantic service. This agreement ended in 2005.

1996 saw the introduction of service to Boston via [[Terceira Island]], the inauguration of service to [[Macau]] and the launch of TAP's [[website]]. In 1997, service began to [[Punta Cana]] and [[Bangkok]]. Flights to Bangkok and Macau were discontinued in 1998.

A strategic alliance was formed with [[Swissair]] in 1997. Within the scope of this agreement, a team of professional managers arrive at TAP, led by the Brazilian [[:pt:Fernando Pinto]]. Part of the agreement would lead to Swissair buying a 34% stake of TAP. Also, TAP became a member of [[Qualiflyer]], the frequent-flyer program led by the Swiss flag carrier. Due to financial difficulties, the Swiss company ends up not buying the agreed shares of TAP Air Portugal, unilaterally revoking the partnership agreement which led to unexpected costs for the Portuguese airline in 2000, with the culmination of a legal action taken against Swissair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/tap-sues-bankrupt-swissair/11064|title=TAP sues bankrupt Swissair|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 60th anniversary and Star Alliance membership ===
[[File:CS-TPC PGA Portugália Airlines (3869398765).jpg|left|thumb|Former Fokker 100 of TAP Air Portugal subsidiary [[Portugália Airlines]]]]
TAP became a member of Star Alliance on 14 March 2005, the same day on which the company celebrated its 60th anniversary. TAP Air Portugal was re-branded as TAP Portugal in February 2005. TAP also ended its code-sharing agreement with [[Delta Air Lines]] and began a new agreement with [[United Airlines|United]], as part of its membership in the [[Star Alliance]].  Under this agreement United's code (UA) is placed on TAP Air Portugal's transatlantic flights and some African flights, and TAP Air Portugal's code (TP) is placed on United flights.

In 2006, TAP Air Portugal signed a deal with [[Banco Espírito Santo|Espírito Santo International]] for the acquisition of 99.81% of the Portuguese regional airline [[Portugália Airlines|Portugália]]. Furthermore, it started a code-sharing agreement with [[US Airways]] on all routes between Portugal and the United States with connecting services out of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].

In 2007 TAP Air Portugal was awarded by [[NATO]] as the Best Engine/Aircraft Source of Repair for the NATO AWACS Maintenance Program. TAP Air Portugal has complete maintenance and overhaul bases in Portugal (Lisbon) and Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre), and has specialised line maintenance stations in three continents: 4 in Portugal, 8 in Brazil, and 1 in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tapme.pt/|title=TAP Maintenance &amp; Engineering|publisher=MRO Solutions|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started scheduled flights to Moscow, [[Warsaw]] and [[Helsinki]], in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easier.com/view/Travel/Flights/TAP/article-220792.html Easier Travel: TAP flies to Warsaw, Moscow &amp; Helsinki] retrieved 8 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After deciding to outsource its [[Passenger Service System]] in 2008, TAP migrated its reservation and inventory systems to the Altéa system managed by [[Amadeus IT Group|Amadeus]]. Prior to the migration to Altéa TAP was using a system derived from Delta Air Lines called Tapmatic, in use since 1972.

===Development since 2010===
[[File:CS-TNS A320 TAP tails (5286414010).jpg|thumb|TAP Air Portugal tail-fins]]
In 2010 TAP introduced two new routes to Africa: [[Marrakesh]] and [[Algiers]], the latter discontinued in 2017. The launch of these new routes highlighted the carrier airline reinforcement of its growth strategy for Africa, which is an important segment in the network where the airline has continually expanded since 2001, going from 236,000 to 541,000 passengers, an increase of more than 129%.

Miami and Porto Alegre were the latest long range routes introduced in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.opodo.co.uk/NewsDetails/2011-01-12/TAP_Portugal_to_fly_to_Porto_Alegre__Brazil|title=TAP Portugal to fly to Porto Alegre, Brazil|website=news.opodo.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenextmiami.com/tap-portugal-up-to-80-of-traffic-originates-at-mia-on-new-miami-lisbon-route/|title=TAP Portugal: up to 80% of traffic originates at MIA on new Miami-Lisbon route|date=2012-02-13|work=The Next Miami|access-date=2017-06-16|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Privatisation ====

In order to obtain its three-year national bailout, Portugal was forced to sell its interests in several companies, including the state-run airline.&lt;ref name="PTDailyView"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portugaldailyview.com/whats-new/privatization-sole-bidder-for-tap-portugal|title=Privatisations: Sole Bidder for TAP-Air Portugal|last=Peláez|first=Marina Watson|date=19 October 2012|location=Lisbon, Portugal|access-date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several international operators were drawn by the airline's strategic position, but on 18 October 2012, the [[Portuguese government]] announced a sole potential bidder for the privatized national carrier: the South American consortium [[Synergy Group|Synergy Aerospace]], owner of Colombian airline [[Avianca]].&lt;ref name="PTDailyView" /&gt; Portuguese financial daily ''Dinheiro Vivo'' indicated that the government would suspend privatization negotiations, if German Efromovich's Synergy Aerospace bid was not approved.&lt;ref name="PTDailyView" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pratas|first=José Carlos|title=Basílio Horta: Processo de privatização da TAP "é um escândalo nacional"|trans-title=|date=19 October 2012|url=http://www.dinheirovivo.pt/Economia/Artigo/CIECO065700.html|location=Lisbon, Portugal|publisher=Dinheiro Vivo|language=Portuguese|access-date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 2014 the airline announced that it would buy two [[ATR 42|ATR 42-600]]s for its subsidiary company, [[Portugália Airlines|Portugália]], replacing the smaller [[Beechcraft 1900|Beechcraft 1900D]] previously operated by [[PGA Express]].&lt;ref name="presstur.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstur.com/site/news.asp?news=46558|title=Agência de notícias de viagens e turismo|trans-title=|website=www.Presstur.com|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tapportugal.com/PressRelease/pt/oviedo-e-o-11-novo-destino-da-tap-em-2014|title=TAP|first=TAP|last=Portugal|website=TAPPortugal.com|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese government planned to sell its controlling stake in the [[flag carrier]] to one or more large investors in a relaunch of the privatisation in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/13/portugal-tap-idUSL6N0T351V20141113|title=Portugal to sell up to 66 pct of airline TAP in relaunched privatisation|date=13 November 2014|work=Reuters|access-date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It intended to sell a 66% stake in the airline, with 5% of that set aside for its 7,500 staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenfieldreporter.com/view/story/44a2ed0818d647a290e289ef97bb4f60/EU--Portugal-Airline-Privatization&lt;/ref&gt; Among known bidders were South American businessman [[German Efromovich]], whose 2012 bid for TAP failed to meet the initial conditions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-13/portugal-makes-fresh-attempt-to-find-buyer-for-flag-carrier-tap.html|title=Portugal Makes Fresh Attempt to Find Buyer for Flag Carrier TAP|date=13 November 2014|work=Bloomberg.com|author=Anabela Reis|access-date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a consortium formed by American businessman [[Frank Lorenzo]] and Portuguese entrepreneur [[Miguel Pais do Amaral]]; the American Brazilian businessman [[David Neeleman]], founder of [[JetBlue]] in the United States and [[Azul Brazilian Airlines|Azul]] in Brazil and finally Globalia, the parent company of [[Air Europa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/business/world/a/25510400/portugal-puts-66-stake-in-tap-airline-up-for-sale/|title=The West Australian|website=The West|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, an over-week-long pilot strike led to the cancellation of around 3,000 TAP Air Portugal flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/10-day-strike-portuguese-airline-pilots-grounds-flights-30723658|title=International News:  Latest Headlines, Video and Photographs from Around the World – People, Places, Crisis, Conflict, Culture, Change, Analysis and Trends|first=ABC|last=News|website=|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the Portuguese government decided to sell the TAP Air Portugal Group, owner of the national air carrier, TAP Air Portugal, to the Atlantic Gateway consortium formed by the partnership between [[David Neeleman]] and Humberto Pedrosa, who took control of 61% of the capital of the Portuguese flag carrier. On the memorandum signed by the new owner, TAP Air Portugal has to maintain the country as the airline’s main hub for a minimum of 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-azul-airlines-founder-wins-bid-to-buy-portuguese-carrier-tap-1434032281|title=Brazil’s Azul Airlines Founder Wins Bid to Buy Portuguese Carrier TAP|date=11 June 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|last1=Magalhaes|first1=Luciana|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consortium that won the company's privatization in June 2015 has promised to buy 53 new Airbus aircraft for TAP. It was announced new orders would include 14 wide-body A330s and 39 narrow-body A320 Family aircraft.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/portugal-airlines-tap/tap-new-owners-see-profits-from-2016-to-invest-up-to-800-mln-euros-idUSL8N0ZA3MT20150624|title=TAP new owners see profits from 2016, to invest up to 800 mln euros|date=24 June 2015|publisher=|access-date=2 January 2018|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2015, a new left-wing government has sought to return majority control of the airline to the state, having signed in February 2016 a deal with the private consortium, which indicates that the company is 50% owned by the Portuguese state, 45% by the Atlantic Gateway Consortium and 5% available shareholder to collaborators and employees of TAP.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== After privatisation ====
On 14 January 2016, TAP Air Portugal announced that the subsidiary [[Portugália Airlines]] would be rebranded [[TAP Express]] by 27 March 2016, as part of further restructuring measures within the group.&lt;ref name="rebranding" /&gt; On the same day, the Portuguese carrier also announced that the entire Portugália fleet would be replaced with new aircraft by July 2016, which would receive a livery similar to that of TAP Air Portugal.&lt;ref name="rebranding"&gt;[http://atwonline.com/finance-data/tap-portugal-creates-tap-express-replace-portugalia atwonline.com TAP Portugal creates TAP Express to replace Portugalia] 15 Januar 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A downsize in the carrier network also took place in January, with TAP announcing the ceasing of long-haul flights to [[Panama City]], [[Manaus]] and [[Bogota]] as well as the European connections to [[Hanover]] and [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.air-journal.fr/2016-01-15-portugal-tap-express-remplace-portugalia-5156568.html air-journal.fr Portugal : TAP Express remplace Portugalia] (French) 14 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

TAP Air Portugal plans to promote Portugal, in the United States, as a vibrant and exciting tourism destination, and Lisbon as a prime gateway into Europe for North American travellers, and thus, on February 2016, the airline announced the return of [[JFK airport|New York’s John F. Kennedy International]] and [[Boston Logan International Airport|Boston’s Logan International]] as daily non-stop services from Lisbon. The Boston service started on June 11 and the new JFK daily flights commenced on July 1, both being operated with new [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-200]] delivered in June of the same year from [[Azul Brazilian Airlines]]. These two new routes reinforce the presence in the American market, with TAP also serving [[Miami International Airport|Miami]] from Lisbon and [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]] from Lisbon and Porto. Altogether, TAP Air Portugal service grew to 30 flights per week to the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tapportugal.com/PressRelease/en/tap-portugal-to-introduce-daily-non-stops-to-lisbon-on-new-a330-aircraft-from-new-yorks-jfk-and-boston-logan-airports#sthash.z2p0MZuk.dpuf TAP Portugal to introduce daily non-stops to Lisbon on new A330 aircraft from New York’s JFK and Boston Logan Airports] (English) 25 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

TAP expanded its network in 2017, adding 10 routes, some which were previously operated by the airline: [[Abidjan]] (Ivory Coast), [[Alicante]] and [[Las Palmas]] (Spain), [[Bucharest]] (Romania), [[Budapest]] (Hungary), [[Cologne]] and [[Stuttgart]] (Germany), [[Fes]] (Morocco), [[Lomé]] (Togo), [[London City Airport]] (England) and [[Toronto]] (Canada).

In March 2017, [[Miguel Frasquilho|Miguel Antunes Frasquilho]], president and CEO of [[AICEP Portugal Global]], was selected to be TAP Air Portugal's new chairman of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/economia/2017-03-01-Miguel-Frasquilho-troca-presidencia-da-AICEP-pela-TAP|title=Miguel Frasquilho troca presidência da AICEP pela TAP|trans-title=|website=Sapo.pt|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observador.pt/2017/03/01/miguel-frasquilho-vai-ser-chairman-da-tap/|title=Miguel Frasquilho vai ser “chairman” da TAP|first=Rita|last=Cipriano|website=Observador|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 2017, TAP Portugal was renamed ''TAP Air Portugal'', going back to the name used between 1979 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portuguese-american-journal.com/travel-tap-portugal-return-original-brand-name-portugal/|title=Travel: TAP Portugal to return to original brand name |website=portuguese-american-journal.com|access-date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Logo and livery ====
In 2005 TAP unveiled its current logo and livery, to coincide with its Star Alliance membership, during the airline's 60th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/awin/tap-portugal-unveiled-new-livery|title=TAP Portugal unveiled a new livery|website=aviationweek.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also saw the name change from TAP Air Portugal, introduced in the 1970s, to TAP Portugal. On 14 September 2017, TAP returned to its previous name 

The first logo dates back to 1945, when the airline was founded. It consisted of a blue wing with the acronym TAP written to its left.

=== Museum ===
The TAP museum unit was created in 1978, but it only opened officially on 14 March 1985 as part of the company's 40th anniversary celebrations. Its venue was at the company’s head office on the grounds of Lisbon airport. Due to space limitations, on 29 January 2010, the new premises of the [[Museu do Ar]] (Air Museum), in the municipality of [[Sintra]], opened to the public. This extensive museum is the result of a three-way partnership between airport operator Ana-Aeroportos, the Portuguese Air Force and TAP. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tapportugal.com/Info/en/fleet-history/museum|title=Museum|first=TAP|last=Portugal|website=http://www.FlyTAP.com|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection on display recounts the history of military and civil aviation in Portugal. Visitors are able to see 40 aircraft, including a TAP Douglas DC-3, simulators, engines and other exhibits. A panel of photographs in the main hangar tells the story of 100 years of aviation in Portugal.

TAP Air Portugal is the leading European airline flying to Brazil, offering more destinations from its hub in Lisbon than any other European airline. Many Europeans transit through Portugal to fly to Brazil due to the large number of slots TAP holds on the South American country.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The airline is currently{{When|date=January 2018}} looking to expand its service to Brazil even further, as well as adding new destinations in the United States, in which it currently serves four airports: Boston, Miami, Newark and New-York JFK.

In January 2016, TAP Air Portugal also announced the order of two more Airbus A330-200 to add to its wide-body family. TAP Air Portugal will be the first airline to fly the [[Airbus A330neo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/business-newswires/3176555-tap-portugal-named-as-launch-operator-for-airbus-a330neo/|title=Euronews,  TAP Portugal named as launch operator for Airbus A330neo, 06.04.2016|website=Euronews.com|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latest version of the plane maker's current generation of wide-body jets. The aircraft, a revamped and more fuel-efficient version of the A330 with new [[Rolls-Royce Trent 7000]] engines, was due to enter service in late 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/tap-portugal-to-be-first-operator-of-a330neo-423917/|title=TAP Portugal to be first operator of A330neo|date=6 April 2016|website=FlightGlobal.com|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delays in the development of the aircraft's engine will push the entry in service to the 3Q 2018. TAP ordered 20 of the jets, of which some are leased, as part of a wider fleet reorganisation in 2017. They also estimate to have 133 aircraft in the fleet by 2025 including TAP Express.&lt;ref&gt;[https://leitor.expresso.pt/semanario/semanario2393/html/economia/capa/antonoaldo-neves-tap-vai-ter-15-novos-avioes-e-15-novas-rotas-em-2019]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[TAP Express]]=== 
[[File:CS-DJD (LEBB, 2016-11-01).jpg|thumb|TAP Express [[ATR 72-600]] operated by [[White Airways]]]]
TAP Air Portugal announced in January 2016 the creation of the new brand [[TAP Express]] to replace [[Portugália Airlines]].  The acquisition of 8 new ATR 72-600 (to be operated by [[White Airways]] crew) and 9 Embraer 190 (to be operated by Portugália crew) replaced the aging Fokker 100 and Embraer 145.  A further four Embraer 195 were added to the fleet.

===Fleet development===
Before its current fleet, TAP Air Portugal had operated the following aircraft types:

==Services==

===Lounges===
TAP Air Portugal offers two different [[Airport lounge|lounge]]s at [[Lisbon Airport]], the '''TAP Premium Lounge''', available for Victoria Gold Winners, Star Alliance Gold members and passengers flying on [[business class]] on [[Star Alliance]] flights, while Victoria Silver Winners only have access to the '''Blue Lounge''', contracted with the [[handling]] [[subsidiary]] [[Groundforce Portugal|Groundforce]].

===Cabins===
[[File:TAP Portugal A330neo interior ITB 2017.JPG|thumb|TAP Air Portugal [[A330neo]] interior mock-up]]
The aircraft are divided into a two-class cabin: [[business class]] (branded as tap|executive) and [[economy class|economy]] classes (tap|plus, tap|classic, tap|basic and tap|discount). TAP Air Portugal does not offer first class services. On the medium-haul fleet of [[Airbus A319]], [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] and [[Airbus A321]] aircraft, both cabins have been retrofitted with new leather seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flytap.com/en-pt/tap-experience/retrofit|title=Fleet retrofit|website=www.FlyTAP.com|language=en|access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executive class offers better privacy than economy class, and more meal options. On the [[long-haul]] fleet of [[Airbus A330]] and [[Airbus A340]] aircraft, the cabin is divided into a two-class layout. The economy class of the new Airbus A330's and Airbus A340's is equipped with modern individual [[LCD]]s with touchscreen and a complete [[In-flight entertainment|IFE]], while the older Airbus A330's feature an average IFE and older individual screens. The entire fleet of [[Airbus A340]] economy class was refurbished during 2013, adding a new seat design and a new [[in-flight entertainment]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lisbonjet.blogspot.pt/2012/03/tap-a340-new-economy-class-seats.html|title=LisbonJet's Logbook|author=LisbonJet|publisher=|access-date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In business class, seats are capable of turning into lie-flat beds. New Airbus A330 aircraft are also fitted with extra functions.

TAP's in-flight magazine is named ''UP'' and is available on board, as a fully responsive website (compatible with desktops, smart phones and tablets), and as a freely downloadable application for Apple's [[iPad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipadinflightmagazines.blogspot.com|title=iPad In-Flight Magazines|publisher=|access-date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Airspace by Airbus ====
The Portuguese airline will also be the first to take a new cabin layout called “Airspace”. The design allows airlines to add more seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airlinesanddestinations.com/airlines/tap-portugal-to-be-first-a330neo-operator-and-to-launch-airspace-cabin/|title=TAP Portugal to Be First A330neo Operator and to Launch Airspace Cabin|website=AirlinesAndDestinations.com|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequent-flyer program===
TAP Air Portugal current [[loyalty program]] is '''Victoria''', which awards members miles based on the distance travelled, ticket fare and class of service.
As part of Star Alliance, miles can be earned as well from [[Star Alliance]] and other eligible partners. Membership in the Victoria programme is free.
Award Miles are redeemable for free tickets, upgrades to a higher class of service, extra baggage allowance, and lounge access. Award Miles can furthermore be donated to charity.
The Victoria Programme is divided into 3 tiers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tapvictoria.com/en/TheProgramme/MembershipLevels/|title=TAP Portugal|work=www.FlyTAP.com|access-date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Victoria Miles Winner, the basic tier, with no mileage requirements.
* Victoria Silver Winner, ([[Star Alliance]] Silver), with a requirement of 30,000 Status Miles or 25 segments flown within one year.
* Victoria Gold Winner, ([[Star Alliance]] Gold), with a requirement of 70,000 Status Miles or 50 segments flown within one year.

==Accidents and incidents==
According to the JACDEC Airliner Safety Report released in January 2011, TAP Air Portugal was rated Western Europe's safest airline and tied for fourth worldwide with three other airlines ([[Qantas]], [[Air New Zealand]], and [[Finnair]]). The JADEC report rates TAP Air Portugal well above any of its competitors in its prime geographic operating areas: Europe, Atlantic Islands, Africa, North America and South America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.pt.msn.com/Internacional/article.aspx?cp-documentid=155855253 TAP é a quarta companhia aérea mais segura do mundo - relatório JACDEC] MSN Notícias (Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[TAP Air Portugal Flight 425]]: the crash of Flight 425 at [[Madeira Airport]] on 19 November 1977 remains TAP Air Portugal's only fatal accident. Flight 425 was flying to Madeira Airport from [[Brussels]] via [[Lisbon]]. The [[Boeing 727]] crashed while landing on runway 24 in heavy rain. Before the crash, the pilot had made two unsuccessful attempts to land, and had decided to make one more attempt. The plane touched down too late and overran the runway which was, at the time, only {{convert|1600|m}} long. The plane crashed onto a beach at the end of the runway, splitting into two pieces and bursting into flames. Of the 164 people aboard, 131 were killed and 33 survived. It is the second-deadliest aeroplane accident in Portugal (after [[Independent Air Flight 1851]]). The crash prompted officials to explore ways of extending the short runway on Madeira. Because of the height of the runway relative to the beach below, an extension was very difficult and too expensive to perform. A {{convert|200|m|0|abbr=on}} extension was built between 1983 and 1986. In 2000 the runway was extended to {{convert|2781|m|0|abbr=on}} long and was capable of handling wide-body commercial jets such as the [[Boeing 747]] or [[Airbus A340]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6468">'''Virtual CFO''' (or '''vCFO''' for short) stands for virtual [[chief financial officer]]. A virtual CFO is an outsourced service provider offering high skill assistance in financial requirements of an organization, just like a chief financial officer does for large organizations.&lt;ref name="IndiaTimes"&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-12-19/news/45377498_1_smes-clients-startups "Virtual CFO services gaining traction in NCR region"] in ''The Economic Times''&lt;/ref&gt; A virtual CFO may be a single person or an entity.

== Target market ==

The mushrooming of the startup ecosystem has generated specialized service providers which fit the requirement of startups. Virtual CFO is one such specialized service provider. Startups normally do not have the resources to hire a full-time CFO.&lt;ref name="TECCPV"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=747tKaSdtgkC&amp;pg=PA394&amp;dq=virtual+cfo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zRj6UuypFc2nrgeshIHgCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=virtual%20cfo&amp;f=false ''Technology Entrepreneurship: Creating, Capturing, and Protecting Value''] by Thomas N. Duening, Robert A. Hisrich, Michael A. Lechter&lt;/ref&gt; "There have been studies claiming that among the top issues faced by Indian startup CEOs are hiring financial and legal experts," according to a virtual CFO.&lt;ref name="IndiaTimes"/&gt; Startups like to keep fixed costs low and having outsourced service provider provides them the flexibility of choosing services as and when required. A Virtual CFO provides strategic, value add services to a startup which cannot be provided by an accountant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z5sLg7JGu_IC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=virtual+cfo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zRj6UuypFc2nrgeshIHgCg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=virtual%20cfo&amp;f=false ''Business Owner's Handbook: The Ultimate Small Business Book -- Focus on Management of Money and Leadership to Increase Company Value''] By Marty Koenig and Keith McAslan&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, VCFO services are typically used by small to medium-businesses with annual sales in excess of $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fintelligent.com/ Fintelligent]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Singapore, the market is mainly served by [http://supercfo.com/ SuperCFO], [https://www.cfocentre.com.sg/ CFOCentre] and [https://www.excide.co Excide]. SuperCFO and CFOCentre focus on experienced finance individuals that are parachuted into the company. On the other hand, [https://www.excide.co/ Excide] provides virtual CFO services with emphasis on their all-rounded team and technology capabilities. While there are many other accounting firms adopting the term, "[http://hirevirtualcfo.com/ Virtual CFO] ", most of them are merely bookkeeping services.

== Services offered ==

The primary role of a [[chief financial officer]] in any organization is to oversee the financial planning, maintain and report on the financial activities and manage [[financial risk]] of the business. A virtual CFO provides the same services but since the common clientele of a Virtual CFO are small businesses and startups, there are certain more services that are expected of them. Services offered by a Virtual CFO often follow the Financial pyramid of needs. In the basic level, a Virtual CFO is expected to be the bookkeeper of the client and has to take responsibility for the accuracy of the account books and interpret the financial information from the accounting data to the client. They make take responsibility for executing or overseeing the reporting process. On the more strategic side, they are the financial and strategic sparring partner from the CEO. Additionally, they are also responsible for suggesting measures to control expenditure and acquire capital at low cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffthomson/2013/02/14/signs-a-small-business-needs-a-cfo/ 'Signs a Small Business Needs a CFO'] in ''Forbes''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==

Small companies may need a controller on a weekly or fortnightly basis. Virtual CFOs also offer one-time help with strategic transactions, financial processes, business plans and budgeting.

In the USA, Virtual CFOs earn between $55 and $250 an hour,&lt;ref name="TECCPV"/&gt; as per their level of expertise. Clients are invoiced on an hourly or monthly rate depending on the nature of service. Most firms provide tailor-made services and the service charges vary from client to client&lt;ref name="IndiaTimes"/&gt; This practice is gaining ground in India, with a thriving start-up and SME culture in the country. This sector has discovered new virtual CFO companies in the last three to four years, mainly because the start-ups want to focus in their core areas, leaving the technical job to technical people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-12-19/news/45377498_1_smes-clients-startups ''The Economic Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this practice should be differentiated from finance outsourcing. Finance outsourcing is commonly understood to indicate a trans-national outsourcing process, in which financial management of companies is generally outsourced from Western countries to low-wage group countries, like India, South Africa, Brazil, etc.

== Trademark ==

virtualcfo is a registered trademark of VirtualCFO, Inc. and vcfo Holdings, Inc. in the United States and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vcfo.com/legal&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a generic term "virtual cfo" is used by many finance outsourcing firms throughout the world.

== Professional qualifications ==

There is currently no official requirement as to the qualifications that a virtual CFO should hold. However, it is generally expected for a virtual CFO to have finance related university degree, professional accountancy qualification and sufficient relevant experience.

In addition, virtual CFOs can obtain the Qualified Cloud CFO (QCCFO) professional certification provided by the International Association of Qualified Cloud Accountants (IAQCA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaqca.com/qccfo/ |title=Qualified Cloud CFO (QCCFO) certification}} - official website of the certification&lt;/ref&gt; that is specifically focused on the knowledge that financial professionals need to deliver their services within the Internet and Cloud environment.

'''Vladimir Lvovich Ashurkov''' ({{lang-rus|Владимир Львович Ашурков}}, born 15 February 1972) is a Russian political figure and the Executive Director of the [[Anti-Corruption Foundation]]. A former banker, Ashurkov was the Director of Group Portfolio Management and Control at [[Alfa Group|Alfa Group Consortium]] from 2006 to 2012, when he was asked to step down due to his political involvement with [[Alexei Navalny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-protest-fund-idUSBRE84U1EP20120531|title=Russian protest fund manager looks to elite for cash|last=|first=|date=2012-05-31|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-07-15|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also on the board of the [[X5 Retail Group]] during this time. 

In 2014, [[Investigative Committee of Russia|Russia's Investigative Committee]] charged Ashurkov with embezzlement of funds from [[Alexei Navalny mayoral campaign, 2013|Alexei Navalny's 2013 mayoral campaign]], after which he applied for political asylum in Great Britain, claiming the charges were politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/01/russian-opposition-activist-is-granted-asylum-in-uk&lt;/ref&gt; Both Ashurkov and Navalny maintain that the charges were baseless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-navalny-idUKKBN0E310620140523|title=Russia launches fraud case against backers of Putin critic Navalny|last=|first=|date=2014-05-23|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-07-15|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vladimir Kumarin''', aka '''Vladimir Barsukov''' is a [[Russia]]n businessman, former deputy president of the [[Petersburg Fuel Company]] (PTK) between 1998 and 1999, and allegedly the boss of the powerful criminal [[Tambovskaya Bratva]] (Tambov gang) of [[Saint Petersburg]]. 

Kumarin allegedly founded the Tambov syndicate in 1989 to run protection rackets, and later expanded into nightclubs and strip clubs. During the early 1990s, Kumarin was allegedly connected to current Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]],&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Roth, ''Die Gangster aus dem Osten'', Europa Verlag Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1994, as deputy mayor of Saint Petersburg, awarded the [[Petersburg Fuel Company]] (PTK) the right to be the sole supplier of gasoline to the city. 

The deal allegedly triggered a violent gang war during which there was an attempt on Kumarin's life. After being sprayed by machine gun fire he fell into a month-long coma. His right arm had to be amputated at the shoulder and bullets pierced his stomach, chest and lungs. To this day he still has bullet fragments in his heart.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6395870.ece The Times - Russia's 'Al Capone' sneers at his trial]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003, the magazine ''Der Spiegel'' mentioned that, according to the [[Germany|German]] ministry of criminal affairs, the German firm SPAG had fallen under suspicion of being involved in a money laundering scheme with connections to Kumarin. Putin was an advisor to this firm over the course of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Spiegel'', June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Kumarin maintains good relations to Russian politicians [[Mikhail Glushenko]] and [[Alexander Filatov]]. 

After Putin became president in 2000, Kumarin sought to clean up his image via donations to charities and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] of which he was a devout follower as well as securing the release of two kidnapped children.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; During this period his celebrity grew as well. He played the role of [[King Louis XIV]] in a film and dozens of celebrities and politicians attended his 50th birthday party in 2006.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Allegedly after refusing to back down from a business deal in favour of a politician close to Vladimir Putin, Kumarin was raided and arrested by 300 special forces officers on August 24, 2007.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Prosecutor General [[Yury Chaika]] accused him of banditry and organizing a gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rian.ru/defense_safety/investigations/20070827/75211130.html |title="Эрмитаж отдыхает": в Петербурге изъяли 50 антикварных предметов |access-date=2007-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830162854/http://www.rian.ru/defense_safety/investigations/20070827/75211130.html |archive-date=2007-08-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://spb.rbc.ru/freenews/20070827165115.shtml |title=Ю.Чайка: Преступная группировка под руководством арестованного в Петербурге В.Барсукова действовала около 10 лет |access-date=2007-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725123706/http://spb.rbc.ru/freenews/20070827165115.shtml |archive-date=2011-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fontanka.ru/2007/08/27/093/ Генпрокурор Чайка: «Перед Кумариным все делали «Ку»]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also accused of the murder attempt on businessman Sergei Vasiliev, a rival in the oil business. In 2006, two men with automatic rifles sprayed Vasiliev's car with gunfire, wounding him and killing one of his bodyguards.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

He was sentenced to 14 years in prison for fraud and money laundering on November 12, 2009.

'''İbrahim Bilgen''' (2 March 1949 &amp;ndash; 31 May 2010) was a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[politician]], [[electrical engineer]] and [[activist]]. He was born in [[Batman, Turkey]] and killed by the Israeli armed forces in the [[Gaza flotilla raid]].

==Early life and education==
Bilgen was born in [[Batman, Turkey|Batman]], to a family that had migrated to Turkey from [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]]. He graduated from [[Fırat University]], where he studied [[electrical engineering]], and was a member of the [[Chamber of Electrical Engineers of Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/wap.do?method=getMansetHaber&amp;haberno=990887&amp;sirano=3&amp;sayfa=|title=Zaman|language=tr|publisher=Zaman|accessdate=26 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229132736/http://www.zaman.com.tr/wap.do?method=getMansetHaber&amp;haberno=990887&amp;sirano=3&amp;sayfa=|archivedate=29 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been a resident of [[Siirt]], a south-eastern city of Turkey, since 1980.

==Political career==
Bilgen was one of the founders of [[Virtue Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siirtmanset.com/yardim-gemisinde-bulunan-hemsehrimiz-ibrahim-bilgen-sehit-oldu.htm |title=Siirt Manşet - Siirt Haber - Siirt Haberleri - Son Dakika Siirt Haberleri - Siirt Haberler - Siirt Kurtalan Haberler - Siirt Haber - Siirt Son Dakika Haberleri - Siirt Son Dakika - Siirt Manşet Haber |publisher=Siirtmanset.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Virtue Party was banned by the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey]] in 2001, he joined the newly formed [[Felicity Party]]. He was a candidate for Member of Turkish Parliament in 2007 for that party for [[Siirt Province]], but he was not elected, the Felicity Party receiving 884 votes (0.96%) there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saadet.org.tr/worde_aktar/saadet-partisinin-tam-listesi2]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secimsonuclariturkiye.com/2007/56-Siirt-secim-sonuclari.html |title=Seçim Sonuçları 2007 SİİRT &amp;#124; Oy Oranları &amp;#124; Genel Seçim Sonuçları SİİRT |publisher=Secimsonuclariturkiye.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902123450/http://www.secimsonuclariturkiye.com/2007/56-Siirt-secim-sonuclari.html |archivedate=2 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Turkish local elections, 2009]], he was a candidate for mayor of [[Siirt]], but he was again not elected.&lt;ref name=bilgendead&gt;{{cite web
