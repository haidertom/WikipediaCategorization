In [[Indian religions]] and society, an '''acharya''' ([[IAST]]: {{IAST|''ācārya''}}) is a preceptor or instructor in religious matters; founder, or leader of a sect; or a highly learned person or a title affixed to the names of learned people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Platts|first=John T.|title=A dictionary of Urdu, classical Hindi, and English|publisher=W. H. Allen &amp; Co.|location=London|year=1884|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:1246.platts}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The designation has different meanings in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and secular contexts. It is also a Vishwabrahmin/brahmin surname found in Nepal and across India, including [[Odisha]], [[Karnataka]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Maharashtra]].{{Cn|date=January 2017}}

Acharya is sometimes used to address a teacher or a scholar in any discipline, e.g.: [[Bhaskaracharya]], the mathematician.

==Etymology==
The term "acharya" is most often said to include the root "char" or "charya" (conduct). Thus it literally connotes "one who teaches by conduct (example)", i.e. an exemplar.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

==In Hinduism==
In [[Hinduism]], an ''acharya'' (आचार्य) is a formal title of a teacher or guru, who has attained a degree in Veda and Vedanga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Education in India|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqtAAgS3NSEC&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author1=Ram Nath Sharma|author2=Rajendra Kumar Sharma|year=1996|publisher=Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=October 2018}}

Prominent acharyas in the  Hindu tradition are as given below :
*[[Adi Sankara]]charya&lt;ref&gt;[viswakarma community] Although famous for being the proponent of ''[[advaita]] vad'', he established the supremecy of ''[[bhakti]]'' to [[Krishn]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ramanuja]]charya&lt;ref&gt;He propagated the ''[[bhakti]]'' of ''[[Bhagwan]]'' ''[[Vishnu]]''. Source: [http://www.jagatguru.in/ramanuj.htm Ramanujacharya] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826200921/http://www.jagatguru.in/ramanuj.htm |date=26 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Madhvacharya]]&lt;ref&gt;His philosophy is called ''[[dvaita]] vad''. His primary teaching is that "the only goal of a soul is to selflessly and wholeheartedly love and surrender to God" Source: [http://www.encyclopediaofauthentichinduism.org/articles/70_saints_acharyas.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nimbarka]]charya&lt;ref&gt;His writings say that Radha Krishn are the supreme form of God.&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=March 2014}} 
*[[Vallabhacharya]]

*[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]

*[[Sandipani|Acharya Sandipani]]
*[[Bhadreshdas Swami]]

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, acharya is a senior teacher. Notable acharyas:
* [[Pema Chödrön]] (b. 1936) acharya at [[Gampo Abbey]]&lt;ref name="gampoabbey"&gt;{{cite web

==In Jainism==
{{main|Acharya (Jainism)}}

[[File:Acharya_KundaKunda.jpg|thumb|Image of Āchārya [[Kundakunda]], author of [[Jain texts]] like [[Pancastikayasara]], [[Niyamasara]]]]
In [[Jainism]], an ''acharya'' is the highest leader of a Jain order. ''Acharya'' is one of the [[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]] (five supreme beings) and thus worthy of worship. They are the final authority in the monastic order and has the authority to ordain new monks and nuns. They are also authorized to consecrate new idols, although this authority is sometimes delegated to scholars designated by them.

An acharya, like any other Jain monk, is expected to wander except for the [[Chaturmas]]. [[Bhattaraka|Bhaṭṭāraka]]s, who head institutions, are technically junior monks, and thus permitted to stay in the same place.

==In scientific/mathematical scholarship==
* [[Bhaskaracharya]]
* [[Mahaviracharya]]
* [[Bhaskaracharya I]]

==Acharya (degree)==
In Sanskrit institutions, acharya is a post-graduate degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/33943525/?formInput=acharya%20degree%20equivalent%20to|title=Nandan Mishra vs University Of Delhi &amp; Ors on 12 May, 2015|website=indiankanoon.org|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of several reasons why cherophobia may develop is the belief that when one becomes [[Happiness|happy]], a negative event will soon occur that will taint that happiness, as if punishing that individual for satisfaction. This belief is thought to be more prevalent in [[eastern_world|Eastern]] cultures. In [[Western cultures]], such as [[American culture]], "it is almost taken for granted that happiness is one of the most important values guiding people's [[personal life | lives]]".  Western cultures are more driven by an urge to maximize happiness and to minimize sadness. Failing to appear happy often gives cause for concern. The value placed on happiness echoes through Western [[positive psychology]] and through research on subjective well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/springer+select?SGWID=0-11001-6-1457741-0 |title= What's so bad about feeling happy? |date= 17 March 2014 |author= Joan Robinson |publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fear of happiness is associated with fragility of happiness beliefs, suggesting that one of the causes of aversion to happiness may be the belief that happiness is unstable and fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-014-9553-0|title= Fragility of Happiness Beliefs Across 15 National Groups|first1= Mohsen|last1= Joshanloo|first2= Dan|last2= Weijers|first3= Ding-Yu|last3= Jiang|first4= Gyuseog|last4= Han|first5= Jaechang|last5= Bae|first6= Joyce S.|last6= Pang|first7= Lok Sang|last7= Ho|first8= Maria Cristina|last8= Ferreira|first9= Melikşah|last9= Demir|first10= Muhammad|last10= Rizwan|first11= Imran Ahmed|last11= Khilji|first12= Mustapha|last12= Achoui|first13= Ryosuke|last13= Asano|first14= Tasuku|last14= Igarashi|first15= Saori|last15= Tsukamoto|first16= Sanne M.

==Cultural factors==
There are four major reasons why cherophobes avoid happiness: "believing that being happy will provoke bad things to happen; that happiness will make you a worse person; that expressing happiness is bad for you and others; and that pursuing happiness is bad for you and others".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=It's time for Western psychology to recognise that many individuals, and even entire cultures, fear happiness |url=http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/its-time-for-western-psychology-to.html |publisher=[[The British Psychological Society]] |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "some people—in Western and Eastern cultures—are wary of happiness because they believe that bad things, such as unhappiness, suffering, and death, tend to happen to happy people."&lt;ref name="livescience44233"&gt;{{citation |title=Why Happiness Scares Us |author=Stephanie Pappas |url=http://www.livescience.com/44233-fear-of-happiness.html |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings "call into question the notion that happiness is the ultimate goal, a belief echoed in any number of articles and [[self-help]] publications about whether certain choices are likely to make you happy".&lt;ref name="livescience44233"/&gt; Also, "in cultures that believe worldly happiness to be associated with sin, shallowness, and moral decline will actually feel less satisfied when their lives are (by other standards) going well",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=13 of Psychology’s Newest and Coolest Ideas |author=Susan Krauss Whitbourne |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201304/13-psychology-s-newest-and-coolest-ideas |publisher=[[Psychology Today]] |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so measures of personal happiness cannot simply be considered a yardstick for satisfaction with one's life, and attitudes such as aversion to happiness have important implications for measuring happiness across cultures and ranking nations on [[Happiness economics|happiness scores]].

In [[mathematics]], an '''axiomatic system''' is any [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[axiom]]s from which some or all axioms can be used in conjunction to [[logic]]ally derive [[theorem]]s. A [[Theory_(mathematical_logic)|theory]] consists of an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems. An axiomatic system that is completely described is a special kind of [[formal system]]. A formal theory typically means an axiomatic system, for example formulated within [[model theory]]. A [[formal proof]] is a complete rendition of a [[mathematical proof]] within a formal system.

== Properties ==

An axiomatic system is said to be ''[[Consistency|consistent]]'' if it lacks [[contradiction]], i.e. the ability to derive both a statement and its denial from the system's axioms.

In an axiomatic system, an axiom is called ''[[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]]'' if it is not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system. A system will be called independent if each of its underlying axioms is independent. Although independence is not a necessary requirement for a system, consistency usually is, but see neutrosophic logic.

An axiomatic system will be called ''[[Completeness (logic)|complete]]'' if for every statement, either itself or its negation is derivable.

== Relative consistency ==

Beyond consistency, relative consistency is also the mark of a worthwhile axiom system.  This is when the undefined terms of a first axiom system are provided definitions from a second, such that the axioms of the first are theorems of the second.

A good example is the relative consistency of neutral geometry or absolute geometry with respect to the theory of the real number system.  Lines and points are undefined terms in absolute geometry, but assigned meanings in the theory of real numbers in a way that is consistent with both axiom systems.

== Models ==

A '''[[Model theory|model]]''' for an axiomatic system is a well-defined [[Set (mathematics)|set]], which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system, in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system. The existence of a '''concrete model''' proves the [[consistency proof|consistency]] of a system. A model is called '''concrete''' if the meanings assigned are objects and relations from the real world{{clarify|date=March 2018|reason=What does 'real world' mean in this context?}}}, as opposed to an '''abstract model''' which is based on other axiomatic systems.

Models can also be used to show the independence of an axiom in the system. By constructing a valid model for a subsystem without a specific axiom, we show that the omitted axiom is independent if its correctness does not necessarily follow from the subsystem.

Two models are said to be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] if a one-to-one correspondence can be found between their elements, in a manner that preserves their relationship. An axiomatic system for which every model is isomorphic to another is called '''categorial''' (sometimes categorical), and the property of categoriality (categoricity) ensures the completeness of a system.

== Axiomatic method ==

Stating definitions and propositions in a way such that each new term can be formally eliminated by the priorly introduced terms requires primitive notions (axioms) to avoid [[infinite regress]]. This way of doing mathematics is called the '''axiomatic method'''.&lt;ref&gt;"''Set Theory and its Philosophy, a Critical Introduction" S.6; Michael Potter, Oxford, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A common attitude towards the axiomatic method is [[logicism]]. In their book ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to show that all mathematical theory could be reduced to some collection of axioms. More generally, the reduction of a body of propositions to a particular collection of axioms underlies the mathematician's research program. This was very prominent in the mathematics of the twentieth century, in particular in subjects based around [[homological algebra]].

The explication of the particular axioms used in a theory can help to clarify a suitable level of abstraction that the mathematician would like to work with. For example, mathematicians opted that [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s need not be [[Commutative ring|commutative]], which differed from [[Emmy Noether]]'s original formulation. Mathematicians decided to consider [[topological spaces]] more generally without the [[separation axiom]] which [[Felix Hausdorff]] originally formulated.

The [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms]], the result of the axiomatic method applied to set theory, allowed the "proper" formulation of set-theory problems and helped to avoid the paradoxes of [[Naive set theory|naïve set theory]]. One such problem was the [[Continuum hypothesis]]. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the historically controversial [[axiom of choice]] included is commonly abbreviated [[ZFC]], where C stands for choice.  Many authors use [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] to refer to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. Today ZFC is the standard form of [[axiomatic set theory]] and as such is the most common [[foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]].

=== History ===
{{Further|History of Mathematics}}

Mathematical methods developed to some degree of sophistication in ancient Egypt, Babylon, India, and China, apparently without employing the axiomatic method.

[[Euclid]] of [[Alexandria]] authored the earliest extant axiomatic presentation of [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[number theory]]. Many axiomatic systems were developed in the nineteenth century, including [[non-Euclidean geometry]], the foundations of [[real analysis]], [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]'s [[set theory]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s work on foundations, and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s 'new' use of axiomatic method as a research tool. For example, [[group theory]] was first put on an axiomatic basis towards the end of that century. Once the axioms were clarified (that [[inverse element]]s should be required, for example), the subject could proceed autonomously, without reference to the [[transformation group]] origins of those studies.

=== Issues ===

Not every consistent body of propositions can be captured by a describable collection of axioms. Call a collection of axioms [[recursive set|recursive]] if a computer program can recognize whether a given proposition in the language is an axiom. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem]] then tells us that there are certain consistent bodies of propositions with no recursive axiomatization. Typically, the computer can recognize the axioms and logical rules for deriving theorems, and the computer can recognize whether a proof is valid, but to determine whether a proof exists for a statement is only soluble by "waiting" for the proof or disproof to be generated.  The result is that one will not know which propositions are theorems and the axiomatic method breaks down. An example of such a body of propositions is the theory of the [[natural number]]s. The Peano Axioms (described below) thus only partially axiomatize this theory.

In practice, not every proof is traced back to the axioms. At times, it is not clear which collection of axioms a proof appeals to. For example, a number-theoretic statement might be expressible in the language of arithmetic (i.e. the language of the Peano Axioms) and a proof might be given that appeals to [[topology]] or [[complex analysis]]. It might not be immediately clear whether another proof can be found that derives itself solely from the Peano Axioms.

Any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory, but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions, and even if it is, it is not likely to shed light on anything. Philosophers of mathematics sometimes assert that mathematicians choose axioms "arbitrarily", but it is possible that although they may appear arbitrary when viewed only from the point of view of the canons of deductive logic, that appearance is due to a limitation on the purposes that deductive logic serves.

=== Example: The Peano axiomatization of natural numbers ===
{{Main|Peano axioms}}
The mathematical system of [[natural number]]s  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... is based on an axiomatic system first written down by the mathematician [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] in 1889. He chose the axioms, in the language of a single unary function symbol ''S'' (short for "[[Successor function|successor]]"), for the set of natural numbers to be:

* There is a natural number 0.

=== Axiomatization ===

In [[mathematics]], '''axiomatization''' is the formulation of a system of statements (i.e. [[axiom]]s) that relate a number of primitive terms in order that a [[consistency proof|consistent]] body of [[Boolean-valued function|propositions]] may be derived [[deductive reasoning|deductively]] from these statements. Thereafter, the [[mathematical proof|proof]] of any proposition should be, in principle, traceable back to these axioms.

The '''blood eagle''' is a ritualized method of [[capital punishment|execution]], detailed in late [[skald|skaldic poetry]]. According to the two instances mentioned in the [[Saga]]s, the victims (in both cases members of [[royal families]]) were placed in a prone position, their ribs severed from the spine with a sharp tool, and their lungs pulled through the opening to create a pair of “wings”. There is continuing debate about whether the ritual was a literary invention, a mistranslation of the original texts, or an authentic historical practice.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Frank | first =Roberta | title =Viking atrocity and Skaldic verse: The Rite of the Blood-Eagle | journal =English Historical Review | volume =XCIX | issue =CCCXCI | pages =332–343 | publisher =Oxford Journals | date =1984 | url =http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/XCIX/CCCXCI/332.full.pdf+html | doi =10.1093/ehr/XCIX.CCCXCI.332 | accessdate = 30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tracy"&gt;{{cite book| last =Tracy| first =Larissa| title =Torture and Brutality in Medieval Literature: Negotiations of National Identity| publisher =DS Brewer| date =2012| location =| pages =109–111| url =http://www.boydellandbrewer.com/store/viewitem.asp?idproduct=13853| isbn =9781843842880| access-date =2015-03-30| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194210/http://www.boydellandbrewer.com/store/viewitem.asp?idproduct=13853#| archive-date =2015-09-23| dead-url =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dash"&gt;{{cite web| last =Dash| first =Mike| authorlink =Mike Dash| title =The Vengeance of Ivarr the Boneless| website =Smithsonian.com| publisher =Smithsonian| date =18 March 2013| url =http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-vengeance-of-ivarr-the-boneless-4002654/| accessdate = 30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounts==
The blood eagle ritual killing rite appears in just two instances in Norse literature, plus oblique references some have interpreted as referring to the same ritual. The primary versions share certain commonalities: the victims are both noblemen (Halfdan Haaleg or "Long-leg" was a prince; [[Ælla of Northumbria]] a king) and both of the executions were in retaliation for the murder of a father.

===Einarr and Halfdan ===
{{wikisource|Heimskringla/Harald Harfager's Saga#Halfdan Haleg's Death.}}
In the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'', the blood eagle is described as a sacrifice to [[Odin]]. [[Torf-Einarr]] has [[Harald Fairhair]]'s son [[Halfdan Long-Leg]] ritually executed:

{{quote|''Þar fundu  þeir Hálfdan hálegg, ok lèt Einarr rísta örn á baki honum með sverði, ok skera rifin öll frá hrygginum ok draga þar út lúngun, ok gaf hann Óðni til sigrs sèr.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/orkneyingasagaa00dasegoog|title=Orkneyinga saga and Magnus saga, with appendices, Volume 1|last=Guðbrandur Vigfússon|first=Sir George Webbe Dasent|publisher=H.M.S.O., 1887|others=Oxford University|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einarr made them carve an eagle on his back with a sword, and cut the ribs all from the backbone, and draw the lungs there out, and gave him to Odin for the victory he had won.&lt;ref name="Dasent"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Dasent| first =G.W.| title = Icelandic Sagas and Other Historical Documents Relating to the Settlements and Dsecents of the Northmen on the British Isles Vol III - The Orkneyinger's Saga| journal =Rerum Britannicarum Medii Ævi Scriptores, Or, Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain and Ireland During the Middle Ages| volume =88| issue =3| pages =xxvi, 8–9| publisher =Great Britain. Public Record Office| location =London| date =1894 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pqlEAQAAMAAJ| accessdate = 30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

[[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Heimskringla]]'' contains an account of the same event described in ''Orkneyinga saga'', with Einarr actually performing the deed himself:

{{quote|''Þá gékk Einarr jarl til Hálfdanar; hann reist örn á baki honum með þeima hætti, at hann lagði sverði á hol við hrygginn ok reist rifin öll ofan alt á lendar, dró þar út lungun; var þat bani Hálfdanar.''&lt;ref name="Heimskingla.no"&gt;
{{cite web| last = Sturluson| first = Snorri| title = Heimskringla in Old Norse| url =http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Haralds_saga_hins_h%C3%A1rfagra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, Earl Einarr went up to Halfdan and cut the "blood eagle" on his back, in this fashion that he thrust his sword into his chest by the backbone and severed all the ribs down to the loins, and then pulled out the lungs; and that was Halfdan's death.&lt;ref name="Hollander"&gt;

=== Ivar and King Ælla ===
In ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|Þáttr af Ragnars sonum]]'' (the "Tale of Ragnar's sons"),  [[Ivar the Boneless]] has captured king [[Ælla of Northumbria]], who had killed Ivar's father [[Ragnar Loðbrók]]. The killing of Ælla, after a battle for control of [[York]], is described thus:
 
{{quote|They caused the bloody eagle to be carved on the back of Ælla, and they cut away all of the ribs from the spine, and then they ripped out his lungs.}}
&lt;!--Some sources on-line mistakenly ascribe to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' the text from ''ßáttr af Ragnars sonum'' mentioned above. The relevant year (867) of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', however, says merely:
{{quote|{{lang|ang|Her for se here of East Englum ofer Humbre muþan to Eoforwicceastre on Norþhymbre, ⁚ þær wæs micel ungeþuærnes þære þeode betweox him selfum, ⁚ hie hæfdun hiera cyning aworpenne Osbryht, ⁚ ungecyndne cyning underfengon Ællan; ⁚ hie late on geare to þam gecirdon þæt hie wiþ þone here winnende wærun, ⁚ hie þeah micle fierd gegadrodon, ⁚ þone here sohton æt Eoforwicceastre, ⁚ on þa ceastre bræcon, ⁚ hie sume inne wurdon, ⁚ þær was ungemetlic wæl geslægen Norþanhymbra, sume binnan, sume butan; ⁚ þa cyningas begen ofslægene, ⁚ sio laf wiþ þone here friþ nam; ⁚ þy ilcan geare gefor Ealchstan biscep, ⁚ he hæfde þæt bisceprice .l. wintra æt Scireburnan, ⁚ his lic liþ þær on tune.}}

[Translation:] Here the [[Viking]] enemy army went forth from [[East Anglia]] over the mouth of the [[Humber]] to York town in [[Northumbria]], and there was there great discord of the people among themselves, and they had their king [[Osberht of Northumbria|Osberht]] overthrown, and accepted a strange king Ælla; and they late in the year turned to fighting against the enemy army, and they gathered a great army, and they sought the enemy army at York, and broke into the town, and some of them got in, and there was an unmeasurable slaughter of Northumbrians, some inside, some outside; and '''both kings were slain''', and the survivors made peace with the enemy army; and in the same year [[bishop]] Ealhstān died, who had the [[diocese|bishopric]] 50 winters at [[Sherborne]], and his body lies in the town.}} --&gt;

The blood eagle is referred to by the eleventh-century poet [[Sigvatr Þórðarson]], who, some time between 1020 and 1038, wrote a skaldic verse named ''[[Knútsdrápa]]'' that recounts and establishes [[Ivar the Boneless]] as having killed Ælla and subsequently cutting his back.

Sighvatr's skaldic verse in [[Old Norse]]:
{|
! Original
! Literal translation
! Suggested reordering
|-
| style="padding-right:1em" | {{lang|non|&lt;poem&gt;Ok Ellu bak,
At lét hinn’s sat,
Ívarr, ara,
Iorví, skorit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skaldic.arts.usyd.edu.au/db.php?table=poems&amp;id=356 Knútsrápra by Sigvatr Þórðarson], ''Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}
| style="padding-right:1em" |&lt;poem&gt;And Ella’s back,
at had the one who dwelt
Ívarr, with eagle,
York, cut.&lt;/poem&gt;
|&lt;poem&gt;And Ívarr, the one
who dwelt at York,
had Ella's back
cut with [an] eagle.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

Skaldic verse, a common medium of Norse poets, was meant to be cryptic and allusive, and the idiomatic nature of Sighvatr's poem as a description of what has become known as the blood eagle is a matter of historical contention, particularly since in Norse imagery the eagle was strongly associated with blood and death.

===Other accounts===
Another possible oblique reference to the ritual appear in ''[[Norna-Gests þáttr]]''. There are two stanzas of verse near the end of its section 6, "[[Sigurd]] Felled the Sons of Hunding", where a character describing previous events says:
{|
| style="padding-right:1em" | {{lang|non|&lt;poem&gt;Nú er blóðugr örn
breiðum hjörvi
bana Sigmundar
á baki ristinn.
Fár var fremri,
sá er fold rýðr,
hilmis nefi,
ok hugin gladdi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/nornages.htm Norna-Gests þáttr]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}
|&lt;poem&gt;Now the blood eagle
With a broad sword
The killer of [[Sigmund]]
Carved on the back.
Fewer were more valiant
As the troops dispersed
A chief of people
Who made the [[raven]] glad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100323030754/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/oldheathen/077.php Hardman's translation of ''Norna-Gests þáttr'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
|}
The word translated "raven" is not ''hrafn'' but ''[[Huginn|hugin]]'', one of [[Odin]]'s ravens.

==Authenticity==
There is debate about whether the blood eagle was historically practiced, or whether it was a literary device invented by the authors who transcribed the sagas. No contemporary accounts of the ritual exist, and the scant references in the sagas are several hundred years after the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]]. 

Alfred Smyth supported the historicity of the ritual, stating that it is clearly [[human sacrifice]] to the Norse god [[Odin]].  He characterized St. Dunstan's description of the Ælla's killing as an "accurate account of a body subjected to the ritual of the blood eagle".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred P. Smyth]], ''Scandinavian Kings in the British Isles, 850–880'' (1977), Oxford, pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Roberta Frank]] reviewed the historical evidence for the ritual in her "Viking Atrocity and Skaldic Verse: The Rite of the Blood-Eagle", where she writes: "By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the various saga motifs—eagle sketch, rib division, lung surgery, and 'saline stimulant'—were combined in inventive sequences designed for maximum horror."&lt;ref name="Frank-II"&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|1984|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; She concludes that the authors of the sagas misunderstood alliterative [[kenning]]s which described carnivorous birds scavenging after battles, i.e. killing a foe and allowing their backs to be torn by eagles as battlefield [[carrion]]. She compared the lurid details of the blood eagle to Christian [[martyr]]dom tracts, such as that relating the tortures of [[Saint Sebastian]], shot so full of arrows that his ribs and internal organs were exposed.  She suggests that these tales of martyrdom inspired further exaggeration of the misunderstood skaldic verses into a grandiose torture and death ritual with no actual historical basis.  David Horspool in his book ''King Alfred: Burnt Cakes and Other Legends'', while not committing to the historical veracity of the ritual, also saw parallels to martyrdom tracts.&lt;ref name="Horspool"&gt;{{cite book |last=Horspool |first=David |authorlink= |title=King Alfred: Burnt Cakes and Other Legends |publisher=Profile Books |year=2006 |location=London |pages=44–45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdB584-MIhIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |isbn=067402320X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank's paper sparked a "lively debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baraz |first=David |authorlink= |title=Medieval Cruelty: Changing Perceptions, Late Antiquity to the Early Modern Period |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2003 |location=Ithaca, NY |page=67 |isbn=978-0801438172}}, citing: Bjarni Einarsson, "''De Normanorum Atrocitate'', or on the Execution of Royalty by the Aqueline Method", ''The Saga Book'', 22 (1988): 79–82; Roberta Frank, "The Blood-Eagle Again", ''The Saga Book'', 22 (1988): 287–289; Bjarni Einarsson and Roberta Frank, "The Blood-Eagle Once More: Two Notes", ''The Saga Book'', 23 (1990): 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Ronald Hutton]]'s ''[[The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles]]: Their Nature and Legacy'' states that "the hitherto notorious rite of the 'Blood Eagle,' the killing of a defeated warrior by pulling up his ribs and lungs through his back, has been shown to be almost certainly a [[Christian]] [[mythology|myth]] resulting from the misunderstanding of some older verse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink= |title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy states |publisher=Blackwell |year=1991 |location=Oxford |page=282|isbn=978-0631172888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''car analogy''' is a common technique used by [[engineering]] textbooks to ease the understanding of [[abstraction|abstract]] concepts in which a [[car]], its composite parts, and common circumstances surrounding it are used as [[analogy|analogs]] for elements of the conceptual [[systems]].

==Uses of car analogies==
The efficiency of car analogies reside on their capacity to explain difficult concepts (usually due to their high abstraction level) on more mundane terms with which the target audience is comfortable, and with which many also have a special interest. Due to that, car analogies appear more often on works related to [[applied sciences]] and [[technology]].

In order to work, car analogies translate [[force|agents of action]] as the car driver, the seller, or police officers; likewise, elements of a [[system]] are referred as car pieces, such as wheels, motor, or ignition keys. [[Resources]] tend to appear as gas, speed, or as the money that can be spent on better accessories/vehicles.

For example, in the paragraph:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"[[Zener diode]]s regulate voltage by acting as complementary loads, drawing more or less current as necessary to ensure a constant voltage drop across the load. This is analogous to regulating the speed of an automobile by braking rather than by varying the throttle position."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/Semi/SEMI_3.html#xtocid1418812 |title=Lessons in Electric  Circuits |volume=III - Semiconductors |chapter=Diodes and Rectifiers |first=Tony R |last=Kuphaldt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Current (resource) is depicted as the car's speed, while the role of the brakes is performed by the Zener diodes (element of the system).

Car analogies are also typically used to explain the quality differences between two similar tools or hardware pieces; in that case, the best one is usually described as a [[mid-engined]] Italian [[supercar]] or a high-end [[luxury vehicle]].

The '''Clemson–South Carolina football brawl''' was an on-[[American football field|field]] altercation during an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] game between [[American football|football]] players from the [[University of South Carolina]] and [[Clemson University]]. The incident took place on November 20, 2004 at the [[Memorial Stadium, Clemson|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Clemson, South Carolina]]. This [[riot|disturbance]] led to serious repercussions handed down for those involved from the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] (South Carolina's conference) and the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] (Clemson's conference). This took place the day after a notable brawl at an NBA game in Detroit, the "[[Malice at the Palace]]".

==The fight==
Prior to the contest, some South Carolina players congregated at the corner of the endzone near the bottom of "the Hill" at Memorial Stadium as Clemson made their traditional entrance to the field. Brief shoving ensued between Gamecock and Tiger players, but was broken up quickly.

The brawl resulted late in the game after USC quarterback Syvelle Newton was knocked to the ground after a shot to the helmet following an incomplete pass on 4th and 11 with 5:48 left to go in the fourth quarter, and Clemson players lay on top of him preventing him from getting up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10057787/ Clemson, South Carolina Recall The Brawl]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1929371 ESPN - Both teams were bowl eligible - College Football&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stories/101906abn.html Clemson, South Carolina Reflect On Past Brawl :: Two teams had plenty of time off between games after ugly brawl&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Players on the field from both teams engaged in shoving and punching and both benches practically cleared as chaos erupted. The iconic image of the brawl was of Clemson's Yusef Kelly kicking a helmetless South Carolina player in the head as he lay face down, attempting to protect his head with his hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestate.com/2009/11/24/1042903_a1042887/usc-clemson-football-memorable.html USC-Clemson football, memorable moments]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.augusta.com/latest-news/2010-11-25/south-carolina-clemson-rivalry-gets-kinder South Carolina-Clemson rivalry gets kinder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/7916916 Clemson, South Carolina to opt out of bowl games]&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Carolina Highway Patrol|State Troopers]], as well as other local law enforcement officers, entered the field to restore order. No fans ever entered the field. Play was suspended for six minutes.

The fight overshadowed the last game [[Lou Holtz]] participated in as South Carolina's head coach, as he retired at the end of the season. Holtz quoted that he "is going to be remembered along with former [[List of Ohio State Buckeyes head football coaches|Ohio State coach]] [[Woody Hayes]] for having a fight at the Clemson game," alluding to the [[1978 Gator Bowl]]. Holtz then handed the coaching reins to [[Steve Spurrier]]. Clemson won the game 29–7.

The following year (2005), in a showing of sportsmanship which was coordinated by both schools' athletic departments and administrations, both teams met at midfield at [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] at the University of South Carolina and shook hands.

==The consequences==

The ACC and SEC reviewed the tapes of both incidents before handing out proper punishments to players. However, both schools imposed a punishment of their own on November 22, by saying that neither team would be permitted to play in a bowl game because of the brawl.

Both the SEC and ACC suspended players from each school, with the SEC's penalties effective for South Carolina's first game of the 2005-06 season, against [[UCF Knights football|Central Florida]], while the ACC allowed Clemson to stagger the suspensions for their offending players at various games during the 2005-06 season.

The ACC's policy on players serving suspensions permitted Clemson to punish the players during the season, and not an immediate penalty during the Tigers' first game of 2005, against [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M]].  Some of the offending players were involved in the crucial game, which resulted in a Tigers win in the final seconds. The penalties were served, based on a case-by-case basis, in midseason games against the winless [[Temple Owls football|Temple]] and one game winner [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]].

[[Image:E8086-Bishkek-glass-bottle-collection-point.jpg|thumb|Refillable glass bottles collected, and deposits refunded, at a collection point in [[Bishkek]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]. Deposit values (from 50 tyiyn to 2 [[Kyrgyz som]], i.e. 2–5 U.S. cents) for various bottle types are posted next to the sample bottles on a rack.]]

'''Container-deposit legislation''' (also known as a '''deposit-refund system''', '''bottle bill''', or '''deposit-return system''') is any law that requires the collection of a monetary deposit on beverage containers (refillable or non-refillable) at the point of sale.  When the container is returned to an authorized redemption center, or retailer in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly or fully refunded to the redeemer (presumed to be the original purchaser). It is a [[deposit-refund system]].

Governments may pass container deposit legislation for several reasons, including, for example:
* To encourage recycling and complement existing curbside recycling programs, to reduce energy and material usage for containers
* To specifically reduce beverage container [[litter]] along [[highway]]s, in lakes and rivers, and on other public or private properties (where beverage container litter occurs, a nominal deposit provides an economic incentive to clean it up; this is a significant source of [[income]] to some poor individuals and [[non-profit]] civic organizations)
* To extend the usable lifetime of taxpayer-funded landfills

Deposits that are not redeemed are often kept by distributors or bottlers to cover the costs of the system (including handling fees paid to retailers or redemption enters to collect, sort, and handle the containers) or are escheated to the governmental entity involved to fund environmental programs. 

==History==
A &amp; R Thwaites &amp; Co in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], announced in 1799 the provision of artificial "[[soda water]]" and that they paid 2 shillings a dozen for returned bottles. [[Schweppes]] that also was in the business of artificially made [[mineral water]]s, had a similar recycling policy about 1800, without any legislation.&lt;ref name="britishsoftdrinks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/PDF/history.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014013216/http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/PDF/history.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish bottled beverage companies also voluntarily introduced such a scheme to encourage the return of their bottles for reuse.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140426202005/http://www.agbarr.co.uk/ces_general.nsf/wpg/about_us-frequently_asked_questions.html] In Sweden a standard system for deposits on bottles and recycling was established in 1884, eventually by law. The popular demand for a deposit on [[aluminium can]]s to reduce littering led to legislation in 1984.

In North America, [[British Columbia]]'s legislated deposit-return system, enacted in 1970, is the oldest such program in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/legislation/canada/britishcolumbia.htm|title=BottleBill.org - The British Columbia Deposit Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Container-deposit legislation by country==

===Australia===

[[File:Reverse vending machine for the NSW Container Deposit Scheme at the Kooringal Mall 2.jpg|thumb|Reverse container vending machine in [[Kooringal, New South Wales]]]]
In the days when bottles were washed and re-used, drinks manufacturers paid for the return of their (proprietary) containers, but with the advent of [[disposable|single-use]] containers great savings were possible, leaving their disposal as the consumer's responsibility.

While a national scheme has been repeatedly delayed largely due to unveiled threats from the beverage industry of multimillion-dollar ad campaigns against politicians who support it and disagreements between the states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/millions-of-dollars-in-attack-ads-coming-in-march-20141024-11b5pi.html|title=Millions of dollars in attack ads coming in March|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a growing momentum of state-based operated container deposit schemes (CDS). Currently all states except Victoria and Tasmania look to have some sort of state-based container deposit scheme operating within the next 2 years. With 8 billion beverage containers landfilled or littered every year in Australia, proponents argue that it is the most effective method to reduce such litter; and improve recycling above that achieved by kerbside. It also has many co-benefits such as funds for charities and several thousand new jobs, that cannot be achieved by other approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boomerangalliance.org.au|title=Boomerang Alliance|work=Boomerang Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The state of [[South Australia]] charges a refundable deposit of AUD 10 [[Australian dollar|cents]] per drinks carton, can or bottle (only containers marked as eligible for refund; does not include wine &amp; spirits bottles, milk cartons, or concentrated/and or vegetable juice intended to be diluted before consumption). This has been in place since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.sa.gov.au/environmental_info/container_deposit|title=Request Rejected|website=www.epa.sa.gov.au|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall return rate is 79.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Container deposits|url=http://www.epa.sa.gov.au/environmental_info/container_deposit|website=Environment Protection Authority|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Northern Territory]] introduced a container deposit scheme in 2012.  A 10-cent (AUD) refundable deposit is charged on all beverage containers with the exception of unflavoured milk, soy milk, cordial bottles (undiluted), concentrated fruit/vegetable juice intended to be diluted before consumption, and still or sparkling wine (in glass bottles). Unredeemed deposits remain with the producer/filler. In 2015-2016, the system achieved a total return rate of 54%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual Report 2015-16|journal=Environment Protection (Beverage Containers and Plastic Bags) Act|url=https://ntepa.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/387987/2015-16-CDS-Annual-Report.pdf|publisher=Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The state of [[New South Wales]] (the most populated state, with 7.5 million residents) recently announced that it would be adopting a 10-cent (AUD) deposit scheme, which commenced on December 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSW CDS|url=http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/waste/cds-intro.htm|website=NSW Environment &amp; Heritage|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is expected to double the state's beverage container recycling rate to roughly 80 percent. 
* On July 22, 2016, the [[Queensland]] government announced that the state would introduce a container deposit scheme. The government has confirmed that the initiative will start in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2016/7/22/container-deposit-scheme-for-queensland|title=Container deposit scheme for Queensland|website=qld.gov.au|publisher=Queensland government|language=en-AU|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the scheme, it is expected that a 10-cent (AUD) refund will be provided for empty drink containers between 150ml and 3L. 
* The state of [[Western Australia]] has announced the start date of a state-based scheme commencing in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-17/10-cent-container-deposit-scheme-for-wa-recyclable-bottles-cans/7751328|title=Premier Colin Barnett announces 2018 start date for cash for containers scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme will apply to certain empty drink containers ranging in size from 150ml to 3L and will exclude domestically consumed drink containers such as wine and spirit bottles, milk and juice containers. The amount of the deposit/refund will be AUD 10-cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs - Department of Water and Environmental Regulation|url=https://www.der.wa.gov.au/our-work/programs/111-wa-container-deposit-scheme|website=Department of Water and Environmental Regulation|publisher=Government of Western Australia|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
Smaller beer bottles (250 or 330&amp;nbsp;mL) carry a [[Euro|€]]0.10 deposit, and larger ones (750&amp;nbsp;mL or 1&amp;nbsp;L) a €0.20 one. Some fruit-juice bottles, such as those sold by Oxfam Wereldwinkels/Magasins du Monde], carry a €0.30 deposit. Some hard plastic milk bottles such as those sold by [[Delhaize Group|Delhaize]] carry a €0.20 deposit.

===Canada===
{{See also|Recycling in Canada}}In 1970, British Columbia became the first Canadian province to establish a mandatory deposit-return system for soft drinks and beer containers. Today, nearly all provinces and territories in Canada have followed suit; the territory of Nunavut is the only jurisdiction in Canada that has yet to implement some sort of deposit refund system. 

Deposits range from CAD$0.05 to CAD$0.40 per unit depending on the material and size of the container and whether the container contains an alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage. 

Below is a brief summary of each program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/WPW2016-FINAL-with-cover.pdf|title=Who Pays What 2016|last=CM Consulting|first=|date=2016|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* British Columbia: While the original program covered only carbonated soft drinks and beer, the deposit legislation expanded to include any ready-to-serve beverage sold in a container that is sealed by its manufacturer (e.g. bottled water, juice, new age drinks, and alcohol), excluding milk and milk substitutes. There are currently two stewardship agencies in BC that carry out deposit-refund obligations on behalf of beverage producers: [[Encorp Pacific]] (for non-alcoholic beverages, wine, spirits, some ciders and coolers, and some import beer) and Brewers Distributor Ltd. (BDL) (for domestic coolers, beers, and ciders). In 2017, BC's program recovered over 1 billion containers for an overall return-rate of 75.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.return-it.ca/ar2017/executive-summary.php|title=Encorp Pacific Executive Summary 2017|access-date=2 October 2018|publisher=[[Encorp Pacific]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alberta: All beverage containers ([[glass bottle]]s, [[Beverage can|metal cans]], [[Tetra Pak]]s, gable-top cartons, bags-in-boxes, [[plastic bottle]]s and jugs, drink pouches), including milk containers (Alberta was the first jurisdiction in North America to accept and charge a deposit on milk containers in June 2009), are charged deposits at the point of sale; 10¢ for containers 1 L or less, and 25¢ for containers larger than 1 L. Containers can be dropped off at depots and are picked up by the Alberta Beverage Container Recycling Corporation. In 2014, over 2 billion beverage containers were returned to Alberta depots for an overall return rate of 83%. 
* Saskatchewan: Established in 1988, Saskatchewan's deposit-return program applies to all ready-to-serve beverage containers, except those for meal replacements, or dietary supplements. SARCAN began taking milk and milk substitutes on April 1, 2017. SARCAN Recycling is responsible for administering the program and operates under contract to the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment. In fiscal 2014-2015, a total of 405.6 million beverage containers were returned to SARCAN recycling depots for an overall container return rate of 87%. 
* Manitoba: Manitoba's program was implemented in 2010 and is limited to beer containers, which are charged a deposit of CAD$0.10 or $0.20 depending on the size. Other containers (except milk) are charged a non-refundable $0.02 per unit levy (Container Recycling Fee) and can be recycled in municipal curbside recycling programs.
* Ontario: The Ontario Deposit Return Program (ODRP), which came into force in February 2007, is a voluntary program implemented by the provincial government that covers wine, spirits, and imported beer containers (plastics, metal, bimetal, glass, gable top, Tetra Pak, bag-in-box containers). Because there is no law mandating that wine and spirits be placed on deposit, they may be added to municipal blue box programs voluntarily. Refillable and non-refillable beer containers are collected through a separate program administered and operated by Brewers Retail Inc. (The Beer Store). Alcoholic beverage containers, as well as any associated packaging, can be returned to 443 beer store locations, 113 breweries (beer containers only), 141 retail partner stores, 63 LCBO northern agency stores, 4 additional LCBO stores, and 115 empty bottle dealers (small independent depots contracted in more remote locations where beer retailers are not available), for a total of 879 redemption locations. TBS trucks collect these empty containers and back-haul them to various distribution centres where recyclables are sent to a processing facility for sorting, baling, and shipping to market. Refillable bottles are sent back to the brewers for washing and refill. Containers returned through Ontario's deposit-return system showed a total recycling rate of 89% for 2014-2015, while refillable beer bottles were returned at a rate of 98%.
[[File:6675 boulevard Monk - 06.jpg|thumb|Recycling machine in a [[Montreal]] grocery store.]]
* Quebec: Quebec's deposit-return system was established in 1984 and covers beer and carbonated soft drink containers. Deposits range from CAD$0.05¢ to $0.20 depending on the size, material and content of the container. Boissons Gazeuses Environnement (BGE) administers the program for non-refillable soft-drink containers on behalf of industry, while Recyc-Quebec oversees the beer container collection program. In 2014, the recycling rate for containers recovered via the deposit-return system was 78% (includes data for refillable bottles). 
* New Brunswick: This program was created in 1992 and covers all ready-to-drink, non-refillable beverage containers 5L and under, including soft-drinks, beer, wine, spirits, flavoured waters, fruit juices, vegetable juices, and low alcohol drinks. Containers for milk and milk products (and substitutes) as well as processed apple cider are exempt. Encorp Atlantic Inc. is the stewardship agency responsible for managing the collection, transportation, and partial processing of non-alcoholic beverage containers on behalf of brand-owners, and New Brunswick Liquor (NB Liquor) is responsible for the collection of alcoholic beverage containers. Program oversight is the responsibility of the Department of Environment. New Brunswick's deposit-return program is somewhat unique in that it operates under a “half-back” model where only half of the original deposit is refunded to the consumer when a container is returned for recycling. The unrefunded portion of the deposit is used to cover the costs of administering the program and part of it also goes towards the province's Environmental Trust Fund, which is used for environmental conservation and other provincial initiatives aimed at reducing waste. In 2014, New Brunswick's recycling rate for non-refillable containers was 73%.
* Nova Scotia: Launched on April 1, 1996, Nova Scotia's deposit-return program applies to all ready-to-drink beverage containers excluding milk, milk products, soya milk, and rice beverages. Other containers that are exempt from the program are certain meal replacements, formulated liquid diets, foods for very low energy diets, thickened juices, baby formulas, concentrates, and non-alcoholic beverages in containers of 5L or more. The organization responsible for managing the program is DivertNS (formerly the Resource Recovery Fund Board Inc.). Like New Brunswick's program, Nova Scotia's deposit-return system is based on a “half-back” model where only half of the original deposit paid per container is refunded to the consumer. The non-refundable portion of the deposit is used as revenue by DivertNS to help pay for program costs. In 2014, the program collected 334 million non-refillable beverage containers for a recycling rate of 84%. 
* Prince Edward Island: The province's deposit-return system was launched on May 3, 2008 as a replacement to a law that had prohibited the sale of non-refillable soft drink containers. The program is overseen and administered by the Department of Environment, Energy, and Forestry and covers all ready-to-drink beverage containers up to 5L, except those used for dairy products, milk substitutes, or nutritional supplements. Similar to the other Atlantic provinces, PEI's deposit-return system is based on a “half-back” model where only 50% of the original deposit paid is refunded to the consumer when he/she returns the empty container to a depot. In 2014-2015, PEI had a non-refillable beverage container recycling rate of 80% and a total container recycling rate of 82%. 
* Yukon: Introduced in 1992, Yukon's deposit-return program covers all ready-to-drink beverage containers (glass, plastic, steel, aluminum, and Tetra Pak), excluding those containing milk and milk substitutes. The program is managed by the Department of Community Services and requires consumers to pay a surcharge on the purchase of certain beverage containers, which includes a refundable deposit and a non-refundable recycling fund fee (RFF). Upon return of the empty container to a depot or processor, a portion of the surcharge (the refundable deposit) is refunded to the consumer, while the non-refundable RFF is kept by the retailer and remitted to the territorial Recycling Fund, where unredeemed deposits also go. In 2014, Yukon had a non-refillable recycling rate of 82%. In May 2016, the Yukon government announced changes to the Beverage Container Regulation. These changes, which are expected to be implemented August 1, 2017, will affect the surcharges and refunds applicable to beverage containers including milk and milk substitutes, and will simplify the regulation. Once the territory's new regulations kick in, all beverage containers will fall into two categories: (1) 750ml and less, including all milk &amp; milk substitutes (surcharge 10-cents, refund 5-cents), and (2) 750ml and more (surcharge 35-cents, refund 25-cents). 
* Northwest Territories: Launched on November 1, 2005, Northwest Territories’ deposit-return program covers all ready-to-serve beverage containers made of glass, plastics, aluminum, bi-metal, and mixed materials, including juice, milk and liquid milk products (added February 2010), soda, water, beer, wine, liquor and other alcoholic beverages. Excluded from the program are containers for infant formula; containers for milk and liquid milk products smaller than 30ml; and powder milk. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DNR) is responsible for administering the program. Similar to Yukon's program, the total surcharge per container includes a refundable deposit and a non-refundable handling fee. Whereas the refundable deposit is returned to the consumer when they return the beverage container to a depot, the non-refundable handing fee is put into the Environment Fund and is used to help cover program costs. In fiscal 2014, approximately 26 million beverage containers were returned for reuse or recycling, translating into an overall recycling rate of 89%.

=== Croatia ===
Since 2006, a refundable deposit of 0.5 HRK (Croatian Kuna) has been levied on non-refillable containers (except dairy products) with minimum volume of 200ml. Retailers over 200m2 are obliged to take-back containers. Collection is mostly manual, although some collection occurs with reverse vending machines. Retailers must sort containers by material type (PET bottles, aluminum/steel cans, and glass bottles). The scheme is government operated and there is a collection target of 95%. In 2015, the scheme recovered up to 90% of all non-refillable containers placed on the Croatian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview (2016)|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=2016|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Czech Republic ===
In the [[Czech Republic]] most beer is sold in returnable glass bottles that carry a CZK 3 deposit. These bottles are collected by shops and supermarkets. Reverse vending machines have mostly replaced human staff. There is also a CZK 100 deposit on plastic beer crates with a 20 bottle capacity. Most reverse vending machines accept an entire crate full of empty bottles, returning CZK 160. There is no deposit on other containers.

===Denmark===
&lt;!--[[Image:DK_PantC.jpg|thumb|right|Deposit type C in Denmark]]--&gt;
In [[Denmark]] the selling of aluminium beverage cans was forbidden between 1982 and 2002. However this regulation violated [[European Union law]]. Therefore, the [[European Union|EU]] forced Denmark to replace it, and the new legislation, passed in 2002, introduced a container deposit scheme. The law covers beer (alcohol content &gt;0.5% by volume), carbonated soft drinks (alcohol content 0-0.5%), energy drinks, mineral water, iced tea, ready-to-drink beverages, and mixer products (alcohol content 0.5%-10%). Excluded from the scheme are fruit squash, juice, cocoa, wine and spirits, and milk. The deposit levels are as follows&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.danskretursystem.dk/en/all-about-deposits/deposit-amounts/|title=Deposit Amounts in Denmark|last=Dansk Retur System|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
* Disposable aluminium and glass containers under 1L and refillable glass bottles  under 0.5L: 1DKK 
* Disposable and refillable plastic containers under 1L: 1.5DKK
* Metal and plastic containers equal to or greater than 1L or refillable glass bottles over 0.5L: 3DKK
The deposit system operator is [[Dansk Retursystem]] A/S, a private non-profit organization. Most collection (95%) is done automatically using reverse vending machines, but some (5%) is done manually. In 2014, the system achieved a total return rate of 89%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=2016|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estonia ===
&lt;!--[[Image:PfandEstlandB.jpg|thumb|right|Deposit symbol in Estonia ("B" on a 1.5&amp;nbsp;L-bottle)]]--&gt;
In [[Estonia]] there is a universal deposit and recycling system since 2005 for one-time and refillable containers. This includes soft drinks, water, beer, cider, juice, juice concentrates, nectars, and low-ethanol alcoholic beverages (up to 6% volume). It does not include strong alcoholic beverages such as wine or vodka, glass jars, or Tetra Paks. The deposit is €0.10 on all metal, plastic, and glass beverage containers of all sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eestipandipakend.ee/en/how-does-the-deposit-system-work/|title=How does the deposit system work?|last=Eesti Pandipakend OU|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is operated by Eesti Pandipakend OÜ, which is a producer responsibility organization representing the Estonian Association of Brewers, the Association of Producers of Soft Drinks, the Association of Importers of Soft Drinks and Beer, and the Estonian Retailers Association.

In 2015, 90% of all PET bottles, 70% of all aluminum cans and 87% of all glass bottles sold in Estonia were returned for recycling and/or reuse. The overall return rate was 82.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Fiji===
The United Nations Development Programme had funded a feasibility study to look at the possibility of establishing a deposit-return system in Fiji, building on the experience gained from their successful projects in Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uncrd.or.jp/content/documents/RT4_01_Fiji.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Fijian Government approved the Environment Management [Waste Disposal and Recycling][Amendment] Regulations 2011, and the Environment Management [Container Deposit] Regulations 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.abc.us.org/index.php/apjee/article/download/724/pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulations provide the legal framework for the introduction of a container deposit and refund system, allowing beverage producers and importers to adjust pricing and accommodate deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fijisun.com.fj/2011/09/29/cabinet-approves-waste-management-laws/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulations will also allow the Department of Environment to register and establish the Managing Agency that will administer Fiji's container deposit system, and establish a revolving fund account to receive all deposits paid by producers for all beverages sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fbc.com.fj/fiji/174/cabinet-approves-amendments-to-laws|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No further details are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4943:cabinet-approves-environment-management-waste-disposal-and-recycling-amendment-regulations-2011&amp;catid=49:cabinet-releases&amp;Itemid=166 |title=Cabinet Approves Environment Management (Waste Disposal And Recycling) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 |date=29 September 2011 |publisher=Fijian Government |accessdate=2 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311150347/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4943%3Acabinet-approves-environment-management-waste-disposal-and-recycling-amendment-regulations-2011&amp;catid=49%3Acabinet-releases&amp;Itemid=166 |archivedate=11 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
Deposits were introduced on aluminum cans in 1996, on PET bottles in 2008, and on glass bottles in 2012. Almost all soft drinks are covered by the program, in addition to water, beer, cider, long drinks, sport drinks, juice, and liquor/spirits/wine sold by Alko. Milk is exempt. The system is administered by Suomen palautuspakkaus Oy (abbr. Palpa), which is a private consortium of beverage importers and manufacturers. In 2016, aluminum cans were recovered at a rate of 96%, PET bottles 92%, and one-way glass 88%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.palpa.fi/news/horeca/return-rates-of-palpa-s-deposit-packages-in-2016/?Nav=ajankohtaista&amp;type=Return+rates+of+Palpa%27s+deposit+packages+in+2016|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposit values for these containers are as follows&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview (2016)|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Plastic 0.5L-1L: €0.20
* Plastic &gt;1L: €0.40
* Metal: €0.15
* Glass: €0.10

The scheme is, in technical sense, voluntary and Palpa does not hold a legal monopoly for container deposits systems. However, it is the only such system in operation. Those beverage containers that do not belong to a container deposit system are levied an excise tax of €0.51/L, regardless of the container size.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2004/20041037 Laki eräiden juomapakkausten valmisteverosta (1037/2004)].

===Germany===
[[Image:Aldi-Pfandrückgabeautomat.JPG|thumb|[[Reverse vending machine]] in an [[Aldi]] supermarket in Germany.]]
In [[Germany]] container deposit legislation, known as ''Einwegpfand'' (single-use deposit), was passed in 2002, and was implemented on 1 January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccr-clearing.de/en/about-deposit-clearing|title=About deposit clearing: The German deposit system|last=|first=|date=|website=CCR Clearing Reverse Logistics Group|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its implementation was fought by [[lobby group]]s of German bottling industry and [[retailer]]s. This fight also included [[Trial (law)|trials]] at the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany]] and the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]], but all trials were won by the German federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rk20021227_1bvr235102a.html "Ruling of the Constitutional Court of Germany"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928194845/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rk20021227_1bvr235102a.html |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposit legislation covers plastic, aluminum, and glass containers for water, beer, mixed drinks containing beer, carbonated/non-carbonated soft drinks, and mixed alcoholic drinks. Excluded from the program are containers for fruit and vegetable juice, milk products, wine, spirits, liquors, and certain dietary drinks. Also excluded are containers smaller than 100mL and larger than 3L. At any given time, an estimated 2&amp;nbsp;billion [[beer bottle]]s are in circulation in Germany, each of which sees an average of 36 reuses.&lt;ref name=DieWelt&gt;{{cite news |last=Gassmann |first=Michael |date=April 9, 2014 |title=Der Wahnsinn, wenn Sie in München Flens trinken |url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article126732784/Der-Wahnsinn-wenn-Sie-in-Muenchen-Flens-trinken.html |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |language=de |trans-title=The Madness of drinking Flens in Munich |access-date=October 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2016, the standard deposit for all single-use containers (cans, single-use glass and plastic bottles) 0.1L-3L in volume is [[Euro|€]]0.25. Retailers are only obliged to take back the material fractions that they sell. 

The deposit for refillable bottles is not defined by law. The usual rates are locally €0.02 for some wine bottles, €0.08 for beer bottles up to 0.5&amp;nbsp;L, and €0.15 for beer bottles with [[flip-top]] closures, beer bottles over 0.5&amp;nbsp;L and other bottles (mostly water and soft-drinks, lesser fruit drinks, milk, cream, yoghurt). Some bottles have an even higher deposit. [[Bottle crate]]s have a deposit of €1.50. Shops only accept bottles of sold vendors and sizes.
[[File:German plastic bottle with sign .jpg|thumb|German bottle with sign ]]
Germany's collection system is 80% automated and 20% manual. Most supermarkets in Germany have a [[reverse vending machine]] that is designed to be used by customers and which scans "Pfand" returns and prints a receipt for the total value of the refund which can be exchanged for cash or put towards the cost of future purchases. 

Supermarkets near the Danish border have established a scheme, where Scandinavian residents are exempt from "Pfand", by signing an "Export declaration" and providing that cans are exported within 24 hours and the contents are not consumed within Germany.

===Hungary===
In [[Hungary]], [[beer]], [[wine]] and standardized [[liquor]] bottles carry a deposit on them, which was liberalized in the recent past. Beer bottles have 25&amp;nbsp;[[Hungarian Forint|forints]] on them, but for wine glasses and for liquor bottles, the sum is decided by the trader, which people can exploit by buying a drink in a certain retailer and bringing the bottle back to its rival who have a bigger deposit on it. PET bottles and metal beverage containers are taken back only by some super- and [[hypermarkets]], such as [[Lidl]], [[Auchan]], [[Tesco]], [[Spar (retailer)|Interspar]]. They all use [[reverse vending machine]]s to collect them: for bottles and in most places for the PET bottles they use a Wincor-Nixdorf or a Tomra machine, while [[beverage can|ALU cans]] are collected by the Hungarian ALU-press machine. Its advantage is that it accepts flattened or pressed cans as well, and it crushes them with a pressing machine, thus improving the storage capacity of the machine. The containers' prices - 2&amp;nbsp;forints/ALU can and 1&amp;nbsp;forint/PET bottle - do not widely motivate people to revend these containers.

===Iceland===
[[Iceland]] has had a deposit system on a national scale for a wide range of containers (plastic, aluminum, and glass) since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endurvinnslan.is/english/|title=Endurvinnslan - English|author=Nethönnun ehf.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All ready-to-drink beverages, wine, and liquor are included in the program. Milk, milk products, and juice extracts are excluded. The deposit is the same for all bottles and cans, [[Icelandic Krona|ISK]] 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endurvinnslan.is/english/|title=Deposit System|last=Endurvinnslan hf. (Recycling Ltd)|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The recycling rate per product is approximately 90% aluminum, 87% PET, and 83% glass.

===Israel===
In Israel, there is a 0.30-[[Israeli new shekel|shekel&amp;nbsp;(₪)]] deposit on beverage containers over 100ml and under 5L, except for dairy products. The system is operated by the ELA Recycling Corporation, a private non-profit organization owned by Israel's beverage manufacturers. Businesses are required to accept bottles if they sold them, or if they are over 28 square meters and sell beverages from the same manufacturer or importer. Businesses are not required to accept more than 50 bottles per customer per day. The deposit was initially ₪0.25, but was raised shortly after the ₪0.05 coin was discontinued.

In 2015, the system achieved a total return rate of 77%.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Most 500&amp;nbsp;mL beer bottles (local brands such as Goldstar and Maccabee plus certain imported ones like Carlsberg and Tuborg) have a deposit of ₪1.20, and are willingly accepted even by smaller businesses (plastic water bottles, glass wine bottles and soda cans are mostly accepted by larger supermarket chains, some of which possess [[reverse vending machines]]).

===Japan===
The container deposit legislation, as a monetary approach to the garbage/recycling problem, has never caught on in [[Japan]]. However, under increasingly ever stricter sorting rules announced by each town or city, garbage is meticuously sorted into kitchen garbage, newspapers/books, metal cans (washed)/plastic bottles (rinsed), garden weeds, etc. in each neighborhood for pickkup by collection cars, usually on different days notified by the local government. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpninfo.com/9826|title=A Guide to Trash and Garbage Disposal in Japan – Japan Info|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Lithuania===

Lithuania implemented container deposit legislation for single-use cans and bottles in February 2016. Lithuania's program is comprehensive and charges a deposit on nearly all types of beverage containers, including those made of plastic, metal, and glass 0.1L to 3L. The deposit is applicable to beer and beer cocktails; cider and other fermented beverages; mixed alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages; all types of water; juice and nectars (sold in glass, plastic, and metal packaging); and fruit wines and wine-product cocktails sold in plastic and metal packaging. Milk, wine, and spirits are exempt. The deposit is the same for all containers and is €0.10 per bottle/can, and most collection is done using reverse vending machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grazintiverta.lt/en/for-business/about-the-system/#|title=Deposit|last=Užstato Sistemos Administratorius|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lithuania's deposit return system is operated by Užstato Sistemos Administratorius (USAD). Container return rates for plastic bottles were 34% before the deposit scheme, 74.3% at end of 2016, 91.9% at end of 2017, and 93% in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/recycling-lithuania-deposit-system-exceeds-all-expectations/45003/|title=Recycling: Lithuania deposit system exceeds all expectations|website=Open Access Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foodbev.com/news/vending-in-reverse-the-industry-is-leading-on-returnable-plastics/|title=Vending in reverse: the industry is leading on returnable plastics|website=Foodbev Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{See also|Recycling in the Netherlands}}
Under the current deposit-return scheme, large [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) bottles greater than 0.5L are subject to a [[Euro|€]]0.25 deposit, but only those for soft drinks and water. All other beverage types, such as medical drinks, wine, spirits, etc., are excluded. The system, which is operated by Stichting Retourverpakkingen NL, is mostly automated collection (89%) with only 11% of returns being done manually.  Beer bottles carry a €0.10 deposit, and beer crates €1.50.

In 2014, the Netherlands' deposit system recovered 95% of the containers covered by the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview (2016)|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] had no container-deposit legislation until 2008 when the [[Waste Minimisation Act 2008]] passed into law. The Act has provision for [[product stewardship]] of which container-deposit legislation is the most familiar type. {{As of|2010}} there is no widespread deposits available on containers with some beer bottles being a notable exception.

===Norway===
[[Image:Container deposit machine.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Tomra]] reverse vending machine in [[Hammerfest]], Norway]]
Automated recycling of bottles has been in use since the 1970s. Aluminum and steel beverage cans had a 5,60 kr surtax in [[Norway]] up until the end of the 20th century. In 1999, a container deposit legislation was passed, which also abolished this regulation. Today, these are the following container deposits in Norway:
* Cans, glass and plastic bottles up to 0.5&amp;nbsp;L: 2.00&amp;nbsp;[[Norwegian krone|krone]]
* Cans, glass and plastic bottles over 0.5&amp;nbsp;L: 3&amp;nbsp;kr
* Bottle crates are also reverse vended.

In 2018 the rates were increased to 2 NOK (formerly 1 NOK) and 3 NOK (previously 2.50 NOK) due to inflation and the discontinuation of the 50-øre coin.

[http://infinitum.no Infinitum AS] (formerly Norsk Resirk A/S) is responsible for operating the national recycling scheme for non-refillable plastic bottles and beverage cans in Norway. The non-profit corporation was founded in 1999 and is owned by companies and organizations in the beverage industry and food trading. 

The Norwegian system works in such a way that the excise tax decreases as the returns increases, meaning that for example that 90 per cent returns for cans translates into a 90 per cent discount on the excise tax. This again allows drink products to be sold at lower prices.

In 2014, 95.4% of PET bottles and 96.6% of all drink cans in Norway were returned under the scheme. 

Deposits on drink containers have a long history in Norway, starting with deposits on beer bottles in 1902. The deposit back then was 0.06 kr (3.30 kr in 2006 currency value).
This deposit arrangement was later expanded to include soft drink bottles.

Up until 1 January 2001, the [[Vinmonopolet]] government wine and spirits monopoly chain had deposits on products made by the company itself, this did not include imported products.

All sellers of deposit marked drinking containers are required by law to accept returns of empty containers for cash. As of 2016, drink containers can be returned and deposits retrieved at over 15,000 establishments in Norway. The collection system is 95% automated (using reverse vending machines) and only 5% manual. Most reverse vending machines in Norway are manufactured by [[Tomra|Tomra Systems ASA]].

===Sweden===
[[Image:Pant 50 öre.jpg|thumb|200px|Deposit symbol of the old Swedish 50&amp;nbsp;öre 33-cl [[aluminium]] can.]]
In [[Sweden]], there are deposits on nearly all ready-to-serve beverages, including beer, soft drinks, cider, and bottled water. Dairy products, vegetable juice, fruit juice, and berry drinks are excluded from the program. The deposit values are as follows: 
* Metal: [[Swedish Krona|SEK]] 1
* Plastic &lt; 1l: SEK 1
* Plastic &gt; 1l: SEK 2
* Glass 33 cl: SEK 0,60, an empty red bottle crate for 20 bottles have a SEK 22,40 deposit. 
* Glass 50 cl: SEK 0,90, an empty blue bottle crate for 15 bottles have a SEK 28,00 deposit. 
AB Svenska Returpack ([http://pantamera.nu/om-oss/returpack-in-english/ Pantamera]) is responsible for the deposit system for aluminium cans and PET bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fakta om Returpack |publisher=AB Svenska Returpack |url=http://www.returpack.se/flash.php?pageId=106 |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830063036/http://www.returpack.se/flash.php?pageId=106 |archivedate=2009-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aluminum cans have had a deposit since 1984, and PET bottles since 1994.

Until 1998, the hard alcohol and wine bottles sold at [[Systembolaget]] — the government owned alcohol retail monopoly — had a deposit as well, but due to the deregulation of the Systembolaget's suppliers, the former sole supplier [[V&amp;S Group]] dropped the deposit on their bottles due to the restricted bottle shapes giving V&amp;S a disadvantage compared to the competitors. The bottles could be returned and deposit refunded until early 1999 at Systembolaget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sista chansen att panta vin- och spritflaskor|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/telegram/0,1082,1269668_INR_p_,00.html|date=1999-02-21|accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation regarding container deposit systems was updated so that from January 1, 2006, containers from other plastics and metals, e.g., steel cans, can be included in the deposit systems.&lt;ref name="sr-steelcans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.returpack.se/download/pdf/bakgrundsfakta.pdf|title=Fakta om Returpack|publisher=AB Svenska Returpack|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919154813/http://www.returpack.se/download/pdf/bakgrundsfakta.pdf|archivedate=September 19, 2007|accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svensk författningssamling SFS 2005:220 |publisher=[[Parliament of Sweden]] |url=http://62.95.69.3/SFSdoc/05/050220.PDF |date=2005-04-14 |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011824/http://62.95.69.3/SFSdoc/05/050220.PDF |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law also makes it illegal in Sweden to sell consumption-ready beverages in containers that are not part of an authorized Swedish container deposit system, with the exception of beverages that mainly consist of dairy products or vegetable, fruit, or berry juice. However, private importation from (mainly Eastern European) countries without deposit occurs by vendors that thus compete with a somewhat lower customer price. The recycling of these contraband cans has not been seen as a problem, but Returpack made a campaign in 2010 offering 0.10 [[Swedish krona|krona]] for each imported can (without deposit) to the benefit of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], retrieving 17 million cans. In 2011, a similar campaign was repeated, retrieving almost 18 million cans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.returpack.se|title=Välkommen till Pantamera|work=Pantamera}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Non-deposit glass containers are collected in large glass garbage bins, for clear or coloured glass, placed centrally in most urban areas.

The 1.5&amp;nbsp;L refillable PET bottle with a deposit of 4.00&amp;nbsp;kr has been discontinued, and has been replaced by the 1.5&amp;nbsp;L non-refillable PET bottle. The last day for returning bottles made by [[Spendrups]] for deposit was 30 June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Viktig information angående 4:- pant för hårda retur-PET flaskor Sverige |publisher=Sveriges Bryggerier |date=July 2007 |url=http://www.sverigesbryggerier.se/pressrum/enskilda-nyheter-2007/0707-pressmed%20pant%20for%20harda%20retur-pet.pdf |format=PDF |language=Swedish |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320014134/http://www.sverigesbryggerier.se/pressrum/enskilda-nyheter-2007/0707-pressmed%20pant%20for%20harda%20retur-pet.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last day for bottles made by [[Coca-Cola]] Sweden was 30 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pant upphör 30 juni 2008 |publisher=Sveriges Bryggerier |url=http://www.sverigesbryggerier.se/emballage/pant%204%20kr.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423223055/http://www.sverigesbryggerier.se/emballage/pant%204%20kr.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2008-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Sweden is one of the leading countries in recycling of beverage containters, Returpack uses TV commercials to promote more recycling. Commercials have been made with well-known melodies sung, like "[[Guantanamera]]" and "Pata pata"—sounding like Returpack's slogan "panta mera" (i.e., "recycle more").

In 2016, the overal recycling rate was 84.9% for both aluminum cans and PET bottles, which translates to 177 packages per person in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pantamera.nu/om-oss/returpack-in-english/about-returpack/|title=About Returpack|last=Pantamera|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
In [[Switzerland]], there is a government ruling that 75% of containers must be returned, otherwise a deposit system may be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/814_621/index.html|title=SR 814.621 Verordnung vom 5. Juli 2000 über Getränkeverpackungen (VGV)|author=Bundeskanzlei - P|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Until the turn of the 21st century, most British bottled beer was sold (whether in off-licences or pubs) in standard quart, pint, half-pint or third-pint (nip) [[beer bottle|bottles]], although some brewers preferred their own distinctive designs. The standard deposit was 7[[Penny (British decimal coin)|pence (p)]] for a pint bottle and 5p for a half-pint. However, in the absence of legislation, and given the switch from pub to supermarket sales, and from Imperial to metric measures, the industry has now entirely abandoned refillable bottles.

Beer casks sold for the home or party consumption of draught beer are usually also loaned out against a deposit which may run to several tens of pounds.

====England ====

In England, in January 2017, ministers were reported to be considering a 10p or 20p refundable deposit on plastic bottles and containers after Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas had voiced her support of such a scheme at the end of 2016. As of February 2017, the idea of a plastic bottle levy was unlikely as the government rejected the deposit scheme proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ciwm-journal.co.uk/deposit-return-scheme-plastic-bottles-unlikely/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, the UK government announced plans to introduce a deposit return scheme in England for drinks containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43563164|title=Drinks bottles and can deposit return scheme proposed|work=BBC News|date=28 March 2018|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland ====

As of June 2015, Northern Ireland had been considering a drinks deposit scheme, following the publication of a feasibility study for a deposit return scheme for drinks containers in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ciwm-journal.co.uk/northern-ireland-considers-drinks-deposit-scheme/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has yet to implement such a scheme.

==== Scotland ====

In Scotland, some Barr products in 750&amp;nbsp;mL glass bottles, had a 30p container deposit although this was discontinued in August 2015. Some Tesco stores have reverse vending machines which pay ½p per aluminium can (equivalent value in Tesco Clubcard Points). Furthermore, the landmark Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 passed by the Scottish Parliament contains within it powers for Scottish ministers to implement a national scheme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/12/part/5/crossheading/deposit-and-return{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2017, a Holyrood motion supporting the idea of a small deposit on all drinks containers was signed by 66 MSPs, including member from every party. In May 2015, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland (APRS) published Scottish polling which revealed overwhelming support for deposit-return. The figures showed that 78.8% of those who expressed a view supported this approach for Scotland, while just 8.5% opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haveyougotthebottle.org.uk/campaign-news/new-campaign-launched-deposit-return-system-scotland/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several companies, most notably large drinks corporations like Coca-Cola, are known to have lobbied against the introduction of a national deposit scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theferret.scot/industry-battle-block-drinks-deposit/|title=Industry’s battle to block drinks deposit scheme|date=3 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/15/plastic-bottle-tax-unlikely-government-rejects-deposit-scheme/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaked documents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4157956/Coca-Cola-plot-kill-bottle-deposits.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reveal that in Europe, Coca Cola had identified deposit programs as a threat and they were planning to fight back. But in February 2017, the drinks company unexpectedly announced its support for a deposit-return program in Scotland, and in a statement to the Independent, Coca-Cola UK stated: "We have embarked on a major review of our sustainable packaging strategy to understand what role we can play in unlocking the full potential of a circular economy in Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/coca-cola-recycling-scotland-scottish-drinks-bottle-return-scheme-u-turn-a7592971.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 5, 2017, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that a deposit-system would be implemented as a means to tackle the rising tide of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/nicola-sturgeon-announces-can-and-bottle-deposit-return-scheme-1-4551671|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No date has been set for implementation at this time. In the days of refillable milk bottles, such bottles were deposit-free.

====Wales====
As of March 2018, Welsh ministers are working on a plan to introduce a deposit return scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-43567768|title=Bottle deposit scheme: Welsh ministers 'already working' on plan|date=28 March 2018|accessdate=28 March 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main article|Container deposit legislation in the United States}}
The [[United States]] container-deposit laws are popularly called "bottle bills" after the [[Oregon Bottle Bill]], which was the first U.S. state to pass container deposit legislation in 1971.

Efforts to pass container deposit legislation in the 39 states that do not have them are often politically contentious.  The U.S. beverage container industry—including both the bottlers of water, soda, [[beer]], and the [[Corporation|corporate]] owners of grocery stores and convenience stores—often spends large amounts of money lobbying against the introduction of both new and amended beverage container deposit legislation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Because of this, a new bottle bill has not been passed since 2005, and Delaware repealed its law in 2010 in favour of a non-refundable USD $0.04 tax per beverage container sold (Universal Recycling Law).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/news/articles/2010/DE-5-17-DEReplacesBottleDeposits.htm|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaware's bottle bill was introduced in 1982 and had charged a $0.05 deposit on all beverage container (except aluminum) under 2 quarts. 

There are currently 10 states that have container deposit laws: 
* California: Enacted in 1981 and operated by CalRecycle, California's bottle bill charges a USD$0.05 refundable deposit on containers less than 24 fl. oz, and USD$0.10 for containers 24 fl. oz or greater.  The deposit is applicable to plastic, aluminum, bimetal, and glass containers, including beer, malt, wine and distilled spirits, and all non-alcoholic beverages. Milk, 100% fruit juice ≥46 oz., vegetable juice ≥16 oz, and refillables are excluded. The total return rate in 2015 was 81%.
* Connecticut: Connecticut's bottle bill was introduced in 1980, but was expanded in 2009 to include bottled water. The program now includes beer, malt, carbonated soft drinks, and noncarbonated beverages in plastic, metal, or glass containers &lt;3L. Juices and HDPE containers are exempt from the deposit. The deposit is the same for all container types and is USD$0.05. In 2015, the total return rate was 50% (does not include 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; quarter). Before water bottles were added to the deposit system, redemption rates were higher (65-70% range). 
* Hawaii: Hawaii's bottle bill has been in place since 2005 and is government-operated. A refundable deposit of USD$0.05 is charged on all plastic (PET, HDPE), metal, bi-metal, and glass beverage containers 2L or less, except for milk and dairy products. In 2015, the system achieved a total return rate of 68%
* Iowa: Introduced in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Evan (June 9, 1985). "Handling Called Messy: Iowa Cleaner; Bottle Law Praised". ''Omaha World-Herald'' (Omaha, Nebraska).&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa's bottle bill covers beer, carbonated soft drinks, mineral water, wine coolers, wine and liquor. All types of containers are accepted, including sealed glass, plastic, or metal bottles, can, jars or cartons. Fruit and vegetable juices, fruit drinks, and milk and milk products are exempt. The deposit is uniform across beverage categories and is currently USD$0.05. It is estimated that the return rate is around 86%.
* Maine: Established in 1978 after a [[ballot initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;Merry, George B. (January 27, 1981). "New 'bottle bills' face crucial test in months ahead". ''The Christian Science Monitor''. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Maine's bottle bill charges a USD$0.05 deposit on plastic, metal, and glass containers and USD$0.015 for most liquor and wine bottles. All beverages in containers 4L or less are included, with the exception of dairy products and unprocessed cider. According to testimony provided by a beverage industry lobbyist to the state, the 2015 return rate was 90%. 
* Massachusetts: The state's bottle bill was effective as of January 17, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Merry, George B. (November 18, 1981). "Bay State places 'nickel-and-dime' bounty on all beverage containers". ''The Christian Science Monitor''. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It applies to beer, malt, carbonated soft drinks, and mineral water in plastic, metal, bimetal, or glass containers (or any combination of those materials). The deposit levied is USD$0.05. In 2015, 57% of beverage containers covered by the bottle bill were returned for a refund of the deposit.
* Michigan: Implemented in 1978, Michigan's bottle bill charges a USD$0.10 deposit on plastic, metal, glass, and paper containers less than 1 gallon. The types of beverages included in the bill include beer/ale, soft drinks, carbonated and mineral water, wine coolers, canned cocktails, and malt drinks. Milk, juice, tea, sport drinks, and foil pouches are excluded.  In 2014, the total return rate was 94%.
* New York: New York's bottle bill has been in place since January 12, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;"New York stores carry the (empty) can". ''Financial Times'' (London, England). September 17, 1983. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; New York charges a USD$0.05 deposit on plastic, metal, and glass containers 3.78L or less. The deposit is applicable to carbonated soft drinks, soda water, energy drinks, juices (anything &lt;100% juice), beer and other malt beverages, mineral water, wine products, water that does not contain sugar, including flavored or nutritionally enhanced water. Excluded from the program are milk products, wine and liquors, tea, sports drinks, juice that is not 100%, drink boxes, and water containing sugar. In 2015, the system achieved a return rate of 65%. 
* Oregon: Oregon's bottle bill, introduced in 1972, is the oldest in the U.S. It covers plastic, metal, and glass beverage containers containing water/flavoured water, beer/malt, soda water, mineral water, teas, juice, and carbonated soft drinks 3L or less. Wine and liquor, as well as milk and milk substitutes are excluded from the program. Up until April 2017, the deposit has been USD$0.05 per container. It is now $0.10 per container. In 2014, Oregon's bottle bill had a 68% return rate. This is expected to increase as a result of the increase in the deposit level. 
* Vermont: Implemented in 1973, Vermont's bottle bill charges a USD$0.05 deposit on plastic, metal, and glass beer, wine coolers and other malt beverages, soft drinks and other carbonated beverage containers. Most liquor and spirits bottles are charged a deposit of USD$0.15. Wine and hard cider, water, milk, juices, sports drinks, and other non-carbonated beverages are excluded from the bottle deposit law. In 2012-2013, the system achieved a return rate of 75%. 

States that formerly have can deposit regulation:
* [[Delaware]] (5¢), introduced 1982, abolished 2009, replaced by Universal Recycling law.

A '''continuous cooling transformation''' ('''CCT''') phase diagram is often used when heat treating steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Transformation diagrams (CCT &amp; TTT) | url = http://www.matter.org.uk/steelmatter/metallurgy/7_1_2.html
 | accessdate =2008-04-17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These diagrams are used to represent which types of phase changes will occur in a material as it is cooled at different rates. These diagrams are often more useful than [[Isothermal transformation|time-temperature-transformation]] diagrams because it is more convenient to cool materials at a certain rate than to cool quickly and hold at a certain temperature.

==Types of Continuous Cooling Diagrams==

There are two types of continuous cooling diagrams drawn for practical purposes

* Type 1: This is the plot of transformation start, a specific transformation fraction and transformation finish temperature for all products against transformation time on each cooling curve.
* Type 2: This is the plot of transformation start, a specific transformation fraction and transformation finish temperature for all products against cooling rate or bar diameter of the specimen for each type of cooling medium.

[[File:Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin (2018-05-18) 01.jpg|thumb|right|Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] with German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] in [[Sochi]], Russia, 18 May 2018]]
'''Courtesy''' (from the word ''courteis'', from the [[12th century]]) is [[gentleness|gentle]] [[politeness]] and [[court (royal)|courtly]] [[manners]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, the behaviour expected of the nobility was compiled in [[courtesy book]]s.

==History==
The apex of European courtly culture was reached in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Baroque period]] (i.e. roughly the four centuries spanning 1300–1700). 
The oldest courtesy books date to the 13th century, but they become an influential genre in the 16th, the most influential of them being ''[[The Book of the Courtier|Il Cortegiano]]'' (1508), which not only covered basic [[etiquette]] and [[decorum]] but also provided models of sophisticated [[conversation]] and [[intellectual]] skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQINrHtwNU0C&amp;pg=PA249 |title=The Cambridge guide to literature in English |author=Dominic Head |chapter=courtesy book}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The royal courts of Europe did, of course, persist well into the 18th century (and to some limited extent to the present day), but in the 18th century, the  notion of ''courtesy'' was replaced by that of ''[[galant|gallantry]]'', referring to an ideal emphasizing the display of affected [[Sensitive style|sensitivity]] in direct contrast with the ideals of self-denial and dignified seriousness that were the Baroque norm. 
During the late medieval and early modern period, the bourgeois class tended to emulate the courtly etiquette of their betters. This changed in the 19th century, after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the emergence of a [[middle class]] with its own set of [[bourgeois]] etiquette, which in turn was mocked in the classist theory of [[Marxism]] as ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]''.

The analogue concept in the court culture of [[medieval India]] was known by the [[Sanskrit]] term ''dakṣiṇya'', literally meaning "right-handedness", but as in English ''dexterity'' having a figurative meaning of "apt, clever, appropriate", glossed as  "[[kindness]] and consideration expressed in a [[sophistication|sophisticated]] and [[elegance|elegant]] way".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BKW65Yt65wC&amp;pg=PA135 |title=Courtly culture and political life in early medieval India |author=Daud Ali |chapter=The spirit of courtesy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9972">'''Cruel and unusual punishment''' is a phrase describing [[punishment]] that is considered unacceptable due to the [[suffering]], [[pain]], or [[humiliation]] it inflicts on the person subjected to it.

There are generally tests that can serve as a guide to what cruel and unusual punishment is according to various legal textbooks in accordance with the law.  These are:
#overall acceptance in society,
#severity (the punishment fits the crime), and
#if the punishment is arbitrary.

==History==
These exact words were first used in the [[England|English]] [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown.... The Bill of Rights (1689) then settled the primacy of Parliament over the monarch’s prerogatives, providing for the regular meeting of Parliament, free elections to the Commons, free speech in parliamentary debates, and some basic human rights, most famously freedom from ‘cruel or unusual punishment’.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later also adopted in the United States by the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (ratified 1791) and in the [[British Leeward Islands]] (1798). Very similar words, "No one shall be subjected to [[torture]] or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment", appear in Article 5 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 10, 1948. The right under a different formulation is also found in [[Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 3]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (1950) and in Article 7 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (1966). The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] (1982) also contains this fundamental right in [[Section Twelve of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 12]] and it is to be found in Article 4 (quoting the European Convention verbatim) of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] (2000). It is also found in Article 16 of the [[Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] (1984), and in Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Poland]] (1997).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Republic of Poland/Chapter 2|Constitution of Poland, Chapter 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution of the [[Marshall Islands]], in the sixth section of its [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] (Article 2), prohibits "cruel and unusual punishment", which it defines as: the [[death penalty]]; torture; "inhuman and degrading treatment"; and "[[excessive fines]] or deprivations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cotmi363/ Constitution of the Marshall Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102080552/http://www.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cotmi363/ |date=2011-01-02 }}, art.II, s.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] states that "cruel and unusual punishments [shall not be] inflicted." The general principles the [[United States Supreme Court]] relied on to decide whether or not a particular punishment was cruel and unusual were determined by [[William J. Brennan|Justice William Brennan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Palmer, Jr. |first= Louis J. |title= Organ Transplants from Executed Prisoners: An Argument for the Creation of Death Sentence Organ Removal Statutes |page= 80 |publisher= Mcfarland &amp; Co Inc Pub |date=July 1999 |isbn= 978-0-7864-0673-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CCZ2SlSBRbQC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=cruel+and+unusual+punishment+less+severe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p5tD3Dg1Ij&amp;sig=7FT7JEB55ZpJZWs7RmLMYWQS6Qo&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I6AHT5z1IcStsgbq7K2DDw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cruel%20and%20unusual%20punishment%20less%20severe&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|408|238|1972}}, Justice Brennan wrote, "There are, then, four principles by which we may determine whether a particular punishment is 'cruel and unusual'."
* The "essential predicate" is "that a punishment must not by its severity be degrading to human dignity," especially [[torture]].
* "A severe punishment that is obviously inflicted in wholly arbitrary fashion." (''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' temporarily suspended [[capital punishment]] for this reason.)
* "A severe punishment that is clearly and totally rejected throughout society."
* "A severe punishment that is patently unnecessary."

And he added: "The function of these principles, after all, is simply to provide means by which a court can determine whether a challenged punishment comports with human dignity. They are, therefore, interrelated, and, in most cases, it will be their convergence that will justify the conclusion that a punishment is "cruel and unusual." The test, then, will ordinarily be a cumulative one: if a punishment is unusually severe, if there is a strong probability that it is inflicted arbitrarily, if it is substantially rejected by contemporary society, and if there is no reason to believe that it serves any penal purpose more effectively than some less severe punishment, then the continued infliction of that punishment violates the command of the Clause that the State may not inflict inhuman and uncivilized punishments upon those convicted of crimes."

Continuing, he wrote that he expected that no state would pass a law obviously violating any one of these principles, so court decisions regarding the Eighth Amendment would involve a "cumulative" analysis of the implication of each of the four principles. In this way the United States Supreme Court "set the standard that a punishment would be cruel and unusual [,if] it was too severe for the crime, [if] it was arbitrary, if it offended society's sense of justice, or if it was not more effective than a less severe penalty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationaljusticeproject.org/seminal.cfm |author=the International Justice Project |title=Seminal Cases - Brief Bank &amp; General Resources - the International Justice Project |accessdate=7 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802122705/http://www.internationaljusticeproject.org/seminal.cfm |archivedate=2 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital punishment==

There is great discussion as to whether [[capital punishment]] is cruel and unusual. Common arguments are that capital punishment is more expensive when factoring in [[appeal]]s versus [[life in prison]], and that the government has been wrong before on death penalty cases (therefore, the government could be wrong again, and the government ought not have the authority to end a life). These two arguments alone may or may not qualify under the tests the government puts forth, which could also be considered arbitrary itself, especially if society is not informed enough on these considerable facts. For most of recorded history, capital punishments were often deliberately cruel and painful. Severe historical execution methods include the [[breaking wheel]], [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], [[mazzatello]], [[boiling to death]], [[death by burning]], [[execution by drowning]], death by starvation, [[immurement]], [[flaying]], [[disembowelment]], [[crucifixion]], [[impalement]], [[Crushing (execution)|crushing]], [[execution by elephant]], [[keelhauling]], [[stoning]], [[dismemberment]], [[sawing (torture)|sawing]], [[scaphism]], [[slow slicing]], [[blood eagle]], [[bamboo torture]] and [[necklacing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950826,00.html|title=The Death Penalty :Revenge Is the Mother of Invention|date=24 January 1983|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Michael Portillo]] on the show ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' argued that in ensuring an execution is not of a cruel and unusual nature, the following criteria must be met:
* Death should be quick and painless to prevent suffering for the person being executed.
* [[Medical education]] should be provided to the [[executioner]] to prevent suffering caused by error.
* The death should not be gory (to prevent suffering for those carrying out the execution).
* No co-operation should be required from the person being executed, to prevent inaction, distress, and/or suffering caused by the prisoner being required to participate in his own execution.

The show argued that [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] appears to meet the criteria, by way of applying a combination of the gases [[argon]] and [[nitrogen]], as the person being executed would not feel any physical pain but would experience a euphoric state. It was further argued that these gases could be applied cheaply and efficiently by restraining the prisoner by way of [[physical restraints]] and mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/tx/executions/lethal_injection/|title=BBC - Horizon - How to Kill a Human Being|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''deathtrap''' is a [[literary]] and [[drama]]tic [[plot device]] in which a [[villain]] who has captured the [[hero]] or another sympathetic character attempts to use an elaborate, improbable, and usually sadistic method of [[murder]]ing them.

It is often used as a means to create dramatic tension in the story and to have the villain reveal important information to the hero, confident that the hero will shortly not be able to use it. It may also be a means to show the hero's resourcefulness in escaping, or the writer's ingenuity at devising a last-minute rescue or [[deus ex machina]].

== History ==
This plot device is generally believed to have been popularized by [[Serial film|movie serials]] and 19th-century theatrical [[melodrama]]s. A well-known example is the [[cliché]] of the moustache-twirling villain leaving the heroine tied to railroad tracks. Its use in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film series and [[superhero]] stories is well known.

== Narrative use ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}It is a common criticism that it is unbelievable in story plots to have villains try to kill the heroes in such elaborate ways when they could use simple methods like shooting them. Through the decades, [[comic book]] writers have responded to these complaints by devising ways in which the deathtraps have served other purposes.

For instance, one ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' story by [[Jim Shooter]] had a team of Legionnaires put into a variety of deathtraps and the villains ''wanted'' the heroes to successfully escape. This was because the real purpose of the deathtraps was to have the Legionnaires use a great deal of energy doing so, which the villains then harnessed for their own benefit. Other stories have had villains use deathtraps as a means of testing the heroes or to distract them while the villain attends to other matters. On some occasions, the deathtrap is a machine that "absorbs" the energy from the hero/heroes.

Another rationalization for a deathtrap is when a particular villain simply enjoys leaving his victims some small chance of survival, just for the sake of sport. Such "sporting" villains include [[Riddler|the Riddler]], who has an uncontrollable compulsion to create intellectual challenges for his enemies. Also included in this list is the [[Jigsaw Killer]], who places his victims in life-or-death situations to prove that they appreciate life. [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] and [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] are other villains who simply enjoy the challenge.

On occasion, the villain may employ a slow deathtrap because they enjoy their victim's suffering prior to death, either due to sadistic tendencies or a desire for painful vengeance.

In a similar vein, the villain, often a [[megalomania]]c, may feel that, as a reflection of his own imagined greatness, it would be "beneath him" to murder his enemy like any common criminal, and that his enemy's death should be the worthy spectacle that a successful deathtrap would provide. In contrast, he may feel that his enemy, having provided him with a worthy challenge in their earlier encounters, himself "deserves" such a grandiose death, or that the enmity between the two is so "epic" that it merits no less than such a conclusion.

Conversely, the protagonists' act of falling into such a trap may itself be the reason they are written off and left unattended. The villain, disappointed in such a non-threatening opponent, loses interest, and intentionally leaves some chance of escape for the protagonists to "redeem" themselves. However, the disillusioned villain tends to assume that the chance is minuscule. Despite secretly hoping that the opponent survives and proves worthy of interest, the now-bored villain is invariably shocked when that actually occurs.

If fully serious, the villain may simply be too insane to recognize the impracticality of the situation, although this characterization is rarely seen outside of deliberately parodic characters such as [[Dr. Evil]].

A more recent reason is villains do it simply because it is considered 'tradition' or 'rule' of being a supervillain to place a hero in a deathtrap and then leave them to their fate. This even goes as far as heroes, or other villains, insulting a villain for attempting to avoid using a deathtrap or staying to watch. [[Batmen of All Nations#Club of Villains|El Sombrero]] is one villain who exemplifies this reason.

When a hero's sidekick or loved one is placed in a deathtrap, its purpose is often to distract the hero, occupying time and attention while the villain pursues their evil plan. Less frequently, the villain intends to instill grief and guilt as a means of defeating a hero that cannot be defeated physically. Multiple secondary characters may be placed in deathtraps to offer the hero an agonizing choice, ostensibly forcing the hero to save one victim and leave the other(s) to die.

*''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'': James Bond is shackled spreadeagled to a table and a [[circular saw]] (a [[laser]] in the [[Goldfinger (film)|film]]) is approaching to cut him in half.

**Escape method: Bond bluffs Goldfinger, and persuades him that his replacement "008" also knows about Goldfinger's plans and that Bond's death will immediately summon him to investigate, so Goldfinger elects to not take the chance of another spy coming on the scene to interfere, which he can avoid by holding Bond captive.
*[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]": The unnamed character finds himself bound to a large slab, beneath a bladed pendulum that slowly lowers toward him as it swings, with the intention of slicing through his chest.

* In the ''Dudley Do-Right'' cartoon, villain Snidely Whiplash (a parody of the stereotypical "movie-serial" villain) tied up Nell Fenwick on a table-saw conveyor belt.  The narrator (Paul Frees) noted that, "Fortunately, the belt was in need of oiling, so the trip was a slow one."  In elapsed time, through the course of the story, this actually took several hours.
*The 1960s live action [[television program|television series]] ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' usually had two-part episodes use a bizarre deathtrap as a [[cliffhanger]].

*''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'' always involved improbable deathtraps, usually set by the [[Hooded Claw]].
*Disney's ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'': Ratigan ties up Basil and Dawson in an intricate mousetrap and tells them about his plot to kill the queen. He then leaves to see his scheme unfold, assuming that they will soon be dead.
**Escape method: Basil activates the mousetrap he and Dawson are trapped in early, catching the ball that was meant to crush them, and setting off a chain reaction that interferes with every other aspect of the trap.
*''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'': The plot of the series revolves around the Jigsaw Killer, a dying vigilante who kidnaps his victims and places them in deadly traps to test them, and give them an opportunity to repent from their former lifestyle in which they took their lives for granted, and where they were unappreciative of their life and the lives and well being of others.
*''[[The Snowman (Nesbø novel)|The Snowman]]'': Rakel, [[Harry Hole]]'s beloved, is forced to sit on a fast-melting snowman; when it had melted she would fall down and the razor-sharp wire around her neck would decapitate her.
**Escape Method: Harry arrives on the scene and extricates Rakel in nick of time, at the acceptable price of the wire cutting off one of his fingers.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)]]'': Jack Dawson is chained in a room deep down inside the ship, where he is meant to disappear and be conveniently drowned as the ship sinks, but is rescued by his lover Rose. The entire second half of the film can also be seen as an extended deathtrap situation, where the thousands of people on board find themselves faced with a painful and absurd death, due to their having bought tickets or enlisted as crew on the glamorous ship, the epitome of technical progress and luxury, and now have to either reach the lifeboats and escape or else accept their death. The villain here, in a sense, is the ship and its careless masters.
*''[[Final Destination (franchise)|Final Destination]]'': The plot of the series revolves around several people surviving a catastrophe because one of them had a premonition of it. In doing this the survivors have cheated Death, a malevolent and unseen force that sets up deathtraps to kill off the survivors in the order in which they had originally died.


A simpler variation on the deathtrap is the '''villain speech''', also known as ''[[Monologue#Monologuing|monologuing]]''. The villain, after having captured the hero or another victim, gives a long speech taunting and sneering at his victim, pontificating on how said victim will soon die, and reminiscing over how he tried for so long to get his kill and is now about to reap the reward. Villains may also give away details of their evil plots, on the rationale that the victim will die immediately and the villain often believes their victim deserves to know. This speech, given when the villain could have just killed the victim in a matter of seconds, is invariably used to give another character time to come in and save the victim, or for the victim to escape. In ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (which used the term "monologuing"), [[Mr. Incredible]] and [[Frozone]] attacked villains in the middle of their speeches (Mr. Incredible is seen attacking [[Syndrome (The Incredibles)|Syndrome]] and Frozone is mentioned to have attacked Baron von Ruthless off-camera). In a literary sense, the villain speech is also used as a form of [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]].

Even in relatively realistic stories, villains will often take a moment to say something pithy before finishing off the victim. The antagonist would often leave the victim to die whilst they commit their evil scheme. This is echoed in the film ''[[2001 - A Space Odyssey]]'' when Hal the supercomputer, confident that Dave will soon perish outside the ship, tells him that he is about to take control of the expedition and then sees Dave off with the flat remark: "This conversation can have no meaningful purpose anymore - goodbye!". Dave manages to make his way inside and kill Hal.

== Spoofs ==
The concept of the deathtrap/monologue is featured in many [[satire]]s.

* Deathtraps were spoofed heavily in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] movies, including a replication of [[James Bond]]'s Shark Infested Water deathtrap. It is first introduced as "an easily escapeable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death" with Austin placed on a platform over a pool (which [[Dr. Evil]] calls "the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism"). The trap is escaped by swinging on a grapple of dental floss. As the intended sharks with laserbeams  were unavailable due to the complexities of international law regarding endangered species (much to Dr. Evil's disappointment), ill-tempered [[mutant]] seabass are used instead. As part of the spoof, [[Scott Evil]], Dr. Evil's son, insists that the deathtrap is pointless and that they could simply shoot them with a pistol, which is nearby, and yells at his father for the further incompetence of leaving them alone. Dr Evil responds that not watching the killing but assuming it went well makes perfect sense.
* In the [[sitcom]] ''[[Blackadder]]'', [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Prince Edmund]] is captured by his nemesis, the Hawk, who straps him into a chair which, in sixty seconds, will mutilate him in a variety of ways. Edmund's friends, [[Baldrick]] and [[Lord Percy Percy|Percy]], manage to poison the Hawk and his followers, but while celebrating this unlikely victory, the time runs out, and Edmund suffers a terrible fate. In another episode, Lord Flashheart is confronted by a villain who begins an evil villain speech. However, rather than waiting for him to finish, Flashheart merely shoots him without warning.
* ''[[Curse of Monkey Island]]'' makes fun of this cliché. The villain [[LeChuck]], after capturing [[Guybrush Threepwood]], ''insists'' on telling him his plans before executing him. By this dialogue, interesting background story that connect the games together are given to the player. Guybrush does him the favour to listen, but after a while he is so bored that he refuses to listen any more, even if LeChuck pleads to continue.
* The famous line from ''[[Watchmen]]'' wherein the character Ozymandias takes his time and explains in detail how he will set his plan irrevocably in motion and then, in a deliberate skewering of the monologuing tendencies of supervillains, explains that "[[Nite Owl|Dan]], I'm not a [[Republic Pictures|Republic serial]] villain. I did it thirty-five minutes ago."
* In ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[You Only Move Twice]]", which generally spoofs Bond villain clichés, supervillain/great boss [[Hank Scorpio]] has "Mr. Bont" strapped to a table with a laser à la Goldfinger. Bont manages to escape, only to be tackled by Homer. Scorpio's henchmen promptly shoot Bont.
*Some incarnations of the [[Evil Overlord List]] point out the impracticality of deathtraps. Some examples include making sure the deathtrap has a VERY small estimated time of death or such lines as "Shooting is NOT too good for my enemies."
* Season 5 Episode 8 of the animated classic series ''[[The Flintstones]]'' entitled "[[List of The Flintstones episodes|Dr. Sinister]]" spoofed the James Bond series ("James Bondrock") and featured, among other deathtraps, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Barney Rubble|Barney]] being tied to a slab with a slowly descending pendulum with blade, a la Poe's "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]". The duo escape when Barney holds his tied hands up and the blade slices through his bonds. He then unties himself and frees Fred before the final swing slices the slab in half.

[[Image:Naive realism.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Direct realism argues we perceive the world directly]]

The question of '''direct''' or '''naïve realism''', as opposed to '''indirect''' or '''representational realism''', arises in the [[philosophy of perception]] and [[philosophy of mind|of mind]] out of the debate over the nature of [[Consciousness|conscious]] [[Qualia|experience]];&lt;ref name=lehar&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/consc1/consc1.html The Function of Conscious Experience: An Analogical Paradigm of Perception and Behavior], ''Consciousness and Cognition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ce&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html Naïve Realism in Contemporary Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811172229/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html |date=2012-08-11 }}, ''The Function of Conscious Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by [[neural]] processes in our [[Human brain|brain]]. [[Naïve realism]] is known as ''direct'' realism when developed to counter ''indirect'' or representative realism, also known as epistemological dualism,&lt;ref&gt;Lehar, Steve. [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html Representationalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905185905/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] position that our conscious experience is not of the real world itself but of an [[Mental representation|internal representation]], a miniature [[Virtual reality|virtual-reality]] replica of the world.

Indirect realism is broadly equivalent to the accepted view of [[perception]] in natural science that states that we do not and cannot perceive the external world as it really is but know only our ideas and interpretations of the way the world is.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] (or audition) is the ability to perceive (create ideas of)sound by detecting vibrations. The sound waves of language cannot perceive directly. They are only heard, interpreted and understood because the physical waves were transformed into ideas (Mental representation of sound wages) by our brains.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Representationalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is one of the key assumptions of [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] in [[psychology]]. The representational realist would deny that "first-hand knowledge" is a coherent concept, since knowledge is always via some means. Our ideas of the world are interpretations of sensory input derived from an external world that is real (unlike the standpoint of [[idealism]], which holds that only ideas are real, but mind-independent things are not).

The main alternative to representationalism is '''anti-representationalism''',&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; the view according to which perception is not a process of constructing internal representations.

==History==
[[Aristotle]] was the first to provide a description of direct realism. In ''[[On the Soul]]'' he describes how a see-er is informed of the [[substance theory|object itself]] by way of the [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic form]] carried over the intervening material continuum with which the eye is impressed.&lt;ref name="Bernecker2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=S. |last=Bernecker |year=2008 |title=The Metaphysics of Memory |series=Philosophical Studies Series |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781402082191 |lccn=2008921236 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNk4jvxjVhUC&amp;pg=PA62 |page=62 |quote=The distinction between direct and indirect realism about perception has an interesting history. There was a time when perception was understood to be of things themselves, not of our ideas of things. This is what we find in Aristotle and Aquinas, who maintain that the mind or understanding grasps the form of the material object without the matter. What we perceive directly, on this view, are material objects. This changed in the seventeenth century with Descartes and Locke. who can be read as saying that the primary objects of perception are not things external to the mind but sense-data. Sense-data are the messengers that stand between us and physical objects such as tables and chairs. While indirect realism was the standard view of early modern philosophers, nowadays direct realism is, once again, in fashion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medieval philosophy]], [[direct realism]] was defended by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Bernecker2008"/&gt;

Indirect realism was popular with several [[early modern philosophy|early modern philosophers]], including [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref name=Yolton&gt;John W. Yolton, ''Realism and Appearances: An Essay in Ontology'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]],&lt;ref name=Yolton/&gt; [[G. W. Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Dickerson, ''Kant on Representation and Objectivity'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Berkeley]],&lt;ref name=SEP-PP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/ The Problem of Perception (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]: "Paraphrasing David Hume (1739...; see also Locke 1690, Berkeley 1710, Russell 1912): nothing is ever directly present to the mind in perception except perceptual appearances."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name=SEP-PP/&gt;

Locke categorized qualities as follows:&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Smith, "On Primary and Secondary Qualities", ''Philosophical Review'' (1990), 221–54.&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Primary qualities are qualities which are "explanatorily basic" – which is to say, they can be referred to as the explanation for other qualities or phenomena without requiring explanation themselves – and they are distinct in that our sensory experience of them resembles them in reality.  (For example, one perceives an object as spherical precisely because of the way the atoms of the sphere are arranged.)  Primary qualities cannot be removed by either thought or physical action, and include mass, movement, and, controversially, solidity (although later proponents of the distinction between primary and secondary qualities usually discount solidity).
* Secondary qualities are qualities which one's experience does not directly resemble; for example, when one sees an object as red, the sensation of seeing redness is not produced by some quality of redness in the object, but by the arrangement of atoms on the surface of the object which reflects and absorbs light in a particular way.  Secondary qualities include colour, smell, and taste.

[[Thomas Reid]], a notable member of the [[Scottish common sense realism]] was proponent of direct realism.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Rysiew, ''New Essays on Thomas Reid'', Routledge, 2017, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct realist views have been attributed to [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Della Rocca (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Spinoza'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[empirical realism]] has also been interpreted as a form of direct realism.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Schulting, Jacco Verburgt (eds.), ''Kant's Idealism: New Interpretations of a Controversial Doctrine'', Springer 2010, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Late modern philosophy|Late modern philosophers]], [[J. G. Fichte]] and [[G. W. F. Hegel]] followed Kant in adopting empirical realism.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Breazeale and [[Tom Rockmore]] (eds.), ''Fichte, German Idealism, and Early Romanticism'', Rodopi, 2010, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Rockmore]], ''Before and After Hegel: A Historical Introduction to Hegel's Thought'', Hackett Publishing, 2003, p. xviii: "Hegel follows Kant ... in limiting claims to know to the empirically real. In short, he adopts a view very similar to Kant's empirical realism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottlob Frege]] (in his paper "[[On Sense and Reference|Über Sinn und Bedeutung]]") also subscribed to indirect realism.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Lebens, ''Bertrand Russell and the Nature of Propositions: A History and Defence of the Multiple Relation Theory of Judgement'', Routledge, 2017, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], indirect realism has been defended by [[Edmund Husserl]]&lt;ref&gt;Robin D. Rollinger, ''Husserl's Position in the School of Brentano'', ''Phaenomenologica'' 150, Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1999, p. 224 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref name=SEP-PP/&gt; Direct realism has been defended by [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary. Sep. 1994. "The Dewey Lectures 1994: Sense, Nonsense, and the Senses: An Inquiry into the Powers of the Human Mind." ''The Journal of Philosophy'' '''91'''(9):445–518.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McDowell]],&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, &lt;!--November--&gt;1994, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galen Strawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Galen Strawson, [https://vimeo.com/91346935 "Real Direct Realism"], a lecture recorded 2014 at Marc Sanders Foundation, Vimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John R. Searle]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, ''Seeing Things as They Are: A Theory of Perception'', Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, epistemological dualism has come under sustained attack by other contemporary philosophers, such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (the [[private language argument]]) and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] in his seminal essay "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind". Indirect realism is argued to be problematical because of [[Ryle's regress]] and the [[homunculus argument]]. However, recently reliance on the private language argument and the Homunculus Objection has itself come under attack. It can be argued that those who argue for "inner presence", to use Antti Revonsuo's term,&lt;ref&gt;Revonsuo, Antti (2006) ''Inner Presence:  Consciousness as a Biological Phenomenon,'' Cambridge MA:  MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; are not proposing  a private "referent", with the application of language to it being "private" and thus unshareable, but a ''private'' use of ''public'' language.  There is no doubt that each of us has a private understanding of public language, a notion that has been experimentally supported;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ragnar Rommetveit|Rommetveit, Ragnar]] (1974) ''On Message Structure:  A Framework for the Study of Language and Communication,'' London:  John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; George Steiner refers to our personal use of language as an "idiolect", one particular to ourselves in its detail.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, George (1998), ''After Babel:  Aspects of Language and Translation,'' London &amp; New York:  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The question has to be put how a collective use of language can go on when, not only do we have differing understandings of the words we use, but our sensory registrations differ.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, C. L. (1988) ''Color for Philosophers,'' Indianapolis IN:  Hackett Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against direct realism==

===The argument from illusion===
[[Image:Café wall.svg|250px|thumb|right|Illusion creates a problem for naïve realists as it suggests our senses are fallible, perceiving things that aren't there. In this illusion, the lines are horizontal, despite how they appear.]]
This argument was "first offered in a more or less fully explicit form in [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] ([[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous|1713]])."&lt;ref name=sep&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/ Epistemological Problems of Perception], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as the problem of conflicting appearances (e.g. [[Myles Burnyeat]]'s article ''Conflicting Appearances''). It has been argued that "informed commonsense" indicates that perceptions often depend on organs of perception.&lt;ref name="uor" /&gt; For example, humans would receive visual information very differently if they, like flies, had compound eyes, and may not even be able to imagine how things would appear with entirely different sense organs such as [[infra-red]] detectors or [[acoustic location|echo-location]] devices. Furthermore, perception systems can misrepresent objects even when in full working order, as shown, for example, by [[optical illusion]]s like the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]]. More dramatically, sometimes people perceive things which are not there at all, which can be termed instances of "hallucination" or "perceptual delusion".&lt;ref name=uor&gt;[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/ld/Philos/jmp/Theory%20of%20Knowledge/NaiveRealism.htm Naïve Realism], [[University of Reading]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Illusions are present in nature. [[Rainbows]] are an example of a perceptual delusion. "For, unlike an architectural arch, a rainbow recedes as we approach it, never to be reached."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gregory|Gregory, Richard.]] (2003). [http://www.perceptionweb.com/perception/perc0303/editorial.pdf Delusions.] ''Perception.'' '''32''', pp. 257-261.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[argument from illusion]] allegedly shows the need to posit sense-data as the immediate objects of perception. In cases of illusion or [[hallucination]], the object has qualities that no public physical object in that situation has and so must be distinct from any such object.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Naïve realism may accommodate these facts as they stand by virtue of its very vagueness (or "open-texture"): it is not specific or detailed enough to be refuted by such cases.&lt;ref name=uor/&gt; A more developed direct realist might respond by showing that various cases of misperception, failed perception, and perceptual relativity do not make it necessary to suppose that sense-data exist. When a stick submerged in water looks bent a direct realist is not compelled to say the stick actually is bent but can say that the stick can have more than one appearance: a straight stick can look bent when light reflected from the stick arrives at one's eye in a crooked pattern, but this appearance is not necessarily a sense-datum in the mind. Similar things can be said about the coin which appears circular from one vantage point and oval-shaped from another. Pressing on your eyeball with a finger creates double vision but assuming the existence of two sense-data is unnecessary: the direct realist can say that they have two eyes, each giving them a different view of the world. Usually the eyes are focused in the same direction; but sometimes they are not.

However, this response is presumably based on previously observed data. If one were to be able to observe nothing other than the stick in the water, with no previous information, it would appear that the stick was bent. Visual depth in particular is a set of inferences, not an actual experience of the space between things in a radial direction outward from the observation point.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Alex. (2003). [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~lka/conr.htm The Empirical Description of Conscious Experience], ''The Science and Philosophy of Consciousness.''&lt;/ref&gt; If all [[empirical evidence]] is based upon observation then the entire developed memory and knowledge of every perception and of each sense may be as skewed as the bent stick. Since objects with different qualities are experienced from each of the different perspectives there is no apparent experiential basis for regarding one out of any such set of related perceptual experiences as the one in which the relevant physical object is itself immediately experienced. The most reasonable conclusion is that the experienced object is always distinct from the physical object or at least that there is no way to identify which, if any, of the immediately experienced objects is the physical object itself. Epistemologically it is as though physical objects were never given, whether or not that is in fact the case.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Another potential counter-example involves vivid hallucinations: phantom elephants, for instance, might be interpreted as sense-data. A direct realist response would differentiate hallucination from genuine perception: no perception of elephants is going on, only the different and related mental process of hallucination. However, if there are visual images when we hallucinate it seems reasonable that there are visual images when we see. Similarly if dreaming involves visual and auditory images in our minds it seems reasonable to think there are visual and auditory images, or sense-data, when we are awake and perceiving things. This argument has been challenged in a number of different ways. First it has been questioned whether there must be some object present that actually has the experienced qualities, which would then seemingly have to be something like a sense-datum. Why couldn't it be that the perceiver is simply in a state of seeming to experience such an object without any object actually being present? Second, in cases of illusion and perceptual relativity there is an object present which is simply misperceived, usually in readily explainable ways, and no need to suppose that an additional object is also involved. Third, the last part of the perceptual relativity version of the argument has been challenged by questioning whether there is really no experiential difference between veridical and non-veridical perception; and by arguing that even if sense-data are experienced in non-veridical cases and even if the difference between veridical and non-veridical cases is, as claimed, experientially indiscernible, there is still no reason to think that sense-data are the immediate objects of experience in veridical cases. Fourth, do sense-data exist through time or are they momentary? Can they exist when not being perceived? Are they public or private? Can they be themselves misperceived? Do they exist in minds or are they extra-mental, even if not physical? On the basis of the intractability of these questions, it has been argued that the conclusion of the argument from illusion is unacceptable or even unintelligible, even in the absence of a clear diagnosis of exactly where and how it goes wrong.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Direct realists can potentially deny the existence of any such thing as a mental image but this is difficult to maintain, since we seem able to visually imagine all sorts of things with ease. Even if perception does not involve images other mental processes like imagination certainly seem to. One view, similar to Reid's, is that we do have images of various sorts in our minds when we perceive, dream, hallucinate and imagine but when we actually perceive things, our sensations cannot be considered objects of perception or attention. The only objects of perception are external objects. Even if perception is accompanied by images, or sensations, it is wrong to say we perceive sensations. Direct realism defines perception as perception of external objects where an "external object" is allowed to be a photon in the eye but not an impulse in a nerve leading from the eye. Recent work in neuroscience suggests a shared ontology for perception, imagination and dreaming, with similar areas of brain being used for all of these.

==Problems with the indirect theory&lt;!--Linked from 'Social constructionism'--&gt;==

A problem with representationalism is that if simple data flow and [[information processing]] is assumed then something in the brain must be interpreting incoming data as a "percept". This something is often described as a [[homunculus]], although the term homunculus is also used to imply an entity that creates a continual [[Regress argument|regress]], and this need not be implied. This suggests that some phenomenon other than simple data flow and [[information processing]] is involved in perception. This is more of an issue now than it was for [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers prior to Newton, such as Descartes, for whom physical processes were poorly defined. Descartes held that there is a "homunculus" in the form of the soul, belonging to a form of natural substance known as ''[[Mental substance|res cogitans]]'' that obeyed different laws from those obeyed by solid matter (''[[res extensa]]''). Although Descartes' duality of natural substances may have echoes in modern physics (Bose and Fermi statistics) no agreed account of 'interpretation' has been formulated. Thus representationalism remains an incomplete description of perception. Aristotle realized this and simply proposed that ideas themselves (representations) must be aware—in other words that there is no further transfer of sense impressions beyond ideas.

A potential difficulty with representational realism is that, if we only have knowledge of representations of the world, how can we know that they resemble in any significant way the objects to which they are supposed to correspond? Any creature with a representation in its brain would need to interact with the objects that are represented to identify them with the representation. This difficulty would seem reasonably to be covered by the learning by exploration of the world that goes on throughout life. However, there may still be a concern that if the external world is only to be [[inference|inferred]], its 'true likeness' might be quite different from our idea of it. The representational realist would answer to this that "true likeness" is an intuitive concept that falls in the face of logic, since a likeness must always depend on the way in which something is considered.

A semantic difficulty may arise when considering [[reference]] in representationalism. If a person says "I see the Eiffel Tower" at a time when they are indeed looking at the Eiffel Tower, to what does the term "Eiffel Tower" refer? The direct realist might say that in the representational account people do not really see the tower but rather 'see' the representation. However, this is a distortion of the meaning of the word see which the representationalist does not imply. For the representationalist the statement refers to the Eiffel Tower, which implicitly is experienced in the form of a representation. The representationalist does not imply that when a person refers to the Eiffel Tower, they are referring to their [[Empirical evidence|sense experience]], and when another person refers to the Tower, they are referring to their sense experience.

Furthermore, representative realism claims that we perceive our perceptual intermediaries-we can attend to them-just as we observe our image in a mirror. However, as we can scientifically verify, this is clearly not true of the physiological components of the perceptual process. This also brings up the problem of [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] and its relation to representative realism, concerning the incongruous marriage of the metaphysical and the physical.

The new objection to the Homunculus Argument claims that it relies on a naive view of sensation.  Because the eyes respond to light rays is no reason for supposing that the visual field requires eyes to see it.  Visual sensation (the argument can be extrapolated to the other senses) bears no direct resemblance to the light rays at the retina, nor to the character of what they are reflected from or pass through or what was glowing at the origin of them.  The reason given is that they only bear the similarities of ''co-variation'' with what arrives at the retinas.&lt;ref&gt;Sellars, Roy Wood (1919), "The epistemology of evolutionary naturalism", Mind, 28:112, 407-26;  se p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as the currents in a wire going to a loudspeaker vary proportionately with the sounds that emanate from it but have no other likeness, so too does sensation vary proportionately (and not necessarily directly) with what causes it but bears no other resemblance to the input.  This implies that the colour we experience is actually a cortical occurrence, and that light rays and external surfaces are not themselves coloured.  The proportional variations with which cortical colour changes are there in the external world, but not colour as we experience it.  Contrary to what Gilbert Ryle believed, those who argue for sensations being brain processes do not have to hold that there is a "picture" in the brain since this is impossible according to this theory since actual pictures in the external world are not coloured.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmond (2005), ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke:  Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 96-102.&lt;/ref&gt; It is plain that Ryle unthinkingly carried over what the eyes do to the nature of sensation; A. J. Ayer at the time described Ryle's position as "very weak".&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, A. J. (1957) ''The Problem of Knowledge,'' Harmondsworth:  Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; So there is no "screen" in front of cortical "eyes", no mental objects before one. As Thomas Hobbes put it: "How do we take notice of sense?—by sense itself". Moreland Perkins has characterized it thus: that sensing is not like kicking a ball, but rather "kicking a kick".&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Thomas (1839 [1655]), ''Elements of Philosophy, The First Section: Concerning Body,'' London: John Bohn, p. 389;  Perkins, Moreland (1983), ''Sensing the World,'' Indianapolis IN: Hackett Pub. Co., pp. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are still philosophers arguing for colour being a property of external surfaces, light sources, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tye (2006), 'The puzzle of true blue', ''Analysis,'' 66: 173-78;  Matthen, Mohan (2009), 'Truly blue:  an adverbial aspect of perceptual representation', ''Analysis,'' 69:1, 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more fundamental criticism is implied in theories of this type. The differences at the sensory and perceptual levels between agents require that some means of ensuring at least a partial correlation can be achieved that allows the updatings involved in communication to take place.  The process in an informative statement begins with the parties hypothetically assuming that they are referring to the "same" entity or "property", even though their selections from their sensory fields cannot match; we can call this mutually imagined projection the "logical subject" of the statement.  The speaker then produces the logical predicate which effects the proposed updating of the "referent". If the statement goes through, the hearer will now have a different percept and concept of the "referent"—perhaps even seeing it now as two things and not one. The radical conclusion is that we are premature in conceiving of the external as already sorted into singular "objects" in the first place, since we only need to behave ''as if'' they are already logically singular.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmond (2005), ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke:  Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 103-120.&lt;/ref&gt; The diagram at the beginning of this entry would thus be thought of as a false picture of the actual case, since to draw "an" object as already selected from the real is only to treat the practically needful, but strictly false, hypothesis of objects-as-logically-singular as ontologically given. The proponents of this view thus argue that there is no need actually ''to believe'' in the singularity of an object since we can manage perfectly well by ''mutually imagining'' that 'it' is singular.  A proponent of this theory can thus ask the direct realist feels why he or she thinks it is necessary to move to taking the imagining of singularity for real when there is no practical difference in the outcome in action.  Therefore, although there are selections from our sensory fields which for the time being we treat as if they were objects, they are only provisional, open to corrections at any time, and, hence, far from being direct ''representations'' of pre-existing singularities, they retain an experimental character.  Virtual constructs or no, they remain, however, selections that are causally linked to the real and can surprise us at any time—which removes any danger of solipsism in this theory.  This approach dovetails with the philosophy known as [[social constructivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995), ''Radical Constructivism:  A Way of Knowing and Learning,'' London:  RoutledgeFalmer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of experience of a physical object can be altered in major ways by changes in the conditions of perception or of the relevant sense-organs and the resulting [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] processes, without change in the external physical object that initiates this process and that may seem to be depicted by the experience. Conversely any process that yields the same sensory/neural results will yield the same perceptual experience, no matter what the physical object that initiated the process may have been like. Furthermore, the causal process that intervenes between the external object and the perceptual experience takes time, so that the character of the experience reflects, at the most, an earlier stage of that object than the one existing at the moment of perception. As in observations of astronomical objects the external object may have ceased to exist long before the experience occurs. These facts are claimed to point to the conclusion that the direct object of experience is an entity produced at the end of this causal process, distinct from any physical object that initiates the process."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

==The adverbial theory==
The above argument invites the conclusion of a perceptual dualism that raises the issue of how and whether the object can be known by experience. The adverbial theory proposes "that this dualism is a dualism of ''objects'', with perceptual experience being a more direct experience of objects of a different sort, [[sense-data]]."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Perceptual dualism implies:&lt;blockquote&gt;both an ''act'' of awareness (or apprehension) and an ''object'' (the sense-datum) which that act apprehends or is an awareness of. The fundamental idea of the adverbial theory, in contrast, is that there is no need for such objects and the problems that they bring with them (such as whether they are physical or mental or somehow neither). Instead, it is suggested, merely the occurrence of a mental act or mental state with its own intrinsic character is enough to account for the character of immediate experience.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to the adverbial theory, when, for example, I experience a silver elliptical shape (as when viewing a coin from an angle) I am in a certain specific state of sensing or sensory awareness or of being appeared to: I sense in a certain manner or am appeared to in a certain way, and that specific manner of sensing or of being appeared to accounts for the content of my experience: I am in a certain distinctive sort of experiential state. There need be no object or entity of any sort that is literally silver and elliptical in the material world or in the mind. I experience a silver and [[Ellipse|elliptical]] shape because an object or entity that literally has that color and shape is directly before my mind. But the nature of these entities and the way in which they are related to the mind are difficult to understand. The adverbial theory has the advantage of being metaphysically simpler, avoiding issues about the nature of sense-data, but we gain no real understanding of the nature of the states in question or of how exactly they account for the character of immediate experience."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

The dual-sector model is a model in [[Development economics|developmental economics]]. It is commonly known as the '''Lewis model''' after its inventor [[W. Arthur Lewis]]. It explains the growth of a developing economy in terms of a [[labour (economics)|labour]] transition between two sectors, the capitalist sector and the subsistence sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Diana |last=Hunt |chapter=W. A. Lewis on ‘Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour’ |title=Economic Theories of Development: An Analysis of Competing Paradigms |location=New York |publisher=Harvester Wheatsheaf |year=1989 |isbn=0-7450-0237-4 |pages=87–95 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ocO-QgAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially the dual-sector model as given by W. Arthur Lewis was enumerated in his article entitled "Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labor" written in 1954, the model itself was named in Lewis's honor. First published in ''The Manchester School'' in May 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=W. Arthur |year=1954 |title=Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labor |journal=[[The Manchester School (journal)|The Manchester School]] |volume=22 |issue= |pages=139–91 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.1954.tb00021.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; the article and the subsequent model were instrumental in laying the foundation for the field of developmental economics. The article itself has been characterized by some as the most influential contribution to the establishment of the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gollin |first=Douglas |title=The Lewis Model: A 60-Year Retrospective |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=28 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=71–88 |jstor=23800576 |doi=10.1257/jep.28.3.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
# The model assumes that a developing economy has a surplus of unproductive labor in the agricultural sector.
# These workers are attracted to the growing manufacturing sector where higher wages are offered.
# It also assumes that the wages in the manufacturing sector are more or less fixed.
# Entrepreneurs in the manufacturing sector make profit because they charge a price above the fixed wage rate.
# The model assumes that these profits will be reinvested in the business in the form of fixed capital.
# An advanced manufacturing sector means an economy has moved from a traditional to an industrialized one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lewis dual sector model |url=http://teacherweb.com/IND/AmericanInternationalSchoolChennai/MsIndraniVerma/Lewis-Dual-Sector-Model_Vivek-and-Krishna.pptx |archivedate=April 6, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075347/http://teacherweb.com/IND/AmericanInternationalSchoolChennai/MsIndraniVerma/Lewis-Dual-Sector-Model_Vivek-and-Krishna.pptx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
W. A. Lewis divided the economy of an underdeveloped country into 2 sectors:

===The capitalist sector===
Lewis defined this sector as "that part of the economy which uses reproducible capital and pays capitalists thereof". The use of capital is controlled by the capitalists, who hire the services of labour. It includes manufacturing, plantations, mines etc.
The capitalist sector may be private or public.

===The subsistence sector===
This sector was defined by him as "that part of the economy which is not using reproducible capital". It can also be adjusted as the indigenous traditional sector or the "self employed sector". The per head output is comparatively lower in this sector and this is because it is not fructified with capital. The "Dual Sector Model" is a theory of development in which surplus labor from traditional agricultural sector is transferred to the modern industrial sector whose growth over time absorbs the surplus labour, promotes industrialization and stimulates sustained development.

In the model, the subsistence agricultural sector is typically characterized by low wages, an abundance of labour, and low [[productivity (economics)|productivity]] through a labour-intensive production process. In contrast, the capitalist manufacturing sector is defined by higher wage rates as compared to the subsistence sector, higher marginal productivity, and a demand for more workers. Also, the capitalist sector is assumed to use a production process that is [[capital (economics)|capital]] intensive, so investment and capital formation in the manufacturing sector are possible over time as capitalists' profits are reinvested in the capital stock. Improvement in the marginal productivity of labour in the agricultural sector is assumed to be a low priority as the hypothetical developing nation's investment is going towards the physical capital stock in the manufacturing sector.

===Relationship between the two sectors===
The primary relationship between the two sectors is that when the capitalist sector expands, it extracts or draws labour from the subsistence sector. This causes the output per head of labourers who move from the subsistence sector to the capitalist sector to increase. Since Lewis in his model considers overpopulated labour surplus economies he assumes that the supply of unskilled labour to the capitalist sector is unlimited.
This gives rise to the possibility of creating new industries and expanding existing ones at the '''existing wage rate'''.
A large portion of the unlimited supply of labor consists of those who are in disguised unemployment in agriculture and in other over-manned occupations such as domestic services casual jobs, petty retail trading. Lewis also accounts for two other factors that cause an increase in the supply of unskilled labour, they are women in the household and population growth.

The agricultural sector has a limited amount of land to cultivate, the marginal product of an additional farmer is assumed to be zero as the [[diminishing returns|law of diminishing marginal returns]] has run its course due to the fixed input, land. As a result, the agricultural sector has a quantity of farm workers that are not contributing to agricultural output since their marginal productivities are zero. This group of farmers that is not producing any output is termed surplus labour since this cohort could be moved to another sector with no effect on agricultural output. (The term surplus labour here is not being used in a [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] context and only refers to the unproductive workers in the agricultural sector.) Therefore, due to the wage differential between the capitalist and subsistence sector, workers will tend to transition from the agricultural to the manufacturing sector over time to reap the reward of higher wages.
However even though the marginal product of labor is zero, it still shares a part in the total product and receives approximately the average product.

If a quantity of workers moves from the subsistence to the capitalist sector equal to the quantity of surplus labour in the subsistence sector, regardless of who actually transfers, general welfare and productivity will improve. Total agricultural product will remain unchanged while total industrial product increases due to the addition of labour, but the additional labour also drives down marginal productivity and wages in the manufacturing sector. Over time as this transition continues to take place and investment results in increases in the capital stock, the marginal productivity of workers in the manufacturing will be driven up by capital formation and driven down by additional workers entering the manufacturing sector. Eventually, the wage rates of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors will equalize as workers leave the agriculture sector for the manufacturing sector, increasing marginal productivity and wages in agriculture whilst driving down productivity and wages in manufacturing.

The end result of this transition process is that the agricultural wage equals the manufacturing wage, the agricultural marginal product of labour equals the manufacturing marginal product of labour, and no further manufacturing sector enlargement takes place as workers no longer have a monetary incentive to transition.&lt;ref name="Misra Puri 263"&gt;{{cite book |author=S.

==Surplus labour and the growth of the economy==

[[Surplus labour]] can be used instead of capital in the creation of new industrial investment projects, or it can be channeled into nascent industries, which are labour-intensive in their early stages. Such growth does not raise the value of the subsistence wage, because the supply of labor exceeds the demand at that wage, and rising production via improved labour techniques has the effect of lowering the capital coefficient.
Although labour is assumed to be in surplus, it is mainly unskilled. This inhibits growth since technical progress necessary for growth requires skilled labor. But should there be a labor surplus and a modest capital, this bottleneck can be broken through the provision of training and education facilities.
The utility of unlimited supplies of labour to growth objectives depends upon the amount of capital available at the same time. Should there be surplus labour, agriculture will derive no productive use from it, so a transfer to a non agriculture sector will be of mutual benefit. It provides jobs to the agrarian population and reduces the burden of population from land. Industry now obtains its labour. Labour must be encouraged to move to increase productivity in agriculture. To start such a movement, the capitalist sector will have to pay a compensatory payment determined by the wage rate that people can earn outside their present sector, plus a set of other amounts includes the cost of living in the new sector and changes in the level of profits in the existing sector. The margin capitalists may have to pay is as much as 30 per cent above the average subsistence wage, '''WW1''' in figure which represents the capitalist sector is shown by '''N'''; '''OW''' is the industrial wage. Given the [[profit maximization]] assumption, employment of labor within the industrial sector is given by the point where marginal product is equal to the rate of wages, i.e. '''OM'''.

[[File:Lewisgraph.jpg|thumb|right|450px]]

Since the wages in the capitalist sector depend on the earnings of the subsistence sector, capitalists would like to keep down productivity/wages in the subsistence sector, so that the capitalist sector may expand at a fixed wage. In the capitalist sector labor is employed up to the point where its marginal product equals wage, since a capitalist employer would be reducing his surplus if he paid labor more than he received for what is produced. But this need not be true in subsistence agriculture as wages could be equal to average product or the level of subsistence. The total product labor '''ONPM''' is divided between the payments to labor in the form of wages, '''OWPM''', and the capitalist surplus, NPW. The growth of the capitalist sector and the rate of labor absorption from the subsistence sector depends on the use made of capitalist surplus. When the surplus is reinvested, the total product of labor will rise. The marginal product line shifts upwards to the right, that is to '''N1'''. Assuming wages are constant, the industrial sector now provides more employment. Hence employment rises by '''MM1'''. The amount of capitalist surplus goes up from '''WNP''' to '''WN1P''''. This amount can now be reinvested and the process will be repeated and all the surplus labor would eventually be exhausted. When all the surplus labor in the subsistence sector has been attracted into the capitalist sector, wages in the subsistence sector will begin to rise, shifting the terms of trade in favor of agriculture, and causing wages in the capitalist sector to rise. Capital accumulation has caught up with the population and there is no longer scope for development from the initial source, i.e. unlimited supplies of labor. When all the surplus labor is exhausted, the supply of labor to the industrial sector becomes less than perfectly elastic. It is now in the interests of producers in the subsistence sector to compete for labor as the agricultural sector has become fully commercialized. It is the increase in the share of profits in the capitalist sector which ensures that labor surplus is continuously utilized and eventually exhausted. Real wages will tend to rise along with increases in productivity and the economy will enter into a stage of self-sustaining growth with a consistent nature.&lt;ref name="Ghatak 80-83"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghatak |first=Subrata |title=Development Economics |publisher=Prentice Hall Press |year=1978 |isbn=0-582-44873-5 |pages=80–83}}&lt;!--much newer versions exist--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital accumulation==
The process of economic growth is inextricably linked to the growth of capitalist surplus, that is as long as the capitalist surplus increases, the national income also increases raising the growth of the economy. The increase in capitalist surplus is linked to the use of more and more labor which is assumed to be in surplus in case of this model. This process of capital accumulation does come to an end at some point.

This point is where capital accumulation catches up with population so that there is no longer any surplus labor left. Lewis says that it the point where capital accumulation comes to a stop can come before also that is if real wages rise so high so as to reduce capitalists' profits to the level at which profits are all consumed and there is no net investment.

This can take place in the following ways:
# If the capital accumulation is proceeding faster than population growth which causes a decline in the number of people in the agricultural or subsistence sector.
# The increase in the size of the capitalist or industrial sector in comparison to the subsistence sector may turn the [[terms of trade]] against the capitalist sector and therefore force the capitalists to pay the workers/laborers a higher percentage of their product in order to keep their real income constant.
# The subsistence sector may adopt new and improved methods and techniques of production, this will raise the level of subsistence wages in turn forcing an increase in the capitalist wages. Thus both the surplus of the capitalists and the rate of capital accumulation will then decline.
#Even though the productivity of capitalist sector remains unchanged, the workers in the capitalist sector may begin to imitate the capitalist style and way of life and therefore may need more to live on, this will raise the subsistence wage and also the capitalist wage and in turn the capitalist surplus and the rate of capital accumulation will decline.&lt;ref name="Misra Puri 263"/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
The Lewis model has attracted attention of underdeveloped countries because it brings out some basic relationships in dualistic development. However it has been criticized on the following grounds:

# Economic development takes place via the absorption of labor from the subsistence sector where opportunity costs of labor are very low. However, if there are positive opportunity costs, e.g. loss of crops in times of peak harvesting season, labor transfer will reduce agricultural output.
# Absorption of surplus labor itself may end prematurely because competitors may raise wage rates and lower the share of profit. It has been shown that rural-urban migration in the Egyptian economy was accompanied by an increase in wage rates of 15 per cent and a fall in profits of 12 per cent. Wages in the industrial sector were forced up directly by unions and indirectly through demands for increased wages in the subsistence sector, as payment for increased productivity. In fact, given the urban-rural wage differential in most poor countries, large scale unemployment is now seen in both the urban and rural sectors.
# The Lewis model underestimates the full impact on the poor economy of a rapidly growing population, i.e. its effects on agriculture surplus, the capitalist profit share, wage rates and overall employment opportunities. Similarly, Lewis assumed that the rate of growth in manufacturing would be identical to that in agriculture, but if industrial development involves more intensive use of capital than labor, then the flow of labor from agriculture to industry will simply create more unemployment.
# Lewis seems to have ignored the balanced growth between agriculture and industry. Given the [[wikt:linkage|linkages]] between agricultural growth and industrial expansion in poor countries, if a section of the profit made by the capitalists is not devoted to agricultural development, the process of industrialization would be jeopardized.
# Possible leakages from the economy seem to have been ignored by Lewis. He assumes boldly that a capitalist's marginal propensity to save is close to one, but a certain increase in consumption always accompanies an increase in profits, so the total increment of savings will be somewhat less than increments in profit. Whether or not capitalist surplus will be used constructively will depend on the consumption- saving patterns of the top 10 percent of the population. But capitalists alone are not the only productive agents of society. Small farmers producing cash crops in Egypt have shown themselves to be quite capable of saving the required capital. The world's largest [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] industry in [[Ghana]] is entirely the creation of small enterprise capital formation.
# The transfer of unskilled workers from agriculture to industry is regarded as almost smooth and costless, but this does not occur in practice because industry requires different types of labor. The problem can be solved by investment in education and skill formation, but the process is neither smooth nor inexpensive.

The model assumes rationality, [[perfect information]] and unlimited capital formation in industry. These do not exist in practical situations and so the full extent of the model is rarely realised. However, the model does provide a good general theory on labour transitioning in developing economies.&lt;ref name="Ghatak 80-83"/&gt;

==Empirical tests and practical application of the Lewis model==
# Empirical evidence does not always provide much support for the Lewis model. [[Theodore Schultz]] in an empirical study of a village in [[India]] during the influenza epidemic of 1918–19 showed that agricultural output declined, although his study does not prove whether output would have declined had a comparable proportion of the agricultural population left for other occupations in response to economic incentive. Again disguised unemployment may be present in one sector of the economy but not in others. Further, empirically it is important to know not only whether the marginal productivity is equal to zero, but also the amount of surplus labor and the effect of its withdrawal on output.
# The Lewis model was applied to the Egyptian economy by Mabro in 1967 and despite the proximity of Lewis's assumptions to the realities of the Egyptian situation during the period of study, the model failed firstly because Lewis seriously underestimated the rate of population growth and secondly because the choice of capital intensiveness in Egyptian industries did not show much labor using bias and as such, the level of unemployment did not show any tendency to register significant decline.
# The validity of the Lewis model was again called into question when it was applied to Taiwan. It was observed that, despite the impressive rate of growth of the economy of Taiwan, unemployment did not fall appreciably and this is explained again in reference to the choice of capital intensity in industries in Taiwan. This raised the important issue whether surplus labor is a necessary condition for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gary S. Fields |title=Dualism in the Labor Market: a Perspective on the Lewis Model after Half a Century |url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/directory/downloads/fields/fields,manchesterschool.pdf |journal=The Manchester School |volume=72 |issue=6 |date=December 2004 |pages=724–735 |accessdate=April 7, 2014 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.2004.00432.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model has been employed quite successfully in [[Singapore]]. Ironically however it has not been employed in Sir Arthur Lewis' home country of [[St. Lucia]].

'''Elena Tejada-Herrera''' is a trans-disciplinary artist that was born in Peru and became known for her work in performance and [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] arts. Her work promotes the participation of the public.

== Performance ==
Elena Tejada-Herrera studied [[painting]] but attained public attention in a controversial way. She became known within the [[Peruvian art]] scene at the end of the 90’s thanks to her performance and multimedia works related to the Peruvian socio economical context, marginal urban cultural expressions and popular culture. Since then she has proposed diverse reflections about the female body and gender constructions with her works. Her works are disinhibited, unapologetic, and scape the normative criteria that characterizes Peruvian [[contemporary art]] in general. During the last 15 years her works have generated situations that promote public participation and the realization of collective aesthetic experiences.

== Work ==
Elena Tejada-Herrera became known as a painter, but got great attention because of her performance art work.
In 1999 Tejada-Herrera presented her video [[performance]] Bomba and the Bataclana in the Belly Dance in which the artist appeared as a cabaret dancer along with street sellers that she hired to perform with her. This piece dealt with the body, [[Gender studies|gender]] constructions, and incorporated the participation of the public. The artist was awarded the first prize in the art contest Passport for an Artist for this artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hernandez Calvo, Villacorta|first1=Max, Jorge|title=Franquicias imaginarias.

From 2002 to 2006 while living in Virginia Tejada-Herrera focused each time more on pieces that incorporated the participation of the public like the series Paper Animals, Holding the House Together, One Day Around The Neighborhood Choreographing My Dance. For this piece Tejada-Herrera asked strangers on stores, and in her neighborhood to teach her how to dance and to choreograph her. Simultaneously she carried on landscape interventions on highways that addressed the drivers as her audience. Other pieces were performances interventions in malls and different public spaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buil, B.|title=Elena Tejada-Herrera:Sharing Territories to communicate understanding|journal=Art Voices|date=2008|issue=10|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Tejada-Herrera was selected to represent Peru at the Nipon International Performance Festival (NIPAF). Her participation consisted of a long distance telephone performance. For this event Tejada-Herrera called random numbers from the telephone books from the cities of Tokyo, and Nagoya. Her conversations with strangers related to the situation of women immigrants in [[Japan]]. Tejada-Herrera continued with these long distance telephone performances with [[Canada]], and with Peru. In Peru she presented an installation that included a phone from which the audience could hear her long distance recorded conversations with her mother.

The same year she participated as a feature artist at PerformIt in [[Tucson]] [[Arizona]], organized by the Plugged Art Collective. Her participation included the performances The Teasing Monkey, Gallery Security, What Would It Take to leave Every Thing Behind, Acts of Love, Grooming Me, and Always Up.
Also in 2007 Elena was awarded the Grand Prix for her performances at the Parnu Performance Festival, in [[Estonia]].

In 2008 Tejada-Herrera presented the exhibition "About You" at Dean Project Gallery in Long Island City [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. This exhibition started with street performances for which Tejada-Herrera invited passers by to participate. The performances included conversations, video portraits, and ephemeral performances made with the body among others. The passers by and witnesses were invited to the gallery to write their experiences and about their days. The exhibition opened with a video projection of the performance of the day and the first writings by the public on the gallery walls. Little by little the walls were filled with texts. On a Sunday Tejada-Herrera invited the public outside the gallery to enter and to paint on the walls. This was their day, in which the passers by painted and exhibited their creations within Tejada-Herrera's exhibition. At the closing reception, more video documentation of the performances made by Tejada-Herrera with the public and photographs were added. These were displayed in between the texts and paintings made by the public.

In 2009 Tejada-Herrera traveled to [[Lima]], [[Peru]] where she was invited to create an artwork at the Peruvian National Library. Elena Tejada-Herrera was granted permission to create artworks with the librarians during their working hours. Tejada-Herrera invited the librarians to bring their hobbies to their offices, and to participate within video art pieces. Tejada-Herrera also brought an approach with which she was working for many years since her first stay in Virginia, USA. This approach consisted of working within people's homes, like in the piece Paper Animals, and One Day at the Neighborhood Choreographing My Dance. The piece created within this process was Art Delivery realized with the librarian Nelly Bobbio. The resulting artwork is a video art piece with the librarian's voice over. This voice over explained the detail of her practice as a librarian while in the video she is performing a sculpture using her body and the furniture in her house. This piece features what Tejada-Herrera calls cultural exchanges, approach in which Tejada-Herrera explains her art practice to the participant who then she invites to interpret from his/her own perspective using the materials at hand. In this case the materials were the domestic furniture. The exhibition presented several video screens placed on top of wooden library furniture. There were huge amounts of shredded paper coming out of the furniture drawers on to the floor, covering big areas. The videos displayed the librarians executing their hobbies and expressing their opinions. There were librarians acting in front of the camera, singing solo and in group. There were librarians singing a serenata for a sanitation worker at the library. Another librarian sang karaoke in front of his co-workers. In a video piece a librarian was working while shredded paper covered him and his whole office. A librarian performed his normal regular duties as a librarian on a desk inside the gallery while he listened at his favorite music and Tejada-Herrera served him coffee and his favorite snacks.

Back in the United States Tejada-Herrera presented several art installations made in collaboration with office workers that facilitated the shredded paper that they collected for 15 days. These installations were presented at Miami International University. One of these pieces consisted of giant plastic bags filled with huge amounts of shredded paper. the other installation was a shelf from which colorful shredded paper fell like a waterfall on the floor. The installation ended with a participative performance with the workers.

In 2010 Tejada-Herrera participated in a residency at [[Atlantic Center for the Arts]]. Within this Tejada-Herrera created several photo and video series. 
In 2010 Tejada-Herrera traveled to [[Huancayo]] in Peru where she co-led a workshop along with the architect Alberto Tejada Herrera. The workshop was part of the CONEA, (Congreso Nacional de Estudiantes de Arquitectura) (National Peruvian Congress of Architectural Students). in this workshop the students created architectural installations on public parks in the area. These were a playground and a bus stop.

The following years Tejada-Herrera realized several video art works with the subject of the male body and sexuality from a woman's point of view. Her works included a homage to the artist Giuseppe Campuzano.

Since 2011 Tejada-Herrera returned to some object based art making, creating room sized installations and [[conceptual art|conceptual]] [[landscape]] interventions in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], including [[Chicago]] and [[Prague]].

In 2015 Tejada-Herrera presented an exhibition as part of 2nd Floor Rear, in which she invited the public to create [[costumes]], [[sculptures]], and [[art installations]] using the lines that she previously made with objects for the room sized installation Lengths of Consumption. The piece called "Playtime is About You" started with video projections of [[Zumba]] tutorials. After warming up the public was invited to play and create the collective installation.

Also in 2015 Elena Tejada-Herrera participated at the Chicago Home Theater Festival. The hosts for her site specific project were the artist [[Faheem Majeed]] and his wife [[LaShana Jackson]].  
Just as in former projects, Tejada-Herrera invited her hosts to participate within the artwork. The video piece was presented on the 16th of May at Majeed's and Jackson's home along with the artworks of other local artists from Chicago.

Tejada-Herrera has a continuous presence within the art scene in Chicago, other cities in the United States and Internationally. Her production is a [[:wikt:hybrid|hybrid]] that blends conceptual approaches, [[new media]], and participative art practices.

[[File:enso.jpg|thumb|262px|''Ensō'' (c. 2000) by [[Kanjuro Shibata XX]]. Some artists draw ''ensō'' with an opening in the circle, while others close the circle.]]

In [[Zen]],  {{nihongo|'''''ensō'''''|[[wiktionary:円|円]][[wiktionary:相|相]]|, "circle"}} is a circle that is hand-drawn in one or two uninhibited brushstrokes to express a moment when the mind is free to let the body create.

==Description ==

The ''ensō'' symbolizes absolute [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], strength, elegance, the universe, and ''[[Mu (negative)|mu]]'' (the void). It is characterised by a [[minimalism]] born of [[Japanese aesthetics]].

Drawing ''ensō'' is a disciplined-creative practice of Japanese ink painting—{{Nihongo|''[[sumi-e]]''|[[wiktionary:墨絵|墨絵]]|"ink painting"}}. The [[Japanese calligraphy#Tools|tools]] and mechanics of drawing the ''ensō'' are the same as those used in traditional [[Japanese calligraphy]]: One uses a {{nihongo|brush|筆|fude}} to apply ink to ''[[washi]]'' (a thin Japanese paper).

The circle may be open or closed. In the former case, the circle is incomplete, allowing for movement and development as well as the perfection of all things. Zen practitioners relate the idea to [[wabi-sabi]], the beauty of imperfection. When the circle is closed, it represents perfection, akin to Plato's perfect form ([[Plato]]), the reason why the circle was used for centuries in the construction of cosmological models, see [[Ptolemy]].

Usually, a person draws the ''ensō'' in one fluid, expressive stroke.  When drawn according to the {{Nihongo|''sōsho''|[[Wiktionary:草書|草書]]}} style of Japanese calligraphy, the brushstroke is especially swift. Once the ''ensō'' is drawn, one does not change it. It evidences the character of its creator and the context of its creation in a brief, continuous period of time. Drawing ''ensō'' is a [[spiritual practice]] that one might perform as often as once per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seo |first=Audrey Yoshiko |date=2007 |title=Ensō: Zen Circles of Enlightenment |location=[[Boston]] |publisher=[[Weatherhill]] |isbn=9780834805750 |oclc=71329980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This spiritual practice of drawing ''ensō'' or writing Japanese calligraphy for self-realization is called {{Nihongo|''hitsuzendō''|筆禅道|"way of the brush"}}. ''Ensō'' exemplifies the various dimensions of the Japanese ''[[wabi-sabi]]'' perspective and aesthetic: ''Fukinsei'' (asymmetry, irregularity), ''kanso'' (simplicity),  ''koko'' (basic; weathered), ''shizen'' (without pretense; natural), ''yugen'' (subtly profound grace), ''datsuzoku'' (freedom), and ''seijaku'' (tranquility).

In 1995, [[Lucent Technologies]] hired the San Francisco office of [[Landor Associates]], a transnational brand consultancy, to design their brand image.&lt;ref name="aiga"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/the-lucent-logo-legacy-long-live-the-big-red-donut |title=The Lucent Logo Legacy: Long Live the Big Red Donut |last=Bowie |first=James |date=9 May 2006 |website=[[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011015559/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/the-lucent-logo-legacy-long-live-the-big-red-donut |archivedate=11 October 2007 |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the design of the logo, Landor colored an image of an ensō red. The designer intended the brushstroke to imply human creativity, and the red to convey urgency.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/03/17/223308/ |title=Elucidating Lucent's "Million-dollar Coffee Stain" |last=McGowan |first=John |date=17 March 1997 |website=[[CNNMoney.com]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |accessdate=27 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045222/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/03/17/223308/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They named it the "Innovation Ring". "Our name and symbol represent the new entrepreneurial spirit and vision of our company" reads a [[public relations]] statement from Lucent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/08/10/lucent_logo_captures_company/ |title=Lucent logo captures company in 'single masterful brush stroke' |last=Magee |first=Mike |date=10 August 1999 |website=[[The Register]] |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, the logo was widely misunderstood.&lt;ref name="aiga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnmoney"/&gt; After years of staying-power and familiarity, the logo became more accepted by industry people in the West (including Lucent's own employees), although it was still not well understood. Nonetheless, soon other logo designers began to be influenced by the work.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney"/&gt; Lucent stopped using the logo after merging with [[Alcatel-Lucent#Alcatel|Alcatel]] of France to form [[Alcatel-Lucent]].

A variation of the symbol was also used as a logo by [[Obaku Ltd.]]. They continue to use an ensō shape as a wristwatch brand.

Thinking, an international design and consulting house centred in London, uses an ensō&lt;ref&gt;thinking.partners&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "Expression" as one of their four icons, along with icons for science, pattern and vision.

Philosopher Joseph Campbell's book, [[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]], bears this symbol on its cover representing creativity and uninhibited freedom of expression within art/literature.

The book [[The Lean Startup]] uses an enso on the cover. One of the concepts in the approach includes a [[learning cycle]] 'Build - Measure - Learn".

The design of [[Apple Campus 2]], [[Apple Inc.]]'s ring-shaped corporate headquarters, might also have been inspired by the ensō.&lt;ref name="Architect's Newspaper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.archpaper.com/wordpress/archives/29794 |title=Zen-otaph: Steve Jobs and the Meaning Behind Apple's New Campus |last=Daly |first=Sean |date=29 December 2011 |website=A/N Blog |accessdate=5 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512235306/http://blog.archpaper.com/wordpress/archives/29794 |archivedate=12 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AMD]] uses an ensō in the marketing of its Ryzen processors with the [[Zen_(microarchitecture)|Zen microarchitecture]].

[[Mindbody_Inc.|MINDBODY]] prominently features an ensō in its company logo.

{{Love sidebar}}
'''Eroticism''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]  ἔρως, ''[[Eros (love)|eros]]''—"desire") is a quality that causes [[Human sexuality|sexual]] feelings,&lt;ref name=merriam&gt;{{cite web |title=Eroticism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eroticism|work=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a philosophical contemplation concerning the [[aesthetic]]s of sexual desire, [[sensuality]] and [[romantic love]]. That quality may be found in any form of artwork, including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[glamor photography|photography]], [[drama]], [[erotic film|film]], [[music]] or [[erotic literature|literature]]. It may also be found in [[Sex in advertising|advertising]]. The term may also refer to a state of [[sexual arousal]]&lt;ref name=merriam /&gt; or anticipation of such – an insistent sexual [[impulse (psychology)|impulse]], [[libido|desire]], or pattern of thoughts.

As French novelist [[Honoré de Balzac]] stated, eroticism is dependent not just upon an individual's [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]], but also the culture and time in which an individual resides.&lt;ref&gt;Balzac, "The Physiology of Marriage" (1826), trans. Sharon Marcus (1997), Aphorism XXVI, 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grande, L., "Laws and Attitudes towards Homosexuality from Antiquity to the Modern Era", Ponte 43:4-5 (1987), pp. 122-129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gauthier, Albert, "La sodomie dans le droit canonique medieval" in L'Erotisme au Moyen Age: Etudes presentees au IIe Colloque de l'Institut d'Etudes Medievales, 3-4 Avril 1976, ed. Roy, Bruno (Montreal: Ed. Aurore, 1977), pp. 109-122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Because the nature of what is erotic is fluid,&lt;ref&gt;Evans, David T., Sexual Citizenship: The Material Construction of Sexualities, (New York: Routledge, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; early definitions of the term attempted to conceive eroticism as some form of sensual or romantic love or as the human sex drive ([[libido]]); for example, the ''Encyclopédie'' of 1755 states that the erotic "is an epithet which is applied to everything with a connection to the love of the sexes; one employs it particularly to characterize...a dissoluteness, an excess".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopédie'' (1755), quoted in Lynn Hunt ed., ''Eroticism and the Body Politic'' (London 1991) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because eroticism is wholly dependent on the viewer's culture and personal tastes pertaining to what, exactly, defines the erotic,&lt;ref&gt;Foster. Jeannette H., Sex Variant Women in Literature: A Historical and Quantitative Survey 2nd ed., (New York: Vantage Press, 1956) (repr. Baltimore: Diana Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, M., &amp; A. Bell, Homosexuality: An Annotated Bibliography, (New York: 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; critics have often{{how often|date=June 2018}} confused eroticism with [[pornography]], with anti-smut activist [[Andrea Dworkin]] saying, "Erotica is simply high-class pornography; better produced, better conceived, better executed, better packaged, designed for a better class of consumer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pornography: Men Possessing Women |last=Dworkin |first=Andrea |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-399-12619-2 |pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confusion, as [[Lynn Hunt]] writes, "demonstrate the difficulty of drawing… a clear generic demarcation between the erotic and the pornographic": indeed arguably "the history of the separation of pornography from eroticism… remains to be written".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", in Hunt ed., ''Eroticism'' p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological evolution ==
Whereas traditionally eroticism has been dealt with in relation to culture and its pornographic outcomes, current evolutionary psychology shows how eroticism has shaped the evolution of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature|last=Miller|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Vintage|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytical approach==
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (8).jpg|thumb|left|An erotic scene from ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' by French illustrator [[Édouard-Henri Avril]]]]
For a [[psychoanalytical]] definition, as early as [[Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;Dollmore, Jonathan, Sexual Dissidence: Ausgutine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault, (Oxford: Clarendon, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; psychotherapists have turned to the ancient Greek philosophy's "overturning of mythology"{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} as a definition to understanding of the heightened [[aesthetic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", in Hunt ed., Eroticism p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Plato]], [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] takes an almost [[transcendent (philosophy)|transcendent]] manifestation when the subject seeks to go beyond itself and form a communion with the objectival other: "the true order of going...to the things of love, is to use the beauties of earth as steps...to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty".&lt;ref&gt;"The Symposium", in Benjamin Jowett trans, ''The Essential Plato'' (1999) p. 746&lt;/ref&gt;

==French philosophy==
Modern French conceptions of eroticism can be traced to [[The Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;Coward, D.A., "Attitudes to Homosexuality in Eighteenth Century France", Journal of European Studies 10, pp. 236 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; when "in the eighteenth century, dictionaries defined the erotic as that which concerned love...eroticism was the intrusion into the public sphere of something that was at base private".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", in Hunt ed., ''Eroticism'' p. 3 and p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; This theme of intrusion or transgression was taken up in the twentieth century by the French philosopher [[Georges Bataille]], who argued that eroticism performs a function of dissolving boundaries between human subjectivity and humanity, a transgression that dissolves the rational world but is always temporary,&lt;ref&gt;L'érotisme, by Georges Bataille, Paris (1957: UK publication 1962) {{ISBN|978-2-7073-0253-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as that, "Desire in eroticism is the desire that triumphs over the taboo. It presupposes man in conflict with himself".&lt;ref&gt;George Bataille, ''Eroticism'' (Penguin 2001) p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; For Bataille, as well as many French theorists, "Eroticism, unlike simple sexual activity, is a psychological quest...eroticism is assenting to life even in death".&lt;ref&gt;Bataille, ''Eroticism'' p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-heterosexual==

[[Queer theory]] and [[LGBT studies]] consider the concept from a [[non-heterosexual]] perspective, viewing psychoanalytical and modernist views of eroticism as both archaic&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Donald, ed., The Material Queer: A LesBiGay Cultural Studies Reader, (Boulder CO: Westview, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]],&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Ed, Talk on the Wilde Side: Towards a Genealogy of a Discourse on Male Sexualities, (New York: Routledge, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; written primarily by and for a "handful of elite, heterosexual, bourgeois men"&lt;ref&gt;Flannigan-Saint-Aubin, Arthur.

[[Audre Lorde]], a Caribbean-American writer and out-spoken [[Feminism|feminist]] talks of the erotic being a type of power being specific to females.  "There are many kinds of power [...] The erotic is a resource within each of us that lies in a deeply female and spiritual plane, firmly rooted in the power of our unexpressed or unrecognized feelings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches |last=Lorde |first=Audre |last2=Clarke |first2=Cheryl |publisher=Ten Speed Press |year=2007 |origyear=1984 |isbn=978-1-58091-186-3 |location=New York |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Uses of the Erotic" within ''[[Sister Outsider]]'', she discusses how erotic comes from sharing, but if we suppress the erotic rather than recognize its presence, it takes on a different form. Rather than enjoying and sharing with one another, it is objectifying, which she says translates into abuse as we attempt to hide and suppress our experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = SIster Outsider|last = Lorde|first = Audre|publisher = Ten Speed Press|year = 2007|isbn = |location = NY|pages = 53–58|chapter = Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic As Power  (1984)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Everything''' (or '''every thing''') is all that [[existence|exists]]; the opposite of [[nothing]], or its [[Opposite (semantics)|complement]]. It is the totality of things relevant to some [[theory|subject matter]]. Without expressed or implied [[Maxima and minima|limits]], it may refer to [[universal quantifier|anything]]. The [[Universe]] is everything that exists theoretically, though a [[multiverse]] may exist according to theoretical cosmology predictions. It may refer to an [[anthropocentric]] [[worldview]],&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite web
| title = everything
| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/everything
| publisher = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary
| accessdate = 2008-06-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the sum of human experience, history, and the [[human condition]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;"This is the excellent foppery of the world..." — [[Shakespeare]], ''[[King Lear]]'',&lt;/ref&gt;  Every [[object (philosophy)|object]] and [[entity]] is a part of everything, including all [[physical body|physical bodies]] and in some cases all [[abstract object]]s.

==Scope==
In ordinary conversation, ''everything'' usually refers only to the totality of things relevant to the subject matter.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; When there is no expressed limitation, ''everything'' may refer to the [[universe]], the [[world]].

The ''Universe'' is most commonly defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of [[time]], all forms of [[matter]], [[energy]] and [[momentum]], and the [[physical law]]s and [[physical constant|constants]] that govern them. However, the term "universe" may be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting such concepts as the ''[[cosmos]]'', the ''[[world (philosophy)|world]]''  or ''[[Nature]]''. According to some speculations, this universe may be one of many disconnected universes, which are collectively denoted as the [[multiverse]]. In the [[bubble universe theory]], there is an infinite variety of universes, each with different [[physical constant]]s. In the [[many-worlds hypothesis]], new universes are spawned with every [[quantum measurement]]. By definition, these speculations cannot currently be tested experimentally, yet, if they{{clarify|reason='they' refers to 'these speculations', which obviously exist. Probably the entities the speculations are about are meant.|date=August 2013}} exist, they would still be part of everything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Especially in a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] context, ''World'' may refer to everything that constitutes [[reality]] and the [[Universe]]: see [[World (philosophy)]]. However, world may "only" refer to ''[[Earth]]'' envisioned from an [[anthropocentric]] or [[human]] [[worldview]], as a place by [[human beings]].

==In theoretical physics==
{{Main article|Theory of everything}}
In [[theoretical physics]], a ''theory of everything'' (TOE) is a hypothetical [[theory]] that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena. Initially, the term was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a great-grandfather of [[Ijon Tichy]]—a character from a cycle of [[Stanisław Lem]]'s [[science fiction]] stories of 1960s—was known to work on the "General Theory of Everything". Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of [[quantum physics]] to describe a theory that would unify or explain through a single model the theories of all [[fundamental interaction]]s of nature.

There have been many theories of everything proposed by [[theoretical physicists]] over the last century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that the accepted theories of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] are hard to combine. Whereas theories exploring quantum mechanics and string theory are easier to combine{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. 

Based on theoretical [[holographic principle]] arguments from the 1990s, many physicists believe that 11-dimensional [[M-theory]], which is described in many sectors by [[matrix string theory]], and in many other sectors by [[dual resonance model|perturbative string theory]], is the complete theory of everything. Other physicists disagree.

==In philosophy==
{{Main article|Theory of everything (philosophy)}}
In philosophy, a ''theory of everything'' or ''TOE'' is an ultimate, all-encompassing explanation of [[nature]] or [[reality]].&lt;ref name=Rescher2006a&gt;Rescher, Nicholas (2006a). "Holistic Explanation and the Idea of a Grand Unified Theory". Collected Papers IX: Studies in Metaphilosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rescher2006b&gt;Rescher, Nicholas (2006b). "The Price of an Ultimate Theory". Collected Papers IX: Studies in Metaphilosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker2002&gt;Walker, Mark Alan (March 2002). [http://www.jetpress.org/volume10/prolegomena.html "Prolegomena to Any Future Philosophy"]. Journal of Evolution and Technology Vol. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adopting the term from physics, where the search for a [[theory of everything]] is ongoing, [[philosophers]] have discussed the viability of the concept and analyzed its properties and implications.&lt;ref name=Rescher2006a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rescher2006b/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker2002/&gt;  Among the questions to be addressed by a [[philosophical theory]] of everything are: "Why is reality understandable?"  "Why are the laws of nature as they are?"  "Why is there anything at all?"&lt;ref name=Rescher2006a/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4729">'''Experiential knowledge''' is [[knowledge]] gained through [[experience]], as opposed to  [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]] (before experience) knowledge: it can also be contrasted both with [[propositional knowledge|propositional]] (textbook) knowledge, and with practical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Burnard, ''Counselling Skills for Health Professionals'' (2005)  p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiential knowledge is cognate to [[Michael Polanyi]]'s personal knowledge, as well as to [[Bertrand Russell]]'s contrast of Knowledge by Acquaintance and by Description.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''Mysticism and Logic'' (1954) Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==A posteriori ==
In the [[philosophy of mind]], the phrase often refers to knowledge that can ''only'' be acquired through experience, such as, for example, the knowledge of what it is like to see [[colour]]s, which could not be explained to someone born blind: the necessity of experiential knowledge becomes clear if one was asked to explain to a blind person a colour like blue.

The question of a posteriori knowledge might be formulated as: can Adam or Eve know what water feels like on their skin prior to touching it for the first time?{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Religion==
[[Zen]] emphasises the importance of the experiential element in religious experience,&lt;ref&gt;Dadid K. Reynolds, ''The Quiet Therapies'' (1982) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to what it sees as the trap of conceptualization:&lt;ref&gt;C. Cheng-Chi, ''The Practice of Zen'' (1951) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; as [[D. T. Suzuki]] put it, "fire. Mere talking of it will not make the mouth burn".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reynolds, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiential knowledge has also been used in the [[philosophy of religion]] as an argument against God's [[omniscience]], questioning whether God could genuinely know everything, since he (supposedly) cannot know what it is like to [[sin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/arguments-for-atheism/problems-with-divine-omniscience/experiential-knowledge/ experiential knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the distinction between experiential knowledge and [[propositional knowledge]], analytic philosopher and theologian [[William Lane Craig]] has stated in an interview&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/episodes/god-all-knowing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfhIkiT3g8A]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Robert Lawrence Kuhn]] for the [[PBS]] series ''[[Closer to Truth]]'' that because experiential knowledge is appropriate to the [[mind]] which does the knowing, in order for omniscience to be a cognitive perfection God's omniscience must entail God know only and all propositional truths and have only appropriate experiential knowledge.

==Ecology==
Writer Barry Lopez writes about experiential knowledge and how it relates back to the environment,&lt;ref&gt;Barry Lopez, ''Arctic Dreams'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that without experiencing nature, one cannot fully "know" and understand the relationships within ecosystems.

==Therapy==
[[Carl Rogers]] stressed the importance of experiential knowledge both for the therapist formulating his or her theories, and for the client in therapy&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rogers, ''On Becoming a Person'' (1961) p. 184 and p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; – both things with which most [[Licensed professional counselor|counsellors]] would agree.&lt;ref&gt;Burnard, p. 64-5 and p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

As defined by Thomasina Borkman (Emeritus Professor of Sociology, George Mason University) experiential knowledge is the cornerstone of therapy in self-help groups,&lt;ref&gt;K. Humphries, ''Circles of Recovery'' (2003) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to both lay (general) and professional knowledge. Sharing in such groups is the narration of significant life experiences in a process through which the knowledge derived thereof is validated by the group and transformed into a corpus that becomes their fundamental resource and product.

[[Neville Symington]] has argued that one of the central features of the narcissist is a shying away from experiential knowledge, in favour of adopting wholesale a ready-made way of living drawn from other people's experience.&lt;ref&gt;N. Symington, ''Narcissism'' (1993) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[Helen Vendler]] has characterised [[Seamus Heaney]]'s art as, in one respect, recording an experiential learning curve: "we are earthworms of the earth, and all that / has gone through us is what will be our trace".&lt;ref&gt;Heaney, quoted in H. Bloom ed., ''Seamus Heaney'' (1986) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education, and career==
Banks grew up in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], the son of F. L. Banks Sr. and Violet Mabery Banks, and graduated from [[Lanier High School (Jackson, Mississippi)|Lanier High School]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="MC Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judicial.mc.edu/judge_profiles.php#banks|title=Profiles of Former Justices and Judges: Fred L. Banks Jr.|publisher=
Mississippi College Judicial Data Project|date=December 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[B.B.A.]] from [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], followed by a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[Howard University School of Law]], in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;Turry Flucker, Phoenix Savage, ''African Americans of Jackson'' (2008), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt; where he graduated ''cum laude'', second in his class.&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MC Law"/&gt; Banks "chose to enter the law to help African Americans achieve equality", being one of only a handful of African American attorneys in the state at the time of his graduation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Finkelman, ''Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present'' (2009), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining [[admission to the bar]] in Mississippi, he entered into private practice in Jackson with several other attorneys acting as local counsel for the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund]].&lt;ref name="MC Law"/&gt; He then formed a law firm with several of those attorneys, [[Reuben Anderson]], E.M. Nichols, and [[Melvyn R. Leventhal]].&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt;

==Career==
===Legislative service===
In 1975, Banks was elected to represent [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]] in the [[Mississippi House of Representatives]]. He was twice re-elected.&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt; During his time in the House, Banks chaired the House Ethics Committee, the House Judiciary Committee, and the Legislative Black Caucus.&lt;ref name="MBJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msbusiness.com/2013/05/banks-wins-award/|title=Fred Banks wins Inns of Court award|publisher=''[[Mississippi Business Journal]]''|date=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt; Banks, along with Representatives [[Horace L. Buckley]] and [[Douglas L. Anderson]], also from Jackson, fought to preserve records from the pro-segregation [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]], in opposition to a bill which would authorize the destruction of these records.&lt;ref&gt;Yasuhiro Katagiri, ''The Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission: Civil Rights and States' Rights'' (2007), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this period, on September 24, 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] announced his appointment of Banks as one of nine members of the National Advisory Council on the Education of Disadvantaged Children.&lt;ref&gt;''Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States, Jimmy Carter, 1979'' (1980), p. 1727.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial service===
During this time, Reuben Anderson had been appointed to a seat as a Circuit Judge for the 7th Circuit District, encompassing Hinds County and [[Yazoo County, Mississippi|Yazoo]]. Banks served in the legislature until February 1985, when Anderson was Governor [[William Allain]], having elevated Reuben Anderson to the Mississippi Supreme Court, appointed Banks to Anderson's seat on the 7th Circuit District.&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt; Banks was twice re-elected without opposition.&lt;ref name="MC Law"/&gt; In January 1991, following Anderson's resignation from the Mississippi Supreme Court, Governor [[Ray Mabus]] appointed Banks to fill the remainder of Anderson's term. Banks was elected to serve the remainder of that term in November 1991 and re-elected to a full term in November 1996.&lt;ref name="MC Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt;

In 1993, Banks was mentioned as a potential nominee to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], during the administration of President [[Bill Clinton]], as there were no African American judges on the Fifth Circuit.&lt;ref&gt;"Clinton and the Federal Courts", ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' (April 1993), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton ultimately appointed Louisiana state court judge [[Carl E. Stewart]] as the first African American judge on the Fifth Circuit.

Banks retired from the court in 2001, and thereafter became a senior partner at the law firm of Phelps Dunbar.&lt;ref name="MBJ"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1750">In [[telecommunication]], the term '''front-to-back ratio''' (''also known as front-to-rear ratio'') can mean:
#The ratio of power gain between the front and rear of a [[directional antenna]]. 
#Ratio of signal strength transmitted in a forward direction to that transmitted in a backward direction. For receiving antennas, the ratio of received-signal strength when the antenna is rotated 180°.&lt;ref&gt;Radio Shack 1974-75 unabridged Dictionary of Electronics edited by Rudolf F. Graf, cat. no. 68-1030&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio compares the [[antenna gain]] in a specified direction, ''i.e.'', [[azimuth]], usually that of maximum gain, to the gain in a direction 180° from the specified azimuth. A front-to-back ratio is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]].  

In [[Fixed wireless|point-to-point]] microwave antennas, a "high performance" antenna usually has a higher front to back ratio than other antennas.  For example, an unshrouded 38 GHz microwave dish may have a front to back ratio of 64 dB, while the same size reflector equipped with a shroud would have a front to back ratio of 70 dB.  Other factors affecting the front to back ratio of a parabolic microwave antenna include the material of the dish and the precision with which the reflector itself was formed.

In other [[electrical engineering]] the '''front to back ratio''' is a [[ratio]] of [[parameter]]s used to characterize [[rectifier]]s or other devices, in which [[electric current]], [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] strength, [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], or other parameters, in one direction is compared with that in the opposite direction.

In mathematics, a '''handle decomposition of a 3-manifold''' allows simplification of the original [[3-manifold]] into pieces which are easier to study.

==Heegaard splittings==
An important method used to decompose into [[handlebody|handlebodies]] is the [[Heegaard splitting]], which gives us  a decomposition in two handlebodies of equal genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Quantum invariant|Quantum Invariants]] of Knots and 3-manifolds|first=Vladimir G. |last=Turaev|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|year= 1994|isbn=3-11-013704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As an example: [[lens space]]s are orientable 3-spaces, and allow decomposition into two '''solid-tori''' which are genus-one-handlebodies. The genus one non-orientable space is a space which is the union of two [[solid Klein bottle]]s and corresponds to the twisted product of the 2-sphere and the 1-sphere: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S^2\tilde{\times}S^1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Orientability==
Each orientable 3-manifold is the union of exactly two orientable handlebodies; meanwhile, each non-orientable one needs three orientable handlebodies.

==Heegaard genus==
The minimal genus of the glueing boundary determines what is known as the [[Heegaard genus]]. For non-orientable spaces an interesting invariant is the [[trigenus|tri-genus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9640">In [[mathematics]], [[Helmut Hasse]]'s '''local–global principle''', also known as the '''Hasse principle''', is the idea that one can find an [[diophantine equation|integer solution to an equation]] by using the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] to piece together solutions [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] powers of each different [[prime number]]. This is handled by examining the equation in the [[Completion (ring theory)|completions]] of the [[rational number]]s: the [[real number]]s and the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]]. A more formal version of the Hasse principle states that certain types of equations have a rational solution [[if and only if]] they have a solution in the [[real number]]s ''and'' in the ''p''-adic numbers for each prime ''p''.

==Intuition==
Given a polynomial equation with rational coefficients, if it has a rational solution, then this also yields a real solution and a ''p''-adic solution, as the rationals embed in the reals and ''p''-adics: a global solution yields local solutions at each prime. The Hasse principle asks when the reverse can be done, or rather, asks what the obstruction is: when can you patch together solutions over the reals and ''p''-adics to yield a solution over the rationals: when can local solutions be joined to form a global solution?

One can ask this for other rings or fields: integers, for instance, or [[number field]]s. For number fields, rather than reals and ''p''-adics, one uses complex embeddings and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak p&lt;/math&gt;-adics, for [[prime ideal]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak p&lt;/math&gt;.

==Forms representing 0==
===Quadratic forms===
The [[Hasse–Minkowski theorem]] states that the local–global principle holds for the problem of [[representing 0]] by [[quadratic form]]s over the [[rational number]]s (which is [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]]'s result); and more generally over any [[number field]] (as proved by Hasse), when one uses all the appropriate [[local field]] necessary conditions. [[Hasse's theorem on cyclic extensions]] states that the local–global principle applies to the condition of being a relative norm for a cyclic extension of number fields.

===Cubic forms===
A counterexample by [[Ernst S. Selmer]] shows that the Hasse–Minkowski theorem cannot be extended to forms of degree 3: The cubic equation 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 has a solution in real numbers, and in all p-adic fields, but it has no nontrivial solution in which ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are all rational numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ernst S. Selmer | title=The Diophantine equation ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''by''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''cz''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 | journal=Acta Mathematica | volume=85 | pages=203–362 | year=1951 | doi=10.1007/BF02395746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Heath-Brown]] showed&lt;ref name=HB&gt;{{cite journal | author=D.R. Heath-Brown | authorlink=Roger Heath-Brown | title=Cubic forms in 14 variables | journal=Invent. Math. | volume=170 | pages=199–230 | year=2007 | doi=10.1007/s00222-007-0062-1| bibcode=2007InMat.170..199H }}&lt;/ref&gt; that every cubic form over the integers in at least 14 variables represents 0, improving on earlier results of [[Harold Davenport|Davenport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=H. Davenport | title=Cubic forms in sixteen variables | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | volume=272 | pages=285–303 | year=1963 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1963.0054 | issue=1350 | bibcode=1963RSPSA.272..285D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since every cubic form over the p-adic numbers with at least ten variables represents 0,&lt;ref name=HB/&gt; the local–global principle holds trivially for cubic forms over the rationals in at least 14 variables.

Restricting to non-singular forms, one can do better than this: Heath-Brown proved that every non-singular cubic form over the rational numbers in at least 10 variables represents 0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=D. R. Heath-Brown | authorlink=Roger Heath-Brown | title=Cubic forms in ten variables | journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society| volume=47 | pages=225–257 | year=1983 | doi=10.1112/plms/s3-47.2.225 | issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus trivially establishing the Hasse principle for this class of forms. It is known that Heath-Brown's result is best possible in the sense that there exist non-singular cubic forms over the rationals in 9 variables that don't represent zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=L. J. Mordell | authorlink=Louis Mordell | title=A remark on indeterminate equations in several variables | journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society | volume=12 |pages=127–129 | year=1937 | doi=10.1112/jlms/s1-12.1.127 | issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Christopher Hooley|Hooley]] showed that the Hasse principle holds for the representation of 0 by non-singular cubic forms over the rational numbers in at least nine variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=C. Hooley | authorlink=Christopher Hooley | title=On nonary cubic forms | journal=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik | volume=386 |pages=32–98 | year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davenport, Heath-Brown and Hooley all used the [[Hardy–Littlewood circle method]] in their proofs. According to an idea of [[Yuri Ivanovitch Manin|Manin]], the obstructions to the Hasse principle holding for cubic forms can be tied into the theory of the [[Brauer group]]; this is the [[Brauer–Manin obstruction]], which accounts completely for the failure of the Hasse principle for some classes of variety.  However, [[Alexei Skorobogatov|Skorobogatov]] has shown that the Brauer–Manin obstruction cannot explain all the failures of the Hasse principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Alexei N. Skorobogatov | title=Beyond the Manin obstruction | journal=Invent. Math. | volume=135 | issue=2 | pages=399–424 | year=1999 | doi=10.1007/s002220050291 | arxiv=alg-geom/9711006 | bibcode=1999InMat.135..399S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms of higher degree===
Counterexamples by [[Masahiko Fujiwara|Fujiwara]] and [[Masaki Sudo|Sudo]] show that the Hasse–Minkowski theorem is not extensible to forms of degree 10''n'' + 5, where ''n'' is a non-negative integer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=M. Fujiwara | authorlink=Masahiko Fujiwara |author2=M. Sudo |authorlink2=Masaki Sudo  | title=Some forms of odd degree for which the Hasse principle fails | journal=Pacific Journal of Mathematics | volume=67 | year=1976 | issue=1 | pages=161–169 | doi=10.2140/pjm.1976.67.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Birch's theorem]] shows that if ''d'' is any odd natural number, then there is a number ''N''(''d'') such that any form of degree ''d'' in more than ''N''(''d'') variables represents 0: the Hasse principle holds trivially.

==Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem==
The [[Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem]] establishes a local–global principle for the splitting of a [[central simple algebra]] ''A'' over an algebraic number field ''K''.  It states that if ''A'' splits over every [[local field|completion]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; then it is isomorphic to a [[matrix ring|matrix algebra]] over ''K''.

==Hasse principle for algebraic groups==

The Hasse principle for algebraic groups states that if ''G'' is a simply-connected algebraic group defined over the global field ''k'' then the map from
:&lt;math&gt; H^1(k,G)\rightarrow\prod_s H^1(k_s,G)&lt;/math&gt;
is injective, where the product is over all places ''s'' of ''k''.

The Hasse principle for orthogonal groups is closely related to the Hasse principle for the corresponding quadratic forms.

{{harvtxt|Kneser|1966}} and several others verified the Hasse principle by case-by-case proofs for each group. The last case was the group ''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; which was only completed by {{harvtxt|Chernousov|1989}} many years after the other cases.

The Hasse principle for algebraic groups was used in the proofs of the [[Weil conjecture for Tamagawa numbers]] and the [[strong approximation theorem]].

'''Henri de Boulainvilliers''' ({{IPA-fr|də bulɛ̃vilje|lang}}; 21 October 1658, [[Saint-Saire]], [[Normandy]] – 23 January 1722, [[Paris]]) was a [[France|French]] nobleman, writer and historian. He was educated at the [[college of Juilly]], he served in the army until 1697.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Primarily remembered as an early modern historian of the [[France|French State]], Boulainvilliers also published an early French translation of [[Spinoza|Spinoza's]] ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' and wrote on topics as diverse as astrology, physics, philosophy and theology.

The [[Count|Comte]] de Boulainvilliers traced his lineage to the [[House of Croÿ]], to Jean de Croÿ, sire de Clery et de Boulainviller, who died in the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)]].  At the time of his birth, however, the family's fortune had declined significantly.  Much of Boulainvilliers' historical work and political life centered on the decline of the [[nobility]].{{sfn|Doumic|1913}}

== Education ==

In 1669, Henri de Boulainvilliers went to study at the Collège de Juilly, one of the most famous schools of the [[Congregation of the Oratory]] of [[Philip Neri]]. [[Exact science]]s, [[history]] and [[geography]] were taught there. 
The philosopher [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] being one of the great educators at the Oratory, [[cartesianism]] was allowed reference in the classroom from 1662 till 1675 when it was banned by Royal arrest. 
In 1673, Henry studied rhetoric with his teacher [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]], who was excluded from the Oratory (1678) because of his critical Bible studies.

The education at Juilly had great impact on Boulainvilliers: a special accent on critical history had been introduced into the Oratory by [[Caesar Baronius]] and [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]], and through the science classes he became familiar with the works of [[Jean Baptist van Helmont]], [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Edme Mariotte]].

Since he had also received private lessons in the German language, it is not inconceivable that he was able to read van Helmont in [[Middle Dutch]] that author used as a critical means to an accessible reading of [[medicine]] in the [[Low Countries]], and which so fluently worded his rich independence of mind.

== Physics ==

In 1683 Boulainvilliers wrote " ''l'Idée d'un Système Général de la Nature''" based on his reading of [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] and [[Robert Boyle]], followed by "''Archidoxes de [[Paracelsus]], avec une préface sur les principes de l'art chimique''".

By 1715-1720, he wrote his "''Traité d'astronomie physique''" using the Cartesian method, commenting on the nature of gravity and the movement of planets and drawing on sources such as [[Jean-Baptiste du Hamel]] and [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]].

He described his method as experimental philosophy and closely preceded the Dutch experimentalists led by [[Anthony Leeuwenhoek]] (Nieuwentijt, [[Herman Boerhaave|Boerhave]], Volder)

He retained affection for [[astrology]], for which he was famous in Court gossip.

== Critical history ==

In a "''Lettre à Mlle Cousinot sur l'histoire de France et le choix des historiens''" he explained why the writing of history was to be more than the "amateur" collection of dates and anecdotes related to old coins ([[numismatics]]) and stones: The knowledge of history pertained to a distinct moral character of society. Related causes of past events, such as the 1346 [[Battle of Crécy]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]], could be instructive on related measures in the present&amp;nbsp;— how to do things better or worse. Sometimes we want to know not only what a historical figure has done, but by what right he might have done so differently.

He stressed in his writings the corruption absolutism played in the fall of France when he contrasts the role English and French historians were able to investigate history. For instance, when stressing the importance of [[Primary source|sources]] in developing fact, he contrasted [[Thomas Rymer]]'s way of access to the London [[archive]]s to that of his own where he had to bribe the keepers of the French archives. For his neutral reasoning, his works were cited by subsequent writers whose works would prove influential in the development of Western political thought and historical research.

== Philosophy ==

Parallel to his historical studies ran an untiring interest in philosophy which he wrote down in ''Considérations abrégées des operations de l'entendement sur les idées'' on the model borrowed from the famous ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]'' by [[Antoine Arnauld]]: psychology of the mind, logic, and method; to which he added [[ontology]]. His influences, apart from the [[Scholastics|Schola]] of his early education, were [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[John Locke|Locke]] and Spinoza.

== Spinoza ==

Boulainvilliers's translation of Spinoza's ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' was not published until 1907 by Colonna d'Istria from an unsigned manuscript at Lyon.

Boulainvilliers's study of Spinoza, as captured in the collected treatises published by Renée Simon (1973), shows an exceptional development from a basic criticism to an enlightened understanding marked by the incredibly generous way in which he let his opponent use his own voice.

In the ''Essay de Métaphysique dans les principes de B...de Sp...'' he translated Spinoza's "geometrical method" into an accessible French, closely following its original meaning without incisive criticism.

In the ''Exposition du système de Benoit Spinosa et sa defense contre les objections de M. Régis'' he voiced the defense of Spinoza against his cartesian critic [[Pierre-Sylvain Régis]]. The comte Boulainvilliers was no blind follower of Descartes; he knew how to make use of his method, but he could equally well criticise him on metaphysical points.

This unusual way of writing philosophy led to the gossip that he was a Spinozist and therefore an [[atheist]]. Yet in his persistent criticism of Spinoza's [[monism]] (through the concept of the "unity of substance"), in writings inaccessible to the multitude, his independent judgement remained unspoilt. After his death his name was frequently used to circulate anti-religious treatises, leading to still more confusion about his intellectual identity.

With [[Matthieu Marais]] he shared a friendship with another great student of Spinoza, [[Pierre Bayle]].

== Molinos ==

Less well known but as important in his time was the similar treatment he gave to the mysticism of [[Miguel de Molinos|Molinos]] in : ''Extrait du livre du ministre [[Pierre Jurieu]] touchant les dogmes des mystiques et particulièrement contre Messieurs de Cambray et de Méaux.'' By the time the reader finished his lecture he had a complete survey of the works of Molinos, thus recapitulating the famous disagreements over [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]].

Such are the traits that can make one regret the criticism&amp;nbsp;— amply justified in retrospect&amp;nbsp;— that Boulainvilliers, elsewhere, brought over himself by his brutal stance on [[feudalism]]; traits for which he equally deserves to be known to a larger circle of students.

'''Identity negotiation''' refers to the processes through which people reach agreements regarding "who is who" in their relationships. Once these agreements are reached, people are expected to remain faithful to the [[identity (social science)|identities]] they have agreed to assume. The process of identity negotiation thus establishes what people can expect of one another. Identity negotiation thus provides the interpersonal "glue" that holds relationships together.

The idea that identities are negotiated originated in the [[sociology|sociological]] literature during the middle of the 20th century. A leading figure in this movement was [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1959, 1961), who asserted that the first order of business in social interaction is establishing a "working consensus" or agreement regarding the roles each person will assume in the interaction. Weinstein and Deutschberger (1964), and later McCall and Simmons (1966),  built on this work by elaborating the interpersonal processes that unfold after interaction partners reach an initial working consensus. Within psychology, these ideas were elaborated by Secord and Backman (1965) and Schlenker (1985). The actual phrase "identity negotiation" was introduced by [[William Swann|Swann]] (1987), who emphasized the tension between two competing processes in social interaction, [[behavioral confirmation]] and [[self-verification]]. Behavioral confirmation occurs when one person (the "perceiver") encourages another person (the "target") to behave in ways that confirm the expectancies of the perceiver (e.g., Rosenthal &amp; Jacobson, 1968; Snyder &amp; Klein, 2005; Snyder, Tanke, &amp; [[Ellen S. Berscheid|Berscheid]], 1977). Self-verification occurs when the "target" persuades the "perceiver" to behave in a manner that verifies the target's firmly held self-views or identities (Swann, 1983; 1996).

==Psychological view==

When the expectancies of perceivers clash with the [[self-concept|self-views]] of targets, a "battle of wills" may occur (Swann &amp; Ely, 1984). Such "battles" can range from short-lived, mild disagreements that are quickly and easily solved to highly pitched confrontations that are combative and contentious. On such occasions, the identity negotiation process represents the means through which these conflicting tendencies are reconciled.

More often than not, the identity negotiation process seems to favor self-verification, which means that people tend to develop expectancies that are congruent with the self-views of target persons (e.g., Major, Cozzarelli, Testa, &amp; McFarlin, 1988); McNulty &amp; Swann, 1994; Swann, Milton, &amp; Polzer, 2000; Swann &amp; Ely, 1984). Such congruence is personally adaptive for targets because it allows them to maintain stable identities and having stable identities is generally adaptive. That is, stable identities not only tell people how to behave, they also afford people with a sense of psychological coherence that reinforces their conviction that they know what to do and the consequences of doing it.

Groups also benefit when there is congruence among group members. When people maintain stable images of themselves, other members of the organization can count on them to "be" the same person day in and day out and the identity negotiation process can unfold automatically. This may free people to devote their conscious attention to the work at hand, which may explain why researchers have found that groups characterized by high levels of congruence perform better (Swann et al., 2000). Also, just as demographic diversity tends to undermine group performance when congruence is low, diversity improves performance when congruence is high (Polzer, Milton, &amp; Swann, 2003; Swann, Polzer, Seyle, &amp; Ko, 2004).

Some instances of incongruence in relationships are inevitable. Sudden or unanticipated changes of status or role of one person, or even the introduction of a novel person into a group, may produce discrepancies between people's self-views and the expectancies of others. In work settings, promotions can foment expectancy violations (cf, Burgoon, 1978) if some members of the organization refuse to update their appraisals of the recently promoted person. When incongruence occurs, it will disturb the normal flow of social interaction. Instead of going about their routine tasks, interaction partners will be compelled to shift their conscious attention to the task of accommodating the identity change that is the source of the disruption. Frequent or difficult-to-resolve disruptions could be damaging to the quality of social interactions and ultimately interfere with relationship quality, satisfaction and productivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20534">{{See also|Civility}}
'''Incivility''' is a general term for social behaviour lacking in civility or good [[manners]], on a scale from [[rude]]ness or lack of [[respect]] for elders, to [[vandalism]] and [[hooliganism]], through [[public drunkenness]] and threatening behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;freesearch=incivility&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact |work=[[AskOxford]] |title=Definition of 'Incivility{{'-}} |accessdate=2006-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "incivility" is derived from the Latin ''incivilis'', meaning "not of a citizen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Catherine Soanes, Angus Stevenson (Eds.) |title=The Oxford Dictionary of English (revised edition) |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between plain rudeness, and perceived incivility as threat, will depend on some notion of civility as structural to society; incivility as anything more ominous than bad manners is therefore dependent on appeal to notions like its antagonism to the complex concepts of [[civic virtue]] or [[civil society]]. It has become a contemporary political issue in a number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Incivility in Political Discourse (The Coming Apogee of the Moonbat Hordes) |work=[http://www.indcjournal.com/ InDC Journal] |url=http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |accessdate=2006-11-25 |date=2004-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103133948/http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |archivedate=2013-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uncivil communication ==
Civil behavior requires that people communicate with respect, restraint, and responsibility, and uncivil communication occurs when people fail to do so.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lane|last2=McCourt|title=Uncivil Communication in Everyday Life: A Response to Benson’s "The Rhetoric of Civility."|journal=Journal of Contemporary Rhetoric|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal pragmatics]], a term coined by [[Jürgen Habermas]], suggests that human conflict arises from miscommunication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication and the Evolution of Society|last=Habermas|first=Jurgen|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=Toronto, Canda|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so [[communicative competence]] is needed to reduce [[Conflict (process)|conflict]]. Communication competence "involves the ability to communicate in such a way that: (1) the truth claim of an utterance is shared by both speaker and hearer; (2) the hearer is led to understand and accept the speaker’s intention; and (3) the speaker adapts to the hearer’s world view."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History and Theory of Rhetoric|last=Herrick|first=James|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2005|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If people disagree about the truth or appropriateness of their interaction, conflict will occur.

According to Habermas, we should establish communicative [[Norm (social)|norms]] that lead to rational conversations by creating the social coordination needed for interactants to pursue their goals while recognizing the truth or appropriateness of their interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Communicative Action, trans. Thomas McCarthy|last=Habermas|first=Jurgen|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1984|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such norms, or social rules, include: "all participants must be allowed to speak freely, all participants must be allowed to speak for themselves (to enable them to establish their own [[ethos]] or "selfhood"), and that communication should be equal, with no one participant commanding more attention from the others than is afforded to them on their turn."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some examples of uncivil communication include rude gestures, vulgar language, interrupting, and loudly having private discussions in public spaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recent poll data suggests that Americans believe uncivil communication is a serious problem, and believe it has led to an increase in physical violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webershandwick.com/news/article/civility-in-america-2013-incivility-has-reached-crisis-levels|title=News - Civility in America 2013: Incivility has reached crisis levels - Weber Shandwick|website=www.webershandwick.com|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 study on ''Civility in America: A Nationwide Survey'', conducted by global public relations firm [[Weber Shandwick]] and public affairs firm Powell Tate in partnership with KRC Research found that 70 percent of Americans believe incivility has reached crisis proportions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Of those who expect civility to rise, 34 percent blame [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study found that Americans encounter incivility, on average, 17.1 times per week, or 2.4 times per day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some studies suggest that uncivil communication may have real consequences, including increased health problems due to stress, decreased work productivity, more auto accidents caused by aggressive driving, and [[vandalism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Political incivility ==
Political incivility is different from the everyday incivility described above. According to [[face negotiation theory]], politeness norms require us to avoid challenging others, but political incivility is different because, since it is specific to the political sphere, contestation of views and confrontation are required for a [[democracy]] to occur.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massaro|last2=Stryker|year=2012|title=Freedom of speech, liberal democracy and emerging evidence on civility and effective democratic engagement|ssrn=2042171|journal=Arizona Law Review|volume=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas Benson, "Where there is disagreement, there is a risk of incivility; in many cases, incivility is itself a tactic in political discourse, employed as an indicator of sincerity, as the marker of the high stakes in a disagreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Thomas|year=2011|title=The Rhetoric of Civility: Power, Authenticity, and Democracy|url=http://www.contemporaryrhetoric.com/articles/benson1_3.pdf|journal=Journal of Contemporary Rhetoric|volume=1|pages=22–30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Civil discourse]] is "the free and respectful exchange of different ideas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coe|last2=Kenski|last3=Rains|title=Online and uncivil? Patterns and determinants of incivility in newspaper website commentary|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=64|doi=10.1111/jcom.12104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight out of 10 Americans believe that the lack of civil discourse in the political system is a serious problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2010/11/americans-say-elections-more-negative-than-past-lack-of-civility-as-major-problem|title=Americans Say Elections More Negative than Past, Lack of Civility as Major Problem - PRRI|newspaper=PRRI|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty-two percent of American respondents to a 2011 survey felt that political advertisements were too "nasty" and 72 percent believed that political commercials that attacked the opponent were "inappropriate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fridkin|first=Kim L.|last2=Kenney|first2=Patrick|date=2011-04-01|title=Variability in Citizens’ Reactions to Different Types of Negative Campaigns|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00494.x/abstract|journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=55|issue=2|pages=307–325|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00494.x|issn=1540-5907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has linked political incivility to reduced trust in the legitimacy of political candidates, political polarization, and policy gridlock.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stryker|first=Robin|last2=Conway|first2=Bethany Anne|last3=Danielson|first3=J. Taylor|date=2016-10-01|title=What is political incivility?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2016.1201207|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=83|issue=4|pages=535–556|doi=10.1080/03637751.2016.1201207|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigns and politicians are not the only avenues for incivility, however. The public also participates in civil discourse, and incivility. Incivility in these contexts can lead to the breakdown of political discourse, and exclude certain people or groups from the discussion&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papacharissi|first=Zizi|date=2014|title=Democracy online: Civility, politeness, and the democratic potential of online political discussion groups|url=|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=6|pages=259-283|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|date=1998|title=Deliberative democracy or agonistic pluralism?|url=|journal=Dialogue International Edition|volume=7|pages=9-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If people or groups are systematically excluded from the discussion, the democratic nature of that discussion is called into question&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. 

In his article ''[[The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article (1964)]]'', Habermas explains that the [[public sphere]] is "a realm of our social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed… Although state authority is so to speak the executor of the political public sphere, it is not a part of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habermas|first=Jürgen|last2=Lennox|first2=Sara|last3=Lennox|first3=Frank|date=1974-01-01|title=The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article (1964)|jstor=487737|journal=New German Critique|issue=3|pages=49–55|doi=10.2307/487737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political incivility threatens the features of the rhetorical model of the public sphere,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vernacular Voices: The Rhetoric of Publics and Public Spheres|last=Hauser|first=Gerard|publisher=The University of South Carolina Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=61–64|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which include:
# It is discourse-based as opposed to class-based.
# Norm of reasonableness, meaning the success of an argument depends on participants agreeing that it makes sense.
# It "emphasizes indeterminate bracketing of discursive exchanges", meaning the public sphere is made up of many smaller conversations that happen independently of each other.
# Values communication that leads to shared judgments.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Political incivility threatens the future of the rhetorical model of the public sphere because it fractures that sphere into counter-publics, which may or may not interact with each other&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. According to Papacharissi (2004), "Incivility can then be operationalized as the set of behaviors that threaten democracy, deny people their personal freedoms, and stereotype social groups."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;, all of which could result from the violation of the features of the rhetorical model of the public sphere. People or groups may be systematically shut out of the mainstream political discourse, which makes that discourse less democratic, as certain voices are then missing from that discourse&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. Examples of incivility in political discourse include, but are not limited to, name calling, derisive or disrespectful speech and vulgarity, intentional lies, and misrepresentation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gervais|first=Bryan|date=2015|title=Incivility online: Affective and behavioral reactions to uncivil political posts in a web-based experiment|url=|journal=Journal of Information Technology &amp; Politics|volume=12|pages=167-185|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of uncivil behavior is "outrage speech", which includes name calling, insulting, character assassination, mockery, and emotional displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sobieraj|first=Sarah|last2=Berry|first2=Jeffrey M.|date=2011-02-09|title=From Incivility to Outrage: Political Discourse in Blogs, Talk Radio, and Cable News|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2010.542360|journal=Political Communication|volume=28|issue=1|pages=19–41|doi=10.1080/10584609.2010.542360|issn=1058-4609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The outrage industry: Political opinion media and the new incivility|last=Sobieraj|first=|last2=Berry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are disagreements among researchers about whether or not emotional speech – using anger, fear, or hatred – should be considered uncivil.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;Some researchers view some emotional speech as civil unless it threatens democracy in some way, while other researchers view emotional speech itself as a disruption to democracy, and push for a purely rational view of civility&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;.  

Stryker et al. assert that "political incivility is usefully distinguished from interpersonal politeness outside of politics." Their research found consensus among survey respondents concerning the types of political speech and behavior that "count" as "political incivility".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Papacharissi echoes this sentiment, stating that "civility should be redefined as a construct that encompasses, but also goes beyond, politeness."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

==Workplace incivility==
{{Main article|Workplace incivility}}
A 2011 report in [[USA Today]] defined Workplace incivility as "a form of organizational deviance... characterized by low-intensity behaviors that violate respectful workplace norms, appearing vague as to intent to harm."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/parenting-family/story/2011/08/Incivility-a-growing-problem-at-work-psychologists-say/49854130/1 | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article asserts further that researchers had announced at the annual meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]] that "Workplace incivility is on the rise.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Uncivil behaviors are characteristically rude and [[courtesy|discourteous]], displaying a lack of regard for others."&lt;ref name=Andersson&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lynne M. |last=Andersson |first2=Christine M. |last2=Pearson |date=July 1999 |title=Tit for Tat? The Spiraling Effect of Incivility in the Workplace |jstor=259136 |journal=The Academy of Management Review |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=452–71 |doi=10.2307/259136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incivility is distinct from violence. Examples of workplace incivility include insulting comments, denigration of the target's work, spreading false rumors, and social isolation.

==Marketing incivility==
At one time, a number of automotive audio manufacturers engaged in marketing incivility with their products, which included Sony with its "Disturb The Peace" tagline.&lt;ref&gt;"Today's Boom Cars Are Nothing If Not Acoustic Terrorism", Ted Rueter, Los Angeles Times, March 27, 2002 http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/27/opinion/oe-rueter27 Retrieved 19 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movements and organizations promoting civility===
* Dr. P.M. Forni, a professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]], co-founded the Johns Hopkins Civility Project in 1997. An aggregation of academic and community outreach activities, the JHCP aimed at assessing the significance of civility, manners and politeness in contemporary society. The JHCP has been reconstituted as The Civility Initiative at Johns Hopkins, which Dr. Forni now directs. This Web site is designed to introduce Dr. Forni's work on civility and to offer links to related material (http://sites.jhu.edu/civility/index.html).
* The Civility Project is a voluntary, grassroots movement of people from diverse backgrounds who agree that, at this critical time in America's history, solutions to our most pressing problems will be found only through a more civil exchange of ideas. A web-based organization, CivilityProject.org hopes to promote more civility in public discourse. Mark DeMoss and long-time Clinton advisor [[Lanny Davis]] launched The Civility Project (http://www.CivilityProject.org) earlier 2009.
* Choose Civility is an ongoing community-wide initiative, led by Howard County Library, to position [[Howard County, Maryland]] as a model of civility. The project intends to enhance respect, empathy, consideration and tolerance in Howard County (http://www.choosecivility.org).
* The National Civility Center is a not-for-profit organization established in 2000 to help people make their communities better places to live. They believe that a comprehensive approach to community improvement—one that engages all local stakeholders around shared ideas and a unified plan for action—can help community members and organizations become more effective at solving tough social issues (http://www.civilitycenter.org).
* The Institute for Civility believes there are two key threats to the effectiveness and efficiency of our governing process today. A nation experiencing both polarization and citizen apathy is a nation at risk. The institute works to reduce polarization in society by focusing on the very public civility (or lack of it!) in the governing process by facilitating dialogue, teaching respect, and building civility (http://www.instituteforcivility.org/  and http://www.civilityblog.org/).
* "The Civility Institute" (http://www.civilityinstitute.com), founded by Dr. Benet Davetian (author of Civility-A Cultural History), conducts research on civility and provides consultations for institutions, schools, corporations. The goal of the institute is to offer beneficiaries with a practical understanding of the social psychology of civility and how civility can be increased without interfering with the mandates of a competitive society.

'''Inhibitory control''', also known as '''response inhibition''', is a [[cognitive process]]&amp;nbsp; and more specifically, an [[executive function]]&amp;nbsp;– that permits an individual to inhibit their [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] and natural, habitual, or dominant behavioral responses to stimuli ({{aka}} '''prepotent responses'''&lt;!--term redirects here: bolded per MOS:BOLD--&gt;) in order to select a more appropriate behavior that is consistent with completing their goals.&lt;ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilieva IP, Hook CJ, Farah MJ | title = Prescription Stimulants' Effects on Healthy Inhibitory Control, Working Memory, and Episodic Memory: A Meta-analysis | journal = J Cogn Neurosci | volume = 27| issue = | pages = 1–21 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25591060 | doi = 10.1162/jocn_a_00776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt; [[Self-control]] is an important aspect of inhibitory control.&lt;ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Diamond A | title = Executive functions | journal = Annu Rev Psychol | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 135–168 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23020641 | pmc = 4084861 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750 | quote = Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control—resisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking “outside the box,” seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances).&amp;nbsp;... EFs and prefrontal cortex are the first to suffer, and suffer disproportionately, if something is not right in your life. They suffer first, and most, if you are stressed (Arnsten 1998, Liston et al. 2009, Oaten &amp; Cheng 2005), sad (Hirt et al. 2008, von Hecker &amp; Meiser 2005), lonely (Baumeister et al. 2002, Cacioppo &amp; Patrick 2008, Campbell et al. 2006, Tun et al. 2012), sleep deprived (Barnes et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2007), or not physically fit (Best 2010, Chaddock et al. 2011, Hillman et al. 2008). Any of these can cause you to appear to have a disorder of EFs, such as ADHD, when you do not. You can see the deleterious effects of stress, sadness, loneliness, and lack of physical health or fitness at the physiological and neuroanatomical level in prefrontal cortex and at the behavioral level in worse EFs (poorer reasoning and problem solving, forgetting things, and impaired ability to exercise discipline and self-control).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;EFs can be improved (Diamond &amp; Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).&amp;nbsp;... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson &amp; Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)&amp;nbsp;... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one’s attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what’s more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we would be at the mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn’t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.&amp;nbsp;... The subthalamic nucleus appears to play a critical role in preventing such impulsive or premature responding (Frank 2006).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-Cognitive Control"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 313–321 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 13: Higher Cognitive Function and Behavioral Control | quote ={{bull}} Executive function, the cognitive control of behavior, depends on the prefrontal cortex, which is highly developed in higher primates and especially humans.&lt;br /&gt;{{bull}} Working memory is a short-term, capacity-limited cognitive buffer that stores information and permits its manipulation to guide decision-making and behavior.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt; These diverse inputs and back projections to both cortical and subcortical structures put the prefrontal cortex in a position to exert what is often called “top-down” control or cognitive control of behavior.&amp;nbsp;... The prefrontal cortex receives inputs not only from other cortical regions, including association cortex, but also, via the thalamus, inputs from subcortical structures subserving emotion and motivation, such as the amygdala (Chapter 14) and ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens; Chapter 15).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in '''drug addiction''', where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in '''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder''' ('''ADHD'''; described below), significant negative consequences can result.&amp;nbsp;... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior.

Data to date from studies of aging provide strong evidence of exercise-linked benefits related to task switching, selective attention, inhibition of prepotent responses, and working memory capacity; furthermore, cross-sectional fitness data suggest that working memory updating could potentially benefit as well. In young adults, working memory updating is the main executive function shown to benefit from regular exercise, but cross-sectional data further suggest that task-switching and post-error performance may also benefit. In children, working memory capacity has been shown to benefit, and cross-sectional data suggest potential benefits for selective attention and inhibitory control.&amp;nbsp;... Support for the idea that higher levels of aerobic activity may be associated with superior brain structure has been gained through cross-sectional studies in older adults and children (for a recent review, see Voss, Nagamatsu, et al., 2011).&amp;nbsp;... only those in the aerobic exercise group exhibited improved connectivity between the left and right prefrontal cortices, two areas that are crucial to the effective functioning of the fronto-executive network.&amp;nbsp;... &lt;!--Selective attention--&gt;Together, these studies provide evidence that regular aerobic exercise benefits control over responses during selective attention in older adults.&amp;nbsp;... &lt;!--Inhibitory control--&gt;aerobic fitness is a good predictor of performance on tasks that rely relatively heavily on inhibitory control over prepotent responses (e.g., Colcombe et al., 2004, Study 1; Prakash et al., 2011) and also that regular aerobic exercise ''improves'' performance on such tasks&amp;nbsp;... &lt;!--Working memory--&gt;Overall, the results from the span and Sternberg tasks suggest that regular exercise can also confer benefits for the volume of information that children and older adults can hold in mind at one time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cognitive control of exercise"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buckley J, Cohen JD, Kramer AF, McAuley E, Mullen SP | title = Cognitive control in the self-regulation of physical activity and sedentary behavior | journal = Front Hum Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 747 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25324754 | pmc = 4179677 | doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00747 | quote = Recent theory (e.g., Temporal Self-Regulation Theory; Hall and Fong, 2007, 2010, 2013) and evidence suggest that the relation between physical activity and cognitive control is reciprocal (Daly et al., 2013). Most research has focused on the beneficial effects of regular physical activity on executive functions-the set of neural processes that define cognitive control. Considerable evidence shows that regular physical activity is associated with enhanced cognitive functions, including attention, processing speed, task switching&lt;!--cognitive flexibility--&gt;, inhibition of prepotent responses&lt;!--inhibitory control--&gt; and declarative memory (for reviews see Colcombe and Kramer, 2003; Smith et al., 2010; Guiney and Machado, 2013; McAuley et al., 2013). Recent research demonstrates a dose-response relationship between fitness and spatial memory (Erickson et al., 2011)&amp;nbsp;... The effects of physical activity on cognitive control appear to be underpinned by a variety of brain processes including: increased hippocampal volume, increased gray matter density in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), upregulation of neurotrophins and greater microvascular density&amp;nbsp;... Together, this research suggests that an improvement in control processes, such as attention and inhibition or interference control, is associated with an improvement in self-regulation of physical activity.&amp;nbsp;... Increasingly, research shows that cognitive control abilities are malleable, and that cognitive training can produce positive cognitive outcomes and improvements in daily function (Willis et al., 2006; Hertzog et al., 2008) that can have long-lasting effects (Rebok et al., 2014). Approaches to cognitive training are numerous and varied; however, the relative superiority of different approaches with regard to training and transfer continue to be debated. }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, successfully suppressing the natural behavioral response to eat cake when one is craving it while dieting requires the use of inhibitory control.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;

==Tests==
An '''inhibitory control test''' is a [[neuropsychological test]] that measures an individual's ability to override their natural, habitual, or dominant behavioral response to a stimulus in order to implement more adaptive {{nowrap|goal-oriented}} behaviors.&lt;ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-Cognitive Control" /&gt;  Some of the neuropsychological tests that measure inhibitory control include the [[Stroop task]], [[go/no-go]] task, [[Simon task]], [[Flanker task]], [[antisaccade task]]s, [[delayed gratification|delay of gratification]] tasks, and stop-signal tasks.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;

Jenkins &amp; Berthier (2014) conducted a study on working memory and inhibitory response in toddlers.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; The toddlers that participated were between the ages of two and three years of age.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; Thirty six children were recruited, twenty of them were males and sixteen were females; most of the children were closer to 3 years of age (34 months).&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; The way these subjects were recruited was via telephone calls and letters from birth state records that were found.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; The purpose of this study was to determine which type of test helped increase memory retention in toddlers. There were four types of test, the door task, three boxes-stationary task, three boxes scrambled, and the three pegs task.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; Three of these tests were working memory tasks and one was an inhibitory/cognitive control test. The first test that was given was the door task; in this task children were asked to sit in front of an item or electronic device that consisted of a pathway where balls could be rolled down into different slots. A barrier was included to mislead the child and test the memory of what slot the ball went into.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; They were then instructed to search or point at where the hidden ball had landed. The second test was called three boxes stationary task. This test asked the participants to select a box of their choice that contained certain treats.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; The child kept getting distracted as the researcher pulled away the boxes and brought them back to his/her attention to choose the right box where the treat was in; along with this test the child was provided with feedback.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;  The third test was similar to the second test; the only difference was that the boxes were scrambled. The last test consisted of a three peg task, this measured inhibitory control, in this test children were asked to identify pegs. The results of this study found that the inhibitory control test was the most effective in allowing the child to remember things. The improvements were found due to an increase in attention and reaction time.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; Most of these tasks involved analyzing a part of the brain called the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jenkins I, Berthier N | year = 2014 | title = Working memory and inhibitory control in visually guided manual search in toddlers | url = | journal = Developmental Psychobiology | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1002/dev.21205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Initiation''' is a concept in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that there are nine levels of spiritual development that beings who live on Earth can progress upward through.  Within these levels, there are four basic levels of spiritual development that human beings on Earth progress through as they [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]], although [[evil]] acts may cause bad [[karma]] which may cause one to temporarily regress.  It is believed that when [[soul]]s have advanced to the fourth level of initiation, they have reached [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and have no further need to reincarnate.  At the fifth level of initiation and beyond, souls  have the opportunity to become members of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]].  This concept was developed by both [[C. W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]] beginning in the 1920s.
  
According to C.W. Leadbeater, ''Initiation'' is a process by which "we try to develop ourselves not that we may become great and wise, but that we may have the power and knowledge to work for humanity to the best effect."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House Page 166&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Alice A. Bailey, ''Initiation'' is the "process of undergoing an [[Higher consciousness|expansion [toward higher levels] of consciousness]]"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 – Lucis Publishing, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed by Theosophists that all [[soul]]s that have reached the fourth level of initiation and evolved beyond the necessity to [[reincarnate]] that do not elect to become [[pratyeka buddha]]s and go directly into [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing Nirvana|Nirvana]] gradually evolve upward through all of these six higher levels of consciousness over thousands or millions of years, and later over billions or trillions of years, other higher levels yet beyond.    

The concept of ''Initiation'' is also recognized in the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of [[religion]]s loosely based on Theosophy.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is referred to as ''[[Ascended Master Teachings#Ascension|Ascension]]''.  

The first six initiations were named by C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey after the six most important events in the life of [[Jesus]].

According to Martin Euser, “Theosophy closes the gap between science and religion by positing reincarnation as a dynamic process [ unlike the concept of the [[eternal return]] ].  The first jewel concerns the doctrine of reincarnation or reimbodiment. It's all a dynamic process and it's the way nature works.”&lt;ref&gt;Euser, Martin ''Science and Spirituality in the New Millennium'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiation zero==
{{Theosophy}}
The vast majority of ordinary humanity lies on the probationary path (below the first initiation).

==First initiation ("birth" to the spiritual life)==
According to Alice A. Bailey, at the first initiation one gains full control of the [[physical body]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 – Lucis Publishing, page 82&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Benjamin Creme]], there are 800,000 people at this level of initiation.&lt;ref name="Creme, Benjamin Page 195"&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission'' Amsterdam:1986 Share International Foundation Page 195&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Ascended Master Teachings, a soul that reaches this level is referred to as having attained their ''[[Ascended Master Teachings#The Individualized "I AM" Presence|Individualized "I AM" Presence]]'', the prerequisite for further spiritual advancement.

==Second initiation ("baptism")==
Alice A. Bailey states that at the second initiation, one gains full control of the [[astral body]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 – Lucis Publishing, page 85&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Benjamin Creme, there are 240,000 people at this level of initiation.&lt;ref name="Creme, Benjamin Page 195"/&gt;

==Third initiation ("the transfiguration")==
An individual who is at the level of the third initiation has acquired fully developed [[clairvoyance]] and [[clairaudience]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 – Lucis Publishing, page 87&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benjamin Creme, there are somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 people at this level of initiation.&lt;ref name="Creme, Benjamin Page 195"/&gt;

==Fourth initiation ("the crucifixion")==
An individual reaching the fourth initiation is known as the perfected one, or an [[Arhat]] ([[Pali]]) or a [[Paramahamsa]] ([[Sanskrit]]).  

At this level, it is believed in Buddhism, one has the ability to remember all of one's [[past lives]], and one also has various minor [[siddhi]]s capable of affecting one's immediate environment.  

Symbolically the fourth initiation is denoted as the ''[[crucifixion]]'' initiation. An Arhat is supposed to be one who does not need to be incarnated again to develop spiritually.  According to Benjamin Creme, there are 450 people at this level of initiation.&lt;ref name="Creme, Benjamin Page 195"/&gt;

==="The seven choices before the perfect [hu]man"===
Having reached the threshold of the fifth initiation, a soul does not necessarily have to enter Earth's spiritual hierarchy proper as one of the "Masters of the Ancient Wisdom".  One has seven paths forward to higher levels that they can choose to go forward on, only one of which is to become a "Master of the Ancient Wisdom".  These seven choices, called in Theosophical literature "the seven choices before the perfect [hu]man" are:

:1.  "Remain with humanity as on official of the Hierarchy", i.e., become one of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]].
:2.  "Remain with humanity as a "[[Nirmanakaya]]", i.e., become a [[bodhisattva]].
:3.  "Join the [[Deva (New Age)|Devas]]".
:4.  "Join the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Staff Corps of the Solar Logos]]", i.e., join the Masters living in etheric cities inside the Sun who supervise the activities of the [[Deva (New Age)|Solar Angels]] that direct the process of evolution of the life waves (process of reincarnation) of the beings on all the planets of the [[solar system]] (all of whom live except those on Earth live on the [[etheric plane]]s of their planets).
:5.  "Prepare the work of the [[Round (Theosophy)|next Chain]]", i.e. join that subsection of the ''Staff Corps of the Solar Logos'' who are the solar planners who plan the future development of planetary civilizations in this solar system.
:6.&amp;7. "Enter [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing Nirvana|Nirvana]]", i.e., become a [[Pratyekabuddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, E.L. ''The Web of the Universe'' London:1936 Theosophical Publishing House "The Seven Choices Before the Perfect Man" Page 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/weboftheuniverse032400mbp/weboftheuniverse032400mbp_djvu.txt "Web of the Universe" text on Internet:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Text available at https://archive.org/stream/weboftheuniverse032400mbp/weboftheuniverse032400mbp_djvu.txt – Does not clarify points 6&amp;7. --&gt;

==Fifth initiation ("the resurrection")==
The fifth initiation, called the ''[[resurrection]]'', comprises the first rung of beings designated in Theosophy as [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] and in the Ascended Master Teachings as [[Ascended master]]s.  

Siddhis at this level include the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] and [[Bilocation|bilocate]] moderate
distances and [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]] within a localized area. 

According to [[C. W. Leadbeater]], [[Alice Bailey]] and Benjamin Creme, there are a total of 43 beings at this level of initiation; this figure is arrived at because all three have stated there are a total of 60 Masters in all—subtracting from the 60 the 17 Masters at level six and above identified by C. W. Leadbeater, leaves a total of 43 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom at the fifth level of initiation. 

Of these 43 Masters, a total of 12 have been identified by name, one by C. W. Leadbeater, nine by Alice Bailey, and two by Benjamin Creme.  

C. W. Leadbeater named a Master called '''Master Jupiter''' who lives in [[India]] that is involved with overseeing the people, government, and development of India that is at this level.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C. W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alice A. Bailey identified as Masters the '''Master P.''', who is said to help ''St. Germain'' bring about the [[Age of Aquarius]] in the Americas, and two different ''English Masters'' ('''English Master #1''' and '''English Master #2'''), one of which is said to have inspired the [[labor movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957&amp;mdash;Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) Master P. Page 682; See numerous references to "English Master" in Index&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these three, she identified the three ''Lords of Liberation'' – ('''Lord of Liberation #1''', '''Lord of Liberation #2''', and '''Lord of Liberation #3''').  According to Alice A. Bailey, the three ''Lords of Liberation'' formulated the slogan ''[[Liberty, equality, brotherhood|Liberty, Equality, Fraternity]]''.  Finally, Alice A. Bailey also identified the three ''Lords of Karma'' ('''Lord of Karma #1''', '''Lord of Karma #2''', and '''Lord of Karma #3''').  These three beings are said to live in [[Shamballah]] and help ''Sanat Kumara'' decide where and when [[soul]]s are going to [[Reincarnation|incarnate]] in their next life.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957&amp;mdash;Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) "Lords of Liberation"&lt;/ref&gt; 

Benjamin Creme identified two previously unidentified Masters at this level in 2001—he stated that there is a '''Master in Moscow'''&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach: New Light and Life for Humanity'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 179&lt;/ref&gt; and a '''Master in Tokyo''',&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach: New Light and Life for Humanity'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 177&lt;/ref&gt; but did not give their personal names.    

Forty-three minus 12 equals 31 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom at this level that are still unidentified by name.

[[Guy Ballard]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] have identified, named, and received dictations from at least 200 new "[[Ascended Master]]s" at this level;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press "Profiles of the Ascended Masters" – pages 13–394 More than 200 "Ascended Masters" are listed&lt;/ref&gt; however, these Masters are not recognized as Masters of the Ancient Wisdom by traditional Theosophists.  Ascended Masters named by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet at this level include such Masters as '''[[Confucius]]''', '''[[Lord Ling]]''', '''[[Master Jesus#Twin flame|Lady Master Magda]]''', '''[[Athena|Pallas Athena]]''', '''[[Master Lanello|Lanello]]''',  '''[[Kwan Yin]]''', the '''Great Divine Director''', '''[[Padre Pio]]''',  '''[[Master Godfre|Godfre]]''' and his "twin flame" (celestial wife) '''[[Lady Master Lotus]]''', and many dozens more.

In the Ascended Master Teachings, the ''Master Jupiter'' is referred to as '''Chananda'''.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Chananda Pages 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, ''Sanat Kumara'' has a grandson named '''[[Sanat Kumara#Master Cha Ara|Master Cha Ara]]''' who is half mortal and who just recently became a Master, therefore meaning he is functioning at the fifth level.

==Sixth initiation ("the ascension" or "masterhood")==
The Chohans (Lords) of the [[Seven Rays]] – '''[[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]''' (1st Ray), Master '''[[Koot Hoomi]]''' (2nd Ray), '''[[Paul the Venetian]]''' (3rd Ray), '''[[Serapis Bey]]''' (4th Ray), '''[[Master Hilarion]]''' (5th Ray), '''[[Master Jesus]]''' (6th Ray), and the '''[[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Master Rakoczi]]''' (7th Ray) – are seven of the beings at the level of the sixth initiation, while their coordinator and [[communications director]] '''[[Djwal Khul]]''' is another, making a total of eight at this level.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 "Diagram 5 – The Spiritual Hierarchy" – facing page 248&lt;/ref&gt; 

All of these Masters are recognized by both traditional Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, ''Master Rakoczi'' is referred to as  '''[[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]]'''.

Siddhis at this level include the ability to teleport, bilocate, or levitate to anyplace on Earth. 

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, on January 1, 1956, the Master Jesus advanced from the sixth to the seventh level of initiation and the '''[[Lady Master Nada]]''' (a ''lady'' Master recognized in the Ascended Master Teachings but not in Theosophy) advanced from the fifth level to the sixth level and replaced the Master Jesus as the chohan of the sixth ray.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seventh initiation ("bodhisattva" , "avatar", or "christhood")==
The seventh initiation is known as the initiation of the [[Bodhisattava]] (Buddhism) or the [[Avatar]] (Hinduism). The '''[[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]]''' or ''World Teacher'' (known as [[Krishna]] by [[Hindus]], the [[Christ]] by [[Christian]]s, [[Maitreya]] by [[Buddhist]]s, [[Messiah]] by the [[Jew]]s, the Iman [[Mahdi]] by [[Muslims]], and the [[Peshotan]] by the [[Zoroastrian]]s) is at this level.  At this level also are said to be the '''[[Manu (Theosophy)|Chakshusha Manu]]''', the '''[[Manu (Theosophy)|Vaivasvatu Manu]]''' and the '''[[Maha Chohan]]''',&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922, Lucis Publishing Chart, page 49&lt;/ref&gt; thus making a total of four beings at this level.

In  the Ascended Master Teachings, the ''Chakshusha Manu'' is referred to as '''[[Manu (Theosophy)#Ascended master teachings|Lord Himalaya]]'''.

According to Benjamin Creme, a being at this level has the ability to teleport to anyplace in the [[solar system]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam: 1997 Share International Foundation, page 72&lt;/ref&gt; Creme admits, however, that unless one is in a hurry, it's simpler, easier, and uses less energy to just take a [[flying saucer]].  Creme has also stated that beings at this level have a level of [[invulnerability]] such that they would not be affected by a [[bullet]] fired at them, nor even by the detonation of a [[nuclear bomb]].  

In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that on January 1, 1956, Maitreya advanced from the 7th level to the 8th level.  
==Eighth initiation ("buddhahood")==

Level eight is the level of the '''[[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'''.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"/&gt;

At this level also, according to C.W. Leadbeater, are '''[[Pratyeka-Buddha|The Three Pratyeka Buddha]]s''' (the task of these three [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] is to focus the Seven Rays from ''Sanat Kumara'' through ''Djwal Khul'' to the chohans of the Seven Rays).&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"/&gt; Unlike Buddha, the three Pratyeka Buddhas do not interact with the human race except for fulfilling their function of focusing the seven rays.

Alice A. Bailey stated that communication among beings at this level is entirely by [[telepathy]].  According to Theosophist [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], beings at this level can freely roam both in [[interplanetary space]] and in nearby [[interstellar space]] in full consciousness while physically remaining in their celestialized bodies and carrying on normal activities such as communicating with other beings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett, A. P.]] ''Esoteric Buddhism'', London 1883&lt;/ref&gt;   In order for beings at this level to be able to do this, it would have been  necessary for them to have activated their transpersonal chakras.  Benjamin Creme and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have stated that beings at this level can teleport as far as the star [[Sirius]].  

This makes four beings at this level, according to traditional Theosophy.

In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that on January 1, 1956, Buddha advanced from the 8th level to the 9th level, becoming co-equal with ''Sanat Kumara''.

The three Pratyeka Buddhas have not been mentioned so far in any of the Ascended Master Teachings. Elizabeth Clare Prophet described and quoted from Buddhist sources on the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas]] of mainstream [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana Buddhism]]. They focus the five inner rays which together with the seven more external rays focused by the Chohans comprise the [[Ascended Master Teachings#The rays o ascension|twelve rays]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] ''Vol. 37 No. 2 The Buddhas in Winter 2 Introduction to the Five Dhyani Buddhas and Their Mandala, p2'', January 9, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tsl.org/tag/dhyani-buddhas/ "The five Dhyani Buddhas" on TSL.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ninth initiation ("godhood")==
Level nine is the "Lord of the World": '''[[Sanat Kumara]]''' –  "The Eternal Youth" and "The Ancient of Days", the [[Nordic alien]] that is believed by Theosophists to be the "Lord of the World", i.e., the governing [[deity]] of Earth.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"/&gt;

C.W. Leadbeater discussed the abilities of beings at this level.  He stated that Sanat Kumara's "consciousness is of so extended a nature that it comprehends at once all the life on our globe.  In his hands are the powers of cyclic destruction, for he wields ''Fohat'' [i.e. beams composed of "[[Micro black hole|bubbles in space]]" used by Theosophical deities to materialize or dematerialize material objects&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 19&lt;/ref&gt;] in its higher forms and can deal directly with cosmic forces outside our chain [i.e., outside our solar system]."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Page 296&lt;/ref&gt; Thus according to Leadbeater powers of beings at this level include [[omniscience]] regarding the events occurring on a single inhabited planet, [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialization]] of large objects, and the ability to affect at a distance to some degree happenings in other nearby [[planetary system]]s.  

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara has a "twin flame" (celestial wife) named '''[[Sanat Kumara#Lady Master Venus|Lady Master Venus]]''' who he brought with him from Venus, as well as a daughter named '''[[Sanat Kumara#Lady Master Meta|Lady Master Meta]]''' born to them on Venus who they brought with them to Earth, both of them presumably also functioning at the ninth level of initiation.

==Tenth initiation ("planetary logos")==
The tenth initiation is considered to symbolize perfection and is used to describe the '''Planetary Logos''', also called the '''Spirit of the Earth''', and specifically denoted as the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic being functioning within Earth|Planetary Logos of Earth]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House Chapter XXVI – "The Building of the Earth" ''The Planetary Logos'', pages 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reach the status of a ''Planetary Logos'', this being would have had to have been a high level ''[[Deva (New Age)|Planetary Deva]]'' in some other solar system before it incarnated inside our planet at the time of the [[Creation myth|creation of the world]]. According to C. W. Leadbeater, the "Planetary Logos" is functioning at the tenth level of initiation and [[Sanat Kumara]], in continuous telepathic rapport with the Planetary Logos, functions as its spokes-deity.  Since the formulation in the early 1970s by [[James Lovelock]] of the [[Gaia theory|Gaia hypothesis]], many Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings, adopting the [[Gaia philosophy]], nowadays simply refer to the "Planetary Logos of Earth" as '''[[New Age Gaian|Gaia]]''', the New Age version of what in many religions is called the [[Mother goddess#Earth Mother|Earth mother]]..

==Levels of initiation beyond the tenth level==
In the theosophical teachings of Alice Bailey, there is a powerful being living inside the sun serving the Solar Logos called the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Avatar of Synthesis]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957 Lucis Publishing Co. See "Avatar of Synthesis" in the Index&lt;/ref&gt; Its job is to transmit the [[Seven rays#Theosophy|seven rays]] from the heart of the sun through the ''seven spirits before the [solar] throne'' to all the life waves of the solar system.  According to Benjamin Creme, the ''Avatar of Synthesis'' is functioning at the ''17th level of initiation''.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share Foundation Page 72&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ascended Master Teachings, this being is called '''Ray-O-Light'''.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Ray-O-Light Page 301&lt;/ref&gt; The only master above all these levels is the Christ.

The '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]]''' itself must be at least several levels beyond the 17th level.  The ''Solar Logos'', the [[Sun God]] in Theosophy, is personified as the cosmic beings '''[[Helios]]''' and his ''twin flame'' (celestial wife) '''[[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]''', the "God and  Goddess of this [[solar system]]", in the Ascended Master Teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Helios and Vesta Page 126&lt;/ref&gt;  

Perhaps several dozen or a couple of hundred of levels above the ''Solar Logos'' would be the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Milky Way Galaxy from the galactic core|Galactic Logos]]'''.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, the ''Galactic Logos'' is personified as the cosmic being '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Milky Way Galaxy from the galactic core|Averran]]'''.

C.W. Leadbeater stated, "The ladder of being [i.e., of initiation] extends upward into clouds of light, into which few of us can yet penetrate, and when we ask those who stand higher than we and know infinitely more than we do, all they can say is that it extends beyond their sight also.  They know very many more steps of it than we do, but it goes still further, onwards and upward to unimaginable heights of glory, and no one knows its end."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Page 207&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of levels of initiation ultimately would depend on the physical size of the [[Cosmos]], because enough souls would have to climb the ladder to ensoul all the [[star]]s with ''stellar logoi'' and all the [[galaxy|galaxies]] with ''galactic logoi'', plus provide staffing for their attendant cosmic bureaucracies of angels, archangels, etc., as souls beyond them on the scale of initiation move up the ladder.  If [[Alan Guth]]'s [[inflation theory]], which states that the actual size of the Cosmos is at least fifteen [[orders of magnitude]] larger than the [[observable universe]] (itself 93,000,000,000 [[light year]]s in diameter), is correct, then there could be several hundred or even thousands of levels of initiation necessary to staff the [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structures of the cosmos]] before reaching the level of the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Cosmos from the Great Central Sun|Cosmic Logos]]'''. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the ''Cosmic Logos'' is personified as the cosmic beings '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Cosmos from the Great Central Sun|Alpha and Omega]]'''. 

If the concept of the [[Multiverse]] is true, then other hierarchies exist in [[Multiverse (religion)|other Universes]].  It is believed in Theosopy that the concept of the Multiverse is true because Theosophists have stated that the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#God|Universal Logos]]''' has created many other cosmoses besides our own.

==Initiation in popular culture==
'''[[Music]]'''
* In 1975, [[Todd Rundgren]] released an album titled ''[[Initiation (Todd Rundgren album)|Initiation]]'' which has a song called "Initiation" on side one.  The title of the album is apparently based on the Theosophical concept of Initiation as taught by Alice Bailey and [[C. W. Leadbeater]].  The entire second side of the album is taken up by a song called "A Treatise on Cosmic Fire"; the three parts of the song are listed as: "I. The Internal Fire, or Fire by Friction; II. The Fire of Spirit, or Electric Fire; The Fire of Mind, or Solar Fire." The second parts of these three phrases are taken directly from Alice A. Bailey's book ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="140348">The '''International Classification of Diseases for Oncology''' ('''ICD-O''') is a domain-specific extension of the [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] for [[tumor]] diseases. This classification is widely used by [[cancer registry|cancer registries]].

It is currently in its third revision (ICD-O-3). ICD-10 includes a list of morphology codes.  They stem from ICD-O second edition (ICD-O-2) that was valid at the time of publication.

== Axes ==
The classification has two axes: topography and morphology.

=== Morphology ===
The [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] axis is for the shape and structure of the tumor.

This axis has particular importance because the [[Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine]] ("SNOMED") has adopted the ICD-O classification of morphology. SNOMED has been changing continuously, and several different versions of SNOMED are in use. Accordingly, mapping of ICD-O codes to SNOMED requires careful assessment of whether entities are indeed true matches.

=== Topography ===
The [[topographical code|topography]] axis is for of the tumor's site in the body. It is standardized with the C section of [[ICD|ICD-10]].

There were no changes in the topography axis between ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3.

See [[List of ICD-10 codes#(C00–C97) Malignant Neoplasms]] for examples.

== International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) ==

=== 5th Digit Behaviour Code for Neoplasms ===
* '''/0''' Benign
* '''/1''' Uncertain whether benign or malignant

In [[software engineering]], '''inversion of control''' ('''IoC''') is a design principle in which custom-written portions of a [[computer program]] receive the [[control flow|flow of control]] from a generic [[Software framework|framework]]. A [[software architecture]] with this design inverts control as compared to traditional [[procedural programming]]: in traditional programming, the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program [[function call#Main concepts|calls]] into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.

Inversion of control is used to increase [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] of the program and make it [[Extensible programming|extensible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.laputan.org/drc/drc.html | title=Designing Reusable Classes | publisher=Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign | work=Journal of Object-Oriented Programming, Volume 1, Number 2 | date=June–July 1988 | accessdate=29 April 2014 | author=Ralph E. Johnson &amp; Brian Foote | pages=22–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has applications in [[object-oriented programming]] and other [[programming paradigm]]s. The term was used by Michael Mattsson in a thesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Mattsson/publication/2238535_Object-Oriented_Frameworks/links/54d0a8ed0cf298d65667af54.pdf | title=Object-Oriented Frameworks, A survey of methodological issues | author=Michael Mattsson |  date=Feb 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;, taken from there&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/38/ | title=On Inversion of Control | date=Jan 22, 2004 | author=Stefano Mazzocchi | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202120126/http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/38/ | archivedate=2 February 2004 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Stefano Mazzocchi and popularized by him in 1999 in a defunct Apache Software Foundation project, [[Apache Avalon|Avalon]], then further popularized in 2004 by [[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C. Martin]] and [[Martin Fowler]].

The term is related to, but different from, the [[dependency inversion principle]], which concerns itself with [[Dependency (computer science)|decoupling dependencies]] between [[high- and low-level|high-level and low-level]]  [[Abstraction layer|layers]] through shared [[Abstraction (computing)|abstractions]]. The general concept is also related to [[event-driven programming]] in that it is often implemented using IoC, so that the custom code is commonly only concerned with the handling of events, whereas the [[event loop]] and dispatch of events/messages is handled by the framework or the runtime environment.

== Overview ==
As an example, with traditional programming, the [[main function]] of an application might make function calls into a menu library to display a list of available [[Command (computing)|commands]] and query the user to select one.&lt;ref name=FowlerDI/&gt; The library thus would return the chosen option as the value of the function call, and the main function uses this value to execute the associated command. This style was common in [[text based interface]]s. For example, an [[email client]] may show a screen with commands to load new mails, answer the current mail, start a new mail, etc., and the program execution would block until the user presses a key to select a command.

With inversion of control, on the other hand, the program would be written using a [[software framework]] that knows common behavioral and graphical elements, such as [[windowing system]]s, menus, controlling the mouse, and so on. The custom code "fills in the blanks" for the framework, such as supplying a table of menu items and registering a code subroutine for each item, but it is the framework that monitors the user's actions and invokes the subroutine when a menu item is selected. In the mail client example, the framework could follow both the keyboard and mouse inputs and call the command invoked by the user by either means, and at the same time monitor the [[network interface]] to find out if new messages arrive and refresh the screen when some network activity is detected. The same framework could be used as the skeleton for a spreadsheet program or a text editor. Conversely, the framework knows nothing about Web browsers, spreadsheets or text editors; implementing their functionality takes custom code.

Inversion of control carries the strong connotation that the reusable code and the problem-specific code are developed independently even though they operate together in an application. [[Software framework]]s, [[Callback (computer programming)|callback]]s, [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]]s, [[event loop]]s, [[dependency injection]], and the [[template method]] are examples of [[design pattern]]s that follow the inversion of control principle, although the term is most commonly used in the context of [[object-oriented programming]].

Inversion of control serves the following design purposes:
* To [[Object decoupling|decouple]] the execution of a task from implementation.
* To focus a module on the task it is designed for.
* To free modules from assumptions about how other systems do what they do and instead rely on [[design by contract|contracts]].
* To prevent [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]]s when replacing a module.

Inversion of control is sometimes facetiously referred to as the "Hollywood Principle: Don't call us, we'll call you".

== Background ==

Inversion of control is not a new term in computer science. [[Martin Fowler]] traces the etymology of the phrase back to 1988,&lt;ref name=FowlerIoC&gt;[http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InversionOfControl.html Inversion of Control] on Martin Fowler's Bliki&lt;/ref&gt; but it is closely 
related to the concept of '''program inversion''' described by [[Michael A. Jackson|Michael Jackson]] in his [[Jackson Structured Programming]] methodology in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jacksonworkbench.co.uk/stevefergspages/papers/ourusoff--introduction_to_jackson_design_method.pdf | title=Introduction to Jackson Design Method}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Bottom-up parsing|bottom-up parser]] can be seen as an inversion of a [[Top-down parsing|top-down parser]]: in the one case, the 
control lies with the parser, in the other case, it lies with the receiving application.

[[Dependency injection]] is a specific type of IoC.&lt;ref name=FowlerDI&gt;[http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html Dependency Injection].&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Service locator pattern|service locator]] such as the [[Java Naming and Directory Interface]] (JNDI) is similar. In an article by Loek Bergman,&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://loekbergman.nl/InsideArchitecture/TheVision/InversionOfControl |date=* }} Inside Architecture: write once, run anywhere by Loek Bergman&lt;/ref&gt; it is presented as an architectural principle.

In an article by [[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C. Martin]],&lt;ref name="robertmartin"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041221102842/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf The Dependency Inversion principle] by Robert C. Martin&lt;/ref&gt; the dependency inversion principle and abstraction by layering come together. His reason to use the term "inversion" is in comparison with traditional software development methods. He describes the uncoupling of services by the abstraction of layers when he is talking about dependency inversion. The principle is used to find out where system borders are in the design of the abstraction layers.

== Description ==

In traditional programming, the [[control flow|flow]] of the [[business logic]] is determined by objects that are [[Static binding|statically bound]] to one another. With inversion of control, the flow depends on the object graph that is built up during program execution. Such a dynamic flow is made possible by object interactions that are defined through abstractions. This [[Late binding|run-time binding]] is achieved by mechanisms such as [[dependency injection]] or a [[Service locator pattern|service locator]]. In IoC, the code could also be linked statically during compilation, but finding the code to execute by reading its description from [[Configuration file|external configuration]] instead of with a direct reference in the code itself.

In dependency injection, a dependent [[object-oriented programming|object]] or module is coupled to the object it needs at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]]. Which particular object will satisfy the dependency during program execution typically cannot be known at [[compile time]] using [[static code analysis|static analysis]]. While described in terms of object interaction here, the principle can apply to other programming methodologies besides [[object-oriented programming]].

In order for the running program to bind objects to one another, the objects must possess compatible [[Software interface|interfaces]]. For example, class &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; may delegate behavior to interface &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; which is implemented by class &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;; the program instantiates &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, and then injects &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.

== Implementation techniques ==

In [[object-oriented programming]], there are several basic techniques to implement inversion of control. These are:
* Using a [[service locator pattern]]
* Using [[dependency injection]], for example
** Constructor injection
** Parameter injection
** Setter injection
** Interface injection
* Using a contextualized lookup
* Using [[template method design pattern]]
* Using [[strategy design pattern]]

In an original article by Martin Fowler,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection Pattern] by Martin Fowler&lt;/ref&gt; the first three different techniques are discussed. In a description about inversion of control types,&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.codehaus.org/display/PICO/IoC+Types IoC Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615045650/http://docs.codehaus.org/display/PICO/IoC+Types |date=15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the last one is mentioned. Often the contextualized lookup will be accomplished using a service locator

==Examples==
Most frameworks such as [[.NET Framework|.NET]] or [[Enterprise Java]] display this pattern:

&lt;source lang="Java"&gt;
public class ServerFacade {
   public &lt;K, V&gt; V respondToRequest(K request) {
      if (businessLayer.validateRequest(request)) {
         DAO.getData(request);
         return Aspect.convertData(request);
      }
      return null;
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This basic outline in Java gives an example of code following the IoC methodology. It is important, however, that in the {{Java|ServerFacade}} a lot of assumptions are made about the data returned by the [[data access object]] (DAO).

Although all these assumptions might be valid at some time, they couple the implementation of the {{Java|ServerFacade}} to the DAO implementation. Designing the application in the manner of inversion of control would hand over the control completely to the DAO object. The code would then become

&lt;source lang="Java"&gt;
public class ServerFacade {
   public &lt;K, V&gt; V respondToRequest(K request, DAO dao) {
      return dao.getData(request);
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The example shows that the way the method {{Java|respondToRequest}} is constructed determines if IoC is used. It is the way that parameters are used that define IoC. This resembles the [[Message Passing|message-passing]] style that some object-oriented programming languages use.

In [[United States copyright law]] and [[jurisprudence]] established under the doctrine of ''[[stare decisis]]'' by the case of ''Netbula, LLC v. Symantec Corp.'', 516 F. Supp.2d 1137 ([[United States District Court for the Ninth District of California|N.D.Cal.]] 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Netbula, LLC v. Symantec Corp., 516 F. Supp.2d 1137 (N.D.Cal. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and related cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decoderpro.com/k/docket/218.pdf] Netbula, LLC v. Storage Technology Corporation et al., 2008 U.S. Dist LEXIS 4119 (N.D. Cal., January 18, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The cases defined the boundaries of [[property rights]] and contractual rights in the licensing of [[digital works]].  It is so called because the cases were decided by two renowned American judges and leading jurists, former U.S. District Judge [[Martin Jenkins]] (now a [[Justice]] in [[California Courts of Appeal]]) and Magistrate Judge Elizabeth D. Laporte.

The basic principles of the doctrine can be summarized:

(1) If an accused infringer did not see or agree to copy restriction, there was no infringement;

(2) A "one user on one computer" restriction does not limit the scope of a software license, it's an independent contractual covenant;

(3) A termination clause in the license agreement does not limit the scope of the license, it's an independent contractual covenant.

The ingenious observation Justice Jenkins made was that in a copyright action, although license is an affirmative defense to infringement, the "plaintiff’s initial hurdle is proving the terms of the license." 516 F. Supp. 2d at 1151. The Jenkins–Laporte doctrine provides a legal foundation for circumvention of the exclusive rights provided by the Copyright Act, as the doctrine requires the copyright owner to prove the negative.

'''Jovita Idár''' (September 7, 1885, &amp;ndash; June 15, 1946) was an American journalist, political activist and civil rights worker, who fought for the rights of Mexican Americans and women. She worked as a teacher but turned to journalism and worked at her father's newspaper, ''La Crónica''.&lt;ref&gt;“Texas Originals.” Jovita Idár | Humanities Texas, [http://www.humanitiestexas.org/programs/tx-originals/list/jovita-idar www.humanitiestexas.org/programs/tx-originals/list/jovita-idar]. Retrieved 02 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Years ==
Jovita Idár was born in [[Laredo, Texas]] in 1885.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Handbook of Texas Online - Idar, Jovita.
http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fid03. Retrieved on 2009-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of eight children of Jovita and Nicasio Idár &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Nancy Baker|title=IDAR JOVITA|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fid03|website=TSHA|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; who strove to advance the civil rights of Mexican-Americans. All eight Idar children grew up in an atmosphere where rights, responsibilities and the circumstances of the Chicano community were consistently discussed. In the book ''Marching to a Different Drummer,'' Robin Kadison Berson explains “Growing up Jovita was an imaginative, spirited girl; eager student, she won prizes for her poetry and enjoyed reciting before an audience.”&lt;ref&gt;Berson, Robin Kadison.Marching to a Different Drummer: Unrecognized Heroes of American History.Greenwood Publishing Group,1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Idár and two of her brothers, Eduardo and Bobby Brown, worked for the newspaper ''La Crónica'' [The Chronicles]. The paper, edited and published by their father Nicasio Idár, advocated for civil rights and social justice for [[Mexican-American]]s. A strong, proud man, Nicasio turned the newspaper into a major voice for justice and [[Tejano]] rights. Jovita wrote articles under a pseudonym, exposing the poor living conditions of Mexican-American workers and supported the [[Mexican Revolution]] which began in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Pouwels, Joel Bollinger. ''Political Journalism by Mexican Women During the Age of Revolution 1876-1940''. Edwin Mellon Press, 2006, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez-Witt, Laura. "Cultural Continuity in the Face of Change: Hispanic Printers in Texas". In ''Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage'', Vol. II. (Eds. [[Erlinda Gonzales-Berry]] and Chuck Tatum). Arte Publico Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Laura Gutierrez in volume two of ''Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage'', the newspaper ''La Crónica'':&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez-Witt 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|... including a wide variety of articles dealing with current events, news from Mexico, local and regional news, biographical and historical essays, poetry, literary essays, commentary, and, of course, lots of advertisements. More importantly, however, La Cronica gave voice to the serious social and economic disparities suffered by Mexicans in Texas and the U.S.}}

== Career ==
Idár earned her teaching certificate in 1903 from the [[Holding Institute]] in Laredo.&lt;ref&gt;Pouwels, ''Political Journalism by Mexican Women''.&lt;/ref&gt; She taught in a school in [[Los Ojuelos]], located approximately 40 miles east of Laredo.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Texas - Idar, Joavita&lt;/ref&gt; The reality of her first years teaching was frustrating, “There was never enough textbooks for her pupils, nor enough paper, pens or pencils; if all her students came to class, there were not enough chairs or desk for them.”.&lt;ref&gt;Berson, Robin Kadison.Marching to a Different Drummer: Unrecognized Heroes of American		 History.Greenwood Publishing Group,1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The schooling for Chicano students, much like African American students in the south at that time, was inadequate. Chicanos paid taxes to support decent schooling for their children yet, they were denied from entering. By this time Idar realized that her teaching efforts were making little impact on student lives due to the ill-equipped segregated schools. She decided that journalism offered more of a meaningful change that would be effective and she returned to Laredo to write for ''La Cronica''. In 1910 La Cronica criticized the different social relations between the Hispanic communities and the Anglo people, “Featuring stories on educational and social discrimination against Mexican Americans, poor economic conditions, decreasing use of the Spanish language, the loss of Mexican culture and lynching of Hispanics.”&lt;ref&gt;JONES, NANCY BAKER."IDAR, JOVITA."JONES, NANCY BAKER. June 14, 2010.Accessed February 12, 2018. https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fid03.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1911 La Cronica had shifted towards supporting revolutionary forces, “the newspaper called a convention of the Orden Caballeros de Honor, a fraternal order to discuss the troubling social issues at the time”

== Movements ==
'''La Liga Femenil (League of Mexican Women)'''

Idár served as the first president of the League of Mexican Women (La Liga Femenil Mexicanista). It was founded in October 1911 in Laredo to offer free education to Mexican children.&lt;ref&gt;Villegas de Magnón, Leonor. ''The Rebel''. Arte Publico Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional goals of the organization were to "unify the Mexican intellectuals of Texas around the issues of protection of civil rights, bilingual education, the lynching of Mexicans, labor organizing and women's concerns."&lt;ref&gt;Lomas, Clara. "Historical Newspapers". In ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Latinos and Latinas in the United States''. (Eds. Suzanne Oboler and Deena J. González). Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The women within this league worked to transform these injustices into a plan of action and focused on relieving social problems through actively making changes within their communities. Women who participated in this organization were highly influential. “Some league members were trained educators and professionals, and the education of youth remained the organization's primary focus.”&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, Raĺul A., and Monica Perales. Recovering the U.S Hispanic Literary Heritage Series:		 Recovering the Hispanic History of Texas. Arte Publico Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It developed into a social, political and charitable organization for women that, in part, provided food and clothes to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Texas Online - Liga Femenil Mexicanista.

'''Primer Congreso Mexicanista'''

Idar also participated in the Primer Congreso Mexicanista,&lt;ref&gt;Meier, Matt S. and Margo Gutierrez. ''Encyclopedia of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement''. Greenwood Press, 2000, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; an organization dedicated to fighting inequality and racism.&lt;ref&gt;Pardo, Mary S. "Latina Labor and Community Organizers". In The Oxford Encyclopedia of Latinos and Latinas in the United States." (Eds. Suzanne Oboler and Deena J. González). Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; These associations actively worked for the advancement of their members, “by holding studying and learning sessions, sessions where culture is acquired and talent is developed without orgies and unhealthy ambitions.”&lt;ref name="Turner, Elizabeth Hayes 2015"&gt;Turner, Elizabeth Hayes, Stephanie Cole, and Rebecca Sharpless. Texas women: their histories, their lives. Athens, GA: The University of Georgia Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Idar promoted the values of the "gente decente," self-identified decent, honest and respectable people, as the solution to the social problems faced by marginalized communities, “Idar promoted the idea that education elevated women and by extension men”&lt;ref name="Turner, Elizabeth Hayes 2015"/&gt; she reflected an ideal of feminism that was not completely against Victorian concepts, but she did challenge ideas and broke boundaries of the patriarchal society of her time.

In 1913 during the [[Mexican Revolution]] Idár and a friend entered Mexico to help care for the wounded along the border region. She later joined a medical group called the White Cross ([[La Cruz Blanca]]) which was similar to the Red Cross relief organization.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Texas - Idar, Jovita.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Laredo Idár worked for the newspaper ''El Progreso'' where she protested against the dispatch of U.S troops to border through a written editorial. This offended the U.S Army and [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], causing the rangers to force the shutdown of ''El Progreso''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Nancy Baker|title=IDAR, JOVITA|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fid03|website=TSHA|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her father's death in 1914, she eventually returned to operate ''La Crónica'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Nancy Baker|title=Jovita Idar|url=https://www.womenintexashistory.org/audio/idar/|website=Women in Texas History|publisher=Venue Communications, Inc|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she continued to expose the conditions that Mexican-Americans and Mexican immigrants were living under at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She also founded the weekly paper ''Evolución'' in November 1916 which lasted four years.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Marriage and Later Years ==
In May 1917 Idár married Bartolo Juárez, who worked as a plumber and tinsmith.&lt;ref&gt;''Laredo Times''. May 27, 1917, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; She moved with her husband to [[San Antonio]] in 1921. There she founded a free kindergarten and also volunteered in a hospital as an interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Texas Women|url=https://texaswomen.housing.utexas.edu/pdfs/GTWContent.pdf|publisher=UTSA 's Institute of Texas Cultures|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 she co-edited the journal ''El Heraldo Cristiano''.&lt;ref&gt;Villegas de Magnón.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5211">In [[computer science]], the '''Krauss matching wildcards algorithm''' is a [[pattern matching]] algorithm. Based on the [[wildcard character|wildcard syntax]] in common use, e.g. in the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[command-line interface]], the algorithm provides a non-[[Recursion|recursive]] mechanism for matching patterns in software applications, based on syntax simpler than that typically offered by [[regular expression]]s.

== History ==
The algorithm is based on a history of development, correctness and performance testing, and programmer feedback that began with an unsuccessful search for a reliable non-recursive algorithm for matching wildcards. An initial algorithm, implemented in a single while loop, quickly prompted comments from software developers, leading to improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Krauss| first=Kirk| title=Matching Wildcards: An Algorithm| publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]| year=2008| url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/matching-wildcards-an-algorithm/210200888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing comments and suggestions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=wild card searching| publisher=alt.os.development| year=2008| url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.os.development/8-rIaarASu8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=T.J.| title=wild card matching in text string| year=2014| publisher=Stack Overflow| url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21409588/wild-card-matching-in-text-string}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminated in a revised algorithm still implemented in a single while loop but refined based on a collection of [[test case]]s and a [[profiling (computer programming)|performance profiler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Krauss| first=Kirk| title=Matching Wildcards: An Empirical Way to Tame an Algorithm| publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]| year=2014| url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/matching-wildcards-an-empirical-way-to-t/240169123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience tuning the single while loop using the profiler prompted development of a two-loop strategy that achieved further performance gains, particularly in situations involving empty input strings or input containing no wildcard characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Krauss| first=Kirk| title=Matching Wildcards: An Improved Algorithm for Big Data| publisher=Develop for Performance| year=2018| url=http://www.developforperformance.com/MatchingWildcards_AnImprovedAlgorithmForBigData.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-loop algorithm is available for use by the [[open-source software]] development community, under the terms of the [[Apache License]] v. 2.0, and is accompanied by test case code.

== Usage ==
The algorithm made available under the Apache license is implemented in both [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]-based [[C++]] and portable C++ (implemented without pointers). The test case code, also available under the Apache license, can be applied to any algorithm that provides the pattern matching operations below. The implementation as coded is unable to handle [[Variable-width encoding|multibyte character sets]] and poses problems when the text being searched may contain multiple incompatible character sets.

== Pattern matching operations ==
The algorithm supports three pattern matching operations:
* A one-to-one match is performed between the pattern and the source to be checked for a match, with the exception of asterisk ([[*]]) or question mark ([[?]]) characters in the pattern.
* An asterisk ([[*]]) character matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
* A question mark ([[?]]) character matches any single character.

== Examples ==
* ''*foo*''  	  matches any string containing "foo".
* ''mini*''       matches any string that begins with "mini" (including the string "mini" itself).
* ''???*''        matches any string of three or more letters.

== Applications ==
The original algorithm has been ported to the [[DataFlex]] programming language by Larry Heiges&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Data Access Worldwide Code Library| last=Heiges| first=Larry| title=Text compare function - generalTextCompare.txt| year=2008| url=https://support.dataaccess.com/Forums/showthread.php?1064-Text-compare-function-generalTextCompare-txt-(0-1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use with [[Visual DataFlex|Data Access Worldwide]] code library. It has been posted on GitHub in modified form as part of a log file reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Deniskore| work=Popular repositories| title=Deniskore/wildcard/CLogReader.cpp| publisher=GitHub| year=2013| url=https://github.com/Deniskore/wildcard/blob/master/CLogReader.cpp}} Lines 173-279.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 algorithm is part of the Unreal Model Viewer built into the Epic Games [[Unreal Engine]] [[game engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=gildor2| work=Unreal Engine Model Viewer (UE Viewer)| title=UModel/Core/Core.cpp| publisher=GitHub| year=2016| url=https://github.com/gildor2/UModel/blob/master/Core/Core.cpp}} Lines 334-435.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=gildor2| work=Unreal Engine Model Viewer (UE Viewer)| title=History for UModel/Core/Core.cpp| year=2016| url=https://github.com/gildor2/UModel/commits/master/Core/Core.cpp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2671">{{general relativity}}
In [[general relativity]], a '''manifestly covariant''' equation is one in which all expressions are [[tensor]]s.  The operations of addition, [[tensor multiplication]], [[tensor contraction]], [[raising and lowering indices]], and [[covariant differentiation]] may appear in the equation.  Forbidden terms include but are not restricted to [[partial derivatives]].  [[Tensor density|Tensor densities]], especially integrands and variables of integration, may be allowed in manifestly covariant equations if they are clearly weighted by the appropriate power of the [[determinant]] of the metric.  

Writing an equation in manifestly covariant form is useful because it guarantees [[general covariance]] upon quick inspection.  If an equation is manifestly covariant, and if it reduces to a correct, corresponding equation in [[special relativity]] when evaluated instantaneously in a [[local inertial frame]], then it is usually the correct generalization of the special relativistic equation in general relativity.

== Example ==

An equation may be [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz covariant]] even if it is not manifestly covariant.  Consider the [[electromagnetic field tensor]]

:&lt;math&gt;F_{ab} \, = \, \partial_a A_b \, - \, \partial_b A_a \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electromagnetic four-potential]] in the [[Lorenz gauge]].  The equation above contains partial derivatives and is therefore not manifestly covariant.  Note that the partial derivatives may be written in terms of covariant derivatives and [[Christoffel symbol]]s as

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_a A_b = \nabla_a A_b + \Gamma^c_{ab} A_c&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_b A_a = \nabla_b A_a + \Gamma^c_{ba} A_c&lt;/math&gt;

For a [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]-free metric assumed in general relativity, we may appeal to the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^c_{ab} - \Gamma^c_{ba} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which allows the field tensor to be written in manifestly covariant form

:&lt;math&gt;F_{ab} \, = \, \nabla_a A_b \, - \, \nabla_b A_a .&lt;/math&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}} 
A '''mathematical model''' is a description of a [[system]] using [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and [[Language of mathematics|language]]. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed '''mathematical modeling'''. Mathematical models are used in the [[natural science]]s (such as [[physics]], [[biology]], [[earth science]], [[chemistry]]) and [[engineering]] disciplines (such as [[computer science]], [[electrical engineering]]), as well      as in the [[social sciences]] (such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]]). 

A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.

== Elements of a mathematical model ==

Mathematical models can take many forms, including [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].  These and other types of models can overlap, with a given  model involving a variety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include [[model theory|logical models]].  In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments.  Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed.

In the [[physical sciences]], a traditional mathematical model contains most of the following elements:
# [[Governing equation|Governing equations]]
# Supplementary sub-models
## [[Defining equation (physics)|Defining equations]]
## [[Constitutive equation|Constitutive equations]]
# Assumptions and constraints
## [[Initial condition|Initial]] and [[Boundary condition|boundary conditions]]
## [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|Classical constraints]] and [[Kinematics|kinematic equations]]

== Classifications ==
Mathematical models are usually composed of relationships and ''[[variable (mathematics)|variables]]''. Relationships can be described by ''[[Operator (mathematics)|operators]]'', such as algebraic operators, functions, differential operators, etc. Variables are abstractions of system [[parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] of interest, that can be [[Quantification (science)|quantified]]. Several classification criteria can be used for mathematical models according to their structure:
* '''Linear vs. nonlinear:''' If all the operators in a mathematical model exhibit [[linear]]ity, the resulting mathematical model is defined as linear. A model is considered to be nonlinear otherwise. The definition of linearity and nonlinearity is dependent on context, and linear models may have nonlinear expressions in them.  For example, in a [[Linear model|statistical linear model]], it is assumed that a relationship is linear in the parameters, but it may be nonlinear in the predictor variables.  Similarly, a differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written with linear [[differential operator]]s, but it can still have nonlinear expressions in it.  In a [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] model, if the objective functions and constraints are represented entirely by [[linear equation]]s, then the model is regarded as a linear model.  If one or more of the objective functions or constraints are represented with a [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] equation, then the model is known as a nonlinear model.&lt;br&gt;Nonlinearity, even in fairly simple systems, is often associated with phenomena such as [[Chaos theory|chaos]] and [[irreversibility]].  Although there are exceptions, nonlinear systems and models tend to be more difficult to study than linear ones.  A common approach to nonlinear problems is [[linearization]], but this can be problematic if one is trying to study aspects such as irreversibility, which are strongly tied to nonlinearity.
* '''Static vs. dynamic:''' A ''dynamic'' model  accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the system, while a ''static'' (or steady-state) model calculates the system in equilibrium, and thus is time-invariant.  Dynamic models typically are represented by [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s.
* '''Explicit vs. implicit:''' If all of the input parameters of the overall model are known, and the output parameters can be calculated by a finite series of computations, the model is said to be ''explicit''. But sometimes it is the ''output'' parameters which are known, and the corresponding inputs must be solved for by an iterative procedure, such as [[Newton's method]] (if the model is linear) or [[Broyden's method]] (if non-linear). In such a case the model is said to be ''implicit''. For example, a [[jet engine]]'s physical properties such as turbine and nozzle throat areas can be explicitly calculated given a design [[thermodynamic cycle]] (air and fuel flow rates, pressures, and temperatures) at a specific flight condition and power setting, but the engine's operating cycles at other flight conditions and power settings cannot be explicitly calculated from the constant physical properties.
* '''Discrete vs. continuous:''' A [[discrete modeling|discrete model]] treats objects as discrete, such as the particles in a [[molecular model]] or the states in a [[statistical model]]; while a [[continuous model]] represents the objects in a continuous manner, such as the velocity field of fluid in pipe flows, temperatures and stresses in a solid, and electric field that applies continuously over the entire model due to a point charge.
* '''Deterministic vs. probabilistic (stochastic):''' A [[deterministic system|deterministic]] model is one in which every set of variable states is uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables; therefore, a deterministic model always performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions. Conversely, in a stochastic model—usually called a "[[statistical model]]"—randomness is present, and variable states are not described by unique values, but rather by [[probability]] distributions.
* '''Deductive, inductive, or floating:''' A deductive model is a logical structure based on a theory. An inductive model arises from empirical findings and generalization from them. The floating model rests on neither theory nor observation, but is merely the invocation of expected structure. Application of mathematics in social sciences outside of economics has been criticized for unfounded models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stanislav Andreski |first=Stanislav |last=Andreski |year=1972 |title=Social Sciences as Sorcery |publisher=[[St. Martin’s Press]] |isbn=0-14-021816-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of [[catastrophe theory]] in science has been characterized as a floating model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Clifford Truesdell |first=Clifford |last=Truesdell |year=1984 |title=An Idiot’s Fugitive Essays on Science |pages=121–7 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-90703-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance in the natural sciences ==
Mathematical models are of great importance in the natural sciences, particularly in [[physics]]. Physical [[theory|theories]] are almost invariably expressed using mathematical models.

Throughout history, more and more accurate mathematical models have been developed. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] accurately describe many everyday phenomena, but at certain limits [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]] must be used; even these do not apply to all situations and need further refinement{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Examples|date=September 2017}}. It is possible to obtain the less accurate models in appropriate limits, for example relativistic mechanics reduces to Newtonian mechanics at speeds much less than the [[speed of light]]. Quantum mechanics reduces to classical physics when the quantum numbers are high. For example, the [[de Broglie wavelength]] of a tennis ball is insignificantly small, so classical physics is a good approximation to use in this case.

It is common to use idealized models in physics to simplify things. Massless ropes, point particles, [[ideal gases]] and the [[particle in a box]] are among the many simplified models used in physics. The laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as Newton's laws, [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. These laws are such as a basis for making mathematical models of real situations. Many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximate on a computer, a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws. For example, molecules can be modeled by [[molecular orbital]] models that are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation. In [[engineering]], physics models are often made by mathematical methods such as [[finite element analysis]].

Different mathematical models use different geometries that are not necessarily accurate descriptions of the geometry of the universe. [[Euclidean geometry]] is much used in classical physics, while [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]] are examples of theories that use [[geometry|geometries]] which are not Euclidean.

== Some applications==&lt;!--whatever this section is, it isn't background (original heading), and isn't general--&gt;
Since [[prehistory|prehistorical times]] simple models such as [[map]]s and [[Mathematical diagram|diagrams]] have been used.

Often when engineers analyze a system to be controlled or optimized, they use a mathematical model. In analysis, engineers can build a descriptive model of the system as a hypothesis of how the system could work, or try to estimate how an unforeseeable event could affect the system. Similarly, in control of a system, engineers can try out different control approaches in [[simulation]]s.

A mathematical model usually describes a system by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of variables and a set of equations that establish relationships between the variables. Variables may be of many types; [[Real number|real]] or [[integer]] numbers, [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values or [[String (computing)|strings]], for example. The variables represent some properties of the system, for example, measured system outputs often in the form of [[Signal (electronics)|signals]], [[Chronometry|timing data]], counters, and event occurrence (yes/no). The actual model is the set of functions that describe the relations between the different variables.

== Building blocks ==
In [[business]] and [[engineering]], mathematical models may be used to maximize a certain output. The system under consideration will require certain inputs. The system relating inputs to outputs depends on other variables too: [[decision theory|decision variables]], [[state variable]]s, [[Exogeny|exogenous]] variables, and [[random variable]]s.

Decision variables are sometimes known as independent variables.  Exogenous variables are sometimes known as [[parameter]]s or [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]s.
The variables are not independent of each other as the state variables are dependent on the decision, input, random, and exogenous variables.  Furthermore, the output variables are dependent on the state of the system (represented by the state variables).

[[Goal|Objective]]s and [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s of the system and its users can be represented as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the output variables or state variables.  The [[objective function]]s will depend on the perspective of the model's user.  Depending on the context, an objective function is also known as an ''index of performance'', as it is some measure of interest to the user.  Although there is no limit to the number of objective functions and constraints a model can have, using or optimizing the model becomes more involved (computationally) as the number increases.

For example, [[economist]]s often apply [[linear algebra]] when using [[input-output model]]s. Complicated mathematical models that have many variables may be consolidated by use of [[vector space|vectors]] where one symbol represents several variables.

== A priori information ==
[[File:Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png|thumb|480px|To analyse something with a typical "black box approach", only  the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) ''box''. The usual representation of this ''black box system''  is a [[data flow diagram]] centered in the box.]]

Mathematical modeling problems are often classified into [[black box]] or [[White box (software engineering)|white box]] models, according to how much [[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]] information on the system is available. A black-box model is a system of which there is no a priori information available. A white-box model (also called glass box or clear box) is a system where all necessary information is available. Practically all systems are somewhere between the black-box and white-box models, so this concept is useful only as an intuitive guide for deciding which approach to take.

Usually it is preferable to use as much a priori information as possible to make the model more accurate. Therefore, the white-box models are usually considered easier, because if you have used the information correctly, then the model will behave correctly. Often the a priori information comes in forms of knowing the type of functions relating different variables. For example, if we make a model of how a medicine works in a human system, we know that usually the amount of medicine in the blood is an [[exponential decay|exponentially decaying]] function. But we are still left with several unknown parameters; how rapidly does the medicine amount decay, and what is the initial amount of medicine in blood? This example is therefore not a completely white-box model. These parameters have to be estimated through some means before one can use the model.

In black-box models one tries to estimate both the functional form of relations between variables and the numerical parameters in those functions. Using a priori information we could end up, for example, with a set of functions that probably could describe the system adequately. If there is no a priori information we would try to use functions as general as possible to cover all different models. An often used approach for black-box models are [[artificial neural network|neural networks]] which usually do not make assumptions about incoming data. Alternatively the NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs) algorithms which were developed as part of [[nonlinear system identification]] &lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. (2013), ''Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains'', Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to select the model terms, determine the model structure, and estimate the unknown parameters in the presence of correlated and nonlinear noise. The advantage of NARMAX models compared to neural networks is that NARMAX produces models that can be written down and related to the underlying process, whereas neural networks produce an approximation that is opaque.

=== Subjective information ===
Sometimes it is useful to incorporate subjective information into a mathematical model.  This can be done based on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[experience]], or [[expert opinion]], or based on convenience of mathematical form.  [[Bayesian statistics]] provides a theoretical framework for incorporating such subjectivity into a rigorous analysis: we specify a [[prior probability distribution]] (which can be subjective), and then update this distribution based on empirical data.

An example of when such approach would be necessary is a situation in which an experimenter bends a coin slightly and tosses it once, recording whether it comes up heads, and is then given the task of predicting the probability that the next flip comes up heads.  After bending the coin, the true probability that the coin will come up heads is unknown; so the experimenter would need to make a decision (perhaps by looking at the shape of the coin) about what prior distribution to use.  Incorporation of such subjective information might be important to get an accurate estimate of the probability.

== Complexity ==
In general, model complexity involves a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy of the model.  [[Occam's razor]] is a principle particularly relevant to modeling, its essential idea being that among models with roughly equal predictive power, the simplest one is the most desirable.  While added complexity usually improves the realism of a model, it can make the model difficult to understand and analyze, and can also pose computational problems, including [[numerical instability]].  [[Thomas Kuhn]] argues that as science progresses, explanations tend to become more complex before a [[paradigm shift]] offers radical simplification {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

For example, when modeling the flight of an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model. Additionally, the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system, because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model. It is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size. Engineers often can accept some approximations in order to get a more robust and simple model. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[classical mechanics]] is an approximated model of the real world. Still, Newton's model is quite sufficient for most ordinary-life situations, that is, as long as particle speeds are well below the [[speed of light]], and we study macro-particles only.

== Training and tuning ==
Any model which is not pure white-box contains some [[parameter]]s that can be used to fit the model to the system it is intended to describe. If the modeling is done by an [[artificial neural network]] or other [[machine learning]], the optimization of parameters is called ''training''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Why|date=September 2017}}, while the optimization of model hyperparameters is called ''tuning'' and often uses [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. In more conventional modeling through explicitly given mathematical functions, parameters are often determined by ''[[curve fitting]]''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

== Model evaluation ==
A crucial part of the modeling process is the evaluation of whether or not a given mathematical model describes a system accurately.  This question can be difficult to answer as it involves several different types of evaluation.

=== Fit to empirical data ===
Usually the easiest part of model evaluation is checking whether a model fits experimental measurements or other empirical data.  In models with parameters, a common approach to test this fit is to split the data into two disjoint subsets: training data and verification data. The training data are used to estimate the model parameters.  An accurate model will closely match the verification data even though these data were not used to set the model's parameters. This practice is referred to as [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] in statistics.

Defining a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] to measure distances between observed and predicted data is a useful tool of assessing model fit.  In statistics, decision theory, and some [[economic model]]s, a [[loss function]] plays a similar role.

While it is rather straightforward to test the appropriateness of parameters, it can be more difficult to test the validity of the general mathematical form of a model.  In general, more mathematical tools have been developed to test the fit of [[statistical model]]s than models involving [[differential equations]].  Tools from [[non-parametric statistics]] can sometimes be used to evaluate how well the data fit a known distribution or to come up with a general model that makes only minimal assumptions about the model's mathematical form.

=== Scope of the model ===
Assessing the scope of a model, that is, determining what situations the model is applicable to, can be less straightforward.  If the model was constructed based on a set of data, one must determine for which systems or situations the known data is a "typical" set of data.

The question of whether the model describes well the properties of the system between data points is called [[interpolation]], and the same question for events or data points outside the observed data is called [[extrapolation]].

As an example of the typical limitations of the scope of a model, in evaluating Newtonian [[classical mechanics]], we can note that Newton made his measurements without advanced equipment, so he could not measure properties of particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light.  Likewise, he did not measure the movements of molecules and other small particles, but macro particles only. It is then not surprising that his model does not extrapolate well into these domains, even though his model is quite sufficient for ordinary life physics.

=== Philosophical considerations ===
Many types of modeling implicitly involve claims about [[causality]].  This is usually (but not always) true of models involving differential equations.  As the purpose of modeling is to increase our understanding of the world, the validity of a model rests not only on its fit to empirical observations, but also on its ability to extrapolate to situations or data beyond those originally described in the model. One can think of this as the differentiation between qualitative and quantitative predictions. One can also argue that a model is worthless unless it provides some insight which goes beyond what is already known from direct investigation of the phenomenon being studied.

An example of such criticism is the argument that the mathematical models of [[optimal foraging theory]] do not offer insight that goes beyond the common-sense conclusions of [[evolution]] and other basic principles of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pyke | first1 = G. H. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515 | title = Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 15 | pages = 523–575 | year = 1984 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* One of the popular examples in [[computer science]] is the mathematical models of various machines, an example is the [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) which is defined as an abstract mathematical concept, but due to the deterministic nature of a DFA, it is implementable in hardware and software for solving various specific problems. For example, the following is a DFA M with a binary alphabet, which requires that the input contains an even number of 0s.

[[File:DFAexample.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[state diagram]] for ''M'']]
''M'' = (''Q'', Σ, δ, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F'') where
*''Q'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;},
*Σ = {0, 1},
*''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
*''F'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}, and
*δ is defined by the following [[state transition table]]:
:{| border="1" cell padding="1" cell spacing="0"
| || &lt;center&gt;'''0'''&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;'''1'''&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

The state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents that there has been an even number of 0s in the input so far, while ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained an even number of 0s or not. If the input did contain an even number of 0s, ''M'' will finish in state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted.

The language recognized by ''M'' is the [[regular language]] given by the [[regular expression]] 1*( 0 (1*) 0 (1*) )*, where "*" is the [[Kleene star]], e.g., 1* denotes any non-negative number (possibly zero) of symbols "1".

* Many everyday activities carried out without a thought are uses of mathematical models. A geographical [[map projection]] of a region of the earth onto a small, plane surface  is a model&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landinfo.com/resources_dictionaryMP.htm landinfo.com, definition of map projection]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for many purposes such as planning travel.
* Another simple activity is predicting the position of a vehicle from its initial position, direction and speed of travel, using the equation that distance traveled is the product of time and speed. This is known as [[dead reckoning]] when used more formally. Mathematical modeling in this way does not necessarily require formal mathematics; animals have been shown to use dead reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallistel |first= |title=The Organization of Learning |location=Cambridge |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1990 |ISBN=0-262-07113-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whishaw | first1 = I.

* ''[[Population]] Growth''. A simple (though approximate) model of population growth is the [[Malthusian growth model]]. A slightly more realistic and largely used population growth model is the [[logistic function]], and its extensions. 
* ''Model of a particle  in a potential-field''. In this model we consider a particle as being a point of mass which describes a trajectory in space which is modeled by a function giving its coordinates in space as a function of time. The potential field is given by a function &lt;math&gt;V\!:\mathbb{R}^3\!\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the trajectory, that is a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\!:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, is the solution of the [[differential equation]]:

::&lt;math&gt; -\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}m=\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial x}\mathbf{\hat{x}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial y}\mathbf{\hat{y}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial z}\mathbf{\hat{z}}, &lt;/math&gt;

that can be written also as:

::&lt;math&gt; m\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-\nabla V[\mathbf{r}(t)]. &lt;/math&gt;

:Note this model assumes  the particle is a point mass, which is certainly known to be false in many cases in which we use this model; for example, as a model of planetary motion.

* ''Model of rational behavior for a consumer''.  In this model we assume a consumer faces a choice of ''n'' commodities labeled 1,2,...,''n'' each with a market price ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The consumer is assumed to have an [[ordinal utility]] function ''U'' (ordinal in the sense that only the sign of the differences between two utilities, and not the level of each utility, is meaningful), depending on the amounts of commodities ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consumed.  The model further assumes that the consumer has a budget ''M'' which is used to purchase a vector ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in such a way as to maximize ''U''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  The problem of rational behavior in this model then becomes an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem, that is:
:: &lt;math&gt; \max U(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:: subject to:
:: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i \leq M.&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; x_{i} \geq 0   \; \; \; \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n \} &lt;/math&gt;
: This model has been used in a wide variety of economic contexts, such as in [[general equilibrium theory]] to show existence and [[Pareto efficiency]] of economic equilibria.

'''Mental factors''' ({{lang-sa|caitasika}}; {{lang-pi|cetasika}}; Tibetan Wylie: ''sems byung''), in [[Buddhism]], are identified within the teachings of the [[Abhidhamma]] (Buddhist psychology). They are defined as aspects of the mind that apprehend the quality of an object, and that have the ability to color the mind. Within the Abhidhamma, the mental factors are categorized as formations ({{lang-sa|saṅkhāra}}) concurrent with mind ({{lang-sa|citta}}).&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geshe Tashi Tsering 2006"&gt;Geshe Tashi Tsering (2006), Kindle Location 456.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternate translations for mental factors include "mental states", "mental events", and "concomitants of consciousness".

==Introduction==
Mental factors are aspects of the mind that apprehend the quality of an object and have the ability to color the mind. Geshe Tashi Tsering explains:
:The Tibetan for mental factors, ''semlay jungwa chö'' (Skt. ''chaitasika dharma''), means phenomena arising from the mind, suggesting that the mental factors are not primary to the mind but arise within a larger framework. A mental factor, again, is defined as the aspect of the mind that apprehends a particular quality of an object. Because it is characterized by the qualities of activity and non-neutrality, it has the ability to color the mind in dependence on the way it manifests. Hence, a feeling of desire from seeing what is conceived as a beautiful object affects the other mental factors that are present at that time, and this colors the whole mind.&lt;ref&gt;Geshe Tashi Tsering (2006), Kindle Locations 564-568.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the main mind (Sanskrit: [[citta]]) and the mental factors can be described by the following metaphors:
* The main mind is like screen in a cinema, and the mental factors are like the images projected on the screen. In this analogy, we typically do not notice the screen because we are so caught up on the images.
* The main mind is like a king who sits passively on a throne, and the mental factors are like the king's busy ministers.&lt;ref name="Geshe Tashi Tsering 2006"/&gt;

Traleg Rinpoche states that the main distinction between the mind and mental factors is that the mind apprehends an object as a whole, whereas mental factors apprehend an object in its particulars.&lt;ref name=traleg1&gt;Traleg Rinpoche (1993). p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Traleg Rinpoche states: "The fundamental distinction made in Yogacara philosophy between the mind and mental events is that the mind apprehends an object as a whole, whereas mental events apprehend an object in its particulars. If we perceive a table, then the perception of the table itself would be related to the mind, whereas the particular characteristics of that table would be the object of perception for the mental events. First, we have an immediate perception of the table. After that, we have certain feeling-tones, certain judgments, involved with that particular perception. Those things are related to the mental events. The immediate perception is the only thing related to the mind. That seems to be the major distinction between the mind and the mental events."&lt;ref name=traleg1/&gt;}}

==Lists of mental factors==
Within Buddhism, there are many different systems of [[abhidharma]] (commonly referred to as Buddhist psychology), and each system contains its own list of the most significant mental factors.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Alexander Berzin states: "There are many different systems of abhidharma (chos-mngon-pa, topics of knowledge), each with its individual count and list of subsidiary awarenesses. Often, the definitions of the awarenesses they assert in common differ as well."&lt;ref name=berzin1&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/science-of-mind/mind-mental-factors/primary-minds-and-the-51-mental-factors ''Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors'' by Alexander Berzin] (see section "Count of the Mental Factors")&lt;/ref&gt; }}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Bikkhu Bodhi states: "A second distinguishing feature of the Abhidhamma is the dissection of the apparently continuous stream of consciousness into a succession of discrete evanescent cognitive events called cittas, each a complex unity involving consciousness itself, as the basic awareness of an object, and a constellation of mental factors (cetasika) exercising more specialized tasks in the act of cognition. Such a view of consciousness, at least in outline, can readily be derived from the Sutta Pitaka's analysis of experience into the five aggregates, among which the four mental aggregates are always inseparably conjoined, but the conception remains there merely suggestive. In the Abhidhamma Pitaka the suggestion is not simply picked up, but is expanded into an extraordinarily detailed and coherent picture of the functioning of consciousness both in its microscopic immediacy and in its extended continuity from life to life."&lt;ref name=bhodhi1&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/abhiman.html ''A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} These lists vary from system to system both in the number of mental factors listed, and in the definitions that are given for each mental factor. These lists are not considered to be exhaustive; rather they present significant categories and mental factors that are useful to study in order to understand how the mind functions.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The lists of mental factors are not considered to be exhaustive. For example:
* The Dalai Lama states: “Whether the system includes fifty-one mental factors or more or less, none of those sets is meant to be all-inclusive, as though nothing is left out. They are only suggestive, indicative of some things that are important.”{{sfn|Goleman|2008|loc=Kindle Locations 3628-3631}}
* Alexander Berzin states: "These lists of subsidiary awarenesses are not exhaustive. There are many more than just fifty-one. Many good qualities (yon-tan) cultivated on the Buddhist path are not listed separately – for example, generosity (sbyin-pa), ethical discipline (tshul-khrims), patience (bzod-pa), love (byams-pa), and compassion (snying-rje). According to the Gelug presentation, the five types of deep awareness (ye-shes) – mirror-like, equalizing, individualizing, accomplishing, and sphere of reality (Skt. dharmadhatu) – are also subsidiary awarenesses. The various lists are just of certain significant categories of subsidiary awarenesses."&lt;ref name=berzin1/&gt;}}

Some of the main commentaries on the Abhidharma systems that are studied today include:&lt;ref name=berzin1/&gt;
* ''[[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]]'' by Acariya Anuruddha - a [[Theravada]] commentary that lists fifty-two mental factors.
* ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' by [[Buddhaghosa]] - a Theravada commentary that provides explanations for fifty-two mental factors
* ''[[Abhidharma-kosha]]'' by [[Vasubandhu]] - a [[Sarvastivada]] commentary (studied by the Mahayana schools) that lists forty-six mental factors.
* ''[[Abhidharma-samuccaya]]'' by [[Asanga]] - a [[Yogachara]] commentary (studied by the Mahayana schools) that lists fifty-one mental factors.
* ''Innermost Core of Topics of Knowledge (mDzod-phug)'' by [[Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche|Shenrab Miwo]] - a Tibetan [[Bon]] commentary that lists fifty-one factors.

==Sthaviravāda Sarvastivada tradition==
In [[Mahavibhasa]] and [[Abhidharma-kosa]], 46 mental factors have been listed as below:

* ''[[Auddhatya]]'' - excitement, ebullience

==Theravāda Abhidharma tradition==
Within the Theravāda tradition, the [[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]] enumerates the fifty-two mental factors listed below:{{refn|group=lower-alpha|These fifty-two mental states are enumerated and defined in chapter 2 of the ''[[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]]''. See: 
* [http://www.palikanon.com/english/sangaha/chapter_2.htm Abhidhammattha-sangaha (Chapter 2)] translated by Nārada Thera, et al.&lt;ref name=thera1&gt;[http://www.palikanon.com/english/sangaha/sangaha.htm ''Abhidhammattha-sangaha'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mendis/wheel322.html#cetasika The Abhidhamma in Practice: The Cetasikas]}}

Note that this list is not exhaustive; there are other mental factors mentioned in the Theravada teachings. This list identifies fifty-two important factors that help to understand how the mind functions.

===Seven universal mental factors===
The seven universal mental factors (''sabbacittasādhāraṇa cetasikas'') are common (''sādhāraṇa'') to all consciousness (''sabbacitta''). [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] states: "These factors perform the most rudimentary and essential cognitive functions, without which consciousness of an object would be utterly impossible."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2140-2142}}

These seven factors are:
* ''[[Phassa]]'' - contact 
* ''[[Vedanā]]'' - feeling
* ''[[Saññā]]'' - perception
* ''[[Cetanā]]'' - volition
* ''[[Ekaggata]]'' - one-pointedness
* ''[[Jīvitindriya]]'' - life faculty
* ''[[Manasikāra]]'' - attention

===Six occasional mental factors===
The six occasional or particular mental factors (''pakiṇṇaka cetasikas'') are ethically variable mental factors found only in certain consciousnesses.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2232-2234}} They are:
* ''[[Vitakka]]'' - Application of thought
* ''[[Vicāra]]'' - Examining
* ''[[Adhimokkha]]'' - Decision
* ''[[Viriya]]'' - Energy
* ''[[Pīti]]'' - Rapture
* ''[[Chanda (Buddhism)|Chanda]]'' - Desire (to act)

===Fourteen unwholesome mental factors===

Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 1320-1324}}
:Unwholesome consciousness (''akusalacitta'') is consciousness accompanied by one or another of the three unwholesome roots—greed, hatred, and delusion. Such consciousness is called unwholesome because it is mentally unhealthy, morally blameworthy, and productive of painful results. 

The fourteen unwholesome mental factors are:
* Four universal unwholesome mental factors (''akusalasādhāraṇa''):
** ''[[Moha (Buddhism)|Moha]]'' - delusion 
** ''[[Ahirika]]'' - lack of shame
** ''[[Anottappa]]'' - disregard for consequence
** ''[[Uddhacca]]'' - restlessness
* Three mental factors of the greed-group (''lobha''):
** ''[[Raga (Buddhism)|Lobha]]'' - greed
** ''[[View (Buddhism)|Diṭṭhi]]'' - wrong view
** ''[[Māna]]'' - conceit
* Four mental factors of the hatred-group (''dosa'')
** ''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|Dosa]]'' - hatred
** ''[[Issā]]'' - envy

** ''[[Middha]]'' - torpor
** ''[[Vicikicchā]]'' - doubt

===Twenty-five beautiful mental factors===
The beautiful mental factors (''sobhana cetasikas'') accompany the wholesome consciousnesses (''kusala citta'').

Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 1320-1324}}
:Wholesome consciousness (''kusalacitta'') is consciousness accompanied by the wholesome roots—non-greed or generosity, non-hatred or loving-kindness, and non-delusion or wisdom. Such consciousness is mentally healthy, morally blameless, and productive of pleasant results.

The twenty-five beautiful mental factors (''sobhana cetasikas'') are:
* Nineteen universal beautiful mental factors (''sobhanasādhāraṇa''):
** ''[[Saddhā]]'' - faith

==Mahayana Abhidharma tradition==
Abhidharma studies in the Mahayana tradition are based on the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda abhidharma system. Within this system, the [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] identifies fifty-one mental factors:

===Five universal mental factors ===
The five universal mental factors (''sarvatraga'') are:
# ''[[Sparśa]]'' - contact, contacting awareness, sense impression, touch
# ''[[Vedanā]]'' - feeling, sensation
# ''[[Saṃjñā]]'' - perception
# ''[[Cetanā]]'' - volition, intention
# ''[[Manasikara]]'' - attention

These five mental factors are referred to as ''universal'' or ''omnipresent'' because they operate in the wake of every mind situation. If any one of these factors is missing, then the experience of the object is incomplete. For example:
* If there is no ''sparśa'' (contact), then there would be no basis for perception.
* If there is no ''vedana'' (feeling, sensation), there is no relishing of the object.
* If there is no ''saṃjñā'' (perception), then the specific characteristic of the object is not perceived.
* If there is no ''cetanā'' (volition), then there is no movement towards and settling on the object.
* If there is no ''manasikara'' (attention), then there is not holding onto the object.&lt;ref&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 409-414.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Five object-determining mental factors ===
The five object-determining mental factors (''viṣayaniyata'') are:
# ''[[Chanda (Buddhism)|Chanda]]'' - desire (to act), intention, interest
# ''[[Adhimoksha]]'' - decision, interest, firm conviction
# ''[[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|Smṛti]]'' - mindfulness
# ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|Prajñā]]'' - wisdom
# ''[[Samādhi]]'' - concentration

The five factors are referred to as ''object-determining'' is because these factors each grasp the specification of the object. When they are steady, there is certainty concerning each object.&lt;ref&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 487-488.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eleven virtuous mental factors===
The eleven virtuous (''kuśala'') mental factors are:
# ''[[Saddhā|Sraddhā]]'' - faith
# ''[[Hri (Buddhism)|Hrī]]'' - self-respect, conscientiousness, sense of shame
# ''[[Apatrāpya]]'' - decorum, regard for consequence
# ''[[Alobha]]'' - non-attachment
# ''[[Adveṣa]]'' - non-aggression, equanimity, lack of hatred
# ''[[Amoha]]'' - non-bewilderment
# ''[[Vīrya]]'' - diligence, effort
# ''[[Praśrabdhi]]'' - pliancy
# ''[[Apramāda]]'' - conscientiousness
# ''[[Upekṣa]]'' - equanimity
# ''[[Ahiṃsā]]'' - nonharmfulness

===Six root unwholesome factors===
The six root unwholesome factors (''mūlakleśa'') are:
# ''[[Raga (Buddhism)|Raga]]'' - attachment
# ''[[Pratigha]]'' - anger
# ''[[Avidya (Buddhism)|Avidya]]'' - ignorance
# ''[[Māna]]'' - pride, conceit
# ''[[Vicikitsa]]'' - doubt
# ''[[View (Buddhism)|Dṛiṣṭi]]'' - wrong view

===Twenty secondary unwholesome factors ===
The twenty secondary unwholesome factors (''upakleśa'') are:
#''[[Krodha (Mental factor)|Krodha]]'' - rage, fury
#''[[Upanāha]]'' - resentment
#''[[Mrakśa]]'' - concealment, slyness-concealment
#''[[Pradāśa]]'' - spitefulness
#''[[Irshya]]'' - envy, jealousy
#''[[Mātsarya]]'' - stinginess, avarice, miserliness
#''[[Maya (Buddhist mental factor)|Māyā]]'' - pretense, deceit
#''[[Asāṭhya]]'' - hypocrisy, dishonesty
#''[[Mada (Buddhism)|Mada]]'' - self-infatuation, mental inflation, self-satisfaction
#''[[Vihiṃsā]]'' - malice, hostility, cruelty, intention to harm
#''[[Āhrīkya]]'' - lack of shame, lack of conscience, shamelessness
#''[[Anapatrāpya]]'' - lack of propriety, disregard, shamelessness

[[File:Ch5 wakamurasaki.jpg|thumb|260px|Art of ''Miyabi'' on the [[Heian period]]. ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'']]
[[File:Kinkakuji 2004-09-21.jpg|thumb|260px|Art of ''Miyabi'' on the [[Muromachi period]]. ([[Kinkaku-ji]] in [[Kyoto]])]]
'''''Miyabi''''' (雅) is one of the traditional Japanese aesthetic ideals, though not as prevalent as [[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|Iki]] or [[Wabi-sabi]]. In modern Japanese, the word is usually translated as "elegance," "refinement," or "courtliness" and sometimes to a "sweet loved one".

The ideal posed by the word demanded the elimination of anything that was absurd or vulgar and the "polishing of manners, diction, and feelings to eliminate all roughness and crudity so as to achieve the highest grace." It expressed that sensitivity to beauty which was the hallmark of the [[Heian period|Heian]] era. Miyabi is often closely connected to the notion of [[Mono no aware]], a bittersweet awareness of the transience of things, and thus it was thought that things in decline showed a great sense of miyabi. An example of this would be one of a lone cherry tree. The tree would soon lose its flowers and would be stripped of everything that made it beautiful and so it showed not only mono no aware, but also miyabi in the process.

Adherents to the ideals of miyabi strove to rid the world of crude forms or aesthetics and emotions that were common in artworks of the period, such as those contained in the [[Man'yōshū]], the oldest extant collection of [[Japanese poetry]]. The [[Man'yōshū]] contained poems by people of every walk of life, many of which stood in stark contrast to the sensibilities of miyabi. For example, one poem in the collection likened a woman's hair to snail innards. The ideals of miyabi stood firmly against the use of metaphors such as this.  Furthermore, appreciation of miyabi and its ideal was used as a marker of class differences. It was believed that only members of the upper class, the courtiers, could truly appreciate the workings of miyabi.

Miyabi in fact limited how art and poems could be created. Miyabi tried to stay away from the rustic and crude, and in doing so, prevented the traditionally trained courtiers from expressing real feelings in their works. In later years, miyabi and its aesthetic were replaced by ideals inspired by [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]], such as [[Wabi-sabi]], [[Yugen|Yuugen]] and [[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|Iki]].

The characters of the classic eleventh-century Japanese novel "[[The Tale of Genji]]" by [[Lady Murasaki]] provide  examples of  miyabi.&lt;ref&gt;''Japanese Aesthetics and Culture'' Nancy G. Hume, {{ISBN|978-0791424001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4545">The '''National Centre for Knowledge on Men's Violence against Women''' ({{lang-sv|Nationellt centrum för kvinnofrid}}, abbreviated '''NCK''') is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] knowledge and resource centre at [[Uppsala University]], founded in 2006. NCK is working on behalf of the [[Government of Sweden]] to raise awareness at the national level of men's [[violence against women]], and develops new methods for the treatment of abused women. NCK has a mandate to research, educate, compile and spread information. In 2008, its operations expanded to include violence and oppression in the name of honour, and violence in same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action plan for combating men's violence against women, violence and oppression|url=http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/9761/a/98653|publisher=The [[Government of Sweden]]|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information om Nationellt centrum för kvinnofrid|url=http://www.nck.uu.se/Om_NCK/|publisher=NCK/[[Uppsala University]]|accessdate=20 July 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=law-sv&gt;{{cite web|title=Förordning (2006:1072) om nationellt kunskapscentrum för frågor om mäns våld mot kvinnor|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Forordning-20061072-om-nati_sfs-2006-1072/|publisher=The Swedish Government|accessdate=28 July 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The centre is part of Uppsala University, organised directly under the [[Rector (academia)|rector]], and managed by Professor [[Gun Heimer]].&lt;ref name=Organisation&gt;{{cite web|title=Organisation|url=http://www.nck.uu.se/Om_NCK/Organisation/|publisher=NCK|accessdate=28 July 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telephone counseling==
Since 2007, the centre have been operating a Government funded national helpline for women who have been subjected to threats and violence ({{lang-sv|Kvinnofridslinjen}}). The [[telephone counseling]] is open 24-hour, toll-free, and the call does not appear on the telephone bill. Staff at the helpline provide support, practical advice, information about the healthcare system and how to report crimes. The staff consist of [[social work]]ers, [[Midwife|midwives]] and [[Nursing|nurses]] with at least five years of professional experience; receiving on average 60 calls a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kvinnofridslinjen – national helpline|url=http://www.kvinnofridslinjen.se/index.php?page=startpage|publisher=NCK|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Development of a National Helpline for Women subjected to Violence|url=http://nck.uu.se/digitalAssets/49/49512_1nck_kvinnofridslinjen_the_development.pdf|publisher=NCK|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Helpline - Kvinnofridslinjen (020-505050)|url=http://eige.europa.eu/content/national-helpline-kvinnofridslinjen-020505050|publisher=[[European Institute for Gender Equality]]|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nyamko Sabuni inviger Kvinnofridslinjen|url=http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/9722/a/93358|publisher=The Swedish Government|accessdate=28 July 2014|language=Swedish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808071955/http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/9722/a/93358|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vårdförbundet-sv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mer än 60 samtal om dagen till Kvinnofridslinjen|url=https://www.vardforbundet.se/Vardfokus/Webbnyheter/2012/December/Over-60-samtal-om-dagen-till-Kvinnofridslinjen/|publisher=[[Swedish Association of Health Professionals]]|accessdate=28 July 2014|language=Swedish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140805052358/https://www.vardforbundet.se/Vardfokus/Webbnyheter/2012/December/Over-60-samtal-om-dagen-till-Kvinnofridslinjen/|archivedate=5 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=interview-sv&gt;{{cite web|title=Socionomen: Ett samtal kan vara avgörande|url=http://kvinnofridslinjen.se/index.php?page=socionomen-ett-samtal-kan-vara-avgoerande|publisher=NCK|accessdate=28 July 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6190">'''Natural heritage''' refers to the sum total of the elements of biodiversity, including flora and fauna ,
ecosystems and geological structures.

Heritage is that which is ''inherited'' from past generations, maintained in the present, and bestowed to future generations.&lt;ref&gt; Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; The term "natural heritage", derived from "natural inheritance", pre-dates the term "[[biodiversity]]." It is a less scientific term and more easily comprehended in some ways by the wider audience interested in [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]]. 

The term was used in this context in the United States when [[Jimmy Carter]] set up the Georgia Heritage Trust &lt;ref&gt;http://maps.csc.noaa.gov/RoisDatabaseEntry/lawDetails.jsp?lawID=107{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The creation of the Heritage Trust Commission, Georgia Heritage Trust Act, Official Code of Georgia (O.C.G.A.)

 By James F. Cook, {{ISBN|0-86554-954-0}}, 2005 Mercer University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that Carter picked the term up from [[Lyndon Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-11-lady-bird-obit_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Lady Bird Johnson dies at 94 | first=Kathy | last=Kiely | date=2009-01-22 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used it in a 1966 Message to [[United States Congress|Congress]].  (He may have gotten the term from his wife [[Lady Bird Johnson]] who was personally interested in conservation.)  President Johnson signed the [[Wilderness Act|Wilderness Act of 1964]]. 

The term "Natural Heritage" was picked up by the Science Division of [[The Nature Conservancy]] (TNC) when, under Robert E. Jenkins, Jr., it launched in 1974 what ultimately became the network of state natural heritage programs -- one in each state, all using the same [[methodology]] and all supported permanently by state governments because they scientifically document conservation priorities and facilitate science-based environmental reviews. When this network was extended outside the United States, the term "Conservation Data Center (or Centre)" was suggested by Guillermo Mann and came to be preferred for programs outside the US{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}.  Despite the name difference, these programs, too, use the same core methodology as the 50 state natural heritage programs. In 1994 The network of natural heritage programs formed a membership association to work together on projects of common interest: the Association for Biodiversity Information (ABI). In 1999, Through an agreement with The Nature Conservancy, ABI expanded and assumed responsibility for the scientific databases, information, and tools developed by TNC in support of the network of natural heritage programs. In 2001, ABI changed its name to [[NatureServe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureserve.org/about-us/our-history NatureServe History], The history of the Virginia-based conservation non-profit NatureServe.&lt;/ref&gt; NatureServe continues to serve as the hub of the NatureServe Network, a collaboration of 86 governmental and non-governmental programs including natural heritage programs and conservation data centers located in the United States, Canada, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureserve.org/natureserve-network About the NatureServe Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==

An important site of natural heritage or [[cultural heritage]] can be listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by the [[World Heritage Committee]] of [[UNESCO]].  The UNESCO programme, catalogues, names, and conserves sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humanity.  As of March 2012, there are 936 World Heritage Sites: 725 cultural, 183 natural, and 28 mixed properties, in 153 countries.

The 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention established that biological resources, such as plants, were the [[common heritage of mankind]] or as was expressed in the preamble: "need to be preserved as part of the world heritage of mankind as a whole.". These rules probably inspired the creation of great public banks of genetic resources, located outside the source-countries.

New global agreements (e.g., the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]), now give sovereign national rights over biological resources (not property). The idea of static  conservation of biodiversity is disappearing and being replaced by the idea of dynamic conservation, through the notion of resource and  innovation.

The new agreements commit countries to conserve biodiversity, develop resources for sustainability and share the benefits resulting from their use. Under new rules, it is expected  that [[bioprospecting]] or collection of natural products has to be allowed by  the biodiversity-rich country, in exchange for a share of the  benefits.

In 2005, the [[World Heritage Marine Programme]] was established to protect marine areas with Outstanding Universal Values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11692">{{Algebraic structures}}

In [[mathematics]], there are many types of [[algebraic structure]]s which are studied. [[Abstract algebra]] is primarily the study of specific algebraic structures and their properties. Algebraic structures may be viewed in different ways, however the common starting point of algebra texts is that an algebraic object incorporates one or more [[set theory|set]]s with one or more [[binary operation]]s or [[unary operation]]s satisfying a collection of [[axiom]]s.

Another branch of mathematics known as [[universal algebra]] studies algebraic structures in general.   From the universal algebra viewpoint, most structures can be divided into [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties]] and [[quasivariety|quasivarieties]] depending on the axioms used. Some [[axiom]]atic [[formal system]]s that are neither varieties nor quasivarieties, called ''nonvarieties'', are sometimes included among the algebraic structures by tradition.

Concrete examples of each structure will be found in the articles listed.

Algebraic structures are so numerous today that this article will inevitably be incomplete. In addition to this, there are sometimes multiple names for the same structure, and sometimes one name will be defined by disagreeing axioms by different authors. Most structures appearing on this page will be common ones which most authors agree on. Other web lists of algebraic structures, organized more or less alphabetically, include [http://math.chapman.edu/~jipsen/structures/doku.php Jipsen] and [http://planetmath.org/browse/objects/ PlanetMath.] These lists mention many structures not included below, and may present more information about some structures than is presented here.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== Study of algebraic structures ==

Algebraic structures appear in most branches of mathematics, and one can encounter them in many different ways.
*Beginning study: In American universities, [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[vector space]]s and [[field (mathematics)|field]]s are generally the first structures encountered in subjects such as [[linear algebra]]. They are usually introduced as sets with certain axioms.
*Advanced study:
**[[Abstract algebra]] studies properties of specific algebraic structures.
**[[Universal algebra]] studies algebraic structures abstractly, rather than specific types of structures. 
***[[Variety (universal algebra)|Varieties]]
**[[Category theory]] studies interrelationships between different structures, algebraic and non-algebraic. To study a non-algebraic object, it is often useful to use category theory to relate the object to an algebraic structure. 
***Example: The [[fundamental group]] of a [[topological space]] gives information about the topological space.

== Types of algebraic structures ==

In full generality, an algebraic structure may use any number of sets and any number of axioms in its definition. The most commonly studied structures, however, usually involve only one or two sets and one or two [[binary operation]]s. The structures below are organized by how many sets are involved, and how many binary operations are used. Increased indentation is meant to indicate a more exotic structure, and the least indented levels are the most basic.

===One binary operation on one set===
{{Group-like structures}}
The following structures consist of a set with a binary operation. The most common structure is that of a ''group''. Other structures involve weakening or strengthening the axioms for groups, and may additionally use unary operations.

*[[Group (mathematics)|Group]]s are key structures. [[Abelian group]]s are an important special type of group.
**[[semigroup]]s and [[monoid]]s: These are like groups, except the operation need not have inverse elements.
**[[quasigroup]]s and [[quasigroup|loops]]: These are like groups, except the operation need not be associative.
**[[Magma (algebra)|Magmas]]: These are like groups, except the operation need not be associative or have inverse elements.
*[[Semilattice]]: This is basically "half" of a lattice structure (see below).

===Two binary operations on one set===
The main types of structures with one set having two binary operations are ''rings'' and ''lattices''. The axioms defining many of the other structures are modifications of the axioms for rings and lattices. One major difference between rings and lattices is that their two operations are related to each other in different ways. In ring-like structures, the two operations are linked by the [[distributive law]]; in lattice-like structures, the operations are linked by the [[absorption law]].

*[[ring (mathematics)|Ring]]s: The two operations are usually called addition and multiplication. [[Commutative ring]]s are an especially important type of ring where the multiplication operation is commutative. [[Integral domain]]s and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] are especially important types of commutative rings.
**[[Nonassociative ring]]s: These are like rings, but the multiplication operation need not be associative.
***[[Lie ring]]s and [[Jordan ring]]s are special examples of nonassociative rings.
**[[semiring]]s: These are like rings, but the addition operation need not have inverses.
**[[nearring]]s: These are like rings, but the addition operation need not be commutative.
**[[*-ring]]s: These are rings with an additional unary operation known as an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]].
*[[lattice (order theory)|Lattice]]s: The two operations are usually called [[meet and join]].
**[[Latticoid]]: meet and join [[Commutativity|commute]] but need not [[Integral domain|associate]].
**[[Skew lattice]]: meet and join associate but need not commute.

===Two binary operations and two sets===
The following structures have the common feature of having two sets, ''A'' and ''B'', so that there is a binary operation from ''A''×''A'' into ''A'' and another operation from ''A''×''B'' into ''A''.

*[[Vector space]]s: The set ''A'' is an abelian group, and the set ''B'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].
**[[Graded vector space]]s: Vector spaces which are equipped with a [[direct sum]] decomposition into subspaces.
*[[module (mathematics)|Module]]s: The set ''A'' is an abelian group, but the ''B'' is only a general ring and not necessarily a field.
**Special types of modules, including [[free module]]s, [[projective module]]s, [[injective module]]s and [[flat module]]s are studied in abstract algebra.
*[[Group with operators]]: In this case, the set ''A'' is a group, and the set ''B'' is just a set.

===Three binary operations and two sets===
Many structures here are actually hybrid structures of the previously mentioned ones.

*[[Algebra over a field]]: This is a ring which is also a vector space over a field. There are axioms governing the interaction of the two structures. Multiplication is usually assumed to be associative.
**[[Algebra over a ring]]: These are defined the same way as algebras over fields, except that the field may now be any commutative ring.
**[[Graded algebra]]: These algebras are equipped with a decomposition into ''grades''.
*[[Non-associative algebra]]s: These are algebras for which the associativity of ring multiplication is relaxed. 
**[[Lie algebra]]s and [[Jordan algebra]]s are special examples of non-associative algebras.
*[[Coalgebra]]: This structure has axioms which make its multiplication [[dual (category theory)|dual]] to those of an associative algebra.
**[[Bialgebra]]: These structures are simultaneously algebras and coalgebras whose operations are compatible. There are actually four operations for this structure.

==Algebraic structures with additional non-algebraic structure==
There are many examples of mathematical structures where algebraic structure exists alongside non-algebraic structure.

*[[Topological vector space]]s are vector spaces with a compatible [[topology]].
*[[Lie group]]s: These are topological manifolds that also carry a compatible group structure.
*[[Ordered group]]s, [[ordered ring]]s and [[ordered field]]s have algebraic structure compatible with an [[order theory|order]] on the set.
*[[Von Neumann algebra]]s: these are *-algebras on a [[Hilbert space]] which are equipped with the [[weak operator topology]].

==Algebraic structures in different disciplines==
Some algebraic structures find uses in disciplines outside of abstract algebra. The following is meant to demonstrate some specific applications in other fields.

In [[Physics]]:
*[[Lie group]]s are used extensively in physics. A few well-known ones include the [[orthogonal group]]s and the [[unitary group]]s.
*[[Lie algebra]]s
*[[Inner product space]]s
*[[Kac–Moody algebra]]
*The [[quaternions]] and more generally [[geometric algebra]]s

In [[Mathematical logic]]:
*[[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s are both rings and lattices, under their two operations.
**[[Heyting algebra]]s are a special example of boolean algebras.
*[[Peano arithmetic]]
*[[Boundary algebra]]
*[[MV-algebra]]

In [[Computer science]]:
*[[Max-plus algebra]]
*[[Syntactic monoid]]
*[[Transition monoid]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="743">The '''panopticon gaze''' (from [[panopticon]]) is an ideological phrase, a [[metaphor]].  The panopticon gaze is the idea of a silent, unknown overseer in the society such as the government that subconsciously controlled all aspects of life.  It symbolizes extreme transparency within the society where the rulers or leaders can look down and know, being able to see exactly what is going on, influencing the actions of every individual.
[[Milan Kundera]] used this idea in his fictional novel about the Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''.

[[File:F. Taylor 1856-1915.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] (1856–1915), leading proponent of scientific management]]

'''Scientific management''' is a theory of [[management]] that [[Analysis|analyzes]] and [[wikt:synthesis#Noun|synthesizes]] [[workflow]]s. Its main objective is improving [[economic efficiency]], especially [[Workforce productivity|labour productivity]]. It was one of the earliest attempts [[applied science|to apply science]] to the [[engineering]] of [[business process|process]]es and to management. Scientific management is sometimes known as '''Taylorism''' after its founder, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]].&lt;ref name="Mitcham05p1153"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mitcham|2005|p=1153}} Mitcham, Carl and Adam, Briggle ''Management'' in Mitcham (2005) p. 1153&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor began the theory's development in the [[United States]] during the 1880s and '90s within [[manufacturing]] industries, especially steel. Its peak of influence came in the 1910s;&lt;ref name=Wodham1997p12&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodham|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor died in 1915 and by the 1920s, scientific management was still influential but had entered into [[competition]] and [[syncretism]] with opposing or complementary ideas.

Although scientific management as a distinct theory or school of thought was obsolete by the 1930s, most of its themes are still important parts of [[industrial engineering]] and management today. These include: analysis; synthesis; [[logic]]; [[rationality]]; [[empiricism]]; [[work ethic]]; efficiency and [[waste reduction|elimination of waste]]; [[standardization]] of [[best practice]]s; disdain for tradition preserved merely for its own sake or to protect the [[social status]] of particular workers with particular skill sets; the transformation of [[craft production]] into [[mass production]]; and [[knowledge transfer]] between workers and from workers into tools, processes, and documentation.

== Name ==
Taylor's own names for his approach initially included "shop management" and "[[process management]]". However, "scientific management" came to national attention in 1910 when crusading attorney [[Louis Brandeis]] (then not yet Supreme Court justice) popularized the term.&lt;ref name="Drury1915pp15-21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1915}}, [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924002406647#page/n19/mode/2up/search/Brandeis+find+scientific+management pp. 15–21]&lt;/ref&gt; Brandeis had sought a consensus term for the approach with the help of practitioners like [[Henry L. Gantt]] and [[Frank B. Gilbreth]]. Brandeis then used the consensus of "scientific management" when he argued before the [[Interstate Commerce Commission|Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)]] that a proposed increase in railroad rates was unnecessary despite an increase in labor costs; he alleged scientific management would overcome railroad inefficiencies (The ICC ruled against the rate increase, but also dismissed as insufficiently substantiated that concept the railroads were necessarily inefficient.) Taylor recognized the nationally-known term "scientific management" as another good name for the concept, and adopted it in the title of [[The Principles of Scientific Management (monograph)|his influential 1911 monograph]].

== History ==
The [[Midvale Steel Company]], "one of America's great armor plate making plants," was the birthplace of scientific management. In 1877, at age 22, Frederick W. Taylor started as a clerk in Midvale, but advanced to foreman in 1880. As foreman, Taylor was "constantly impressed by the failure of his [team members] to produce more than about one-third of [what he deemed] a good day's work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B. (Horace Bookwalter)|last=Drury|date=29 January 2018|publisher=New York, Columbia university; [etc., etc.]|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor determined to discover, by scientific methods, how long it should take men to perform each given piece of work; and it was in the fall of 1882 that he started to put the first features of scientific management into operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B. (Horace Bookwalter)|last=Drury|date=29 January 2018|publisher=New York, Columbia university; [etc., etc.]|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Horace Bookwalter Drury]], in his 1918 work, ''Scientific management: A History and Criticism'', identified seven other leaders in the movement,  most of whom learned of and extended scientific management from Taylor's efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B.

* [[Henry L. Gantt]] (1861–1919)
* [[Carl G. Barth]] (1860–1939) 
* [[Horace K. Hathaway]] (1878–1944) 
* [[Morris Llewellyn Cooke|Morris L. Cooke]] (1872–1960)
* [[Sanford E. Thompson]] (1867–1949)
* [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr.|Frank B. Gilbreth]] (1868–1924). Gilbreth's independent work on "motion study" is on record as early as 1885; after meeting Taylor in 1906 and being introduced to scientific management, Gilbert devoted his efforts to introducing scientific management into factories. Gilbreth and his wife Dr [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] (1878–1972) performed micro-motion studies using stop-motion cameras as well as developing the profession of industrial/organizational psychology. 
* [[Harrington Emerson]] (1853–1931) began determining what industrial plants' products and costs were compared to what they ought to be in 1895. Emerson did not meet Taylor until December 1900, and the two never worked together.

Emerson's testimony in late 1910 to the Interstate Commerce Commission brought the movement to national attention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

By January 1911, a leading railroad journal began a series of articles denying they were inefficiently managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B.

When steps were taken to introduce scientific management at the government-owned [[Rock Island Arsenal]] in early 1911, it was opposed by [[Samuel Gompers]], founder and President of the [[American Federation of Labor]] (an alliance of [[craft unions]]). When a subsequent attempt was made to introduce the bonus system into the government's [[Watertown Arsenal]] foundry during the summer of 1911, the entire force walked out for a few days. Congressional investigations followed, resulting in a ban on the use of time studies and pay premiums in Government service.

Taylor's death in 1915 at age 59&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0320.html|title=F. W. Taylor, Expert in Efficiency, Dies|website=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; left the movement without its original leader. In management literature today, the term "scientific management" mostly refers to the work of Taylor and his disciples ("classical", implying "no longer current, but still respected for its seminal value") in contrast to newer, improved iterations of efficiency-seeking methods. Today, task-oriented optimization of work tasks is nearly ubiquitous in industry.

== Pursuit of economic efficiency ==
Flourishing in the late 19th and early 20th century, scientific management built on earlier pursuits of [[economic efficiency]]. While it was prefigured in the folk wisdom of [[wikt:thrift#Noun|thrift]], it favored [[Empiricism|empirical methods]] to determine efficient procedures rather than perpetuating established traditions. Thus it was followed by a profusion of successors in applied science, including [[time and motion study]], the [[Efficiency Movement]] (which was a broader cultural echo of scientific management's impact on business managers specifically), [[Fordism]], [[operations management]], [[operations research]], [[industrial engineering]], [[management science]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[logistics]], [[business process management]], [[business process reengineering]], [[lean manufacturing]], and [[Six Sigma]]. There is a fluid continuum linking scientific management with the later fields, and the different approaches often display a high degree of compatibility.

Taylor rejected the notion, which was universal in his day and still held today, that the trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by [[craft production]] methods. In the course of his empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of [[manual labour|manual labor]]. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; [[material handling equipment]] as we know it today was mostly not developed yet. He looked at [[shovel]]ing in the unloading of [[railroad car]]s full of [[ore]]; lifting and carrying in the moving of [[pig iron|iron pigs]] at steel mills; the manual inspection of [[ball (bearing)|bearing balls]]; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent forms of scientific management were articulated by Taylor's disciples, such as [[Henry Gantt]]; other engineers and managers, such as [[Benjamin S. Graham]]; and other theorists, such as [[Max Weber]]. Taylor's work also contrasts with other efforts, including those of [[Henri Fayol]] and those of [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth, Sr.]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] (whose views originally shared much with Taylor's but later diverged in response to Taylorism's inadequate handling of human relations).

== Soldiering ==

Scientific management requires a high level of managerial control over employee work practices and entails a higher ratio of managerial workers to laborers than previous management methods. Such detail-oriented management may cause friction between workers and managers.

Taylor observed that some workers were more talented than others, and that even smart ones were often unmotivated. He observed that most [[worker]]s who are forced to perform repetitive tasks tend to work at the slowest rate that goes unpunished. This slow rate of work has been observed in many industries and many countries&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911|pp=13–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called by various terms.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp19,23,82,95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911|pp=19, 23, 82, 95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor used the term "soldiering",&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soldier|title=Definition of SOLDIER|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term that reflects the way [[Conscription|conscripts]] may approach following orders, and observed that, when paid the same amount, workers will tend to do the amount of work that the slowest among them does.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-29,95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911|pp=13–29, 95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor describes soldiering as "the greatest evil with which the working-people ... are now afflicted."&lt;ref name="Taylor1911"/&gt;

This reflects the idea that workers have a vested interest in their own well-being, and do not benefit from working above the defined rate of work when it will not increase their remuneration. He therefore proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one [[Best practice|best method]] for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their [[productivity]] would go up.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-29,95"/&gt; Thus his compensation plans usually included [[piece work|piece rates]]. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect and tried to get large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.

== Relationship to mechanization and automation ==
[[File:Musterarbeitsplatz.png|thumb|A machinist at the Tabor Company, a firm where Frederick Taylor's consultancy was applied to practice, about 1905]]

Scientific management evolved in an era when [[mechanization]] and [[automation]] were still in their infancy. The ideas and methods of scientific management extended the [[American system of manufacturing]] in the transformation from [[craft production|craft]] work (with humans as the only possible agents) to mechanization and automation, although proponents of scientific management did not predict the extensive removal of humans from the production process. Concerns over [[Technological unemployment|labor-displacing technologies]] rose with increasing mechanization and automation.

By factoring processes into discrete, unambiguous units, scientific management laid the groundwork for automation and [[offshoring]], prefiguring [[industrial control systems|industrial process control]] and [[numerical control]] in the absence of any machines that could carry it out. Taylor and his followers did not foresee this at the time; in their world, it was ''humans'' that would execute the optimized processes. (For example, although in their era the instruction "open valve A whenever pressure gauge B reads over value X" would be carried out by a human, the fact that it had been reduced to an algorithmic component paved the way for a machine to be the agent.) However, one of the common threads between their world and ours is that the agents of execution need not be "smart" to execute their tasks. In the case of computers, they are ''not able'' (yet) to be "smart" (in that sense of the word); in the case of human workers under scientific management, they were often ''able'' but were ''not allowed''. Once the time-and-motion men had completed their studies of a particular task, the workers had very little opportunity for further thinking, experimenting, or suggestion-making. They were forced to "play dumb" most of the time, which occasionally led to revolts.

The middle ground between the craft production of skilled workers and full automation is occupied by systems of extensive mechanization and partial automation operated by semiskilled and unskilled workers. Such systems depend on algorithmic workflows and [[knowledge transfer]], which require substantial engineering to succeed. Although Taylor's intention for scientific management was simply to optimize work methods, the process engineering that he pioneered also tends to build the skill into the equipment and processes, removing most need for skill in the workers. Such engineering has governed most industrial engineering since then. It is also the essence of successful offshoring. The common theme in all these cases is that businesses engineer their way out of their need for large concentrations of skilled workers, and the high-wage environments that sustain them. This creates competitive advantage on the local level of individual firms, although the pressure it exerts systemically on [[employment]] and [[employability]] is an [[externality]].

== Impact ==

=== Market economies ===

==== Taylor's view of workers ====



Other thinkers soon offered more ideas on the roles that workers play in mature industrial systems. These included ideas on improvement of the individual worker with attention to the worker's needs, not just the needs of the whole. [[James Hartness]] published ''The Human Factor in Works Management''&lt;ref name="Hartness1912"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hartness|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1912, while [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] offered their own alternatives to Taylorism. The [[Human Relations Movement|human relations]] school of management evolved in the 1930s to complement rather than replace scientific management, with Taylorism determining the organisation of the work process, and human relations helping to adapt the workers to the new procedures.&lt;ref name="Braverman_1998_1974"&gt;{{Harvnb|Braverman|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today's efficiency-seeking methods, such as lean manufacturing, include respect for workers and fulfillment of their needs as integral parts of the theory. (Workers slogging their way through workdays in the business world do encounter flawed implementations of these methods that make jobs unpleasant; but these implementations generally lack managerial competence in matching theory to execution.) Clearly, a [[syncretism]] has occurred since Taylor's day, although its implementation has been uneven, as lean management in capable hands has produced good results for both managers and workers, but in incompetent hands has damaged enterprises.

==== Taylorism, anomie, and unions ====

With the division of labor that became commonplace as Taylorism was implemented in manufacturing, workers lost their sense of connection to the production of goods. Workers began to feel disenfranchised with the monotonous and unfulfilling work they were doing in factories. Before scientific management, workers felt a sense of pride when completing their good, which went away when workers only completed one part of production. "The further 'progress' of industrial development... increased the anomic or forced division of labor," the opposite of what Taylor thought would be the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melossi|first1=Dario|title=Controlling Crime, Controlling Society: Thinking about Crime in Europe and America|date=December 2008|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial adoption of Taylor's principles by management seeking to boost efficiency, while ignoring principles such as fair pay and direct engagement by managers, led to further tensions and the rise of unions to represent workers needs.

Taylor had a largely negative view of unions, and believed they only led to decreased productivity. Although he opposed them, his work with scientific management led disenfranchised workers to look to unions for support.

==== Early decades: Making jobs unpleasant ====

Under scientific management, the demands of work intensified. Workers became dissatisfied with the work environment and became angry.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} During one of Taylor's own implementations at the [[Watertown Arsenal]] in Massachusetts, a [[Strike action|strike]] led to an investigation of Taylor's methods by a U.S. House of Representatives committee. The committee reported in 1912, concluding that scientific management did provide some useful techniques and offered valuable organizational suggestions,{{Request quotation|date=April 2011}} but that it also gave production managers a dangerously high level of uncontrolled power.&lt;ref name="Mullins2004p70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mullins|2004|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After an attitude survey of the workers revealed a high level of resentment and hostility towards scientific management, the Senate banned Taylor's methods at the arsenal.&lt;ref name="Mullins2004p70"/&gt;

Scientific management lowered worker morale and exacerbated existing conflicts between labor and management. As a consequence, the method inadvertently strengthened [[labor union]]s and their bargaining power in labor disputes,&lt;ref name="Drury1915pp170-174"&gt;
{{Harvnb|Drury|1915|pp=170–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby neutralizing most or all of the benefit of any productivity gains it had achieved. Thus its net benefit to owners and management ended up as small or negative. It took new efforts, borrowing some ideas from scientific management but mixing them with others, to produce more productive formula.

==== Later decades: Making jobs disappear ====

Scientific management may have exacerbated grievances among workers about oppressive or greedy management. It certainly strengthened developments that put workers at a disadvantage: the erosion of employment in developed economies via both [[offshoring]] and automation. Both were made possible by the deskilling of jobs, which was made possible by the [[knowledge transfer]] that scientific management achieved. Knowledge was transferred both to cheaper workers and from workers into tools. Jobs that once would have required craft work first transformed to semiskilled work, then unskilled. At this point the labor had been [[commodification|commoditized]], and thus the competition between workers (and worker populations) moved closer to [[perfect competition|pure]] than it had been, depressing wages and [[job security]]. Jobs could be offshored (giving one human's tasks to others—which could be good for the new worker population but was bad for the old) or they could be rendered nonexistent through automation (giving a human's tasks to machines). Either way, the net result from the perspective of developed-economy workers was that jobs started to pay less, then disappear. The power of labor unions in the mid-twentieth century only led to a push on the part of management to accelerate the process of [[automation]],&lt;ref name="Noble1984"&gt;{{Harvnb|Noble|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; hastening the onset of the later stages just described.

In a central assumption of scientific management, "the worker was taken for granted as a cog in the machinery."&lt;ref name="Rosen1993p139"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1993|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; While scientific management had made jobs unpleasant, its successors made them less remunerative, less secure, and finally nonexistent as a consequence of [[structural unemployment]].

==== Relationship to Fordism ====

It is often assumed that [[Fordism]] derives from Taylor's work. Taylor apparently made this assumption himself when visiting the [[Ford Motor Company]]'s Michigan plants not too long before he died, but it is likely that the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor's work was indirect at best.&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984pp249-253"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=249–253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles E. Sorensen]], a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956p41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until [[Henry Ford II]] took over the company in 1945, that the world's experts were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, it would have failed to attain its great successes. [[Henry Ford]] felt that he had succeeded ''in spite of'', not ''because of'', experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956p41"/&gt; Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor [[Walter Flanders]] in high esteem and credits him for the efficient floorplan layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his production technique. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from Taylorism. Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the [[efficiency movement]] during the decade of 1905-1915.

=== Planned economies ===

Scientific management appealed to managers of [[planned economy|planned economies]] because [[Economic planning|central economic planning]] relies on the idea that the expenses that go into economic production can be precisely predicted and can be optimized by design. The opposite theoretical pole would be [[laissez-faire]] thinking in which the [[invisible hand]] of free markets is the only possible "designer". In reality most economies today are somewhere in between. Another alternative for economic planning is [[workers' self-management]].

==== Soviet Union ====

In the [[Soviet Union]], Taylorism was advocated by [[Aleksei Gastev]] and ''nauchnaia organizatsia truda'' (''the movement for the scientific organisation of labor''). It found support in both [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]]. Gastev continued to promote this system of labor management until his arrest and execution in 1939.&lt;ref name="Beissinger1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beissinger|1988|pp=35–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, the Soviet Union enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism, importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]] and the centrally planned economy can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. As scientific management was believed to epitomize American efficiency,&lt;ref name="Hughes_2004_1989"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] even claimed that "the combination of the Russian revolutionary sweep with American efficiency is the essence of [[Leninism]]."&lt;ref name="Hughes_2004_1989_p251"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2004|p=251}}, quoting Stalin 1976 p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorensen was one of the consultants who brought American know-how to the USSR during this era,&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp193-216"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=193–216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[Cold War]] made such exchanges unthinkable. As the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both sides, the Soviets and the Americans, chose to ignore or deny the contribution that American ideas and expertise had made: the Soviets because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to a rival, and the Americans because they did not wish to acknowledge their part in creating a powerful communist rival. [[Anti-communism]] had always enjoyed widespread popularity in America, and [[anti-capitalism]] in Russia, but after World War II, they precluded any admission by either side that technologies or ideas might be either freely shared or clandestinely stolen.

By the 1950s, scientific management had grown dated, but its goals and practices remained attractive and were also being adopted by the [[German Democratic Republic]] as it sought to increase efficiency in its industrial sectors. In the accompanying photograph from the [[German Federal Archives]], workers discuss standards specifying how each task should be done and how long it should take. The workers are engaged in a state-planned instance of process improvement, but they are pursuing the same goals that were contemporaneously pursued in [[Capitalism|capitalist]] societies, as in the [[Toyota Production System]].

== Organized labor reactions ==
In 1911, organized labor erupted with strong opposition to scientific management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B.

By 1913 [[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote that the "most widely discussed topic today in Europe, and to some extent in Russia, is the 'system' of the American engineer, Frederick Taylor"; Lenin decried it as merely a "'scientific' system of sweating" more work from laborers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/13.htm|title=Lenin: A 'Scientific' System of Sweating|first=V.I.|last=Lenin|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again in 1914, Lenin derided Taylorism as "man’s enslavement by the machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/mar/13.htm|title=Lenin: The Taylor System—Man's Enslavement by the Machine|first=V.I.|last=Lenin|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the [[Russian Revolutions]] brought him to power, Lenin wrote in 1918 that the "Russian is a bad worker [who must] learn to work. The Taylor system... is a combination of the refined brutality of bourgeois exploitation and a number of the greatest scientific achievements in the field of analysing mechanical motions during work, the elimination of superfluous and awkward motions, the elaboration of correct methods of work, the introduction of the best system of accounting and control, etc. The Soviet Republic must at all costs adopt all that is valuable in the achievements of science and technology in this field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/mar/x03.htm|title=The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote box
 |quote = [The early US history of labor relations with scientific management was described by Dr Drury thusly:] ...for a long time there was thus little or no direct [conflict] between scientific management and organized labor... [However] One of the best known experts once spoke to us with satisfaction of the manner in which, in a certain factory where there had been a number of union men, the labor organization had, upon the introduction of scientific management, gradually disintegrated. 

...From 1882 (when the system was started) until 1911, a period of approximately thirty years, there was not a single strike under it, and this in spite of the fact that it was carried on primarily in the steel industry, which was subject to a great many disturbances. For instance, in the [[Philadelphia general strike (1910)|general strike in Philadelphia]], one man only went out at the Tabor plant [managed by Taylor], while at the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin Locomotive]] shops across the street two thousand struck.

...Serious opposition may be said to have been begun in 1911, immediately after certain testimony presented before the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] [by Harrington Emerson] revealed to the country the strong movement setting towards scientific management. National labor leaders, wide-awake as to what might happen in the future, decided that the new movement was a menace to their organization, and at once inaugurated an attack... centered about the installation of scientific management in the [[Watertown Arsenal|government arsenal at Watertown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Watertown Arsenal in Massachusetts provides an example of the application and repeal of the Taylor system in the workplace, due to worker opposition.  In the early 2001, neglect in the Watertown shops included overcrowding, dim-lighting, lack of tools and equipment, and questionable management strategies in the eyes of the workers. Frederick W. Taylor and Carl G. Barth visited Watertown in April 1909 and reported on their observations at the shops. Their conclusion was to apply the Taylor system of management to the shops to produce better results.  Efforts to install the Taylor system began in June 1909.  Over the years of time study and trying to improve the efficiency of workers, criticisms began to evolve.  Workers complained of having to compete with one another, feeling strained and resentful, and feeling excessively tired after work.  There is, however, no evidence that the times enforced were unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aitken|1985}}, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2017}} In June 1913, employees of the Watertown Arsenal petitioned to abolish the practice of scientific management there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1915}}, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; A number of magazine writers inquiring into the effects of scientific management found that the "conditions in shops investigated contrasted favorably with those in other plants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1915}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuing current reactions==
{{criticism section|date=February 2017}}

[[Criticism]] of Taylor's principles of effective [[workmanship]] and the [[productivity]] of the workers continues today. Often, his theories are described as man-contemptuous and portrayed as now overhauled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= F. W. Taylor und der Taylorismus. Über das Wirken und die Lehre Taylors und die Kritik am Taylorismus.|last= Hebeisen|first= W.|publisher= |year= 1999|isbn= |location= Zürich: vdf Hochschulverlag AG.|pages= 7|quote= |via= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, the principles of Taylor are still being pursued by [[Kaizen]] and [[Six Sigma]] and similar methodologies, which are based on the development of working methods and courses based on systematic [[analysis]] rather than relying on tradition and rule of thumb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= F. W. Taylor und der Taylorismus. Über das Wirken und die Lehre Taylors und die Kritik am Taylorismus.|last= Hebeisen|first= W.|publisher= |year=1999|isbn= |location= Zürich: vdf Hochschulverlag AG.|pages= 188|quote= |via= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylorism is, according to Stephen P. Waring, considered very controversial, despite its popularity.  It is often{{quantify|date=June 2017}} criticized for turning the worker into an "automaton" or "machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1915}}, pp. 195–198&lt;/ref&gt; Due to techniques employed with scientific management, employees claim to have become overworked and were hostile to the process. Criticisms commonly came from workers who were subjected to an accelerated work pace, lower standards of workmanship, lower product-quality, and lagging wages.  Workers defied being reduced to such machines, and objected to the practices of Taylorism. Many workers formed unions, demanded higher pay, and went on strike to be free of control issues.  This ignited [[class conflict]], which Taylorism was initially meant{{by whom|date=June 2017}} to prevent.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  Efforts to resolve the conflicts included methods of scientific collectivism, making agreements with unions, and the [[personnel management]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waring|1991}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of 1960 some [[Countermovement|counter-movements]] to Taylorism arose.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Representatives of the so-called [[Human relations movement|Human Relations movement]] urged humanization and democratization of the working world. The criticism of Taylorism supports the unilateral approach of [[labour economics|labor]]. Strictly speaking, Taylorism is not a scientific theory. All theories of F. W. Taylor are based on experiments. On the basis of samples, conclusions were made, which were then generalized. There is no [[Representativeness heuristic|representativeness]] of the selected sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.klett.de/sixcms/detail.php?template=terrasse_artikel__layout__pdf&amp;art_id=1010818|title= Infoblatt Taylorismus.

Another reason for criticizing Taylor's methods stemmed from Taylor's belief that the [[scientific method]] included the calculations of exactly how much time it takes a man to do a particular task, or his rate of work.  However, the opposition to this argument is that such a calculation relies on certain arbitrary, non-scientific decisions such as what constituted the job, which men were timed, and under which conditions.  Any of these factors are subject to change, and therefore can produce inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aitken|1985}}, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dismiss so-called "scientific management"/Taylorism as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

Scientific management was one of the first attempts to systematically treat management and process improvement as a scientific problem. It may have been the first to do so in a "bottom-up" way and found a lineage of successors that have many elements in common. With the advancement of statistical methods, [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control]] began in the 1920s and 1930s. During the 1940s and 1950s, the body of knowledge for doing scientific management evolved into [[operations management]], [[operations research]], and management [[cybernetics]]. In the 1980s [[total quality management]] became widely popular, and in the 1990s "re-engineering" went from a simple word to a mystique. Today's [[Six Sigma]] and [[lean manufacturing]] could be seen as new kinds of scientific management, although their [[cultural evolution|evolutionary]] distance from the original is so great that the comparison might be misleading. In particular, [[Shigeo Shingo]], one of the originators of the [[Toyota Production System]], believed that this system and [[Japanese management culture]] in general should be seen as a kind of scientific management.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

[[Peter Drucker]] saw Frederick Taylor as the creator of [[knowledge management]], because the aim of scientific management was to produce knowledge about how to improve work processes. Although the typical application of scientific management was manufacturing, Taylor himself advocated scientific management for all sorts of work, including the management of universities and government. For example, Taylor believed scientific management could be extended to "the work of our salesmen".  Shortly after his death, his acolyte Harlow S. Person began to lecture corporate audiences on the possibility of using Taylorism for "sales engineering"&lt;ref name="Dawson2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawson|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Person was talking about what is now called [[sales process engineering]]—engineering the processes that [[sales]]people use—not about what we call [[sales engineering]] today.) This was a watershed insight in the history of corporate [[marketing]].

Google's methods of increasing productivity and output can be seen to be influenced by Taylorism as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carr|first1=Nicholas G.|title=The Shallows|date=June 2010|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silicon Valley company is a forerunner in applying behavioral science to increase knowledge worker productivity. In classic scientific management as well as  approaches like lean management or business process reengineering leaders and experts develop and define standard. Leading high-tech companies use the concept of nudge management to increase productivity of employees. More and more business leaders start to make use of this new scientific management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Philip|last2=Freibichler|first2=Wolfgang|year=2017|title=Nudge management: applying behavioural science to increase knowledge worker productivity|url=http://jorgdesign.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41469-017-0014-1|journal=Journal of Organization Design|volume=6:4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's [[Military|militaries]] employ all of the major goals and tactics of scientific management, if not under that name. Of the key points, all but wage incentives for increased output are used by modern military organizations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Wage incentives rather appear in the form of skill bonuses for enlistments.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Scientific management has had an important influence in sports, where stop watches and motion studies rule the day. (Taylor himself enjoyed sports, especially tennis and golf. He and a partner won a national championship in doubles tennis. He invented improved tennis racquets and improved golf clubs, although other players liked to tease him for his unorthodox designs, and they did not catch on as replacements for the mainstream implements).&lt;ref name="Kanigel1997"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kanigel|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern human resources can be seen to have begun in the scientific management era, most notably in the writings of [[Katherine M. H. Blackford]], who was also a proponent of [[eugenics]].

Practices descended from scientific management are currently used in offices and in medicine (e.g. [[managed care]]) as well.&lt;ref name="Head2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Head|2005|p=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century the tendency to overcome Taylorism is very great. The trend is moving away from assembly line work, since people are increasingly being replaced by [[machine]]s in production plants and sub-processes are [[Automation|automated]], so that human labor is not necessary in these cases. The desire for automated [[workflow]] in companies is intended to reduce costs and support the company at the operational level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Business Process Management.|last=Dumas, M., La Rosa, M., Mendling, J. &amp; Reijers, H.|first=|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=Berlin Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.|pages=372|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it can be observed that many companies try to make the [[workplace]] as comfortable as possible for the [[employees]]. This is achieved by light flooded rooms, [[Feng shui|Feng Shui]] methods in the workplace or even by creative jobs. The efficiency and creativity of the employees is to be promoted by a pleasant atmosphere at the workplace. Approaches of the Scientific Management, in which attempts are also made to make the work environment pleasant, are partly recognizable here.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/karriere/ausland/jobs-im-silicon-valley-arbeiten-bei-google-facebook-evernote-a-965811.html|title=Arbeiten im Silicon Valley.

In the works of Gouldner and Crozier, the recognition of the plurality of [[industrial society|industrial]] forms is being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geschichte des organisatorischen Denkens|last=Bonazzi|first=G.|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=Wiesbaden: Springer Fachmedien.|pages=261|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, we have a modern corporate management, where managers are given the available positions in [[Company|companies]] and are given the right to take legal action.&lt;ref name="Freriks 1996 117"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theoretische Modelle der Betriebsgröße im Maschinenbau. Koordination und Kontrollmechanismen bei organisatorischem Wachstum.|last=Freriks|first=R.|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=Opladen: Leske+ Budrich.|pages=117|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The working world of the 21st century is mainly based on [[Total quality management|Total Quality Management]]. This is derived from quality control. In contrast to Taylorism, by which products are produced in the shortest possible time without any form of quality control and delivered to the end customer, the focus in the 21st century is on quality control at TQM. In order to avoid error rates, it is necessary to hire [[Expert|specialists]] to check all the products which have been manufactured before they are delivered to the end customer. The quality controls have improved over time, and incorrect partial processes can be detected in time and removed from the production process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einführung in das Management von Geschäftsprozessen.|last=Koch|first=S.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=Berling Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.|pages=185|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylorism approaches are largely prevalent in companies where machines can not perform certain activities. Certain subprocesses are still to be carried out by humans, such as the sorting out of damaged fruit in the final process before the goods are packed by machines. It turns out that the quality control is ultimately to be verified by the individual man. Certain activities remain similar to the approach of Taylorism. There are no "zero error programs", employees have to be trained and thus reduce error rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einführung in das Management von Geschäftsprozessen. Berling Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.|last=Koch|first=S.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=Berling Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.|pages=185|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[invention]] of the management one managed positions, which are equipped with disposition rights. The positions are occupied by paid employees and form the basis for the current, modern [[Management|corporate management.]] In order to be able to perceive these positions, it was no longer necessary to bring in resources such as capital, but instead [[job qualification|qualification]]s were necessary. Written rights are also passed on to employees, which means that the leaders of an organization tend to fall into the background and merely have a passive position.&lt;ref name="Freriks 1996 117"/&gt;

The structure and size of a company must be distinguished. Depending on which dispositions are predominant, the size of the company, the sector, and the number of employees in an organization, one can examine whether approaches of Taylorism are prevalent. It is believed to be predominant in the automotive industry. In spite of the fact that a lot of activities have been replaced by machines during the production, it is ultimately the person who can check the [[quality (business)|quality]] of a product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theoretische Modelle der Betriebsgröße im Maschinenbau. Koordination und Kontrollmechanismen bei organisatorischem Wachstum.|last=Freriks|first=R.|publisher=1996|year=|isbn=|location=Opladen: Leske+ Budrich.|pages=114|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylorism led to a [[performance]] increase in companies. All superfluous working steps are avoided. The company benefits from the [[productivity]] of the workers and this in turn from higher [[wage]]s. Unused productivity resources were effectively exploited by Taylorism.&lt;ref name="Von Berg 2009 1–2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humanisierung der Arbeit. Neue Formen der Arbeitsgestaltung als Determinante von Arbeitszufriedenheit am Beispiel teilautonomer Arbeitsgruppen.|last=Von Berg|first=A.|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=Georg- August Universität: Göttingen.|pages=1–2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's work environment in the 21st century benefits from the [[humanity (virtue)|humanity]] of working conditions. Corporate [[Strategy|strategies]] are increasingly focused on the flexibility of work. Flexible adaptation to demand should be possible. The qualifications of the employees, the work content as well as the work processes are determined by the competition situation on the market. The aim is to promote [[Discipline|self-discipline]] and the [[motivation]] of employees in order to achieve their own tasks and at the same time to prevent [[wikt:monotonous|monotonous]] work. Technical progress has led to more humane working conditions since inhumane work steps are done by the [[machine]]s.&lt;ref name="Von Berg 2009 1–2"/&gt;

Taylorism's approach is called [[wikt:inhuman|inhuman]]. The increased wage alone is not a permanent incentive for the workers to carry out the same monotonous work. Worker-friendly work structures are required. People no longer want to be perceived merely as executive organ. The complete separation from [[manual labor|manual]] and [[Headworks|headwork]] leads to a lack of [[pleasure]] in the execution of the work steps.&lt;ref name="Von Berg 2009 1–2"/&gt;

In the 21st century the rising level of [[education]] leads to better trained workers, but the [[Competition (companies)|competitive]] [[pressure]] also rises. The interplay of [[Economy|economic]] as well as the pressure to innovate also lead to uncertainty among employees. The national diseases in the 21st century have become [[Occupational burnout|burn-out]] phenomena and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]s, often in conjunction with the [[stress (psychological)|stress]] and the increased performance pressure in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humanisierung der Arbeit.

'''StopWatch''' is a joint venture between a  range of civil society organisations, activist and human rights groups, academics and campaigners. StopWatch was established to address concerns about the use of [[Stop and Search#Search without arrest|Stop and Search]] powers by police in the UK with regards to law, community relations and civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegrio.com/politics/rev-jackson-starts-stopwatch-a-uk-civil-rights-group.php |title= Jackson starts stopwatch a uk civil rights group|publisher = The Grio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its primary target is addressing the significant ethnic dis-proportionality in the use of stop and search; however, it also aims to review the use of powers which do not require reasonable suspicion to order a stop and search such as section 60 and to ensure effective monitoring and accountability are employed in conjunction with Stop and Search powers. It also aims to promote more effective methods of policing that do not have the same impact upon civil liberties and community relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stop-watch.org/about.html |title=About StopWatch |publisher=Stop Watch |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The StopWatch Campaign involves: [http://karenchouhan.org/ Equanomics UK]; [[Federation of Student Islamic Societies]] (FOSIS); [http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/mannheim/ Mannheim Centre for Criminology], [[London School of Economics|LSE]]; [[Muslim Safety Forum]]; [[NACRO]]; [http://www.notanotherdrop.com/NAD/Welcome.html Not Another Drop];[[Open Society Justice Initiative]]; [[Release (agency)|Release]];[[Runnymede Trust|The Runnymede Trust]]; [[King's College London|School of Law, King’s College London]]; [[Second Wave (charity)|Second Wave]]; and [[Turning Point (charity)|Turning Point]].

==History==
StopWatch formed in the summer of 2010 in response to concerns about the use of a variety of stop and search powers. Following a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that the power to search people without suspicion was illegal, amendments to [[Terrorism Act 2000#Section 44 powers (stop and search)|Section 44]] powers were proposed by the new [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rules on stop and search changed|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10555430|work=July 8, 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 November 2010|date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously police officers were, in certain defined areas, able to use anti-terrorism legislation to stop people without requiring reasonable suspicion that they were actually involved in terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/justice/stop-and-search/section-44/index.php |title=Section 44 Terrorism Act &amp;#124; Liberty - protecting civil liberties, promoting human rights |publisher=Liberty-human-rights.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new proposals police officers would no longer have this license. However, StopWatch has drawn attention to changes to the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] which would remove requirements for the collection of key data such as name, and whether any injury or damage resulted from the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/1108/contents/made |title=The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Codes of Practice) (Revisions to Codes E and F) Order 2010 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

StopWatch was officially launched on the 18 October 2010 by the [[Reverend Jesse Jackson]] at Kings College London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jesse Jackson launches group to tackle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/religion_and_ethics/newsid_9103000/9103767.stm|work=October 18, 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=November 3, 2010|date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverend Jackson's has previously addressed similar issues in the US with his [[Rainbow/PUSH|Rainbow PUSH]] coalition in New York.

One of StopWatch’s key targets is a 50% reduction in dis-proportionality in stop and search figures. Since StopWatch formed statistics were released indicating that Black people were 26 times more likely to be stopped and searched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Townsend|first=Mark|title=Black people are 26 times more likely than whites to face stop and search|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/17/stop-and-search-race-figures|work=October 17, 2010|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=3 November 2010|location=London|date=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of StopWatch have stated that their aim is not to eliminate stop and search powers per se, rather to help create a more responsible, and measured approach to its use and to Police officers’ interaction with the public generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stop-watch.org/about.html |title=About StopWatch |publisher=Stop Watch |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tapas''', formerly known as '''Tapastic''', is a [[webtoon]] syndicate set up by [[South Korea]]n entrepreneur Chang Kim in October 2012. Operated from both [[Seoul]] and [[San Francisco]] by '''Tapas Media''', Tapastic features a large collection of short-form, English-language webcomics and [[webtoons]] from over 5,000 artists.&lt;ref name=Startup&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2015/04/03/startup-battles-naver-in-english-webtoons/|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|title=Startup Battles Naver in English Webtoons|last=Lee|first=Jun-Youb|date=2015-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website aims to create a platform where comic creators can publish their works without cost, describing itself as the "[[YouTube]] of Comics." Since 2016, the Tapas Media's [[mobile app]] also publishes books through a [[freemium]] business model.

==History==
{{quotebox|"We discovered a lot of people still use print publishing, and paid their own money to print comics ... Or people start their own website, in which case you have to build your audience, think about mobile, pay for hosting. It just doesn't really work out."|Chang Kim&lt;ref name=Youtube&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/54294/20150520/youtube-comics-tapastic-creating-new-publishing-opportunities-creators-fans.htm|publisher=''Tech Times''|title=The YouTube Of Comics: How Tapastic Offers New Publishing Opportunities For Creators And Fans|last=Serafino|first=Jason|date=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=30%}}

Chang Kim came up with the idea of starting an open-publishing platform after wondering if there was a singular online location to read all the webcomics he was a fan of. While YouTube users were making money through uploading independent video content, there existed no equivalent for comic creators. Kim also noted that this business model was already successful in South Korea.&lt;ref name=Youtube /&gt; With $3.4 million in backing from both American and Korean investors, including [[Daum Kakao]] and former [[Facebook]] Chief Technology Officer Adam D’Angelo, Kim started up Tapastic in 2012.&lt;ref name=Startup /&gt;

In 2014, Tapastic reached a partnership with [[Daum Communications]], which operates the largest webtoon portal in South Korea. Through this partnership, Tapastic hopes to bring over successful Korean titles to see if they can find success in the United States market. The partnership deal also resulted in $2 million USD of [[Series A round|Series A funding]] for Tapastic.&lt;ref name=Daum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/tapastic-raises-2m-to-build-out-its-youtube-of-webcomics-and-visual-storytelling/|publisher=''[[Tech Crunch]]''|title=Tapastic Raises $2M To Build Out Its YouTube Of Webcomics And Visual Storytelling|last=Etherington|first=Darrell|date=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2014/01/tapastics-ceo-talks-new-partnership-launch-of-like-a-wolf/|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|title=Tapastic’s CEO talks new partnership, launch of ‘Like a Wolf’|last=Alverson|first=Brigid|date=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Tapas Media released a new mobile app, simply titled "Tapas". Using a [[freemium]] business model by offering content to readers for free as an incentive to pay more, the app added [[books]] to its line-up of offered media. According to Tapas Media, around 10&amp;ndash;20% of the books are offered for free, creating a form of [[product sample|sample preview]]. Books are split up into "bite-sized micro chapters" in order to allow people to read portions within a few minutes. The model was inspired by [[free-to-play]] video games, such as ''[[Candy Crush]]''.&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/Apps/article/69909-e-book-app-applies-gaming-e-commerce-model-to-mobile-reading.html|publisher=''[[Publishers Weekly]]''|title=E-book App Applies Gaming E-Commerce Model To Mobile Reading|last=Gross|first=Anisse|date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2017, Tapastic announced that it had changed its name to Tapas, redesigning parts of their website in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Tapas_App/hello-tapas-io-b41cb5f2d1e7|work=[[Medium.com]]|title=Hello, tapas.io|author=Tapas Media|date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tapas Media changed its [[terms of service]] the same day: the addition of a "Right of First Refusal" clause spurred controversy among the service' users. According to this clause, Tapas Media had the right to negotiate and refuse licensing deals for its users. Tapas Media reversed its decision on May 18, 2017 due to poor reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/05/18/webcomics-publisher-hiveworks-weighs-tapas-right-first-refusal-controversy/|work=[[Bleeding Cool]]|title=Webcomics Publisher Hiveworks Weighs In On Tapas "Right To First Refusal" Controversy|last=Terror|first=Jude|date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sync with their name change, they have also added several features such as friend codes, which benefits gives the code-owner and the invitee 200 coins, used for unlocking episodes and chapters.

==Content==
At its launch, Tapastic billed itself as the "YouTube of Comics".&lt;ref name=Youtube /&gt; By 2015, the website features a collection of webcomics from over 5,000 unique artists.&lt;ref name=Startup /&gt; Kim stated that [[slice-of-life]]-style webcomics are the most popular on the service, which is likely because of their "shareability" and because they can quickly be read. Kim also noted that webcomics featuring school life and work life are "deeply relatable" to Tapastic readers.&lt;ref name=Youtube /&gt;

The website has formed an interactive community, with fans discussing the comics and some creators asking for fan feedback.&lt;ref name=Youtube /&gt; According to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Tapastic had over a million active readers by April 2016, most of which are from North America and 90% of which are under the age of 34.&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly /&gt; Tapastic allows its content creators to profit from their work by selling premium webcomic series and by receiving [[donations]] in turn of exclusive benefits.

'''The Seven Pillars of Life''' are the essential principles of [[life]] described by [[Daniel E. Koshland, Jr.|Daniel E. Koshland]] in 2002 in order to create a universal definition of life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/biology/2002-03-29-life-pillars.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One stated goal of this universal definition is to aid in understanding and identifying [[artificial life|artificial]] and [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref&gt;Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216&lt;/ref&gt; The seven pillars are Program, Improvisation, Compartmentalization, Energy, Regeneration, Adaptability, and Seclusion. These can be abbreviated as PICERAS.

== The Seven Pillars ==

=== Program ===
Koshland defines "Program" as an "organized plan that describes both the ingredients themselves and the kinetics of the interactions among ingredients as the living system persists through time."&lt;ref&gt;Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216&lt;/ref&gt; In natural life as it is known on Earth, the program operates through the mechanisms of [[nucleic acids]] and [[amino acids]], but the concept of program can apply to other imagined or undiscovered mechanisms.

=== Improvisation ===
"Improvisation" refers to the living system's ability to change its program in response to the larger [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which it exists. An example of improvisation on earth is [[natural selection]].

=== Compartmentalization ===
"Compartmentalization" refers to the separation of spaces in the living system that allow for separate environments for necessary chemical processes. Compartmentalization is necessary to protect the concentration of the ingredients for a reaction from outside environments.

=== Energy ===
Because living systems involve net movement in terms of chemical movement or body movement, and lose energy in those movements through [[entropy]], [[energy]] is required for a living system to exist. The main source of energy on Earth is the sun, but other sources of energy exist for life on Earth, such as hydrogen gas or methane, used in [[chemosynthesis]].

=== Regeneration ===
"Regeneration" in a living system refers to the general compensation for losses and degradation in the various components and processes in the system. This covers the thermodynamic loss in chemical reactions, the wear and tear of larger parts, and the larger decline of components of the system in [[ageing]]. Living systems replace these losses by importing molecules from the outside environment, synthesizing new molecules and components, or creating new generations to start the system over again.

=== Adaptability ===
"Adaptability" is the ability of a living system to respond to needs, dangers, or changes. It is distinguished from improvisation because the response is timely and does not involve a change of the program. Adaptability occurs from a molecular level to a behavioral level through [[feedback]] and [[Feedforward neural network|feedforward]] systems. For example, an animal seeing a predator will respond to the danger with hormonal changes and escape behavior.

=== Seclusion ===

== Criticism ==
Y. N. Zhuravlev and V. A. Avetisov have analyzed Koshland's seven pillars from the context of [[primordial life]] and, though calling the concept "elegant," point out that the pillars of compartmentalization, program, and seclusion don't apply well to the non-differentiated earliest life.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuravlev, Y. N. and V. A. Avetisov."The definition of life in the context of its origin"''[[Biogeosciences]]'', 2006-07-10. Retrieved on 2008-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1866">[[Emmanuel Levinas]], in an attempt to overcome a certain naivety within his exploration of ethics as given in what he describes as the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] encounter, attempts to introduce language into what had only been a "picture" of such an encounter.  He distinguishes between '''The saying''' of something and what it is that is said during the talk, '''The said'''.

== Ethics and language ==

=== The Saying ===
The Saying relates to an irreducible exposure to the other.  The saying makes the self-exposure of sincerity possible, a way of giving everything, of not holding secrets, of complete generosity.  One is corrupted into, learns or decides, to lie, to simulate, to dissimulate, to ignore and remain politically or economically silent.

=== The Said ===
The said, on the other hand, refers to the intelligibility and reference of what is communicated or transferred, it can be subjected to the closure truth as total [[metaphysics of presence|presence]], it is associated with [[ontology]] (i.e., philosophy and science).

::Man can give himself in saying to the point of poetry - or he can withdraw into the non-saying of lies. Language as saying is an ethical openness to the other; as that which is said - reduced to a fixed identity or synchronized presence - it is an ontological closure of the other.’  &lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Richard. "Dialogues with contemporary continental thinkers", Manchester: MUP, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

The complication Levinas introduces into his analysis of the face-to-face gives his ethics a further reach toward the kind of universalist ethics of a [[humanism]]:

::One can see an image of destitution and choose a logic in which to ignore it, one can hear the cry, the plea, and be summoned to the logic of another person.

The '''Ugandan kob''' (''Kobus kob thomasi'') is a [[subspecies]] of the [[kob]], a type of [[antelope]] found in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] in [[South Sudan]], [[Uganda]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[Ethiopia]].  It is normally reddish-brown, in which it differs from other kob subspecies. A Ugandan kob appears on the [[coat of arms of Uganda]].

The Ugandan kob is sometimes alternatively classified into the [[subgenus]] ''[[Adenota]]''. References are sometimes made to it by the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name of '''Oeganda-waterbok'''.

[[File:2014-06-02 Sudan Flüchtlinge Protest gegen Abschiebung, Weißekreuzplatz Hannover, (07) Getränke an der Volxküche.jpg|thumb|A Volxküche event in Germany, 2014]]
'''VolxKuche'''/'''VolxKüche''' ('''VoKu'''/'''VoKü'''), '''peoples kitchen''', '''free supper club''' or '''kitchen for all''', are names used for a weekly or regularly occurring group cooking event, at which the meal is served free of charge or at cost. The name derives from the German expression "people's kitchen" (soup kitchen), as a secular counterpart of the Christian [[soup kitchen]].

Volxküchen are found usually in collective and/or self-managed arrangements (pubs, information stores, youth centers or autonomous centers) with politically left self-identity. In general at least one vegetarian meal is offered, frequently also vegan food. Often soon to be [[Shelf life|expired]] ingredients are obtained at cost, or donated by food banks, food manufacturers or community gardens.&lt;ref name="VokuCookbook"&gt;{{Cite book

==History==
The Volxküche in the current sense arose in the European squatter scene of the early 1980s.

==English spelling and pronunciation==
The spelling of Volxküche occurred as an expression of anti-nationalism. Historically nationalism had used the term "[[Volk (German word)|Volk]]/Volks" with negative consequences.  This use was a rejection of the negative connotation which had the intention of "excluding" many groups of German society. It is at the same time a funny self-willed expression of the anarchistic and/or autonomous scene.

In the US the word is spelled without an umlaut, and pronounced like "folks coo heh". The alternate German spelling Volkskueche (Volksküche) was intentionally not used.

== US locations ==
A 'Free Supper Club" in San Francisco, held twice a month as of 2013, is calling itself ''Volxkuche''. Besides a free dinner, performances, film and community are provided.&lt;ref&gt;VokuSF Website: http://www.vokusf.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Black Raku Tea Bowl.jpg|thumb|right|Wabi-sabi tea bowl, [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]], 16th century]]

In traditional [[Japanese aesthetics]], {{nihongo||[[wikt:侘|侘]][[wikt:寂|寂]]|'''wabi-sabi'''}} is a [[world view]] centered on the acceptance of [[wikt:transience|transience]] and imperfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm|title=What Is Wabi-Sabi?|website=nobleharbor.com|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete".&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; It is a concept derived from the [[Buddhist]] teaching of the {{nihongo|[[three marks of existence]]|三法印|sanbōin}}, specifically {{nihongo|[[impermanence]]|無常|mujō}}, {{nihongo|[[dukkha|suffering]]|苦|ku}} and {{nihongo|[[śūnyatā|emptiness or absence of self-nature]]|空|kū}}.

Characteristics of the ''wabi-sabi'' aesthetic include [[asymmetry]], roughness, [[simplicity]], economy, austerity, modesty, [[intimacy]], and appreciation of the ingenuous integrity of natural objects and processes.

==Description==
According to [[Leonard Koren]], ''wabi-sabi'' can be defined as "the most conspicuous and characteristic feature of traditional Japanese beauty and it occupies roughly the same position in the Japanese [[wiktionary:pantheon|pantheon]] of aesthetic values as do the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ideals of [[beauty]] and perfection in the far West."&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; Whereas  Andrew Juniper notes that "If an object or expression can bring about, within us, a sense of serene melancholy and a spiritual longing, then that object could be said to be wabi-sabi."&lt;ref name=Juniper&gt;{{cite book |last=Juniper |first=Andrew |title=Wabi Sabi: The Japanese Art of Impermanence | publisher=Tuttle Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=0-8048-3482-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Richard Powell, "Wabi-sabi nurtures all that is authentic by acknowledging three simple realities: nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect."&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{cite book | author=Powell, Richard R. | title=Wabi Sabi Simple | publisher=Adams Media | year=2004 | isbn=1-59337-178-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' do not translate easily. ''Wabi'' originally referred to the loneliness of living in nature, remote from society; ''sabi'' meant "chill", "lean" or "withered". Around the 14th century these meanings began to change, taking on more positive connotations.&lt;ref name=Koren&gt;{{cite book |last=Koren |first=Leonard |title=Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets and Philosophers |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |year=1994 |isbn=1-880656-12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wabi'' now connotes rustic simplicity, freshness or quietness, and can be applied to both natural and human-made objects, or understated elegance. It can also refer to quirks and anomalies arising from the process of construction, which add uniqueness and elegance to the object. ''Sabi'' is beauty or serenity that comes with age, when the life of the object and its impermanence are evidenced in its [[patina]] and wear, or in any visible repairs.

After centuries of incorporating artistic and Buddhist influences from China, wabi-sabi eventually evolved into a distinctly Japanese ideal. Over time, the meanings of ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' shifted to become more lighthearted and hopeful. Around 700 years ago, particularly among the Japanese nobility, understanding emptiness and imperfection was honored as tantamount to the first step to [[satori]], or enlightenment. In today's Japan, the meaning of wabi-sabi is often condensed to "wisdom in natural simplicity". In art books, it is typically defined as "flawed beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Taro. (2004) [[Taro Gold]]'s ''Living Wabi Sabi'' (Kansas City: [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-7407-3960-3}}), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

From an engineering or design point of view, ''wabi'' may be interpreted as the imperfect quality of any object, due to inevitable limitations in design and construction/manufacture especially with respect to unpredictable or changing usage conditions; then ''sabi'' could be interpreted as the aspect of imperfect reliability, or limited mortality of any object, hence the phonological and etymological connection with the Japanese word sabi, {{nihongo|to rust|錆||also pronounced ''sabi''}}. Although the [[kanji]] characters for "rust" is not the same {{nihongo||寂|sabi}} in ''wabi-sabi'', the original spoken word (pre-kanji, ''[[yamato-kotoba]]'') is believed to be one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;錆びをめぐる話題, 井上勝也, 裳華房, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.memenet.or.jp/kinugawa/sabi/00121.htm さびの文字] on the Kinugawa Chain Mfg. Co. Ltd website&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Contemporary wabi-sabi tea bowl.jpg|left|thumb|Modern tea vessel made in the ''wabi-sabi'' style]]
A good example of this embodiment may be seen in certain styles of Japanese pottery. In the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], the pottery items used are often rustic and simple-looking, e.g. [[Hagi ware]], with shapes that are not quite symmetrical, and colors or textures that appear to emphasize an unrefined or simple style. In fact, it is up to the knowledge and observational ability of the participant to notice and discern the hidden signs of a truly excellent design or [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] (akin to the appearance of a diamond in the rough). This may be interpreted as a kind of wabi-sabi aesthetic, further confirmed by the way the colour of glazed items is known to change over time as hot water is repeatedly poured into them (''sabi'') and the fact that tea bowls are often deliberately chipped or nicked at the bottom (''wabi''), which serves as a kind of signature of the ''Hagi-yaki'' style.

''Wabi'' and ''sabi'' both suggest sentiments of desolation and solitude. In the [[Mahayana Buddhist]] view of the universe, these may be viewed as positive characteristics, representing liberation from a material world and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] to a simpler life. Mahayana philosophy itself, however, warns that genuine understanding cannot be achieved through words or language, so accepting wabi-sabi on nonverbal terms may be the most appropriate approach. Simon Brown&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book | author=Brown, Simon | title=Practical Wabi Sabi | publisher=Carroll &amp; Brown |year=2007 | isbn=1-904760-55-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that wabi-sabi describes a means whereby students can learn to live life through the senses and better engage in life as it happens, rather than be caught up in unnecessary thoughts. In this sense wabi-sabi is the material representation of Zen Buddhism. The idea is that being surrounded by natural, changing, unique objects helps us connect to our real world and escape potentially stressful distractions.

In one sense wabi-sabi is a training whereby the student of wabi-sabi learns to find the most basic, natural objects interesting, fascinating and beautiful. Fading autumn leaves would be an example. Wabi-sabi can change our perception of the world to the extent that a chip or crack in a vase makes it more interesting and gives the object greater meditative value. Similarly materials that age such as bare wood, paper and fabric become more interesting as they exhibit changes that can be observed over time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' concepts are religious in origin, but actual usage of the words in Japanese is often quite casual because of the [[syncretic]] nature of Japanese belief.

==In Japanese arts==
Many [[Japanese art]]s over the past thousand years have been influenced by [[Zen]] and [[Mahayana]] philosophy, particularly acceptance and contemplation of the imperfection, constant [[flux]] and [[impermanence]] of all things. Such arts can exemplify a wabi-sabi aesthetic. Examples include:
* [[Honkyoku]] (traditional [[shakuhachi]] music of wandering Zen monks)
* [[Ikebana]] (flower arrangement)
* [[Bonsai]] design features such as snags, deadwood and hollow trunks highlight passage of time and natural cycles. Bonsai are often displayed in fall color or after they have shed leaves seasonally, to admire their bare branches.
* [[Japanese garden]]s, [[Zen garden]]s  (tray gardens)
* [[Japanese poetry]]
* [[Japanese pottery]], [[Hagi ware]], [[Raku ware]]
* [[Japanese tea ceremony]]

A contemporary Japanese appraisal of this concept is found in the influential essay ''[[In Praise of Shadows]]'' by [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]].

==Western use==
Designer [[Leonard Koren]] (born 1948) in 1994 published ''Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets &amp; Philosophers''&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; as an examination of wabi-sabi, contrasting it with Western ideals of beauty. According to Penelope Green, Koren's book subsequently "became a talking point for a wasteful culture intent on penitence and a touchstone for designers of all stripes."&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Penelope|title=An Idiosyncratic Designer, a Serene New Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/garden/23leonard.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter [[Bernard Leach]] (1887–1979) was deeply influenced by Japanese aesthetics  and techniques and founded an influential European aesthetic movement which also included Dame [[Lucy Rie]] and [[Hans Coper]].

Some [[haiku in English]] adapt the wabi-sabi aesthetic, with spare, minimalist poems that evoke loneliness and transience,{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} such as [[Nick Virgilio]]'s "autumn twilight:/ the wreath on the door/ lifts in the wind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Cor van den Heuvel]], editor. ''The Haiku Anthology''. Fireside, 1986. {{ISBN|0671628372}} p285&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of American artist [[John Connell]] (born 1940) is  centered on the idea of wabi.&lt;ref&gt;Hess Art Collection, Hatje Cantz, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Stuckist]] artist and [[remodernist film]]maker [[Jesse Richards]] (born 1975) employs it in nearly all of his work, along with [[mono no aware]].

During the 1990s the concept was borrowed by computer software developers and employed in [[Agile programming]] and [[Wiki]] to describe acceptance of the state of ongoing imperfection that is the product of these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 16 March 2009, [[Marcel Theroux]] presented "In Search of Wabi Sabi" on [[BBC Four]] as part of the channel's ''Hidden Japan'' season of programming. Theroux traveled throughout Japan trying to understand the aesthetic tastes of its people, beginning by comically enacting a challenge from the book ''Living Wabi Sabi'' by [[Taro Gold]] to "ask people on a Tokyo street to describe Wabi Sabi." Theroux showed that, just as Gold predicted, "they will likely give you a polite shrug and explain that Wabi Sabi is simply unexplainable." &lt;ref&gt;Gold, Taro. (2004) [[Taro Gold]]'s ''Living Wabi Sabi'' (Kansas City: [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-7407-3960-3}}), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Dorsey]], the billionaire founder of [[Twitter]] and [[Square, Inc.|Square]], promotes the Wabi-sabi philosophy of design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Zanzibar leopard''' is an [[African leopard]] (''Panthera pardus pardus'') population on [[Unguja|Unguja Island]] in the [[Zanzibar]] archipelago, [[Tanzania]]. It is the island's largest terrestrial [[carnivore]] and [[apex predator]]. In 2008, it was considered [[extinct]] due to persecution by local hunters.&lt;ref name=WalshGoldman08&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Walsh, M.T.  |author2=Goldman, H.V. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008 |title=Updating the Inventory of Zanzibar Leopard Specimens |url=https://www.academia.edu/694088/Updating_the_inventory_of_Zanzibar_leopard_specimens/ |journal=Cat News |volume=49 |pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing conflict between people and leopards in the 20th century led to their demonization and determined attempts to exterminate them. Efforts to develop a leopard [[conservation biology|conservation]] program in the mid-1990s were shelved when wildlife researchers concluded that there was little prospect for the population's long-term survival.&lt;ref name=Stuart/&gt; However, camera trap footage revealed in 2018 of a similar-looking leopard has renewed hopes for the population's survival, though little information is known.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insideedition.com/zanzibar-leopard-captured-camera-despite-being-declared-extinct-43962|title=Zanzibar Leopard Captured on Camera, Despite Being Declared Extinct|work=Inside Edition|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Zanzibar leopard was described as a [[leopard]] [[subspecies]] by [[Reginald Innes Pocock]], who proposed the [[scientific name]] ''Panthera pardus adersi'' in 1932.&lt;ref name="Pocock1932"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pocock|first1=R.

== Evolutionary history ==
The [[evolution]]ary history of the Zanzibar leopard parallels that of other endemics on Unguja, including the [[Zanzibar servaline genet]] and the [[Zanzibar red colobus]]. It is thought to have evolved in isolation from the African leopard since at least the end of the [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]], when the island was separated from mainland Tanzania by rising [[sea level]]s. The [[founder effect]] and [[adaptation]] to local conditions produced a smaller leopard than its continental relatives and one whose [[rosette (zoology)|rosettes]] have partially disintegrated into spots.&lt;ref name=Pakenham1984&gt;{{cite book | author = Pakenham, R.H.W. | year = 1984 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/14538645/The-Mammals-of-Zanzibar-and-Pemba/ | title = The Mammals of Zanzibar and Pemba Islands | location = Harpenden | publisher = privately printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kingdon1989&gt;{{cite book | author = Kingdon, J. | year = 1989 | title = Island Africa: The Evolution of Africa's Rare Animals and Plants | location = Princeton | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior and Ecology  ==
Very little is known about the Zanzibar leopard's [[behavior]] and ecology.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Walsh, M.T. |author2=Goldman, H.V. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/14568104/The-Zanzibar-Leopard-between-Science-and-Cryptozoology/ |title=The Zanzibar Leopard Between Science and Cryptozoology |journal=Nature East Africa |volume=33 |issue=1/2 |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has never been studied in the wild, and the last sighting of a live leopard happened in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=Swai1983&gt;Swai, I.S. (1983). ''Wildlife Conservation Status in Zanzibar''. Unpublished M.Sc. dissertation, [[University of Dar es Salaam]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Most [[zoology|zoologists]] have since presumed the Zanzibar leopard to be extinct or very nearly so.&lt;ref name=Stuart&gt;{{cite book |authors=Stuart, C. &amp; Stuart, T. |year=1997 |title=A Preliminary Faunal Survey of South-eastern Unguja (Zanzibar) with Special Emphasis on the Leopard ''Panthera pardus adersi'' |publisher=African-Arabian Wildlife Research Centre |location=Loxton, South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only six skins have been located in museums, including the [[type (zoology)|type specimen]] in the [[Natural History Museum, London]], and a much-faded mounted specimen in the [[Zanzibar Museum]].&lt;ref name=WalshGoldman08/&gt;
However, Zanzibar government statistics indicate that leopards were still being killed by hunters in the mid-1990s, and islanders continue to report sightings and [[livestock]] [[predation]].&lt;ref name=Goldman2002&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goldman, H.V.  |author2=Walsh, M.T.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2002 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/13994714/Is-the-Zanzibar-Leopard-Panthera-pardus-adersi-Extinct/ | title = Is the Zanzibar Leopard (''Panthera pardus adersi'') Extinct? | journal = Journal of East African Natural History | volume = 91 | issue = 1/2 | pages = 15–25 | doi = 10.2982/0012-8317(2002)91[15:ITZLPP]2.0.CO;2 | issn = 0012-8317}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Extirpation ==
[[File:Zanzibar Leopard 8.JPG|thumb|Close up of head]] 
Rural Zanzibaris’ descriptions of the leopard and its habits are characterized by the widespread [[belief]] that a large number of these [[carnivore]]s are kept by [[witchcraft|witches]] and sent by them to harm or otherwise harass villagers. This belief comes together with an elaborate package of ideas about how leopards are bred, trained, exchanged and sent to do the evil bidding of their owners. For local farmers this supplies a neat explanation for [[predation]] by leopards, and more generally for their appearance "out of place" in the vicinity of farms and villages.&lt;ref name=Goldman1997&gt;{{cite web |author1=Goldman, H.V.  |author2=Walsh, M.T.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1997 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/17317225/A-Leopard-in-Jeopardy-An-Anthropological-Survey-of-Practices-and-Beliefs-which-Threaten-the-Survival-of-the-Zanzibar-Leopard-Panthera-pardus-adersi/ | title = A Leopard in Jeopardy: An Anthropological Survey of Practices and Beliefs which Threaten the Survival of the Zanzibar Leopard (''Panthera pardus adersi'') | work =  Zanzibar Forestry Technical Paper No. 63, Jozani-Chwaka Bay Conservation Project, Commission for Natural Resources, Zanzibar | accessdate = 2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of human [[population]] and [[agriculture]] in the 20th century was largely responsible for this state of affairs, as people encroached on leopard [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] and prey species. Increasing conflict with leopards and the fear that this generated led to a series of campaigns to exterminate them. These were localized at first, but became island-wide after the [[Zanzibar Revolution]] of 1964, when a combined anti-[[witchcraft]] and leopard-killing campaign was launched under the leadership of a witch-finder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Walsh| first1=M.T.|last2=Goldman| first2=H.V.|editor1-first=E.| editor1-last=Dounias |editor2-first=E.| editor2-last=Motte-Florac |editor3-first=M.| editor3-last=Dunham|title=Le symbolisme des animaux: L'animal, clef de voûte de la relation entre l'homme et la nature?

== Conservation==
Serious attention was not paid to the Zanzibar leopard's plight until the mid-1990s, by which time some authorities were already listing it as extinct.&lt;ref name=Nowell&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nowell, K.  |author2=Jackson, P.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1996 | url = http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/files/actionplans/wildcats.pdf/ | title = Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan | location = Gland, Switzerland | publisher = [[IUCN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leopard conservation program was drafted by the [[CARE (relief)|CARE]]-funded Jozani-Chwaka Bay Conservation Project, but abandoned in 1997 when wildlife researchers failed to find evidence for the leopard's continuing presence in and around [[Jozani forest]].&lt;ref name=Stuart/&gt;

Local wildlife officials, however, remained more optimistic about the leopard's survival, and some Zanzibaris have proposed approaching alleged leopard keepers in order to ask them to display their leopards to paying visitors. Villagers sometimes offer to take tourists or researchers to see "domesticated" leopards in return for cash, but so far none of these "kept leopard chases" has been known to end in a successful sighting.&lt;ref name=Swai1983/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;Marshall, S. (1994). ''The Status of the Zanzibar Leopard''. SIT Tanzania &amp; Commission for Natural Resources, Zanzibar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Selkow&gt;Selkow, B. (1995). ''A Survey of Villager Perceptions of the Zanzibar Leopard''. SIT Tanzania &amp; Commission for Natural Resources, Zanzibar.&lt;/ref&gt;

These conflicting perceptions of the Zanzibar leopard's status and the possibility of its conservation have yet to be reconciled, presenting a dilemma that has been highlighted by researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Goldman, H.V.  |author2=Walsh, M.T.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2007 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/13986864/HumanWildlife-Conflict-Unequal-Knowledge-and-the-Failure-to-Conserve-the-Zanzibar-Leopard-Panthera-pardus-adersi/ | title = Human-Wildlife Conflict, Unequal Knowledge and the Failure to Conserve the Zanzibar Leopard  (''Panthera pardus adersi'') | work = Poster presented to the Felid Biology and Conservation Conference, Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU), University of Oxford, 17–21 September 2007 | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Goldman, H.V. |author2=Walsh, M.T. |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2008 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/13986833/When-Culture-Threatens-the-Conservation-of-Biological-Diversity-The-Tragic-Case-of-the-Zanzibar-Leopard-Panthera-pardus-adersi/ | title = When Culture Threatens the Conservation of Biological Diversity: The Tragic Case of the Zanzibar Leopard (''Panthera pardus adersi'') | work = Poster presented to Sustaining Cultural and Biological Diversity in a Rapidly Changing World: Lessons for Global Policy, Thirteenth Annual Symposium of the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation, American Museum of Natural History, New York, 2–5 April 2008 | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walsh | first1 = M.T. | last2 = Goldman | first2 = H.V. | year = 2012 | title = Chasing Imaginary Leopards: Science, Witchcraft and the Politics of Conservation in Zanzibar | journal = Journal of Eastern African Studies | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 727–746 | doi = 10.1080/17531055.2012.729778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=M.T.|last2=Goldman|first2=H.V.|date=|year=2017|title=Cryptids and credulity: The Zanzibar leopard and other imaginary beings|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781317180463/chapters/10.4324/9781315567297-11|journal=Anthropology and Cryptozoology: Exploring Encounters with Mysterious Creatures|language=en|publisher=Routledge|publication-place=London|volume=|pages=54–90|doi=10.4324/9781315567297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible survival==
In 2018, a camera trap, placed for an [[Animal Planet]] show called ''Extinct or Alive'', caught apparent footage of a leopard on Unguja Island. The leopard appeared smaller than leopards from the mainland, and seemed to have smaller, more solid spots than normally seen on African leopards. Further investigations are planned in order to confirm whether or not this is a Zanzibar leopard, and whether a viable population still exists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
