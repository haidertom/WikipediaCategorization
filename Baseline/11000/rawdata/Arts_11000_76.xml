'''Artisanal food''' encompasses breads, cheeses, fruit preserves, cured meats, beverages, oils, and vinegars that are made by hand using traditional methods by skilled craftworkers, known as food artisans.&lt;ref&gt;Editor. (6 October 2006). Artisanal Defined. Food Crafters. CUESA (Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture). San Francisco, California.&lt;/ref&gt; The foodstuff material from farmers and backyard growers can include fruit, grains and flours, milks for cheese, cured meats, fish, beverages, oils, and vinegars. The movement is focused on providing farm to fork type foods with locally sourced products that benefit the consumer, small scale growers and producers, and the local economy.

==Food artisans==
Food artisans produce [[food]]s and [[eating|edible]] [[foodstuff]]s that are not [[mass produced]], but rather [[handicraft|made by hand]]. These include [[cheese]]s, [[bread]]s and [[baked goods]], [[charcuterie]] and other foods that involve [[food preservation|preservation]] or [[fermentation]], home preservation or [[canning]] processes, and [[fruit preserve]]s, [[cured meat]]s, [[beverages]], [[oils]], and [[vinegars]]. 
Fermentation or otherwise controlling the preservation environment for beneficial microorganisms can be utilized for vinegars, cheeses, cured meats, wine, oolong tea, kimchi and other examples. 
An artisan food item is usually developed and produced over a long period of time and consumed relatively close to where the food is created.&lt;ref name=RBell&gt;Bell, Randy. (30 May 2013). Clearing up confusion about artisan food. Michigan State University Extension. www.msu.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
In 2009, the [[Food Safety Enhancement Act]] was proposed and passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], but did not pass. The measure was renegotiated and became known as the [[FDA Food Safety Modernization Act|Food Safety Modernization Act]] (FSMA). On 4 January 2011, [[President Barack Obama]] signed the bill into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iuf.unitedfresh.org/newsletters/2011/01/06.php#1 |title=Inside United Fresh |publisher=United Fresh Produce Association |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tester-Hagan Amendment===
Senator [[Jon Tester]] (D-MT) and Senator [[Kay Hagan]] (D-NC) introduced two amendments to the [[FDA Food Safety Modernization Act|FSMA]] that removed local food growers and food processors from federal oversight. These growers and producers would remain under the jurisdiction of state and local health and [[sanitation|sanitation laws]], rules, and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Editor. (2 June 2015). FDA Fires Direct Shot at Small, Local, Artisanal Food Producers. ''The Pulse of Natural Health Newsletter.'' Alliance for Natural Health USA. www.anh-usa.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worc.org/userfiles/file/Local%20Foods/QA_Tester_Amendment.pdf |title=S. 510 Food Safety Modernization Act Healthy Local Foods Amendment |publisher=Western Organization of Resource Councils |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tester-Hagen Amendment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marlerblog.com/lawyer-oped/the-tester---hagen-amendment-to-s-510-protects-food-safety-and-small-farmers/ |title=The Tester – Hagen Amendment to S. 510 protects food safety and small farmers |publisher=Marler Blog |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Food Safety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marlerblog.com/lawyer-oped/the-tester---hagen-amendment-to-s-510-protects-food-safety-and-small-farmers/ |title= Food Safety Action Alert |publisher=National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
As of 2016, there was not a published official standard or definition for artisan foods.&lt;ref name=RBell/&gt; A good working definition can be gleaned from the [[FDA Food Safety Modernization Act#Tester-Hagan Amendment|Tester-Hagen Amendment]] that stated artisanal food producers are constrained to: "make less than [[United States dollar|$]]500,000 a year and sell greater than 50% of their products direct to consumers in the same state and within a 400-mile radius".&lt;ref name="Tester-Hagen Amendment"/&gt;

The advertising and marketing industries have latched on to the trendy word "''artisanal''" and now have artisanal products on [[supermarket]] shelves and offerings from local [[fast food chain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ozersky, Josh. (2 May 2012). The “Artisan” Hoax: Has That Word Become Meaningless? Taste of America. ''Time.'' www.time.com.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dunkin' Donuts]] came out with an "artisanal" bagel, [[Domino's Pizza]] dished out an "artisanal" pizza, [[Tostitos]] served up "artisanal" chips, [[McDonald's]] offered an "artisan" bun, [[Wendy's]] introduced an "artisan" egg sandwich, and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] provided "sandwich artisans" to prepare lunch.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, Kathryn. (2 July 2014). ''America's Artisanal Market.'' LuLu Press. {{ISBN|9781312311930}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Points of distribution==
[[Farmers' market]]s, either temporary or permanent, are a tremendous resource for consumers to procure artisanal foods. They exist in many communities in the [[Farmers' market#Canada and United States|United States]], [[Farmers' market#Canada and United States|Canada]], the [[Farmers' market#United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], and throughout the [[Farmers' market#European Union|European Union]] countries.&lt;ref name="Michigan State University"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/public_markets_differ_from_farmers_markets|title=Public markets differ from farmers markets|publisher=MIchigan State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7thstreetpublicmarket.com/2012/the-difference-between-public-markets-and-farmers-markets/|publisher=7th street public market, Charlotte NC USA|title=The Difference Between Public Markets and Farmers Markets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5887">The '''Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society''' was formed in London in 1887 to promote the exhibition of [[decorative arts]] alongside fine arts. The Society's exhibitions were held annually at the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]] from 1888 to 1890, and roughly every three years thereafter,&lt;ref&gt;Parry 1989, p. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, "Of the Arts and Crafts Movement"&lt;/ref&gt; were important in the flowering of the British [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in the decades prior to [[World War I]].

==History==
The illustrator and designer [[Walter Crane]] served as the founding president of the Society for its first three years.&lt;ref name="Crane" /&gt; Of its goals and purposes, he wrote:

{{blockquote|We desired first of all to give opportunity to the designer and craftsman to exhibit their work to the public for its artistic interest and thus to assert the claims of decorative art and handicraft to attention equally with the painter of easel pictures, hitherto almost exclusively associated with the term art in the public mind.

Ignoring the artificial distinction between Fine and Decorative art, we felt that the real distinction was what we conceived to be between good and bad art, or false and true taste and methods in handicraft, considering it of little value to endeavour to classify art according to its commercial value or social importance, while everything depended upon the spirit as well as the skill and fidelity with which the conception was expressed, in whatever material, seeing that a worker earned the title of artist by the sympathy with and treatment of his material, by due recognition of its capacity, and its natural limitations, as well as of the relation of the work to use and life.&lt;ref name="Crane" /&gt;}}

Annual exhibitions were held at the New Gallery in 1888, 1889, and 1890, but the third exhibition failed to match the quality of the first two, and was a financial disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Parry 2005, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Morris]] succeeded Crane as president in 1891.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-london.co.uk/london-art-societies.htm|title=Art Societies|work=Art in London|accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Society thereafter chose to reduce the frequency of showings in order to ensure an abundance of materials to display.&lt;ref name="Crane" /&gt;

The Society published ''Arts and Crafts Essays'', an influential collection of essays on the decorative arts by its members, in 1893. Contributors included Morris, Crane, [[T. J. Cobden-Sanderson]], [[Ford Madox Brown]], and [[May Morris]].

The fourth exhibition, held in 1893, was far more successful, and the fifth exhibition of 1896—although clouded by the death of [[William Morris]] on its planned opening day—proved to be its most influential.&lt;ref&gt;Parry 2005, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; The 1899 exhibit featured a Morris retrospective.&lt;ref&gt;Parry 2005, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  Another successful exhibition was held in 1903, but the Society suffered organizational problems in the new century, with the exhibitions of 1906, 1910, 1912 and 1916 each being held in a different location. Crane died in 1915, and architect and designer [[Henry Wilson (architect and designer)|Henry Wilson]] was president from 1915 to 1922, but the exhibitions failed to recover the critical and artistic success of the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Parry 2005, pp. 89-92&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, [[W. R. Lethaby]] and other members, recognising the limitations of the Society's devotion to craft methods of production, set up the [[Design and Industries Association]] to improve the standards of British industrial design.

In the 1930s it became clear to some members that if the Society was to survive in any form it had to confront the role of the crafts in relation to industry and the place of machinery in craft production. The Society’s 1935 exhibition introduced a section devoted to mass-produced articles designed by craftsmen to demonstrate the influence the crafts could have on industry, which brought its exhibitions to the notice of the press again.&lt;ref&gt;"Arts and Crafts at Burlington House", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 4 November 1938, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; This move was controversial within the Society and led to some resignations.&lt;ref name="interpretingceramics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpretingceramics.com/issue016/articles/01.htm|title=Interpreting Ceramics : issue 16 - Dora Bilington: From Arts and Crafts to Studio Pottery|website=interpretingceramics.com|accessdate=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society continued to exhibit periodically until the 1950s and many eminent craftsmen and women were associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;John Farleigh, ''The Creative Craftsman'', London: G.Bell and Sons, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, it merged with the Cambridgeshire Guild of Craftsmen to form the Society of Designer Craftsmen, which is still active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societyofdesignercraftsmen.org.uk/|title=Society of Designer Craftsmen|accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3145">"'''Ballyscunnion'''" &lt;ref name="author"&gt;This Article by Mrs Bronte Matthews, daughter of Artist&lt;/ref&gt; was an imaginary village located in Ireland, depicted in 285 [[scratchboard|scraperboard]] cartoons by the illustrator, painter and comics artist [[William St. John Glenn R.U.A., Artist|William St. John Glenn RUA]]. The work was produced on white china scraperboard, painted with black ink and then scraped off  with a blade, to produce details.

William St John Glenn was born in 1904,&lt;ref name= "snoddy"&gt;Theo Snoddy, "Dictionary of 20th Century Irish Artists".&lt;/ref&gt; was described as an artist of warmth and gentle humour, and this was resent in "Ballyscunnion"&lt;ref name= "Sheridan"&gt;The Irish Times, Monday Dec 24th 1990, illustrated article by Kathy Sheridan.&lt;/ref&gt;as the village came to terms in its own way with the changing world. The work spanned over 30 years and, because the period detail was so accurate, it makes a unique pictorial history of social changes in rural Ireland.

The first reference  to "Ballyscunnion" appears in a "wash" drawing published in 1937 in Dublin Opinion - a humorous, pictorial magazine which appeared monthly as light relief from the turbulent period following the birth of the nation. Then from late 1938 "Ballyscunnion" appeared in scraperboard and continued this way until 1969, with a break from mid 1940 till 1946, due to illness and the war. 
In total there were 285 "Ballyscunnions" produced, some reappearing when Dublin Opinion produced a selection of their drawings in booklets and then again when the magazine released a series of three books, entitled  ''Fifteen Years of Dublin Opinion'', ''Thirty Years of Dublin Opinion'' and ''Forty Years of Dublin Opinion''.&lt;ref name= "Mac Dara"&gt;The Evening press, Friday 23rd Sept 1970. "Ballyscunnion, The village That's All In The Mind."&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition of "Ballyscunnion" drawings was held at the [[Irish Club]] in [[Eaton Square]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;The Chelsea News March 20th 1970. Photo of the Opening of the Ballyscunnion Exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was opened by [[Sir Charles Petrie]], a military historian and [[Charles E. Kelly (cartoonist)|Charles E. Kelly]], the former editor of the ''Dublin Opinion'', flew to the event from Ireland. Sir Charles suggested that the "Ballyscunnion" collection should be relocated to the [[National Gallery of Ireland|National Gallery]] in [[Dublin]], stating that "I am sure the likes of this will not be seen again."&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'' March 17, 1970. "Ballyscunnion in London", article within "An Irishman's Diary".&lt;/ref&gt;

William St John Glenn died in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=frier&gt;The Irish Times June 12th 1974 "William John Glenn RUA" an article by Rowel Friers. See also ''Chelsea News'' June 14, 1974, "William St. John Glenn, An Appreciation."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boho-chic''' is a style of [[fashion]] drawing on various [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[hippie]] influences, which, at its height in late 2005 was associated particularly with actress [[Sienna Miller]] and model [[Kate Moss]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and (as "boho" chic) actress and businesswoman [[Mary-Kate Olsen]] in the [[United States]]. It has been seen since the early 1990s and, although appearing to wane from time to time, has repeatedly re-surfaced in varying guises. Many elements of boho-chic became popular in the late 1960s and some date back much further, being associated, for example, with [[pre-Raphaelite]] women of the mid-to-late 19th century.

==Lexicography==
[[Image:Sherlock Holmes - Blue Carbuncle.JPG|thumb|left|Sherlock Holmes "upon the sofa in a purple dressing gown" in ''The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle'' (Illustration by Sidney Padget, ''Strand Magazine'', 1891)]]

==="Boho"===
"BoHo" is an abbreviation of Bohemian Homeless, self descriptive of the style.

Vanessa Nicholson (granddaughter of [[Vanessa Bell]], one of the pivotal figures of the unconventional, but influential "[[Bloomsbury Group]]" in the first half of the 20th century) has described it as a "curious slippery adjective".&lt;ref&gt;''Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 1900–1939'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original [[Bohemian|Bohemians]] were inhabitants of central [[Europe]], the term has, as Nicholson noted, "attached itself to individuals as disparate as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]]". The writer and historian [[A. N. Wilson]] remarked that, "in his dress-sense as in much else", [[Winston Churchill]] was "pre-[[First World War]] Bohemian", his unbleached [[linen]] suit causing surprise when he arrived in [[Canada]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Wilson (2005) ''After the Victorians''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s first short story about Holmes for ''The Strand'', [[Doctor Watson]] noted that the detective "loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul" and "remained in our lodgings in Baker-street, buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition..".&lt;ref&gt;''A Scandal in Bohemia'', 1891&lt;/ref&gt; Designer [[Savannah Miller]], elder sister of actress Sienna Miller, described a "real bohemian" as "someone who has the ability to appreciate beauty on a deep level, is a profound romantic, doesn't know any limits, whose world is their own creation, rather than living in a box".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 20 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Chic"===
"[[Chic (style)|Chic]]" was borrowed from French in the late 19th century and has come to mean stylish or [[Elegance|elegant]].

==Elements==
[[Image:Boho 003.jpg|thumb|340px|left|Furry [[gilet]], Autumn 2005]]
The boho look, which owed much to the [[hippie]] styles that developed in the middle to late 1960s, became especially popular after [[Sienna Miller]]'s appearance at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 26 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; although some of its features were apparent from photographs of her taken in October 2003&lt;ref&gt;''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and of others living in or around the postal district of W10 ([[North Kensington]]), an area of [[London]] associated with bohemian culture since the mid-1950s.

By the spring of 2005, boho was almost ubiquitous in parts of London and was invading stores in almost every British high street.&lt;ref&gt;''Closer'', 10–16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Its adherents were sometimes referred to as "Siennas",&lt;ref&gt;''Vogue'', December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; this eponym even being applied to Miller herself: "Sienna's Sienna-ishness", as Jessica Brinton put it in the ''Sunday Times'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 5 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Features included "floaty" skirts (notably long white ones), furry [[gilet]]s, embroidered tunics, cropped jackets, large faux-coin belts, sheepskin ([[UGG Australia|UGG]]) boots and [[cowboy boot]]s, baggy cardigans and "[[hobo bag]]s". Demand was so great that there were allegations the following year of some sub-contractors' having used cheap child labour in [[India]] for [[zari]] embroidery and [[beading]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'', 15 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Footless [[tights]] or "[[leggings]]", of which Miller was a proponent, were a contributory factor in the halving of sales of [[stockings]] in Britain between 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''London Lite'', 18 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boho trends==
[[Image:SiennaMillerFactoryGirl.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Sienna Miller]] at the London premiere of ''[[Factory Girl (film)|Factory Girl]]'', 2007]]

===Sienna Miller in the early 2000s===
Sienna Miller's relationship with – and, for a time, [[engagement]] to – actor [[Jude Law]], after they had starred together in the 2004 film, ''[[Alfie (2004 film)|Alfie]]'', kept both her and her style of dress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey |first=Catriona |url=http://www.getlippy.com/starstyle/siennamiller/herstyle/ |title=Cosmopolitan, the women's magazine for fashion, beauty, sex tips and celebrity news |publisher=Getlippy.com |date=2015-10-13 |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the media headlines during 2004–05. In December 2004, ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' featured Miller on its front cover and described her as "the girl of the year".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Vogue'', December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the ending of her relationship with Law (which resumed temporarily in 2009–10) seemed to signal that boho too was past its peak. In fact, as early as May 2005 the ''Sunday Times Style'' magazine had declared that "overexposed" white peasant skirts were "going down"&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 16 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and had advised adherents of boho to "update your boho [[mojo (African American culture)|mojo]]" by mixing the look with metallic items (anticipating so-called "[[boho-chic#Boho-rock and gothic|boho-rock]]" in 2006) or with layers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;''Style'', 1 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2005, Miller herself, who claimed later that her boho look was not very original – "I think I'd just come back from traveling or something"&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 5 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; – had adopted other styles of dress and her shorter, [[bob cut|bobbed hairstyle]] – ironically a feature of bohemian fashion in the quarter century before [[World War II]] – helped to define a new trend in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''Hair'', June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; She was quoted in ''Vogue'' as saying "no more boho chic ... I feel less hippie. I just don't want to wear anything floaty or coin-belty ever again. No more gilets ...".&lt;ref&gt;''Vogue'', January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, in 2008, Miller reflected that

{{quote|It was a strange social experiment, to be responsible for all that. It made me self-conscious, which, inherently, I'm not. People would say, "I'm sick of boho", and now I stand up and say, "But I liked those clothes – it's not my fault that they were copied, you wore them and now you're sick of them. Also, I did not start the trend."&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;}}

===2007–08: folk, "diluted", and Balearic boho===
In the autumn of 2006, ''The Times''' style director Tina Gaudoin observed that "when the women's wear buyer at M[arks] &amp; S[pencer] is quoted saying 'boho is over', you know the trend is well and truly six foot under."&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 23 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the so-called "[[Folk art|folk]]" look of spring 2007, with its smock tops and flounce hemmed dresses, owed much to boho-chic, while embracing such trends as the re-emergence of the [[miniskirt|mini-dress]]: as the ''Sunday Times'' put it, "if you are still bemoaning the passing of the gypsy look, then the folk trend could be your saving grace".&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 18 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sunday Times'' cited the 1960s singer [[Mary Hopkin]] as influencing the use of [[bandanna]]s,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; while, around the same time, Sienna Miller's appearance as 1960s "starlet" [[Edie Sedgwick]] in the film ''[[Factory Girl (film)|Factory Girl]]'' positioned her once more as a bohemian style icon. ''London Lite'' observed in May 2007 that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You may baulk at the very word, but this summer's style has definite nuances of boho – albeit in a very diluted form. Sienna Miller's gipsy skirt brigade somehow didn't finish this feminine trend off for good, and some of the less contrived ingredients – embroidery, leather, gentle frills – are back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Mischa barton london.JPG|thumb|160px|right|[[Mischa Barton]] in 2006]]
Noting that "this time it's much more about a deconstructed, looser version of English Country Garden style", ''London Lite'' recalled the early 1970s designs of [[Laura Ashley]] – "all folds of floral cotton and centre partings".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Deborah Arthurs, ''London Lite'', 14 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Actresses [[Mischa Barton]] and [[Milla Jovovich]] were cited as exponents of this look, while [[Jade Jagger]] (daughter of Sir [[Mick Jagger]], of the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[Bianca Jagger]]) was said to be promoting her own style of "[[Balearic Islands|Balearic]] boho" on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Ibiza]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; a long-time haven for [[beatniks]] and hippies who colonised the village of [[Santa Eulària des Riu|Sant Carles]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Iain Stewart, ''Ibiza &amp; Formentera'' (Rough Guide Directions, 2nd ed., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Tatler'' wrote of Jagger – "the original 'Boho'" – that she "lives, breathes and creates a certain kind of contemporary "bohemian" chic", although Jagger herself claimed to be "a little wary of the word "bohemian"", describing her approach as "daring to mix ... combining things that are unexpected".&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Mitchell, ''The Tatler'', November 2010. The particular context of Jagger's observations was her styling of a group of villas in Marrakech.&lt;/ref&gt; Jagger modelled for designer [[Matthew Williamson]], whose style has been described as combining "Ibiza glamour" with "London cool".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Sienna Miller has written that, when she first met Williamson, whose [[muse]] she became,&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 16 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in her mother's kitchen in 2001

&lt;blockquote&gt;she had a magazine on the table with Jade Jagger wearing the most beautiful bright dress I had ever seen. I remember thinking it was my dream dress. I now feel that way about almost every dress of Matthew's I have worn".&lt;ref&gt;Sienna Miller, ''Sunday Times Style'', 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011 "destination dressing" for Ibiza was still deemed to "embrace boho chic with a hint of understated glamour"&lt;ref&gt;Harriet Stewart, ''Sunday Times Style'', 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

When, in August 2007, Sienna and Savannah Miller launched their own fashion label, Twenty8Twelve (so-called after Sienna's birthday, 28 December), one commentator referred to Sienna's "own brand of [[Notting Hill]]billy chic" (a reference to London W10) and remarked that, "with [her] love of all things boho, it's unsurprising to see a thread of louche, folksy styling running through the line".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Deborah Arthurs in ''London Lite'', 3 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same writer observed wryly that "quite how many French peasants hoed fields in printed smocks is undocumented" and felt that one particular shirt-dress was "a little too reminiscent of [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]] in [[Oliver Twist]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The following year, the ''Sunday Times'', noting that one in two Americans and one in five Britons were reportedly sporting [[tattoo]]s, observed that Miller "complete[d] her luxe-layabout look with a cluster of stars on her silken shoulder";&lt;ref&gt;Alice Fordham in ''Sunday Times Style'', 13 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that she had also a tattoo of a bluebird, the subject of both a poem by [[Charles Bukowski]] and a drawing by Edie Sedgwick; and that Kate Moss displayed "two swallows diving into her buttock crack".

===Recession of 2008–10: ''broderie'', exotic lingerie, 70s glam/beatnik===
[[Image:Zooey Deschanel at Mercy Lounge in Nashville, TN by breezy421.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Zooey Deschanel]] in 2008]]
In 2008 fashion consultant [[Gok Wan]] cited a ''[[broderie anglaise]]'' top worn by [[Nadine Coyle]] of the group [[Girls Aloud]] as evidence that "the folk/boho look is so hot for summer",&lt;ref&gt;''Sky Mag'', June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; while Marks &amp; Spencer employed the headline "Bohemian Rhapsody" to summarise its summer range, which owed much to the colours and patterns of the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''Your M&amp;S'', May/June 2008. ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]'' was the title of 1975 hit record by the British rock group [[Queen (band)|Queen]].&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of June that year fashion writer Carrie Gorman announced that "this week, shopping is about going bright and bold with a boho feel", citing, among other trends, multi-coloured [[Sleeveless shirt|tank top]]s ("or dress, according to your height") by Harlow, said to be the favorite label of American actress [[Rachel Bilson]].&lt;ref&gt;''thelondonpaper'', 1 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Bilson has cited Kate Moss and actress [[Diane Keaton]] as among her stylistic influences;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremovies.co.uk/filmmaking.asp?ID=185 |title=Filmmaking Category |publisher=Future Movies |date= |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; striped multi-colored panties with brodierie edging were a feature of her photographic shoot for ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' magazine in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim.com/stuff/girls-of-stuff/37978/rachel-bilson.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502065805/http://www.maxim.com/stuff/girls-of-stuff/37978/rachel-bilson.html |date=May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, rather distinctive, exponent of the "vintage" look was actress and singer [[Zooey Deschanel]], who, in June 2008, appeared on the front cover of the magazine ''[[BlackBook Magazine|BlackBook]]'' in a black lace-edged [[swimsuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/zooey-deschanel-blackbook-june-july-cover-girl/3022 |title=Zooey Deschanel: BlackBook June–July Cover Girl - BlackBook |publisher=Blackbookmag.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a journalist wrote of Deschanel:

{{quote|... she's the antistarlet ... She tiptoes in looking like a graceful version of boho-chic 29-year-olds found everywhere from Brooklyn to Silver Lake, with an [[Barack Obama|Obama]] [Democratic Presidential candidate] button on her vintage coat and [t]he ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' rolled up in her pocket...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24967420/ns/entertainment-movies/ |title=Actress Zooey Deschanel is the antistarlet - Entertainment - Movies - TODAY.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Deschanel's "kooky" style&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Radio Times'', 23 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently found a popular outlet as [[Los Angeles]] teacher Jess Day, whom she played in the [[Fox TV]] [[sitcom]], ''[[New Girl (TV series)|New Girl]]'' (2011-). Jess's fashion preferences, including some striking brassières in a range of colours,&lt;ref&gt;Notably a purple demi [[rhinestone]] bra by [[Victoria's Secret]] in series 2, episode 15 ("Cooler")&lt;/ref&gt; attracted much interest, while, around the same time, Anastasia (Ana) Steel's tastes in [[E. L. James]]' best-selling erotic novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' (2011) were thought to have assisted sales of exotic lingerie.&lt;ref&gt;Toni Jones in ''Daily Mail'', 15 August 2012; Rachel Felder in ''New York Times'', 13 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Blue was a favoured color ([[Natalie Portman]] as Dr. Emma Kurtzman was shown dressing hastily for work in a lacy blue bra in the 2011 film, ''[[No Strings Attached (film)|No Strings Attached]]'') and was Ana's own preference: "I'm in the pale blue lacy perfect-fit bra. ''Thank heavens''".&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Shades of Grey'', chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the winning German entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|Eurovision Song Contest]] proclaimed, "I even did my hair for you/I bought new underwear, they're blue" (''[[Satellite (Lena Meyer-Landrut song)|Satellite]]'', sung by [[Lena Meyer-Landrut|Lena]]). In 2013 the former "little hippie"&lt;ref&gt;''Mail on Sunday'', ''You'', 11 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|X Factor]]'' contestant [[Diana Vickers]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''The Sun'', 7 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; wore blue panties (with a short white top bearing the legend, "LOST MY MIND") for a widely publicised photoshoot for the magazine ''[[FHM]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Metro'', 7 November 2013; ''FHM'', January 2014. In one photograph Vickers was holding a copy of [[Che Guevara]]'s ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|Motorcycle Diaries]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although boho once again appeared to be on the wane by 2009, elements of it were clearly in evidence in collections for spring and summer 2010. [[Fashion Union]] advertised "spring's new bohemian trend in full bloom" and "hippie chic tops on loveworn denims",&lt;ref&gt;Fashion Union, ''The Fashionista's Pocket Guide to Miami'', Spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Avon Products|Avon]] introduced a perfumed spray called "Boho Chic". [[Monsoon Stores Ltd|Monsoon]], founded in 1973 and still described by the ''Sunday Times'' in 2010 as "the boho chic fashion retailer", saw its pre-tax profits rise dramatically during the [[Late-2000s recession|recession]] of the late noughties: from £3.6 million in 2008 to £32.6 million in the year to August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Business'', 21 March 2010. In early 2010 Monsoon planned to open a further 140 stores worldwide in the coming year.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bohemian clothing.jpg|thumb|upright|Women wearing bohemian clothing]]
In 2010 the ''Sunday Times'' anticipated that the medieval [[Mail (armour)|head chain]] – "a step on from the hippie head band" – would be a feature of that year's festival circuit, "instantly adding summer bohemia to your look". Socialite [[Nicole Richie]]'s "beatnik/[[Glam rock|disco-glam]] mash-up" was cited as an example of this trend, while [[Peaches Geldof]], model and daughter of rock musician [[Bob Geldof]], was identified as another who had adopted the look.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 13 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year the ''Sunday Times'' lauded the "''haute'' hippie, bohemian splendour and punked up classics" that were putting "a modern spin on 1970s style". These included a cream [[crochet]] dress by [[Marc Jacobs]] ("''haute'' hippie") and a [[devoré]] dress and fringed [[scarf]] by [[Emilio Pucci|Pucci]] ("boho splendour").&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Ewing, ''Sunday Times Style'', 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late autumn of 2010 ''The Times'' noted the desirability in the UK of [[fake fur]] ("Recession chic lets Britain go full pelt for the fake fur"), with Marks and Spencer and [[J. Sainsbury|Sainsbury's]] TU retailing bestselling coats at a time of economic stringency. According to [[Lisa Armstrong]], "everyone from Kate Moss to [[Alexa Chung]], [[Fearne Cotton]] to [[Kylie Minogue|Kylie]] [Minogue], Rachel Bilson and [[Taylor Momsen]] to [[Carine Roitfeld]] ha[d] been swaddling themselves in exotic cat prints with varying degrees of success".&lt;ref name="The Times, 27 November 2010"&gt;''The Times'', 27 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong speculated also that the "[[Impossible Boot]]", based on a 1930s snow boot and so-called by its designer [[Penelope Chilvers]] because it had "proved a headache to make", might, despite its relatively high cost (£325–375), displace the Ugg,&lt;ref name="The Times, 27 November 2010"/&gt; which had been a durable boho accessory. As Armstrong put it wrily, the Impossible was "perfect for [[après-ski]]" in the fashionably bohemian London districts of [[Primrose Hill]] or [[Dalston]].

===Boho Chic Childrens' Fashion Trends===
Many parents have also embraced the Boho Chic trends and elements to create and purchase apparel for their children.  This particular trend is inspired by the casual American fashion of the 1960s, but as the counterculture included the influences of earlier time periods in its eclectic embrace of style and personal values, it often includes hints of the Victorian, a nod to the fabrics and details of the 1940s, or an homage to the intellectuals of the 1950's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrate Beautifully Styled Boho-chic Children’s Clothing Styles  (part 1)|url=http://www.magnolialakeclothing.com/posts/boho-chic-childrens-clothing/|website=Magnolia Lake Clothing|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and exponents==

=== Kate Moss and Sienna Miller ===
Many, including actress [[Lindsay Lohan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indiebohoboutique.com/collections/bohemian-attire-staff-picks |title=Kate Moss has a new A-list fan |publisher=Vogue.co.uk |date=2005-08-11 |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributed the boho look to supermodel [[Kate Moss]] (who in 1997 had been associated, through an advertising campaign for [[Calvin Klein]], with the so-called "[[heroin chic]]" or "[[waif]]" look). In fact the Australian journalist Laura Demasi used the term "boho-chic" as early as October 2002 with reference to Moss and Jade Jagger. In April 2004, the British-born fashion writer [[Plum Sykes]] was quoted as saying of a lynx mini-top, "Very cool, very bohemian, very Kate Moss–y";&lt;ref&gt;''New York Magazine'', 5 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 ''Times'' fashion editor Lisa Armstrong described a plaited leather belt of the previous year as a "Boho 'Kate' belt".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 20 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was the apparently unaffected ease with which Sienna Miller (dubbed by some as the "new Kate Moss"&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, London ''Evening Standard'', 5 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;) carried off the look that brought it into the mainstream: even in advertisements for [[Chloé]] early in 2005 Miller was shown as if casually shopping, while she told ''Vogue'' that she had a laid-back approach to grooming, including cutting her own hair.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Established in 1993, the UK clothing label 'OVERIDER' described as 'the brand of a free spirit' and favoured for its understated, effortless, bohemian style exemplifies the 2014 Boho-chic trend.

In 2008 the ''Sunday Times'' applied the term "real chic" to a group of "the chicest celebrities", including Miller and actresses [[Julie Christie]] and [[Marion Cotillard]], who "handle the glare of fame with a large dose of reality", Miller being described as "a professional free spirit who, annoyingly, seems to have more fun than anyone else".&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Brinton, ''Sunday Times Style'', 6 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Miller's appearance as the poet [[Dylan Thomas]]'s wife, [[Caitlin Macnamara]] in the film ''[[The Edge of Love]]'' caused one journalist to refer to "a new romantic style: woe-ho chic"&lt;ref&gt;Fleur Britten, ''Sunday Times Style'', 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This referred to the [[austerity]] clothing of the 1940s, worn also in the film by [[Keira Knightley]]:

{{quote|A beguillingly shambolic Sienna is seen sobbing on the beach busting a wartime make-do-and-mend look: boiled-wool cardie over flowery tea dress over folded-down wellies over long woolly socks.&lt;ref&gt;Britten, 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One reviewer observed of Miller's role that "Caitlin is meant to be a boho girl and free spirit, which is a posh way of saying she's a drunk who is promiscuous".&lt;ref&gt;Cosmo Landesman, ''Sunday Times Culture'', 22 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appeal and impact ===
The cross-generational appeal of boho influenced, among other things, the ranges that brought about a revival in the fortunes of [[Marks and Spencer]] in 2005–06. An illustration of this, just as boho as such appeared to near its end, was M&amp;S's use of 1960s' icon [[Twiggy]] and younger models such as [[Laura Bailey (model)|Laura Bailey]] ("the natural choice for the season's bohemian chic"&lt;ref&gt;''Your M&amp;S'', Christmas 2005&lt;/ref&gt;) for a major advertising campaign in late 2005. In 2006 the ''Sunday Times'' identified fur gilets and "ugg-a-likes" as preferred winter wear for middle-aged women whom it described as the "[[Botulin toxin|botox]]-and-better-sex-after-40 brigade".&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;''Style'', 18 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exemplars ===
In their differing ways, British singers [[Joss Stone]] (who, in 2011, named American singer [[Gwen Stefani]] as her style icon&lt;ref&gt;''You'', ''Mail on Sunday'', 24 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and was by then combining an independent professional career with the lifestyle of a "[[Devon]] hippy"&lt;ref&gt;''Mail on Sunday Live'', 11 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) and (notwithstanding an early tendency to be associated with photographic spreads for "[[List of men's magazines|lads' magazines]]") [[Rachel Stevens]]&lt;ref&gt;In 2001 and 2002, Stevens was voted the second "sexiest woman in the World" by ''[[FHM]]'' readers in the UK.&lt;/ref&gt; were both held up in the mid-noughties as exemplars of boho. So, a few years later, were Diana Vickers and another teenaged singer, [[Pixie Lott]]. Following an event in 2009, the ''Daily Mail'' commented about Vickers that&lt;blockquote&gt;[she] looked like a cross between a stylish sixties icon and a rambler as she donned a stunning backless dress with a tramp's boots for an X Factor party last night. The 17-year-old, who spent much of her time on the ITV show running around barefoot, opted to cover up her feet with the charity shop footwear. The footwear drew attention away from the singer's stylish sixties style black and red dress which was split open at the back to reveal her [[brassiere|bra]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1164984/Nice-dress-Diana-shame-ugly-boots-X-Factor-stars-party-outfit-hit-miss.html |title=Nice dress Diana, shame about the ugly boots: X Factor star's party outfit is a hit and miss &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For her part, Pixie Lott cited French screen goddess [[Brigitte Bardot]] and Edie Sedgwick as her fashion icons – and ''Factory Girl'' as her favourite film – and defined her look as "vintage clothes, which I mix with contemporary stuff, or I'll be [[Indie design|indie]] and hippie, with accessories such as rings, chains and headbands ... I like to wear girlie things, but only if I can rock them up with biker boots or a jacket".&lt;ref name="Mail on Sunday, 3 October 2010"&gt;''Mail on Sunday'', 3 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Author and critic Bruce Dessau wrote of American-British actress and singer [[Juliette Lewis]] that "there is something odd about [her] attractive boho-chic appearance in a stringy black vest, vintage beads and blue skirt that I cannot quite locate".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 ''London Lite'' contrasted the "gay glamour" of American actress [[Goldie Hawn]] with the "more relaxed, boho look" of her daughter, actress [[Kate Hudson]], noting that "keeping the colours neutral, [Hudson]'s careful not to break any style rules, with classy knitwear and good-quality accessories".&lt;ref&gt;Camilla St John, ''London Lite'', 14 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-judged exponent of boho, in the second series of ITV's ''[[Murder in Suburbia]]'' (2005), was Detective Sergeant Emma Scribbins, the character played by [[Lisa Faulkner]].

=== Fast fashion ===
The impact of boho illustrated certain broader trends in what Shane Watson referred to as "the way we dress now":&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;''Style'', 17 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; that fashion was increasingly being dictated, not by the main houses, but what Watson called "the triple-F crowd" (the F referring to the f's in "famous and fashion-forward"), of which Kate Moss, Lindsay Lohan and Sienna Miller were exemplars. Once they had spotted new fashions, young women were not prepared to wait a season for them to become available and, consequently, the familiar boundaries between summer wear and that for autumn and winter were becoming blurred. As [[Jane Shepherdson]], brand director of the clothing chain [[Topshop]], put it, "when Sienna wore that gilet, we had to pull them forward fast ... She was doing boho in the autumn, and we were expecting it to be a trend for the following spring. Girls see it and they want it immediately".&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

The practice of meeting such demand, pioneered by the Spanish firm [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]], and of which Shepherdson, until she left Topshop in 2006, was the leading British proponent,&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Collins ''(Draper's Magazine)'', ''Today'', BBC Radio 4, 6 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; became known as "[[fast fashion]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Scotsman'', 30 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boho-rock and gothic==

[[File:Theda-bara-cleopatra detail.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Theda Bara]] (1885–1955)]]
By Midsummer 2006, the ''Sunday Times'' had discerned a trend that fused aspects of boho-chic with "[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] attitude": "It's about wearing a studded leather jacket with a flimsy chiffon number, stomping about town in biker boots ... and wearing anything with a skull on it".&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Croft, ''Style'', 2 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper referred to this style, which had been a feature of collections for Autumn 2006 by [[Christian Dior]] and [[John Galliano]], as "boho-rock" and noted that both Sienna Miller and Kate Moss had adopted it. "[[gothic fashion|Gothic]] rock"&lt;ref&gt;''Evening Standard Magazine'', 15 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; had similar connotations. A look described by the ''Sunday Times'' in Autumn 2006 as "modern goth" was a more stylised version, exuding a "[[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] vibe" and contrasting "soft, light fabrics ... with the harsh sleekness of patent [leather]".&lt;ref&gt;Britt Bardo, ''Style'', 24 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The gothic look was in vogue again in the autumn of 2007, a sleeker "dark [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] style" being associated with, among others, Sienna Miller, twin actresses [[Mary-Kate Olsen|Mary-Kate]] and [[Ashley Olsen]] (through their clothing label, The Row), the Australian model [[Gemma Ward]]&lt;ref&gt;''thelondonpaper'', 24 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the rising Ukrainian singer [[Mika Newton]] (the latter notably in photographs associated with her début album of 2005, ''Anomaliya''). In 2009 [[Nicole Scherzinger]], lead vocalist of the [[Pussycat Dolls]], described her off-stage image as "understated-rock-boho-chic",&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Jane Gordon, ''You'', ''Mail on Sunday'', 5 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; while, in the autumn of 2010, under the heading "Boho with bite", the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' advised readers after "dark, soft, floaty fabrics [to] flirt heavily with leather and lace, [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] and killer heels" and to "think laid-back cool with a shot of [[vampire|vamp]]".&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Baker in ''You'', ''Mail on Sunday'', 3 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In some respects this particular refinement harked back to the style of the [[silent film]] actress [[Theda Bara]], who became known as "the Vamp" (after "vampire") and habitually used kohl, a black cosmetic prevalent in Eastern countries, to make up her eyes.

===Pre-Raphaelites===

[[Image:Karen Elson June 2010 e.jpg|thumb|left|[[Karen Elson]] in June 2010]]

====Florence Welch====
In 2009 the rise of British singer [[Florence Welch]] (as Florence + the Machine) coincided with the publication of [[Franny Moyle]]'s study of the private lives of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] Brotherhood of the mid-19th century (''[[Desperate Romantics]]'', 2009) and its dramatisation by BBC television. Welch has cited as her stylistic icons singer [[Marianne Faithfull]], who had been closely associated with the [[Rolling Stones]] in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;''Tatler'', June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and her former [[English language|English teacher]] who used to "come to school in crushed-[[velvet]] gowns like a medieval maiden&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Times Saturday Review'', 29 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, her stage image, which owed much to her long dyed [[red hair]],&lt;ref&gt;''Mail on Sunday'', 8 August 2010. Welch first dyed her hair red at the age of 10 and when she was 11 – during her "goth period" – wore it black: ''Mail on Sunday'', 1 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; called to mind the pre-Raphaelite [[muses]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Francesca Ryan, ''Daily Telegraph'', 4 June 2009; John Harris, ''The Guardian'', 27 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; who, in certain respects, had anticipated the hippie styles of a century later.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Maas, "The Pre-Raphaelites: A Personal View" in Leslie Parris (1984) ''The Pre-Raphaelite Papers''; Fiona MacCarthy (2011) ''The Last Pre-Raphaelite: Edward Burne-Jones and the Victorian Imagination''. Welch denied in 2009 that she herself was a hippy – "I'm just an emotional creature": quoted in ''The Times Saturday Review'', 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Welch herself once described her style as "[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|Lady of Shalott]] meets [[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]] [paintings by [[John William Waterhouse|Waterhouse]] and [[John Millais|Millais]]] mixed with scary gothic bat-lady"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Jane Gordon in ''Mail on Sunday'', 1 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and declared her attraction to "doomed romantic heroines, like [[Alfred Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s [poem] ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]''"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Times Saturday Review'', ''loc.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of Welch's second album ''[[Ceremonials]]'' (2011) drew very clearly on later Pre-Raphaelite images.&lt;ref&gt;''Cf.'', for example, ''The Baleful Head'' by Edward Burne-Jones (1874), whose 2011 biographer has described him as "a perfect artist for that period [late 1960s] of flower power, sex, drugs and rock 'n'roll" (Fiona MacCarthy, ''op.cit.'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on Welch's broader influence, one rock journalist noted in 2010 that "even [[Cheryl Cole]] [of Girls Aloud and an ''X Factor'' judge] has gone gothic princess on her ... single, "[[Promise This]]", and she's looking very Florence in the [[pop video|video]], all black [[leotard]]s and raggedy [[ballet tutu|tutu]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Nicholson in ''Sunday Times Culture'', 19 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Karen Elson====
Other redheads whose personal style combined elegance with boho and gothic features were English model [[Lily Cole]] (who adopted black hair in 2010 – "Golly goth", as one newspaper headline put it&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Mail'', 27 November 2010''&lt;/ref&gt;) and model/singer [[Karen Elson]]. Elson told a ''Times'' journalist that she had always been "the weird looking one" in modelling circles and remarked of herself and her then husband [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] of the rock duo [[White Stripes]] that "there's going to be a point when our children view us as the [[Addams Family]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Playlist'', 8 May 2010. See also ''ES Magazine'', 14 May 2010: "Karen Elson and Jack White: The Addams Family of Rock".&lt;/ref&gt; (In the 1960s incarnation of ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television, based on the characters created by [[Charles Addams]] for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1938, [[Carolyn Jones]] had created a gothic icon with her portrayal of [[Morticia Addams]].) Like Welch, Elson exuded pre-Raphaelite features, though a marked gothic strain was also apparent when, as a singer on stage in 2009, she wore a long salmon dress with black lace edging. Similarly, her [[lingerie]] portfolio that year for [[Agent Provocateur (lingerie)|Agent Provocateur]] combined gothic and boho-rock features,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wasilak |first=Sarah |url=http://www.fabsugar.co.uk/Karen-Elson-Agent-Provocateur-2943683 |title=Karen Elson for Agent Provocateur &amp;#124; POPSUGAR Fashion UK |publisher=Fabsugar.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; there being, for example, a certain resonance between a black and white brassiere and panties set that formed part of that collection and the black swimsuit in which Zooey Deschanel was photographed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''BlackBook'', June/July 2008 ''(supra)''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Pixie Lott said that the item of clothing she would save in a fire were her "favourite black frilly shorts".&lt;ref name="Mail on Sunday, 3 October 2010"/&gt;

====Duchess of Cambridge====
[[File:William and Kate wedding.jpg|thumb|[[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|The Duchess of Cambridge]], in [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]] dress by [[Sarah Burton]], with [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] on their wedding day, 2011]]
In 2011 some detected a pre-Raphaelite line to the [[Alexander McQueen]] dress, designed by [[Sarah Burton]], for [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Catherine Middleton]]'s [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|wedding]] to [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Tim Adams in ''The Guardian'', 30 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Middleton's somewhat medieval headdress called to mind images from paintings by such later pre-Raphaelites as John Waterhouse and [[Edward Burne-Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;In her biography of Burne-Jones (''The Last Pre-Raphaelite'', 2011), Fiona MacCarthy referred to a "special kind of mysticism" in his major works. Citing this observation in a review, David Waller observed that "the girls are high born and ethereal, the men dreamy and knightly, the whole transfused with an idiosyncratic beauty": ''History Today'', October 2011, page 62.&lt;/ref&gt; the overall impression being especially apparent in a side-on double page photograph of the couple by [[Max Mumby]] on the cover of the following day's edition of the London ''Times''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 30 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boho terminology of 2004–10==
In advance of Glastonbury 2004, the ''Sunday Times'' coined the term "festival chic", for a style with some similarities to boho.&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 6 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently labelled a photographic spread of Sienna Miller, Lauren Bailey, [[Erin O'Connor]] and other muses of Matthew Williamson as "boho babes",&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 16 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; advised its readers to "think art-school chic" by adopting layers of clashing colours&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; and, in 2006, noted that "last year's boho babe" had become "this year's boho-rock chick".&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 2 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost an extension of "festival chic", the ''Telegraph'' coined the term "foho" to describe the evolution of the boho style in the summer of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Clare Coulson, '' The birth of Foho '', 16 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the newspaper, this look, which took its influence from both boho style and "the heavy influence of folk culture", had been seen on the likes of Sienna Miller and Kate Moss.

The London ''Evening Standard'' referred to "hippie chic" (a term used in the 1990s with reference to the velvet [[kaftan]]s created by [[Tom Ford]] for the Italian house of [[Gucci]]) in a feature about "gypsy queens",&lt;ref&gt;''Evening Standard Magazine, 11 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''Sunday Times'', reflecting on what "the fashion world called ... boho chic", referred to Sienna Miller's having created "the retro hippie look that swept Britain's high streets".&lt;ref&gt;Dean Nelson, ''Sunday Times'', 15 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 ''London Lite'' hailed the return of "hippy, hippy chic"&lt;ref&gt;''London Lite'', 14 May 2007. "Hippy, hippy chic" was a pun on ''[[Hippy Hippy Shake]]'', the title of a 1963 hit record by the [[The Swinging Blue Jeans|Swinging Blue Jeans]]&lt;/ref&gt; and, as noted, Fashion Union marketed "hippie chic" tops in 2010.

"Boho-by-default" was an unflattering description used by Lisa Armstrong to describe the style of women ("gargoyles" as opposed to "summer goddesses") who, for summer wear, "drag the same greying, crumpled boho-by-default mess out of storage every year".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 1 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morocco and Talitha Getty ===
In 2006 the ''Sunday Times'' described the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] resort and seaport of [[Essaouira]] as the "boho/barefoot-chic beach" because of its association with fashionable "Euro aesthetes with their Talitha Getty-esque kaftans".&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; The latter was a reference to an iconic photograph of [[Talitha Getty|Talitha Pol]], wife of [[Paul Getty|John Paul Getty]], that was taken by [[Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield|Patrick Lichfield]] in [[Marrakesh]] in 1969. This image was described by Lisa Armstrong as "typif[ying] the luxe bohemian look".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating Glastonbury 2005, Hedley Freeman in the ''Guardian'' had recommended the wearing of headscarves to achieve "Talitha Getty chic".&lt;ref&gt;Hedley Freeman, Guardian, 24 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olsen twins and American bobo===
In the United States, [[Mary-Kate Olsen|Mary-Kate]] and [[Ashley Olsen]], especially the former, were credited with a "homeless" look, first identified as such in [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City|New York]] in late 2004, that had many "boho" features (large sunglasses, flowing skirts, boots and loose jumpers). This was sometimes referred to as "ashcan chic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The term, "bobo chic" (also known as "[[hobo]]-grunge",&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'', 7 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; "[[heroin chic]]" or "[[luxe grunge]]"), had similar connotations, "bobo" (or "BoBo") being a contraction of "[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]" and "bohemian" coined by ''New York Times'' columnist [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] in his book, ''[[Bobos in Paradise]]'' (2000).

Bobo chic was associated in particular with [[Punk subculture|punks]] in the [[SoHo]] area of [[Lower Manhattan]], to the south of Greenwich Village. It was described by a student fashion writer as "paying to look poor" and having been "made popular by silver screen stars who all look like they got dressed in the dark like the Olsen twins, [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Chloë Sevigny]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kristale Ivezay, ''The South End'', 8 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 English actress [[Sophie Winkleman]], who had attended [[Cambridge University]] in the 1990s, remarked wryly that she had "wor[n] floaty dresses at university ... thinking that I looked poetic and wistful. I actually looked homeless".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Times Body &amp; Soul'', 9 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Another British commentator referred to Mary-Kate Olsen's "everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to dressing", but noted that, by 2006, the Olsens' merchandising empire was recording annual sales of £500 million.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Brinton, ''Style'', 22 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cocktail grunge and the catwalk====
A "[[catwalk]]", a refinement in 2006, of which actresses [[Kate Bosworth]] and [[Thandie Newton]] were said to be exponents, was referred to as "cocktail grunge" – "looking done-undone ... it's what Marianne Faithfull and [[Debbie Harry|Blondie]] would be wearing if they were young now".&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Paster, ''Style'', 24 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; – while a journalist who interviewed supermodel [[Helena Christensen]] in 2011 observed that, fresh from a photoshoot, she "flopped in a leather armchair like a sexy, ageing beatnik" and that, while "not a hippie, exactly", she lived in "[[groovy]] bohemia in Manhattan, where you can spot [her] moseying around the [[flea market]]s on the weekends".&lt;ref&gt;Giles Hattersley in ''Sunday Times Style'', 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 2000s (decade), this combination of apparently conflicting features was adopted by teenaged actress [[Taylor Momsen]], who, in 2010, became the "face" of the British retailing chain [[New Look (clothing retailer)|New Look]]. Momsen described her style as "sweet and tough, [[grunge]] meets [[Chanel]] – a giant [[oxymoron]]" and claimed that she chose her outfits from "whatever clean clothes she finds on her floor" ("although no one ever believes me").&lt;ref&gt;''Metro'', 13 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French ''bobos'' and similar stylists ===
In the world of [[Paris]]ian fashion, the term ''bobo'' (short for ''[[Bobos in Paradise|Bourgeois Bohème]]''), which also had political connotations, was applied to "typically discerning customers who are [[left wing]] and [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]]";&lt;ref&gt;Carola Long in ''The Times Guide to Paris Fashion and Style'', October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; or, put another way, "that subset of [[thirtysomething (term)|thirty- or forty-something]]-year-olds who don't allow their socialist leanings to interfere with an enjoyment of material pleasures".&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;''National Geographic'', August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ''la gauche caviar'' [the [[caviar]] left] was sometimes applied as an epithet to ''bobos''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 25 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''bobo'' style of dress has been described as "retro-hippie-[[shabby chic|shabby-chic]]",&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; its elements including [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] tops, [[boiled wool]] jackets, smart [[jeans]], [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] [[Athletic shoe|training shoes]] and leather bags by [[Jerome Dreyfuss]] (born 1974).&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Guide to Paris Fashion and Style'' October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A leading exponent was actress and singer [[Vanessa Paradis]], who particularly favoured the designs of [[Isabel Marant]] (born 1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modeaparis.com/va/couturiers/ima/index.html |title=Fédération Française de la Couture du Prêt-à-Porter des Couturiers et des Créateurs de Mode |publisher=modeaparis.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; while English actress [[Michelle Dockery]], best known for her part as Lady Mary Crawley in the early 20th century drama ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' (2010–14), cited Anglo-French actress [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] as one of her style icons: "I love that she looks like she's just thrown it on. Simplicity is true elegance".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Luxx'', 26 November 2011. Dockery added that, when wearing long dresses, she tried not to look "too ''Downton Abbey''" ... I like to make it a little bit more edgy".&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, another British actress [[Karen Gillan]], best known as [[Amy Pond]] in the BBC's science-fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', defined the look of 1960s model [[Jean Shrimpton]], whom she greatly admired and had just portrayed in a filmed drama for television, as "messy, [[gamine|waifish]], bony". She herself professed a liking for vintage clothing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When girls do the walk of shame ... I think they look best like that, slightly dishevelled." The Kate Moss look? "Yeah".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Magazine'', 1 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the teenaged rock bands, such as [[Second Sex (band)|Second Sex]]&lt;ref&gt;Second Sex took their name from the [[Second Sex|book]] of that name (1949) by [[Simone de Beauvoir]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Plastiscines]], that emerged in France ''c.'' 2006 and were known collectively as ''les bébés rockers'' ("baby rockers"), were initially derided in some sections of the press because of their ''bobo'' backgrounds: as Kate Spicer observed in the ''Sunday Times'', "it's as if a bunch of privileged [[Islington]] kids had picked up their guitars and proclaimed themselves the new [[Sex Pistols]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 25 March 2007. Islington is an upper-middle class area of London; the Sex Pistols were a leading [[punk rock|punk]] band of the late 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010 ''bobos'' – "free-thinkers at the weekend, but bankers Monday to Friday" – were said to be squeezing out young, genuinely creative Parisians from their traditional neighborhoods,&lt;ref&gt;Brian Scofield, ''Sunday Times Travel'', 18 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Porte de Bagnolet (Paris Métro)|Porte de Bagnolet]], in the 20th ''[[arrondissement]]'', cited as an alternative base for "the next generation of diverse Parisian voices".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'', 18 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Bourgeois Boheme" was adopted in 2005 by a British company, founded by Alicia Lai, that marketed "ethnically sourced" fashion accessories and cosmetics and, by 2009, had moved into handmade shoes crafted from such materials as hemp and organic cotton.&lt;ref&gt;''Country Life'', 21 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bohemian roots ==
{{main article|Bohemian style}}
Although boho-chic in the early years of the 21st century represented a definite style, it was not a "movement." Nor was it noticeably associated with bohemianism as such. Jessica Brinton saw it as "the tagging and selling of the bohemian dream to the masses for £5.99".&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 20 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the ''Sunday Times'' thought it ironic that "fashionable girls wore ruffly floral skirts in the hope of looking bohemian, nomadic, spirited and non-bourgeois", whereas "gypsy girls themselves ... are sexy and delightful precisely because they do not give a hoot for fashion".&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 19 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in the first half of the 20th century, aspects of bohemian fashion were a reflection of the lifestyle itself.

In fact, most of the components of boho had, in one way or another, drifted in and out of fashion since the "[[Summer of Love]]" of 1967 when [[hippie]]dom and [[psychedelia]] were at their peak. As journalist Bob Stanley put it, "the late 1960s are never entirely out of fashion, they just need a fresh angle to make them ''de jour''".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Knowledge'', 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Scribe Book Scanner.jpg|thumb|[[Internet Archive]] Scribe book scanner in 2011]]
[[File:Internet Archive book scanner 1.jpg|thumb|Internet Archive book scanner]]
'''Book scanning''' (or '''magazine scanning''') is the process of converting physical [[book]]s and magazines into [[digital media]] such as [[digital image|images]], [[electronic text]], or [[e-book|electronic books]] (e-books) by using an [[image scanner]].

Digital books can be easily distributed, reproduced, and [[screen reading|read on-screen]]. Common file formats are [[DjVu]], [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF), and [[Tagged Image File Format]] (TIFF). To convert the raw images [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) is used to turn book pages into a digital text format like [[ASCII]] or other similar format, which reduces the file size and allows the text to be reformatted, searched, or processed by other applications.

Image scanners may be manual or automated. In an ordinary commercial image scanner, the book is placed on a flat glass plate (or platen), and a light and optical array moves across the book underneath the glass. In manual book scanners, the glass plate extends to the edge of the scanner, making it easier to line up the book's spine. Other book scanners place the book face up in a v-shaped frame, and photograph the pages from above. Pages may be turned by hand or by automated paper transport devices. Glass or plastic sheets are usually pressed against the page to flatten it.

After scanning, software adjusts the document images by lining it up, cropping it, picture-editing it, and converting it to text and final e-book form. Human proofreaders usually check the output for errors.

Scanning at {{nowrap|118 dots/centimeter}} ({{nowrap|300 [[dots per inch|dpi]]}}) is adequate for conversion to digital text output, but for archival reproduction of rare, elaborate or illustrated books, much higher resolution is used.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} High-end scanners capable of thousands of pages per hour can cost thousands of dollars, but [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY), manual book scanners capable of 1200 pages per hour have been built for US$300.&lt;ref name="instructables"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-High-Speed-Book-Scanner-from-Trash-and-Cheap-C/|title=DIY High-Speed Book Scanner from Trash and Cheap Cameras|publisher=instructables.com|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial book scanners==
[[File:V-shaped-cradle - en.svg|thumb|Sketch of a V-shaped book scanner from Atiz]]
[[File:book scanner.svg|thumb|Sketch of a typical manual book scanner]]
Commercial book scanners are not like normal [[image scanner|scanners]]; these book scanners are usually a high quality [[digital camera]] with light sources on either side of the camera mounted on some sort of frame to provide easy access for a person or machine to flip through the pages of the book. Some models involve V-shaped book cradles, which provide support for book spines and also center book position automatically.

The advantage of this type of scanner is that it is very fast, compared to the productivity of overhead scanners.

==Book scanning by organizations on a large scale==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Projects like [[Project Gutenberg]] (est. 1971), [[Million Book Project]] (est. circa 2001), [[Google Books]] (est. 2004), and the [[Open Content Alliance]] (est. 2005) scan books on a large scale.

One of the main challenges to this is the sheer volume of books that must be scanned. In 2010 the total number of works appearing as books in human history was estimated to be around 130&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taycher |first=Leonid |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.co.at/2010/08/you-can-count-number-of-books-in-world.html |title=As of Aug 5, 2010, google estimates that there are 129,864,880 different books in the world |publisher=Googleblog.blogspot.co.at |date=2010-08-05 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these must be scanned and then made searchable online for the public to use as a [[universal library]]. Currently, there are three main ways that large organizations are relying on: outsourcing, scanning in-house using commercial book scanners, and scanning in-house using robotic scanning solutions.

As for outsourcing, books are often shipped to be scanned by low-cost sources to [[India]] or [[China]]. Alternatively, due to convenience, safety and technology improvement, many organizations choose to scan in-house by using either overhead scanners which are time-consuming, or digital camera-based scanning machines which are substantially faster and is a method employed by Internet Archive as well as Google. Traditional methods have included cutting off the book's spine and scanning the pages in a [[image scanner|scanner]] with automatic page-feeding capability, with subsequent rebinding of the loose pages.

Once the page is scanned, the [[data]] is either entered manually or via OCR, another major cost of the book scanning projects.{{According to whom|date=January 2016}}

Due to [[copyright]] issues, most scanned books are those that are out of copyright; however, [[Google Book Search]] is known to scan books still protected under copyright unless the [[publisher]] specifically prohibits this.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Destructive scanning methods==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
For book scanning on a low budget, the least expensive method to scan a book or magazine is to cut off the binding. This converts the book or magazine into a sheaf of looseleaf papers, which can then be loaded into a standard [[automatic document feeder]] (ADF) and scanned using inexpensive and common scanning technology. While this is not a desirable solution for very old and uncommon books, it is a useful tool for book and magazine scanning where the book is not an expensive collector's item and replacement of the scanned content is easy. There are two technical difficulties with this process, first with the cutting and second with the scanning.

===Unbinding===
More precise and less destructive than cutting pages with a paper guillotine or razor or scissors is the technique of meticulous unbinding by hand, assisted with tools.  This technique has been successfully employed for tens of thousands of pages of archival original paper scanned for the Riazanov Library digital archive project from newspapers and magazines and pamphlets, varying from 50 to 100 years old and more, and often composed of fragile, brittle paper.  Although the monetary value for some collectors (and for most sellers of this sort of material) is destroyed by unbinding, unbinding in many cases actually greatly assists preservation of the physical pages themselves, making them more accessible to researchers and less likely to be damaged when subsequently examined. The down side is that unbound stacks of pages are "fluffed up", and therefore more exposed to oxygen in the air, which may in some cases (theoretically) speed deterioration.  This can be addressed by putting weights on the pages after they are unbound, and storage in appropriate containers.

Hand unbinding will preserve text that runs into the gutters of bindings, and most critically allows more easy and complete high quality scans to be made of two page wide material, such as center cartoons, graphic art, and photos in magazines.  The digital archive of The Liberator 1918-1924 on Marxist Internet Archive nicely demonstrates the quality of two page wide graphic art scans made possible by careful hand unbinding prior to flat bed or other scanning.

Unbinding techniques vary with the binding technology, from simply removing a few staples to unbending and removing nails to meticulous grinding down of layers of glue on the spine of a book to precisely the right point, followed by laborious removal of the string used to hold the book together.

Note that with some newspapers (such as Labor Action 1950-1952) there are columns on the center facing pages that run right in-between the pages.  Chopping off part of the spine of a bound volume of such papers  will lose part of this text.  Even the Greenwood Reprint of this publication failed to preserve the text content of those center columns, cutting off significant amounts of text there.  Only when bound volumes of the original newspaper were meticulously unbound, and the opened pair of center pages were scanned as a single page on a flat bed scanner was the center column content made digitally available. Alternatively, one can present the two facing center pages as three scans. One of each individual page, and one of a page sized area situated over the center of the two pages.

===Cutting===
One method of cutting a stack of 500 to 1000 pages in one pass is accomplished with a [[Paper cutter|guillotine]] paper cutter. This is a large steel table with a paper [[vise]] that screws down onto the stack and firmly secures it before cutting. The cut is accomplished with a large sharpened steel blade which moves straight down and cuts the entire length of each sheet all at once. A lever on the blade permits several hundred pounds of force to be applied to the blade for a quick one-pass cut.

A clean cut through a thick stack of paper cannot be made with a traditional inexpensive sickle-shaped hinged [[paper cutter]]. These cutters are only intended for a few sheets, with up to ten sheets being the practical cutting limit. A large stack of paper applies torsional forces on the hinge, pulling the blade away from the cutting edge on the table. The cut becomes more inaccurate as the cut moves away from the hinge, and the force required to hold the blade against the cutting edge increases as the cut moves away from the hinge.

The guillotine cutting process dulls the blade over time, requiring that it be resharpened. [[Coated paper]] such as slick magazine paper dulls the blade more quickly than plain book paper, due to the [[kaolinite]] [[clay]] coating. Additionally, removing the binding of an entire hardcover book causes excessive wear due to cutting through the cover's stiff backing material. Instead the outer cover can be removed and only interior pages need be cut.

An alternate method of unbinding books is to use a table saw.  While this method is potentially dangerous and does not leave as smooth an edge as the guillotine paper cutter method, it is more readily available to the average person.  The ideal method is to clamp the book between two thick boards using heavy machine screws to provide the clamping force.  The entire wood and book package is fed through the table saw using the rip fence as a guide.  A sharp fine carbide tooth blade is ideal for generating an acceptable cut.  The quality of the cut depends on the blade, feed rate, type of paper, paper coating, and binding material.

===Scanning===
Once the paper is liberated from the spine, it can be scanned one sheet at a time using a traditional [[flatbed scanner]] or [[automatic document feeder]].

Pages with a decorative riffled edging or curving in an arc due to a non-flat binding can be difficult to scan using an ADF. An ADF is designed to scan pages of uniform shape and size, and variably sized or shaped  pages can lead to improper scanning. The riffled edges or curved edge can be guillotined off to render the outer edges flat and smooth before the binding is cut.

The coated paper of magazines and bound textbooks can make them difficult for the rollers in an ADF to pick up and guide along the paper path. An ADF which uses a series of rollers and channels to flip sheets over may jam or misfeed when fed coated paper. Generally there are fewer problems by using as straight of a paper path as is possible, with few bends and curves. The clay can also rub off the paper over time and coat sticky pickup rollers, causing them to loosely grip the paper. The ADF rollers may need periodic cleaning to prevent this slipping.

Magazines can pose a bulk-scanning challenge due to small nonuniform sheets of paper in the stack, such as magazine subscription cards and fold out pages. These need to be removed before the bulk scan begins, and are either scanned separately if they include worthwhile content, or are simply left out of the scan process.

===A test case: PGP===
In 1995, [[Phil Zimmerman]] published ''PGP Source Code and Internals'' as a $60 hardbound book, which under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] could legally be shipped abroad. The buyer could either display it in a library or destructively scan it so that the source code could be compiled via freely available GNU software into the [[Pretty Good Privacy]] (PGP) cryptosystem that the U.S. government regarded as a restricted munition. Zimmerman was being prosecuted for distributing PGP software and wanted to test the law in the courts. It was not directly tested, but export restrictions have eased: it is [[Export of cryptography in the United States|legal to export PGP]] anywhere but the seven countries and specified groups and individuals to which nothing can be exported from the U.S.

==Non-destructive scanning==

[[File:MyBookScanner,June12,2011.JPG|thumb|An example of a DIY non-destructive book scanner/digitizer, with the book downwards design, allowing gravity to flatten pages]]
Software driven machines and robots have been developed to scan books without the need of disbinding them in order to preserve both the contents of the document and create a digital image archive of its current state. This recent trend has been due in part to ever improving imaging technologies that allow a high quality digital archive image to be captured with little or no damage to a rare or fragile book in a reasonably short period of time.

The first fully automated book scanner was the DL (Digitizing Line) scanner, manufactured by 4DigitalBooks in Switzerland. First known installation was at Stanford University in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=John|title=4DigitalBooks launches digital book scanner|url=http://www.printweek.com/print-week/news/1107446/4digitalbooks-launches-digital-book-scanner|publisher=PrintWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanford University Libraries (SUL) Robotic Book Scanner|url=http://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/library/prod//depts/diroff/DLStatement.html|publisher=Stanford University Libraries (SUL)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scanner received a Dow Jones Runner-Up award under Business Applications Category in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology Innovation Awards: Winners 2001|url=http://www.dowjones.com/innovation/ei_winners_2001.html|publisher=Dow Jones|access-date=2017-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923220139/http://www.dowjones.com/innovation/ei_winners_2001.html|archive-date=2015-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robotický knižní scanner.webm|Video of the robotic book scanner DL mini|thumb|left]]

Most high-end commercial robotic scanners use traditional air and [[suction]] technology while some others use alternative approaches like bionic finger for turning the pages. Some scanners take advantage of [[Ultrasonic sensor]] or [[Photoelectric sensor]] to detect dual pages and prevent skipping of pages. With reports of machines being able to scan up to 2900 pages per hour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rapp|first=David|title=Product Watch: Library Scanners|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2011/06/industry-news/product-watch-library-scanners/#|publisher=Library Journal|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; robotic book scanners are specifically designed for large-scale digitization projects.

Google's patent 7508978 shows an [[infrared]] camera technology which allows to detect and automatically adjust the three-dimensional shape of the page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |inventor1-last=Lefevere |inventor1-first=Francois-Marie |inventor2-last=Saric |inventor2-first=Marin |title=Detection of grooves in scanned images |issue-date=March 24, 2009 |file-date=September 13, 2004 |country-code=US |patent-number=7508978 |assign1=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.npr.org/blogs/library/2009/04/the_granting_of_patent_7508978.html The Secret Of Google's Book Scanning Machine Revealed]'', by Maureen Clements, April 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Researchers from the University of Tokyo have an experimental non-destructive book scanner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guizzo |first=Erico |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/book-flipping-scanning |title="Superfast Scanner Lets You Digitize Book By Flipping Pages", IEEE Spectrum, March 17, 2010 |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes a 3D surface scanner to allow images of a curved page to be straightened in software. Thus the book or magazine can be scanned as quickly as the operator can flip through the pages; about 200 [[pages per minute]].

'''''Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc.''''' 861 F. Supp. 303 ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1994), ''rev'd'' 71 F.3d 77 ([[2d Cir.]] 1995), ''[[Certiorari|cert.]] denied'' 116 S. Ct. 1824 (1996). 

==Overview==
This an early case of authors attempting to exercise their moral rights under the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]] (VARA). VARA was passed in 1990 and added several [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] for artists in the U.S., including the right of authors to prevent mutilation of their works.

==Facts==
The Plaintiffs John Carter, John Swing, and John Veronis (artists) created art and sculpture work together in [[New York City]] under the name "Jx3". 474431 Associates was the owner of a former [[Macy's]] warehouse at 47-44 31st Street, in the [[Long Island City]] section of Queens, New York. 474431 Associates leased this building to 47-44 31st Street Associates, L.P. and from February 1, 1990 to June, 1993, SIG Management Company ["SIG"] managed the property as "The Factory Building" and marketed it as a mall.

On December 16, 1991, the artists entered into a contract with SIG "to design, create and install sculpture and other permanent installations" in the building. The artists had "full authority in design, color, and style" of the artwork they installed. The artists created multiple ecological themed sculptures along with a mosaic on the floor made of recycled light bulbs. SIG could direct the location and installation of the artwork within the building. SIG agreed to pay the artists one thousand dollars a week for at least forty hours of work. The artists retained copyright in their work, but SIG was to receive 50% of all proceeds from the exploitation of the art.

On March 31, 1994, Helmsley-Spear, Inc. assumed the management of the property. Helmsley-Spear's representatives forbade the artists from installing any further artwork, and stated that they were going to remove the completed art from the building. The artists believed that this was a mutilation of their artwork under [[Visual Artists Rights Act]] and filed a lawsuit to enjoin the defendants from taking such actions.

==District Court==

The District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Second District, granted the artists an injunction under VARA prohibiting removal of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc. |vol=861 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=303 |pinpoint= |court=S.D.N.Y. |date=1994 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/861/303/2261919/ |accessdate=2017-09-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That decision was appealed to the [[Second Circuit]] Court of Appeals.

==Circuit Court==
The Second Circuit found that the sculpture was a [[work for hire|work made for hire]] and vacated the injunction. In coming to this conclusion, it applied the 13-factor test from ''[[Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid]]'', 490 U.S. 730, for determining if a work is created as a "work made for hire" or if the artist was working as "independent contractor".

The gold '''Casco de Leiro''' ("[[Helmet]] of Leiro") is a ritual hemispherical [[cap]] probably dating to the end of the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://museos.xunta.gal/es/arqueoloxico-coruna Museo Arqueolóxico e Histórico webpage]; "We believe that the most coherent archaeological context for the dating of Leiro would correspond to the final centuries of the Late Bronze Age"  ([http://webs.uvigo.es/beacomendador/index_archivos/LEIRO.pdf Beatriz Comendador Rey, "The Leiro Hoard (Galicia, Spain): the lonely find?"], ''Gold und kult der Bronzezeit'', exhibition catalogue, Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, 2003:176-188)&lt;/ref&gt; (''circa'' 1,000 to 800 BC) in the town of [[Leiro, Rianxo|Leiro]] (municipality of [[Rianxo]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]]). The circumstances of its discovery show that technically it constitutes a [[hoard]].&lt;ref&gt;As remarked by Almeida ''et al.'', "Galicia Different Place: da cronoloxía do ouro precastrexo e ouros tópicos", ''Historia Nova: Contribución dos Xoves Historiadores do Galicis'' '''3''' (1994:30f), noted by Comendador Rey 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cap, hammered from a single casting of gold,&lt;ref&gt;Armbruster 1999:243f&lt;/ref&gt; is entirely covered with registers of repeated [[repoussé]] decoration, hammered over bronze molds, of repeated bosses alternating with bands of repeated concentric circles. The central point is applied with a flat-sided point in the form of a truncated cone. Its maximum diameter is 19.5&amp;nbsp;cm with a height of 15&amp;nbsp;cm to the base of the point, it weighs 270 grams.&lt;ref&gt;[[:gl:Casco de Leiro|Gallego Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Its registers of hammered decoration present parallels with the decors of late Bronze Age conical [[golden hats]] of the [[Golden Hat of Schifferstadt|Schifferstadt type]] and the gold bowls found at [[Axtroki|Axtroki, Guipúzcoa]], or the so-called  [[Treasure of Villena]], Alicante. There is a possibility that its uses were twofold: as a ritual basin, though it is decoratively pierced with an [[wikt:awl|awl]], and inverted as an emblem of authority.

The casque was a chance discovery made by a fisherman, José Vicente Somoza, on 7 April 1976 at a small rocky point called [[Curruncho dos Porcos]], by the beach at [[Leiro]] (Rianxo) in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia, Spain]]. The site, on the large estuary called the Ría de Arousa, is part of the estuary system of the [[Ulla]],  which offers "optimum conditions for navigation" and has served since time immemorial as an easy passage into the heart of Galicia.&lt;ref&gt;Comendador Rey, 2003:&lt;/ref&gt; Removing some earth to flatten a space for a shed in which to beach his boat, he struck a coarsely made&lt;ref&gt;Comendador Rey 2003, judging from the few isolated [[sherd]]s suggests "a good-size hemispherical vessel with a coarse finish".&lt;/ref&gt; earthenware crock that broke as he struck it. He immediately saw that it contained a gold object, and he reported the find to the Guardia Civil of Rianxo and the Department of Archaeology at the [[Instituto Padre Sarmiento]]. The find was transferred to the Museo Arqueolóxico e Histórico of [[A Coruña]], where it is conserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museos.xunta.gal/es/arqueoloxico-coruna Museo Arqueolóxico e Histórico webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conducting''' is the art of directing a [[music]]al performance, such as an [[orchestra]]l or [[Choir|choral]] [[concert]]. It has been defined as "the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture."&lt;ref&gt;Sir George Grove, John Alexander Fuller-Maitland; eds. (1922). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YgBKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA588&amp;dq=conducting+dictionary&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjix-69nPbWAhUO42MKHWDCDmoQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=conducting%20dictionary&amp;f=false A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Volume 1]'', p.581. Macmillan. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary duties of the '''conductor''' are to interpret the score created by a composer in a manner which is reflective of the specific indications within that score, set the [[tempo]], ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and to "shape" the phrasing where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Conducting|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|first1=Michael|last1=Kennedy|authorlink1=Michael Kennedy (music critic)|first2=Joyce|last2=Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=9780199203833}}&lt;/ref&gt; To convey their ideas and interpretation, conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically though not invariably with the aid of a [[Baton (conducting)|baton]], and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers.&lt;ref name=CambComp3&gt;{{cite book|last=Holden|first=Raymond|chapter=The technique of conducting|page=3|editor-last=Bowen|editor-first=José Antonio|title=The Cambridge Companion to Conducting|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|date=2003|isbn=0-521-52791-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conductor's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.&lt;ref name=CambComp3 /&gt;

The conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the [[full score]], which contains the [[musical notation]] for all the instruments or voices. Since the mid-19th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the [[harpsichord]]ist or first violinist (see [[concertmaster]]), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a [[piano]] or [[synthesizer]] may also be done with [[musical theatre]] [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a "count in"). However, in [[rehearsal]]s, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.

Conductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-conductor-2456662|title=The Conductor|author=Espie Estrella|date=6 March 2017|website=thoughtco.com|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. [[Orchestra]]s, [[choir]]s, [[concert band]]s and other sizable [[musical ensemble]]s such as [[big band]]s are usually led by conductors.

==Nomenclature==
The principal conductor of an [[orchestra]] or [[opera]] company is sometimes referred to as a ''[[music director]]'' or ''chief conductor'', or by the German words ''[[Kapellmeister]]'' or ''Dirigent''. Conductors of [[choir]]s or choruses are sometimes referred to as ''choral director,'' ''chorus master,'' or ''choirmaster,'' particularly for choirs associated with an orchestra. Conductors of [[concert band]]s, [[military band]]s, [[marching band]]s and other bands may hold the title of ''band director'', ''bandmaster'', or ''drum major''. Respected senior conductors are sometimes referred to by the Italian word, ''[[maestro]]'' ("master" as in "one who has mastered the art").

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

===Middle Ages to 18th century===
An early form of conducting is [[cheironomy]], the use of hand gestures to indicate [[melody|melodic]] shape. This has been practiced at least as far back as the [[Middle Ages]]. In the [[Christian]] church, the person giving these symbols held a [[Staff of office|staff]] to signify his role, and it seems that as music became [[rhythm]]ically more complex, the staff was moved up and down to indicate the beat, acting as an early form of [[Baton (conducting)|baton]].

In the 17th century, other devices to indicate the passing of time came into use. Rolled up sheets of paper, smaller sticks and unadorned hands are all shown in pictures from this period. The large staff was responsible for the death of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], who injured his foot with one while conducting a [[Te Deum]] for the [[Louis XIV of France|King]]'s recovery from illness. The wound became [[gangrene|gangrenous]] and Lully refused amputation, whereupon the gangrene spread to his leg and he died two months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Jérôme de La Gorce]]|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/42477pg1?q=lully+gangrene&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|title=(1) Jean-Baptiste Lully (Lulli, Giovanni Battista) (i)|work=[[Oxford Music Online]] (New Grove)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2007|accessdate=8 October 2008}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In instrumental music throughout the 18th century, a member of the ensemble usually acted as the conductor. This was sometimes the [[concertmaster]], who could use his [[bow (music)|bow]] as a baton, or a [[lute]]nist who would move the neck of his instrument in time with the beat. It was common to conduct from the [[harpsichord]] in pieces that had a [[basso continuo]] part. In opera performances, there were sometimes two conductors – the keyboard player was in charge of the singers, and the principal violinist or '''leader''' was in charge of the orchestra.

On Fri, 30 Sep 1791 in Vienna, [[Mozart]]'s opera Die Zauberflöte ([[The Magic Flute]]) premiered at the Theater auf der Wieden (also known as the “Wiednertheater”), with Mozart himself conducting the orchestra, according to documents and publicity posters from that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Edge |first1=Dexter |title=The earliest published report on the premiere of Die Zauberflöte (1 Oct 1791) |url=https://sites.google.com/site/mozartdocuments/documents/1791-10-01 |website=Mozart: New Documents |publisher=Dexter Edge and David Black |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:Verdi conducting Aida in Paris 1880 - Gallica - Restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Giuseppe Verdi]] conducting his opera ''[[Aida]]'' in 1881]]
By the early 19th century (ca. 1820), it became the norm to have a dedicated conductor, who did not also play an instrument during the performance. While some orchestras protested the introduction of the conductor, since they were used to having a concertmaster or keyboard player act as leader, eventually the role of a conductor was established. The size of the usual orchestra expanded during this period, and the use of a baton became more common, as it was easier to see than bare hands or rolled-up paper. Among the earliest notable conductors were [[Louis Spohr]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[Louis-Antoine Jullien]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], all of whom were also composers. Mendelssohn is claimed to have been the first conductor to utilize a wooden baton to keep time, a practice still generally in use in the 2010s. Prominent conductors who did not or do not use a baton include [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Kurt Masur]], [[James Conlon]], [[Yuri Temirkanov]],&lt;ref&gt;Libbey, Theodore (2006).

''A History of Orchestral Conducting: In Theory and Practice'', p. 521. Pendragon. {{ISBN|9780918728470}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The composers [[Hector Berlioz]] and [[Richard Wagner]] attained greatness as conductors, and they wrote two of the earliest essays dedicated to the subject. Berlioz is considered the first virtuoso conductor. Wagner was largely responsible for shaping the conductor's role as one who imposes his own view of a piece onto the performance rather than one who is just responsible for ensuring entries are made at the right time and that there is a unified beat. Predecessors who focused on conducting include [[François Habeneck]], who founded the [[Orchestre de la Société des concerts du Conservatoire]] in 1828, though Berlioz was later to be alarmed at Habeneck's loose standards of rehearsal. Pianist and composer [[Franz Liszt]] was also a conductor.

Wagner's one-time champion [[Hans von Bülow]] (1830–1894) was particularly celebrated as a conductor, although he also maintained his initial career as a pianist, an instrument on which he was regarded as among the greatest performers (he was a prized piano student of [[Franz Liszt]], whose daughter [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]] he married – although she was to abandon him for Wagner. Liszt was a major figure in the history of conducting, who attained remarkable performances).

Bülow raised the technical standards of conducting to an unprecedented level through such innovations as separate, detailed rehearsals of different sections of the orchestra ("sectional rehearsal"). In his posts as head of (sequentially) the [[Bavarian State Opera]], [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]], and [[Berlin Philharmonic]] he brought a level of nuance and subtlety to orchestral performance previously heard only in solo instrumental playing, and in doing so made a profound impression on young artists like [[Richard Strauss]], who at the age of 20 served as his assistant, and [[Felix Weingartner]], who came to disapprove of his interpretations but was deeply impressed by his orchestral standards. Composer [[Gustav Mahler]] was also a noted conductor.

===20th century===
The next generation of conductors brought technical standards to new levels; perhaps most notable was the Hungarian-born [[Arthur Nikisch]] (1855–1922), who succeeded Bülow as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1895. He had previously served as head of the [[Leipzig Opera]], [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], and [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]], and was to serve as music director of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. Nikisch premiered important works by [[Anton Bruckner]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], who greatly admired his work; [[Johannes Brahms]], after hearing him conduct his [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Fourth Symphony]], said it was "quite exemplary, it's impossible to hear it any better."

Nikisch took the London Symphony Orchestra on tour through the United States in April 1912, the first American tour by a European orchestra. He also made one of the earliest [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] of a complete symphony: the [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven Fifth]] with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1913. Nikisch was also the first conductor to have his art captured on film – alas, silently. The film confirms reports that he made particularly mesmerizing use of eye contact and expression to communicate with an orchestra; such later conductors as [[Fritz Reiner]] stated that this aspect of his technique had a strong influence on their own.

Conductors of the generations after Nikisch often left extensive recorded evidence of their arts. Two particularly influential and widely recorded figures are often treated, somewhat inaccurately, as interpretive antipodes. They were the Italian conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] (1867–1957) and the German conductor [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] (1886–1954). Toscanini played in orchestras under [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and made his debut conducting ''[[Aida]]'' in 1886, filling in at the last minute for an indisposed conductor. He is to this day regarded by such authorities as [[James Levine]] as the greatest of all Verdi conductors. But Toscanini's repertory was wide, and it was in his interpretations of the German symphonists Beethoven and Brahms that he was particularly renowned and influential, favoring stricter and faster tempi than a conductor like Bülow or, before him, Wagner. Still, his style shows more inflection than his reputation may suggest, and he was particularly gifted at revealing detail and getting orchestras to play in a singing manner.

Furtwängler, whom many regard as the greatest interpreter of Wagner (although Toscanini was also admired in this composer) and Bruckner, conducted Beethoven and Brahms with a good deal of inflection of tempo – but generally in a manner that revealed the structure and direction of the music particularly clearly. He was an accomplished composer as well as performer, and a disciple of the theorist [[Heinrich Schenker]], who emphasized concern for underlying long-range harmonic tensions and [[Resolution (music)|resolutions]] in a piece, a strength of Furtwängler's conducting. Along with his interest in the large-scale, Furtwängler also shaped the details of the piece in a particularly compelling and expressive manner.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R92264, Herbert von Karajan.jpg|thumb|[[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in 1941]]

The two men had very different techniques: Toscanini's was Italianate, with a long, large baton and clear beats (often not using his left hand); Furtwängler beat time with less apparent precision, because he wanted a more rounded sound (although it is a myth that his technique was vague; many musicians have attested that he was easy to follow in his own way). In any event, their examples illustrate a larger point about conducting technique in the first half of the 20th century: it was not standardized. Great and influential conductors of the middle 20th century like [[Leopold Stokowski]] (1882–1977), [[Otto Klemperer]] (1885–1973), [[Herbert von Karajan]] (1908–1989) and [[Leonard Bernstein]] (1918–1990) – incidentally, the first American conductor to attain greatness and international fame – had widely varied techniques.

Karajan and Bernstein formed another apparent antipode in the 1960s–80s, Karajan as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic (1955–89) and Bernstein as, for part of that period, music director of the [[New York Philharmonic]] (1957–69), and later frequent guest conductor in Europe. Karajan's technique was highly controlled, and eventually he conducted with his eyes often closed; Bernstein's technique was demonstrative, with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body movements. Karajan could conduct for hours without moving his feet, while Bernstein was known at times to leap into the air at a great climax. As the music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, Karajan cultivated warm, blended beauty of tone, which has sometimes been criticized as too uniformly applied; by contrast, in Bernstein's only appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1979 – performing Mahler's [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] – he tried to get the orchestra to produce an "ugly" tone in a certain passage in which he believed it suited the expressive meaning of the music (the first horn player refused, and finally agreed to let an understudy play instead of himself).

Both Karajan and Bernstein made extensive use of advances in media to convey their art, but in tellingly different ways. Bernstein hosted major prime-time national television series to educate and reach out to children and the public at large about classical music; Karajan made a series of films late in his life, but in them, he did not talk. Both made numerous recordings, but their attitudes toward recording differed: Karajan frequently made new studio recordings to take advantage of advances in recording technique, which fascinated him – he played a role in setting the specifications of the compact disc – but Bernstein, in his post-New York days, came to insist on (for the most part) live concert recordings, believing that music-making did not come to life in a studio without an audience.

In the last third of the 20th century, conducting technique – particularly with the right hand and the baton – became increasingly standardized. Conductors like [[Willem Mengelberg]] in Amsterdam until the end of World War II had had extensive rehearsal time to mold orchestras very precisely, and thus could have idiosyncratic techniques; modern conductors, who spend less time with any given orchestra, must get results with much less rehearsal time. A more standardized technique allows communication to be much more rapid. Nonetheless, conductors' techniques still show a great deal of variety, particularly with the use of the left hand, facial and eye expression, and body language.

===21st century===
[[File:full score.jpg|thumb|Conductor's score and batons on a lit, extra-large conductor's music stand]]
[[Women in music#Conducting|Women conductors]] were almost unheard of in the ranks of leading orchestral conductors through most of the 19th and 20th centuries, but today, artists like {{ill|Hortense von Gelmini|de}},&lt;ref&gt;David Mutch: "The gathering critical judgement of Hortense von Gelmini, Germany's only woman conductor, is that she has not only the talent but the education, energy, and persistance to make her mark in this difficult and competive profession" – 1976 in: ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' {{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marin Alsop]] and [[Simone Young]] are to be seen conducting leading orchestras. Alsop was appointed music director of the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]] in 2007 – the first woman ever appointed to head a major US orchestra – and also of the [[Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo]] in 2012, and Alsop was the first woman to conduct on the last night of [[The Proms]]. Young scored similar firsts when she became head of the [[Hamburg State Opera]] and [[Philharmoniker Hamburg]] in 2005; she is also the first woman conductor to record the [[Ring Cycle]] of [[Richard Wagner]]. ''The Guardian'' called conducting "one of the last [[glass ceilings]] in the music industry".&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 article stated that in France, out of 574 concerts only 17 were conducted by women and no women conducted at the [[Paris National Opera|National Opéra in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Victor Tribot Laspière | title=Une main ferme à l'Orchestre national de France | url=http://www.francemusique.fr/actu-musicale/ou-sont-les-femmes-dans-la-musique-7766 | work=France Musique | date=2013-10-02 | accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Bachtrack'' reported that, in a list of the world's 150 top conductors that year, only five were women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classical-music.com/article/11-of-best-female-conductors |title=11 of today's top women conductors |publisher=Classical-Music.com |date=2015-03-06 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Mexico has produced several major international conductors, [[Alondra de la Parra]] has become the first Mexican-born woman to attain distinction in the profession. Similarly, Asian origin has become unremarkable, because of the international successes of conductors from the Far East such as [[Seiji Ozawa]], who was the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]'s music director from 1973 until 2002 after holding similar posts in San Francisco and Toronto, and [[Myung-Whun Chung]], who has held major posts in Germany and France and now is bringing the [[Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra]] to international attention. There is still under-representation of artists of black origin in the conducting profession, but there have been notable exceptions, such as [[Henry Lewis (musician)|Henry Lewis]], [[Dean Dixon]], [[James DePreist]], [[Paul Freeman (conductor)|Paul Freeman]], and [[Michael Morgan (conductor)|Michael Morgan]]. For more information on black conductors, see [[Black conductors]]. According to a 2004 article in ''The Guardian'', "black conductors are rare in the classical music world and even in symphony orchestras it is unusual to see more than one or two black musicians."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/aug/10/edinburgh04.arts|title=Black conductor fears he will remain exception|date=10 August 2004|access-date=19 June 2017|work=The Guardian|first=Charlotte|last=Higgins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conducting is a means of communicating artistic directions to performers during a performance. Although there are many formal rules on how to conduct correctly, others are subjective, and a wide variety of different conducting styles exist depending upon the training and sophistication of the conductor. The primary responsibilities of the conductor are to unify performers, set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats, listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble, and to control the interpretation and pacing of the music. Communication is non-verbal during a performance, however in [[rehearsal]] frequent interruptions allow directions as to how the music should be played. During rehearsals, the conductor may stop the playing of a piece to request changes in the phrasing or request a change in the timbre of a certain section. In amateur orchestras, the rehearsals are often stopped to draw the musicians' attentions to performance errors or transposition mistakes.

Conducting requires an understanding of the elements of musical expression ([[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Articulation (music)|articulation]]) and the ability to communicate them effectively to an ensemble. The ability to communicate nuances of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] and expression through gestures is also beneficial. Conducting gestures are preferably prepared beforehand by the conductor while studying the [[sheet music|score]], but may sometimes be spontaneous.

A distinction is sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral conducting. Typically, orchestral conductors use a [[baton (conducting)|baton]] more often than choral conductors. The grip of the baton varies from conductor to conductor.

===Beat and tempo===
&lt;!--[[Ictus]] links directly here.--&gt;
At the beginning of a piece of music, the conductor raises his hands (or hand if he only uses a single hand) to indicate that the piece is about to begin. This is a signal for the orchestra members to ready their instruments to be played or for the choristers to be ready and watching. The conductor then looks at the different sections of the orchestra (winds, strings, etc.) or choir to ensure that all the orchestra members are ready to play and choir members are ready. In some choral works, the conductor may signal to a pianist or organist to play a note or chord so that the choir members can determine their starting notes. Then the conductor gives one or more preparatory beats to commence the music. The preparatory beat before the orchestra or choir begins is the [[upbeat]]. The [[Beat (music)|beat]] of the music is typically indicated with the conductor's right hand, with or without a baton. The hand traces a shape in the air in every [[bar (music)|bar]] (measure) depending on the [[time signature]], indicating each beat with a change from downward to upward motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Maestro's Mojo – Breaking Conductors' Down by Gesture and Body Part|first=Daniel J.|last=Wakin|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=26 April 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/arts/music/breaking-conductors-down-by-gesture-and-body-part.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images show the most common beat patterns, as seen from the conductor's point of view.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]] indicates the first beat of the bar, and the [[upbeat]] indicates the beat before the first note of the piece and the last beat of the bar. The instant at which the beat occurs is called the ''[[Wikt:ictus|ictus]]'' (plural: ''{{lang|la|ictūs}}'' or ''ictuses''), and is usually indicated by a sudden (though not necessarily large) click of the wrist or change in baton direction. In some instances, "ictus" is also used to refer to a horizontal plane in which all the ictuses are physically located, such as the top of a [[music stand]] where a baton is tapped at each ictus. The gesture leading up to the ictus is called the "preparation", and the continuous flow of steady beats is called the "{{lang|de|takt}}" (the German word for bar, measure and beat).

If the [[tempo]] is slow or slowing, or if the [[time signature]] is [[Metre (music)#Compound metre|compound]], a conductor will sometimes indicate "subdivisions" of the beats. The conductor can do this by adding a smaller movement in the same direction as the movement for the beat that it belongs to.&lt;!---I can't find the words to make this more clear right now, but I don't think this is clear or understandable to the layman yet---not just quadruple metre---&gt;

Changes to the tempo are indicated by changing the speed of the beat. To carry out and to control a [[rallentando]] (slowing down the pace of the music), a conductor may introduce beat subdivisions.

While some conductors use both hands to indicate the beat, with the left hand mirroring the right, formal education discourages such an approach. The second hand can be used for [[Musical cue|cueing]] the entrances of individual players or sections, and to aid indications of dynamics, phrasing, expression, and other elements.

During an instrumental solo section (or, in an opera orchestra during a vocalist's unaccompanied solo), some conductors stop counting out all the subdivisions and simply tap the baton down once per bar, to aid performers who are counting bars of rests.

There is a difference between the "textbook" definition of where the ictus of a downbeat occurs and the actual [[performance practice]] in professional orchestras. With an abrupt, loud [[Dynamics (music)#Sudden changes and accented notes|sforzando]] chord, a professional orchestra will often play slightly ''after'' the striking of the ictus point of the baton stroke.

===Dynamics===
[[dynamics (music)|Dynamics]] are indicated in various ways. The dynamic may be communicated by the size of the conducting movements, larger shapes representing louder sounds. Changes in dynamic may be signalled with the hand that is not being used to indicate the beat: an upward motion (usually palm-up) indicates a [[crescendo]]; a downward motion (usually palm-down) indicates a [[Dynamics (music)|diminuendo]]. Changing the size of conducting movements frequently results in changes in the character of the music depending upon the circumstances.

Dynamics can be fine-tuned using various gestures: showing one's palm to the performers or leaning away from them may demonstrate a decrease in volume. To adjust the overall balance of the various instruments or voices, these signals can be combined or directed toward a particular section or performer.

===Cueing===
The indication of entries, when a performer or section should begin playing (perhaps after a long period of rests), is called "cueing". A cue must forecast with certainty the exact moment of the coming ictus, so that all the players or singers affected by the cue can begin playing simultaneously. Cueing is most important for cases where a performer or section has not been playing for a lengthy time. Cueing is also helpful in the case of a [[pedal point]] with string players, when a section has been playing the pedal point for a lengthy period; a cue is important to indicate when they should change to a new note. Cueing is achieved by "engaging" the players before their entry (by looking at them) and executing a clear preparation gesture, often directed toward the specific players. An inhalation, which may or may not be a semi-audible "sniff" from the conductor, is a common element in the cueing technique of some conductors. Mere eye contact or a look in the general direction of the players may be sufficient in many instances, as when more than one section of the ensemble enters at the same time. Larger musical events may warrant the use of a larger or more emphatic cue designed to encourage emotion and energy.

===Other musical elements===

Articulation may be indicated by the character of the ictus, ranging from short and sharp for [[staccato]], to long and fluid for [[legato]]. Many conductors change the tension of the hands: strained muscles and rigid movements may correspond to marcato, while relaxed hands and soft movements may correspond to legato or espressivo. Phrasing may be indicated by wide overhead arcs or by a smooth hand motion either forwards or side-to-side. A held note is often indicated by a hand held flat with palm up. The end of a note, called a "cutoff" or "release", may be indicated by a circular motion, the closing of the palm, or the pinching of finger and thumb. A release is usually preceded by a preparation and concluded with a complete stillness.

Conductors&lt;!-- would a reference improve this? Strauss said (light-heartedly) "never look at the brass, it only encourages them", and Karajan sometimes conducted with his eyes closed --&gt; aim to maintain eye contact with the ensemble as much as possible, encouraging eye contact in return and increasing the dialogue between players/singers and conductor. Facial expressions may also be important to demonstrate the character of the music or to encourage the players.

In some cases, such as where there has been little rehearsal time to prepare a piece, a conductor may discreetly indicate how the bars of music will be beat immediately before the start of the movement by holding up their fingers in front of their chest (so only the performers can see). For example, in a {{music|time|4|4}} piece that the conductor will beat "in two" (two ictus points or beats per bar, as if it were {{music|time|2|2}}), the conductor would hold up two fingers in front of his chest.

In most cases, there is a short pause between movements of a symphony, concerto or dance suite. This brief pause gives orchestra or choir members time to turn the pages of their part and ready themselves for the start of the next movement. String players may apply rosin or wipe sweat off their hands with a handkerchief. Reed players may take this time to change to a new reed. In some cases, woodwind or brass players will use the pause to switch to a different instrument (e.g., from trumpet to cornet or from clarinet to E{{music|b}} clarinet). If the conductor wishes to immediately begin one movement after another for musical reasons, this is called [[attacca]]. The conductor will instruct the orchestra members and choristers to write the term in their parts, so that they will be ready to go immediately to the next movement.

==Roles==
[[File:US Navy 060529-N-2383B-123 The U.S. Navy band performs during Memorial Day ceremonies held in the amphitheater of Arlington National Cemetery.jpg|thumb|A military conductor leads the U.S. Navy band during Memorial Day ceremonies held at Arlington National Cemetery.]]
The roles of a conductor vary a great deal between different conducting positions and different ensembles. In some cases, a conductor will also be the [[musical director]] of the symphony, choosing the program for the entire season, including concerts by guest conductors, concerto soloists, pop concerts, and so on. A senior conductor may attend some or all of the [[audition]]s for new members of the orchestra, to ensure that the candidates have the playing style and tone that the conductor prefers and that candidates meet the highest performance standards. Some choral conductors are hired to prepare a choir for several weeks which will subsequently be directed by another conductor. The choral conductor is usually acknowledged for their preparatory work in the concert program.

Some conductors may have a significant public relations role, giving interviews to the local news channel and appearing on television talk shows to promote the upcoming season or particular concerts. On the other hand, a conductor hired to guest conduct a single concert may only have the responsibility of rehearsing the orchestra for several pieces and conducting one or two concerts. While a handful of conductors have become well-known [[celebrity|celebrities]], such as [[Leonard Bernstein]], most are only known within the classical music scene.

==Training and education==
[[Image:David Baker (far left) leading the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra.jpg|thumb|220px|[[David Baker (composer)|David Baker]], a music educator, composer and conductor, (far left) leads the [[Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra]] during the [[NEA Jazz Masters]] awards ceremony and concert in 2008.]]
Classical choral and instrumental conducting have established comprehensive systems of instruction and training. Aspiring conductors can study at colleges, conservatories, and universities. [[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur conducting experience. Universities offer a range of conducting programs, including courses in conducting as part of bachelor's degrees, a small number of Master of Music degrees in conducting, and an even smaller number of [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees in conducting.

In addition, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and training festivals, which give students the opportunity to conduct a wide range of music. Aspiring conductors need to obtain a broad education about the history of music, including the major periods of [[classical music]] and regarding [[music theory]]. Many conductors learn to play a keyboard instrument such as the [[piano]] or the [[pipe organ]], a skill that helps them to be able to analyze symphonies and try out their interpretations before they have access to an orchestra to conduct. Many conductors get experience playing in an orchestra or singing in a choir, an experience which gives them good insights into how orchestras and choirs are conducted and rehearsed.

In 2014, orchestra conductors typically hold a master's degree in music and choir conductors in the US typically hold a bachelor's degree in music.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/mobile/music-directors-and-composers.htm|title=Music Directors and Composers : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelor's degrees (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M) are four-year programs that include conducting lessons, amateur orchestra experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Students do not usually specialize in conducting at the B.Mus. stage; instead, they usually develop general music skills such as singing, playing an orchestral instrument, performing in a choir, playing in orchestra, and playing a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the organ.

Another topic that conducting students study is the languages used in Classical music opera. Orchestral conductors are expected to be able to rehearse and lead choirs in works for orchestra and choir. As such, orchestral conductors need to know the major languages used in choral writing (including French, Italian and Latin, among others) and they must understand the correct diction of these languages in a choral singing context. The opposite is also true: a choral conductor will be expected to rehearse and lead a string orchestra or full orchestra when performing works for choir and orchestra. As such, a choral conductor needs to know how to rehearse and lead instrument sections.

Master of music degrees ([[M.mus.]]) in conducting consist of private conducting lessons, ensemble experience, coaching, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two conducted concerts. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an [[M.Mus.]] or M.M.) is often the required minimum credential for people who wish to become a professor of conducting.

[[Doctor of Musical Arts]] (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in conducting provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination and conducting audition are required. Students perform a number of conducted concerts, including a combination lecture-conducted concert with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework. Students must typically maintain a minimum B average. A DMA in conducting is a [[terminal degree]], and as such, it qualifies the holder to teach in colleges, universities and conservatories. In addition to academic study, another part of the training pathway for many conductors is conducting amateur orchestras, such as [[youth orchestra]]s, school orchestras and community orchestras.

A small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting. These individuals often have achieved renown as instrumental or vocal performers, and they have often undertaken a great deal of training in their area of expertise (instrumental performance or singing). Another way that a small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting is by learning on the job by conducting amateur orchestras, school orchestras, and community orchestras (or the equivalent choral ensembles).

The average salary of conductors in the US in 2014 was $48,180. A 3% growth rate is forecast for conducting jobs from 2014 to 2024, a slower than average growth rate.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5645">{{European patent law}}
In [[European Union law]], and especially in European [[intellectual property]] law, a '''cross-border injunction''' is an [[injunction]] by a [[court]] in one European country, such as for example a court in the [[Netherlands]] forbidding [[intellectual property infringement|infringement]] in several other European countries.

==Background==
The [[Brussels Regime]] instruments are a set of similar legal instruments, based on which jurisdiction (and recognition) is determined. The instruments are the Brussels I Regulations (44/2001 and 1215/2012), Lugano Conventions (1998, 2007) and the Brussels Convention (1968). The conventions together cover the European Union, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Aruba and all French territories. 

A legal basis for cross-border injunctions may amongst others be found in Article 6(1) (most instruments) or Article 8(1) (EU regulation 1215/2012), providing that "a person domiciled in a Member State to also be sued
* where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled,
* provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings".

==Case law==
For a period in the late-1990s, national courts issued cross-border injunctions covering all Brussels regime jurisdictions, but this has been limited by the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ).  

In two cases in July 2006, interpreting Articles 6(1) and 16(4) of the Brussels Convention, the ECJ held that [[European patent]]s are national rights that must be enforced nationally, that it was "unavoidable" that infringements of the same European patent have to be litigated in each relevant national court, even if the lawsuit is against the same group of companies, and that cross-border injunctions are not available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-4/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-4/03, ''Gesellschaft für Antriebstechnik  v Lamellen und Kupplungsbau Beteiligungs KG'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]; [http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-539/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-539/03, ''Roche Nederland BV v Primus'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the court set forth in grounds 41 of case C-539/03 that "Article 6(1) of the Brussels Convention ... does not apply in European patent infringement proceedings involving a number of companies established in various Contracting States in respect of acts committed in one or more of those States even where those companies, which belong to the same group, may have acted in an identical or similar manner in accordance with a common policy elaborated by one of them". In other words, there will be no close connection between claims as required by Article 6(1) if two closely connected companies domiciled in different Contracting States act (infringe) in the same manner.

Also in 2006, the ECJ decided on case C-04/03 (GAT/LUK). The court ruled that "Article 16(4) of the Convention … is to be interpreted as meaning that the rule of exclusive jurisdiction laid down therein concerns all proceedings relating to the registration or validity of a patent, irrespective of whether the issue is raised by way of an action or a plea in objection". As of 2015, Article 16(4) of the Convention corresponds to Article 24(4) of EU regulation 1215/2012. The ruling in case C-04/03 confirms that the courts of each Contracting State have exclusive jurisdiction on validity of patents registered for the territory of that State. Exclusive jurisdiction under Article 22(4) applies irrespective of whether a patent proprietor is sued for revocation or whether an alleged infringer asserts invalidity in inter partes proceedings.

In 2012, nearly six years after its rulings on cases C-04/03 and C-539/03, the ECJ decided on case C-616/10 (Solvay/Honeywell).&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=124996&amp;doclang=EN ''Solvay SA v Honeywell Fluorine Products Europe BV, Honeywell Belgium NV, Honeywell Europe NV'', (European Ct. of Justice 12 July 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that "Article 22(4) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as not precluding, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, the application of Article 31 of that regulation". Since Article 31 is about provisional measures, a court may issue a cross-border injunction where an action aims for such measures. The ruling on case C-539/03 allows for a court to issue cross-border injunctions as provisional measures where companies domiciled in different Contracting States infringe in the same Contracting State.

'''Dan art''' is created by the [[Dan people]] of [[Liberia]] and the [[Ivory Coast]].

==Masks==
{{Main|Dan masks}}

[[Masks]] are the most important art form of the [[Dan people]] of [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Barbara C.|title=Four Dan sculptors : continuity and change|year=1986|publisher=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco|location=San Francisco|isbn=088401049X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are perceived to embody the most powerful of spirit forces, called ''ge ''or ''gle''.

==Feast Ladles==
The ''wunkirmian'' is a large ceremonial [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]] that is carved to honor a particular woman who has distinguished herself through generosity or hospitality. The ''wunkirmian'' is owned by the ''wunkirle'', who is considered the "most hospitable woman" of her village quarter. Traditionally, she chooses her own successor.

Curator Barbara C. Johnson describes the role of the feast ladle in a Dan feast: "At feast times [the wunkirle] marches with her spoon at the head of the line of women from her quarter. Each woman carries a pot of cooked rice or soup. The wunkirle either distributes to the food to the guests, or more frequently uses her ladle to indicate the distribution. At some feasts the wurkirlone of a village compete with each other in generosity by distributing small gifts of peanuts, candy, coins and other foods. The women dance at these times. The wunkirle's prestige may be indicated by her being carried in a hammock through the village by the women of her quarter. They also contribute gifts of their own, but always in the name of the wurkirle."&lt;ref name="Johnson 1986" /&gt;

Besides acting as "emblems of honor," feast ladles have spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Johnson 1986" /&gt; According to the Dan, the ladles embody ''[[Dan people#Religion|du]]'' and contain the power of the ''wunkirle''. The ''wunkirmiam'' is for the woman what the masks are for the men; ''wunkirmiam'' are the woman's chief liaison with the power of the spirit world and the symbol of that connection.&lt;ref name="Fischer and Himmelherber 1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Eberhard|title=The Arts of the Dan in West Africa|year=1984|publisher=Museum Reitberg|location=Zurich|author2=Hans Himmelherber}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like masks, each ''wunkirmian'' is given its own name.

The most common form of the wunkirmian has a handle carved as a human head that displays the characteristic of the ''buangle'' mask: narrow eyes and an oval face. The face on the ladle depicts a specific woman.

==Carved wooden heads on pedestals or staffs==
Janus-faced heads on a staff are reported to be carried by certain masked performers. The two faces looking in opposite directions symbolize the supernatural ability of the gle to see in all directions.&lt;ref name="Himmerheber 1960"&gt;{{cite book|last=Himmelheber|first=Hans|title=Negerkunst und Negerkunstler|year=1960|publisher=Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann|location=Braunscheweig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like feast ladles, these heads are considered powerful spiritual objects that act as receptacles for ''du''. Some are created as portraits of deceased family members that embody that person's spirit.

==Brass Casting==

It is difficult to determine the antiquity of brass casting among the [[Dan people|Dan]], but it is clear that the practice began at least in the early 19th century if not much earlier. Some scholars believe that the We people to the East may have introduced the practice to the Dan.&lt;ref name="Schwab 1947"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwab|first=George|title=Tribes of the Liberian Hinterland|year=1947|publisher=Papers of the Peabody Museum|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brass casting was a practice of Dan blacksmiths. In Dan communities, the blacksmith was always awarded a high status because he was responsible for agricultural tools and weapons.&lt;ref name="Johnson 1986" /&gt; Brass-casting took place at night to protect the object from onlookers. Brass-casters created brass objects using the cire-perdue, or [[lost wax method]].

By the late 1930s, a Liberian government decree outlawing all brass jewelry resulted in an abundance of brass, which brass-casters used to figurative sculptures. Typically, figures stand at about 8 inches tall and carry objects of cultural importance in their hands. The figures were made principally as prestige items.

'''''{{Lang|de|Dantons Tod}}''''' (German for ''Danton's Death'') is an [[opera]] by [[Gottfried von Einem]] to a [[libretto]] by [[Boris Blacher]] and Gottfried von Einem after [[Georg Büchner]]'s 1835 [[Danton's Death|play of the same name]]. Its first performance took place in Salzburg on 6 August 1947. It was revised in 1955.

The successful premiere of Gottfried von Einem's opera ''{{Lang|de|Dantons Tod}}'' at the 1947 [[Salzburg Festival]] and its quick staging by European houses were due to more than the strong drama of Einem's score. This was a first step toward the rehabilitation of German musicians after [[World War II]]; an opera by a young Austrian composer who had not collaborated in the former regime's cultural policies. ''{{Lang|de|Dantons Tod}}'' dramatizes legalized governmental terror, a plague which the world at the time realized had not been eradicated with the end of the war.

==Synopsis==
''Dantons Tod'' was adapted from Georg Büchner's play by von Einem and his teacher, composer Boris Blacher. The [[protagonist]] is Georges Danton, a leader in the French government during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]. When he turned against [[Robespierre]]'s tactics—including terror—he was [[guillotine]]d in April 1794. The opera's first act establishes Danton's confrontation with Robespierre. In the first scene Danton and Camille Desmoulins express their desire for an end of the daily executions to a group of their friends playing cards. Scene two introduces the volatile crowd. Robespierre enters and in an [[aria]] sways the crowd and promises more [[Capital punishment|executions]]. Danton confronts him. After Danton leaves, Robespierre and his colleague Saint-Just decide that he and Camille must be killed. In the last scene of the act Danton announces to Camille and his wife Lucile that he is to be arrested, but he refuses to flee.

Act 2 depicts Danton's trial and death. Two scenes before the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] are separated by one with Danton and Camille in prison. Lucile comes to see Camille; she has lost her reason. In the trial scenes the crowd swings between demanding Danton's death and falling under the spell of his eloquent oratory. At the end, in the [[Place de la Révolution]], the condemned prisoners sing "[[La Marseillaise]]" in counterpoint to the crowd dancing the [[Carmagnole]]. Danton and Camille are guillotined. After the crowd disperses, Lucile enters and sits on the steps of the guillotine. She cries ''Es lebe der Konig'' (Long live the king) and is arrested as the curtain falls.

Von Einem revised the score slightly after the premier, replacing an orchestral [[Prelude (music)|prelude]] with the [[Chord (music)|chords]] that now open the opera, cutting an orchestral passage after Danton's death, and revising the final scene with Lucile. These changes make for a more dramatic beginning and ending and add to a score that deserves more frequent revivals than it has seen to date.

'''Defend Innovation''' is a [[patent]] reform project started by [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) in June 2012. The project initially proposed seven changes to United States's patent system, including shortening the term for [[software patent]]s, requirement to provide the running software code along with patent application, and avoidance of liability of an infringer who independently arrives at the patented invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EFF Launches New Patent Reform Project to Defend Innovation|url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-launches-new-patent-reform-project-defend-innovation|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposals|url=https://defendinnovation.org/proposals|website=Defend Innovation|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222074452/https://defendinnovation.org/proposals|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Since June 2012, the project collected information about the patent system from lawyers, software engineers, court cases, and other sources. The information collected was combined with EFF's own expertise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patents|url=https://www.eff.org/patent|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compiled in a whitepaper named ''How to Fix Our Broken Patent System'', which details the issues surrounding the patent system and proposes solutions that can be implemented by the Congress, Patent Office, and also the software companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defend Innovation|url=https://defendinnovation.org/|website=Defend Innovation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whitepaper is available at the Defend Innovation website.

[[Lucious Lyon]] ([[Terrence Howard]]) is a hip hop mogul,  former drug dealer, and CEO of Empire Entertainment.

===Music===
After finding his lead actors, Lee Daniels set out to find a producer to craft the music for the series. Because he felt his own musical tastes and desires would be a little too dated for the show, Daniels consulted with people he thought could give him a little more insight, his children. At the urging of his son and daughter, Daniels contacted super producer [[Timbaland|Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley]], known for scoring hits with some of pop's biggest artists including [[Missy Elliott]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Nelly Furtado]], [[Ginuwine]] and [[Aaliyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/category-songs_produced_by_timbaland.php|title=SONGS PRODUCED BY TIMBALAND|publisher=Songfacts.com|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As executive music Producer, Timbaland, co-songwriter/producer [[Jim Beanz]], and a team of other musical collaborators took their cues from the writing team, which gave them an idea of where the plot is headed, and craft songs to fit those themes. However, the musical aspect of the series is very reality based, unlike Fox's last musical series, ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', performances come with the organic development of the characters as artists, much like the performances featured in the ABC prime-time country musical drama ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]''.&lt;ref name=EWStack010715&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2015/01/07/empire-fox-lee-daniels/|title='Empire': Inside Fox's ambitious, groundbreaking musical soap|first=Tim|last=Stack|date=January 7, 2015|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alistarrecords.com/track/731526/what-the-dj-spins-from-empire?feature_id=157084&amp;trackship_id=833644 |title=What the DJ Spins (Empire) |publisher=Alistar Records |access-date=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any licensed songs and composer Fil Eisler's score are added after the episodes are filmed. The pilot itself consists of 12 songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/timbaland-gives-lee-daniels-empire-hip-hop-cred-1201393126/|title=Timbaland Gives Lee Daniels' 'Empire' Hip-Hop Cred|first=Melinda|last=Newman|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=January 6, 2015|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia Records]] releases weekly soundtracks of ''Empire'' on the [[iTunes Store]], the same strategy used with ''Glee''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1860247/empire-tv-show-on-fox-empire-soundtrack-music-soars-on-itunes-ratings-break-records/ |title=‘EMPIRE’ TV SHOW ON FOX: ‘EMPIRE’ SOUNDTRACK MUSIC SOARS ON ITUNES, RATINGS BREAK RECORDS |last=Mooney |first=Paula |date=February 20, 2015|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2015, Fox announced that [[Ne-Yo]] and [[J.R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5737">'''Empty books''' or '''blank books''' are [[Novelty item|novelty]] [[book]]s whose title indicates that they treat some serious subject, but whose pages have been [[Intentionally blank page|left intentionally blank]]. A number of such titles have been published as attempts at satire or polemic, to some commercial success. 

The joke is that "nothing" is the answer to whatever the title of the book asserts. In 2017, ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that the trend of publishing political empty books had led to "the noble art of political [[parody]] [descending] into a one-joke turn that avoids words".&lt;ref name="KeanSatire" /&gt; 

==List of empty books==
{{incomplete list|date=March 2018}}
This list includes, in order of publication, empty books that have been published with an [[ISBN]] and have received coverage in reliable sources unrelated to the author. The books may have [[book design]] features such as [[front matter]], a table of contents, page numbers, etc.,  as long as the pages are otherwise blank.

'''Maldivian mythology''' or '''Maldivian folklore''' is the body of myths, tales and anecdotes belonging to the oral tradition of [[Maldivians]]. Even though some of the Maldivian myths were already mentioned briefly by British commissioner in Ceylon [[Harry Charles Purvis Bell|HCP Bell]] towards the end of the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;HCP Bell, ''The Máldive Islands: An account of the Physical Features, History, Inhabitants, Productions and Trade''. Colombo, 1883&lt;/ref&gt; their study and publication were carried out only quite recently by Spanish writer and artist [[Xavier Romero-Frias]], at a time when that ancestral worldview was quickly disappearing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom'', Barcelona 1999, {{ISBN|84-7254-801-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maldives]] lie in the warm equatorial area of the Indian Ocean surrounded by very deep waters. This nation is made up exclusively of coral atolls. There are about 1,200 small flat and sandy islands, but only about 200 of them are inhabited.

The Maldives have been continuously populated for millennia; therefore the folklore of these islands is very ancient.

==Myths of origin==
The main myths of origin are reflecting the dependence of the Maldivians on the [[coconut]] tree and the [[tuna]] fish.

A legend says that the first inhabitants of the Maldives died in great numbers, but a great sorcerer or ''fanḍita'' man made [[coconut tree]]s grow out of the skulls of the buried corpses of the first settlers. Therefore, the coconut tree is said to have an anthropomorphic origin according to Maldive lore.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The coconut tree occupies a central place in the present-day [[Emblem of Maldives|Maldive national emblem]].

The [[skipjack tuna|tuna fish]] is said to have been brought to the Maldivian waters by a mythical seafarer (''maalimi'') called Bodu Niyami Kalēfanu who went close to the Dagas (the mythical tree at the end of the world) to bring this valuable fish.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Myths of extinction==
These myths tell that the end of the Maldives will be a great catastrophe where the islands will be submerged by the surrounding ocean. Similar myths are found in the [[Andaman Islands]] as well as in the [[Nicobar Islands]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==The origin of Malé==
The first settlers in the Maldive Islands were [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] people from the nearest coasts, which are in the Indian Subcontinent and coastal Ceylon. The people of [[Giraavaru (Kaafu Atoll)|Giraavaru]], an island located in [[Malé Atoll]] (now a tourist resort, after its inhabitants were removed) considered the first settlers, claim ancestry from the [[Ancient Tamil country|ancient]] [[Tamil people]].

It is said that Giraavaru fishermen used to go regularly to a certain large sandbank (''finolhu'') at the southern end of their atoll to clean tuna fish after a good catch. Owing to the large amount of tuna fish offal and blood, the waters around that sandbank looked like a big pool of blood (''maa ley gande''h). "Maa" (from the Sanskrit "Maha"), meaning big, and "Lē" meaning blood. Traditionally the first inhabitants of the Maldives, which include the Giraavaru people, didn't have kings. They lived in a simple society and were ruled by local headmen.

One day a prince from the Subcontinent called Koimala arrived to Malé Atoll sailing from the north on a big ship. The people of Giraavaru spotted his vessel from afar and welcomed him. They allowed Prince Koimala to settle on that large sandbank in the midst of the waters tainted with fishblood. Trees were planted on the sandbank and it is said that the first tree that grew on it was the papaya tree. As time went by the local islanders accepted the rule of this Northern Prince. A palace was built and the island was formally named Maa-le [[Malé]], while the nearest island was named Hulhu-le ([[Hulhulé]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Evil spirits==

Most of the popular tales in Maldives are about evil spirits and their interaction with the islanders. These stories contain always a lesson in some form or the other. Certain actions became necessary in order to avoid trouble with the spirit world. These patterns of behaviour, like the importance of keeping a secret, as well as the avoidance of certain areas of the island and of inauspicious times, were an essential component of the ancient popular spirituality.&lt;ref name="NIAS Press"&gt;Romero-Frias, Xavier (2012) ''Folk tales of the Maldives'', [http://www.niaspress.dk/catalogue2011/Catalogue_2012.pdf NIAS Press], {{ISBN|978-87-7694-104-8}}, {{ISBN|978-87-7694-105-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maldivian spirits can take human form, even if it is not known whether they have a human origin or not. While in human shape, the malevolence of those spirits is often masked by beauty and youth. Certain Maldivian evil spirits (handi) have the appearance of charming, beautiful women. These stories about female spirits have their origin in the [[Ancient Dravidian culture|Ancient Dravidian]] [[Village Goddess]] worship and they point to the ethnic origin of the Maldive people.&lt;ref name="NIAS Press"/&gt;
 
Other evil spirits which are the subject of many folk stories in the Maldives (''furēta'') are crude monsters coming from the ocean waters. The tales about sea monsters are part of the local cultural background, which is characterized by the oceanic environment in which, along the millennia, the Maldivian culture developed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Don Hiyala and Alifulhu==
Among the stories in which the spirit and sorcery theme are not essential, the most significant is perhaps '''Don Hiyalā and Alifulhu''', the story of an extraordinarily beautiful woman, or ''faiiymini'' as called by Maldivians, who gets kidnapped from her husband Alifulhu by a villainous king. The lovers reunite at the end of the story, however, their reunion is short lived as they are soon pursued by the King's henchmen. Instead of being captured by the King's men again, Dhonhiyala chooses to commit suicide, and Ali Fulhu follows suit.

==Local fauna==
[[File:XRF-maakana's treachery.jpg|thumb|right|The treachery of Maakana. Illustration of a Maldivian folktale.]]
Folktales where fishes, crabs and seabirds are the heroes, like the tales about Mākana, Findana, Kalhubondage Diye, Fandiyaaru Kakuni, or Don Mohonaai Miyaru, introduce us to the world of the local fauna of the Maldive Atolls, where land animals are very few. Many of these are tales for children and some are still quite popular. 
Although most of the stories of this type are original, a few are foreign tales or fables which have been adapted to the island context through local storytellers or by Maldivian learned men, like the late [[Muhammad Jameel Didi|Muhammad Jamil]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Mighty sorcerers==
In the ancestral oral literature of Maldivians, the sorcerer, or learned man of the island who knew the magic arts. Magic or sorcery is known in Maldives as ''fanḍita''.

The Maldivian sorcerer or ''fanḍita veriyaa'' is always portrayed in the folklore of Maldivians as a hero. Only he knew how to appease the spirits that terrified the average island folk on a daily (or better nightly) basis. Some recent stories tend to cast the sorcerer in the role of a villain, but these are totally disconnected from the ancestral Maldive lore.&lt;ref name="NIAS Press"/&gt;

==The conversion to Islam==
{{Main|History_of_the_Maldives#Introduction_of_Islam}}
According to the well-known Moroccan traveler [[Ibn Batuta]], the person responsible for converting the Maldivians to Islam as a [[Sunni]] Muslim visitor named Abu al Barakat ul Barbari. He subdued [[Mariamman|Ranna Maari]], a demon coming from the sea and convinced the King to become a Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Battuta, Travels in Asia and Africa 1325-1354, tr. and ed. H. A. R. Gibb (London: Broadway House, 1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the more reliable local historical chronicles, ''Raadavalhi'' and ''Taarikh'', mention that this saint was actually a Persian from the city of [[Tabriz]], called Yusuf Shamsud-din. He is also locally known as Tabrīzugefānu.&lt;ref&gt;[[HCP Bell]], ''The Máldive Islands. Monograph on the History, Archæology, and Epigraphy'' with W. L. De Silva, Colombo 1940&lt;/ref&gt;
The much venerated tomb of this saint now stands opposite the grounds of Hukuru Miski, in the centre of Malé, the capital.

==Local characters==
Stories about local characters, like '''Rōnu Eduru''', '''Kuda Tuttu Didi''', '''Kalhukuru''' or '''Naalaafushi Fagīru''' (the poor man of [[Naalaafushi]]) give us a glimpse on the way of life in the Maldives when the archipelago was a kingdom, and Malé, the capital, was a quaint, laid back place. In those stories we learn much about the life in the court in Malé and about the mutual interaction between the Radun (the king of Maldives) and his subjects.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Modern variants==
Since there are a great number of islands in the Maldives, many folkstories have different versions according to the particular island and the storyteller in question. 
In recent times some stories have been abridged by contemporary Maldivian writers, like [[Abdulla Sadiq]] or Ahumadu Sharīfu (Maradū) because of their extreme length.&lt;ref name="NIAS Press"/&gt;
 
Other stories ('''Karukuru''', '''Telabagudi''' and the '''Māmeli''' tales) have been sanitized, because there was much casual reference to defecation and bodily fluids, particularly in ancient folk-stories from the outer atolls, where local values found this acceptable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==The Koimala myth==
'''Koimala Siri Mahaabarana Mahaa Radun''' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: ކޮއިމަލާ ސިރީ މަހާބަރަނަ މަހާ ރަދުން) or '''Koimala''' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: ކޮއިމަލާ literally "flower lad") or '''Koimala Kalo''' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: ކޮއިމަލާ ކަލޯ, literally "Lord Koimala") is a myth about the first [[List of Sultans of the Maldives|king]] of all the [[Maldive Islands]].
Some versions of the Koimala myth claim that it refers to the first ruler of the Maldives after the [[conversion to Islam]], also known as ''Dharumavantha rasgefaanu'', who ruled from 1117 to 1141. It is believed that he was also the first king from the [[Lunar Dynasty|House of Theemuge]] and the Lunar Dynasty. By other accounts he was the fourth king of the Lunar Dynastry founded by King Balaadeettiya as the Soma Vansa Kingdom; although until Koimala the house only ruled over part of the Maldives.

However, ascribing the legend to the first Islamic ruler does not explain who built the large [[Buddhist]] monuments that are present in many inhabited islands and that were built in the first millennium AD.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It also leaves without explaining the existence of an ancient kingly dynasty in the Maldives already before the conversion, as the 12th century correspondence from the king to the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangumanun]], or community of Buddhist monks, in Sathudhuvumati ([[Haddummati Atoll]]) via copper plates proves.&lt;ref&gt;H.A. Maniku &amp; G.D. Wijayawardhana, ''Isdhoo Loamaafaanu''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maldivian Folklore, Koimala was a prince from the [[Indian subcontinent]] who arrived in [[Malé Atoll]]. The people of [[Giraavaru people|Giraavaru]] spotted his vessel from afar and welcomed him. They allowed Prince Koimala to settle on that large sandbank in the midst of the waters tainted with fishblood. Trees were planted on the sandbank and it is said that the first tree that grew on it was the [[papaya]] tree. As time went by the local islanders accepted the rule of this northern prince. A palace was built and the island was formally named Maa-le ([[Malé]]), while the nearest island was named Hulhu-le ([[Hulhulé Island|Hulhulé]]). Since then Malé has been the seat of the Maldivian crown and now the head of state.

A different account claims Koimala to be a [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] prince of royal birth from [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. The prince is said to have married the Ceylon king's daughter and made a voyage with her in two vessels from Ceylon. Reaching the Maldives they were becalmed, and rested a while at [[Rasgetheemu (Raa Atoll)|''Rasgetheemu'']] island (meaning the King's Island) in [[Northern Maalhosmadulhu Atoll]]. The Maldive Islanders who were then [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], learning that the two chief visitors were of royal descent from the Buddhist kingdom of Ceylon, invited them to remain and ultimately proclaimed Koimala their king at Rasgetheemu. The new king and his spouse migrated to Malé and settled there with the consent of the [[Indigenous peoples|aborigines]] of Giraavaru (See [[Giraavaru people]]) - then the most important community of Malé Atoll. Until then the Maldives is thought to have been ruled by different [[matriarchy|matriarchies]] in different atolls.

After the settlement in Male', two vessels were dispatched to bring more people of his race to populate Male'. It wasn't tradition for the Giraavaru and perhaps other aboriginal people of the Maldives to marry outside their community.

It is not clear, how much of this legend is true. Although he might have been the first king of the whole of Maldives, the story of a prince might actually be a corruption of the stories of King [[Soorudasaruna-Adeettiya]] and King [[Balaadeettiya]]- both exiled princes from the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] Kingdom of India who founded the Solar and Lunar Dynastries of the Maldives. According to this source (''Kitab fi Athaari Meedoo el-Qadimiyyeh'' by Allama Ahmed Shihabuddine relating from The ''Maapanansa'' copper plates), Koimala or Siri Mahaabarana, the son of King Siri Bovana Aananda was the fourth king of the Lunar Dynastry and uncle to [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|King Dhovemi]] (Siri Bavana-adiththa) the first Sultan (Muslim king) of the Maldives.

Koimala is said to have become the King of the 14 [[atolls]] and two thousand islands of the ''Dheeva Mahal''. His kingdom was referred to as being ''Malikaddu dhemedhu''- or 'all that lies between the [[Minicoy island|Maliku]] and [[Seenu Atoll|Addu]]. He fought against the Raja Dada's (or the forces of the Tamil emperor [[Raja Raja Chola I]] of the [[Chola empire]]) Indians to claim the two northern most atolls for the newly formed Maldivian kingdom. 
Koimala was succeeded by his nephew [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|Dhovemi Kalaminja]] in 1141.

'''''Gladiator''''' is a 2000 [[Epic film|epic]] [[Historical period drama|historical drama film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and written by [[David Franzoni]], [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], and [[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]]. The film was jointly produced and released by [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks Pictures]] and [[Universal Pictures]]. It stars [[Russell Crowe]], [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Connie Nielsen]], [[Ralf Möller]], [[Oliver Reed]] (in his final role), [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Derek Jacobi]], [[John Shrapnel]], and [[Richard Harris]]. Crowe portrays [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when [[Commodus]], the ambitious son of Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.

Inspired by [[Daniel P. Mannix]]'s 1958 novel ''Those About to Die,'' the film's script, initially written by Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks and Ridley Scott signed on to direct the film. Principal photography began in January 1999, before the script was completed, and wrapped up in May of that year, with the scenes of Ancient Rome shot over a period of nineteen weeks in [[Fort Ricasoli]], Malta. The film's computer-generated imagery effects were created by British post-production company [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]].

''Gladiator'' was released in the United States on May 5, 2000 and received favorable reviews from critics; praise was given to the performances of Crowe and Phoenix, Scott's direction, visuals, action sequences, musical score, and the costume and set designs while criticism was aimed at the script. The film grossed $457 million worldwide, making it the [[2000 in film|second highest-grossing film of 2000]]. The film won multiple awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Crowe and three other [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] at the [[73rd Academy Awards]] and also won Best Picture at the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]], [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]], and [[Producers Guild of America]]. It has also been credited with rekindling interest in entertainment centered around [[Culture of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]], such as the TV series [[Rome TV series|''Rome'']].

==Plot==
In AD 180, [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return to his home after he leads the [[Roman army]] to victory against the Germanic tribes near [[Vindobona]] on the [[Limes Germanicus]]. Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] tells Maximus that his own son, [[Commodus]], is unfit to rule, and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to help save [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] from corruption. Commodus, upon hearing this, murders his father.

Commodus announces he is the new Emperor and asks Maximus for his loyalty, but the general refuses. Maximus is arrested by the [[Praetorian Guard|Praetorian Guards]] and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and rides for his home near [[Trujillo, Cáceres|Trujillo]], where he finds his family murdered. Maximus buries his wife and son; then collapses. He is found by slavers who take him to the Roman province of [[Zuccabar|Zucchabar]], where he is sold to a [[Gladiator#Schools and training|gladiator trainer]] named Proximo.

Although reluctant at first, Maximus fights in local tournaments and befriends two other gladiators: Juba, a [[Numidia]]n; and Hagen, a German. His military skills help him win matches and gain recognition from other gladiators and the crowd. Proximo reveals that he was once a gladiator, and advises Maximus that he must "win the crowd" to win his freedom. Proximo takes his gladiators to fight in Rome's [[Colosseum]], because Commodus has organized 150 days of games.

Disguised by a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum as a [[Sacred Band of Carthage|Carthaginian]] in a re-enactment of the [[Battle of Zama]]. Unexpectedly, Maximus leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to show himself and give his name; Maximus reveals himself and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and the Praetorian Guard is held back from striking them down.

Maximus's next fight is a victory against a legendary undefeated gladiator. Commodus orders Maximus to kill the gladiator, but Maximus spares his opponent's life; he is called "Maximus the Merciful" by the crowd. Angered at this outcome, Commodus taunts Maximus about his family's deaths, but Maximus turns and walks away.

Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. [[Lucilla]], Commodus's sister; Gracchus, an influential [[Senate of the Roman Empire|senator]]; and Maximus meet secretly. Maximus will escape Rome, join his soldiers, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the [[Roman Senate]]. Commodus learns of the plot by threatening Lucilla, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where Cicero is killed.

In an effort to win back the people's approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus, whom the Praetorian Guard refuse to aid. Commodus then produces a hidden knife, which Maximus drives into his throat, killing him. Maximus succumbs to his wounds. Before he dies, he asks for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated. Maximus's friends and allies honor him as "a soldier of Rome", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena, leaving the dead Commodus behind.

Juba visits the Colosseum at night and buries the figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died. Juba promises to see Maximus again, "but not yet".

==Production==

===Screenplay===
''Gladiator'' was based on an original pitch by [[David Franzoni]], who wrote the first draft.&lt;ref name=Stax&gt;{{Citation|title=The Stax Report's ''Five Scribes'' Edition|author=Stax|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/356/356712p1.html|publisher=IGN|date=April 4, 2002|accessdate=February 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509024040/http://movies.ign.com/articles/356/356712p1.html|archive-date=2009-05-09|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franzoni was given a three-picture deal with [[DreamWorks]] as writer and co-producer on the strength of his previous work, [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', which helped establish the reputation of DreamWorks. Not a classical scholar, Franzoni was inspired by [[Daniel P. Mannix]]'s 1958 novel ''Those About to Die,'' and he chose to base his story on Commodus after reading the ''[[Augustan History]]''. In Franzoni's first draft, dated April 4, 1998, he named his protagonist [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]], a wrestler who, according to the ancient sources [[Herodian]] and [[Cassius Dio]], strangled Emperor Commodus to death.&lt;ref name="FilmHistoryWinkler"&gt;{{Citation|title=Gladiator: Film and History|editor=Martin M. Winkler|chapter=Gladiator from Screenplay to Screen|author=Jon Solomon|publisher=Blackwell Publishing |date=April 1, 2004|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Several dead men and various scattered weapons are located in a large arena. Near the center of the image is a man wearing armor standing in the middle of an arena looking up at a large crowd. The man has his right foot on the throat of an injured man who is reaching towards the crowd. Members of the crowd are indicating a "thumbs down" gesture. The arena is adorned with marble, columns, flags, and statues.|''[[Pollice Verso (Gérôme)|Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down)]]'' by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], the 19th-century painting that inspired Ridley Scott to tackle the project]]

[[Ridley Scott]] was approached by producers [[Walter Parkes|Walter F. Parkes]] and [[Douglas Wick]]. They showed him a copy of [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]'s 1872 painting entitled ''[[Pollice Verso (Gérôme)|Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down)]]''.&lt;ref name="Landau 22"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott was enticed by filming the world of Ancient Rome. However, Scott felt Franzoni's dialogue was too "on the nose" (lacking subtlety) and hired [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]] to rewrite the script to his liking. Logan rewrote much of the first act and made the decision to kill off Maximus's family to increase the character's motivation.&lt;ref name="scribes"&gt;{{cite video|title=Tales of the Scribes: Story Development|medium=DVD|publisher=Universal|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell Crowe]] describes being eager for the role as pitched by Walter F. Parkes, in his interview for ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'': "They said, 'It's a 100-million-dollar film. You're being directed by Ridley Scott. You play a Roman General.' I've always been a big fan of Ridley's."&lt;ref name="kaspinet.com"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Inside the Actors Studio With Russell Crowe (transcript) |url=http://www.kaspinet.com/Inside_The_Actors_Studio-Transcript.htm |date=January 4, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324015003/http://www.kaspinet.com/Inside_The_Actors_Studio-Transcript.htm |medium=Television production |archive-date=March 24, 2015 |website=kaspinet.com |accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With two weeks to go before filming, the actors complained of problems with the script. [[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]] was brought to [[Shepperton Studios]] to make Maximus a more sensitive character.  Nicholson reworked Maximus' friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife thread in the film, saying "he did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody."&lt;ref name="scribes"/&gt;

The screenplay faced many rewrites and revisions. Crowe allegedly questioned every aspect of the evolving script and strode off the set when he did not get answers. According to a DreamWorks executive, "(Russell Crowe) tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot. You know the big line in the trailer, 'In this life or the next, I will have my vengeance'? At first he absolutely refused to say it."&lt;ref name="Corliss2000"&gt;{{Citation|title=The Empire Strikes Back|first1=Richard|last1=Corliss|first2=Jeffrey|last2=Ressner|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,996847-2,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=May 8, 2000|accessdate=February 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508000727/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,996847-2,00.html|archive-date=2009-05-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell Crowe described the script situation: "I read the script and it was substantially underdone. Even the character didn't exist on the pages. And that set about a long process, that's probably the first time that I've been in a situation where the script wasn't a complete done deal. We actually started shooting with about 32 pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks."&lt;ref name="kaspinet.com"/&gt;

Of the writing and filming process, Crowe added, "Possibly, a lot of the stuff that I have to deal with now in terms of my quote unquote volatility has to do with that experience. Here was a situation where we got to Morocco with a crew of 200 and a cast of a 100 or whatever, and I didn't have anything to learn. I actually didn't know what the scenes were gonna be. We had, I think, one American writer working on it, one English writer working on it, and of course a group of producers who were also adding their ideas, and then Ridley himself; and then, on the occasion where Ridley would say, 'Look, this is the structure for it – what are you gonna say in that?' So then I'd be doing my own stuff, as well. And this is how things like, 'Strength and honor,' came up. This is how things like, 'At my signal, unleash hell,' came up. The name Maximus Decimus Meridius, it just flowed well."&lt;ref name="kaspinet.com"/&gt;

Maximus' habit of rubbing soil before each fight references the attachment and affection to his former life as a farmer.&lt;ref name="cyrino"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.uml.edu/Ethan_Spanier/Teaching/documents/CyrinoGaldiator.pdf|title=Gladiator and Contemporary American Society|publisher=University of Massachusetts Lowell|page=141|author=Monica S.

===Pre-production===
In preparation for filming, Scott spent several months developing storyboards to develop the framework of the plot.&lt;ref name="Landau 34"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over six weeks, production members scouted various locations within the extent of the Roman Empire before its collapse, including Italy, France, North Africa, and England.&lt;ref name="Landau 61"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the film's props, sets, and costumes were manufactured by crew members due to high costs and unavailability of the items.&lt;ref name="Landau 66"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred suits of steel armour and 550 suits in polyurethane were made by Rod Vass and his company Armordillo. The unique sprayed-polyurethane system was developed by Armordillo and pioneered for this production. Over a three-month period, 27,500 component pieces of armor were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.themovienetwork.com/article/motw-sic-semper-illuminatus-five-fun-facts-about-gladiator| title=MOTW: Sic Semper Illuminatus: Five Fun Facts about "Gladiator"| newspaper=Themovienetwork.com| date=February 26, 2013 | author=| accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
The film was shot in three main locations between January and May 1999. The opening battle scenes in the forests of Germania were shot in three weeks in the [[Bourne Wood]]s, near [[Farnham]], [[Surrey]], in England.&lt;ref name="Landau 62"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Scott learned that the [[Forestry Commission]] planned to remove a section of the forest, he persuaded them to allow the battle scene to be shot there and burn it down.&lt;ref name="Landau 68"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson used multiple cameras filming at various frame rates and a [[Rotary disc shutter|45-degree shutter]], creating [[stop motion]] effects in the action sequences, similar to techniques used for the battle sequences of ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="Bankston2000"&gt;{{Citation|last=Bankston|first=Douglas|date=May 2000|title=Death or Glory|journal=American Cinematographer|publisher=American Society of Cinematographers|url=http://www.ascmag.com/magazine/may00/pg1.htm|access-date=2009-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508102010/http://www.ascmag.com/magazine/may00/pg1.htm|archive-date=2009-05-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the scenes of slavery, desert travel, and gladiatorial training school were shot in [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco, just south of the Atlas Mountains over a further three weeks.&lt;ref name="Landau 63"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; To construct the arena where Maximus has his first fights, the crew used basic materials and local building techniques to manufacture the 30,000-seat mud brick arena.&lt;ref name="Landau 73"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the scenes of Ancient Rome were shot over a period of nineteen weeks in [[Fort Ricasoli]], Malta.&lt;ref name=Kodak_inCamera&gt;{{Citation|title=Gory glory in the Colosseum|url=http://www.kodak.com/US/en/motion/newsletters/inCamera/july2000/gladiator.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209185727/http://www.kodak.com/US/en/motion/newsletters/inCamera/july2000/gladiator.shtml|archivedate=2005-02-09|publisher=Kodak: In Camera|date=July 2000|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mfc"&gt;{{Citation |title=Malta Film Commission&amp;nbsp;– Backlots |url=http://mfc.com.mt/page.asp?p=14388&amp;l=1 |publisher=Malta Film Commission |accessdate=28 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729093604/http://mfc.com.mt/page.asp?p=14388&amp;l=1 |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Malta, a replica of about one-third of Rome's Colosseum was built, to a height of 52 feet (15.8 meters), mostly from plaster and plywood (the other two-thirds and remaining height were added digitally).&lt;ref name="Landau 89"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replica took several months to build and cost an estimated $1 million.&lt;ref name="Winkler p130"&gt;Winkler, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse side of the complex supplied a rich assortment of Ancient Roman street furniture, [[colonnade]]s, [[gate]]s, [[statue|statuary]], and marketplaces for other filming requirements. The complex was serviced by tented "costume villages" that had changing rooms, storage, armorers, and other facilities.&lt;ref name=Kodak_inCamera/&gt; The rest of the Colosseum was created in [[computer-generated imagery]] using set-design blueprints and textures referenced from live action, and rendered in three layers to provide lighting flexibility for compositing in [[Autodesk Media and Entertainment|Flame]] and [[Autodesk Media and Entertainment|Inferno]] software.&lt;ref name=TheMill&gt;{{Citation|last=Bath|first=Matthew|title=The Mill|url=http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/creative-lifestyle/mill/|publisher=Digit Magazine|date=October 25, 2004|accessdate=February 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404213613/http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/creative-lifestyle/mill/|archive-date=2015-04-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-production===
[[File:cityrome.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Men in white robes with the Colosseum in the background.|Several scenes included extensive use of computer-generated imagery shots for views of Rome.]]
British post-production company [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]] was responsible for much of the computer-generated imagery effects that were added after filming. The company was responsible for such tricks as compositing real tigers filmed on [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] into the fight sequences, and adding smoke trails and extending the flight paths of the opening scene's salvo of flaming arrows to get around regulations on how far they could be shot during filming. They also used 2,000 live actors to create a computer-generated crowd of 35,000 virtual actors that had to look believable and react to fight scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Landau|first1=Diana|last2=Parkes|first2=Walter|last3=Logan|first3=John|last4=Scott|first4=Ridley|title=Gladiator: The Making of the Ridley Scott Epic|year=2000|publisher=Newmarket Press|isbn=1-55704-428-7|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mill accomplished this by shooting live actors at different angles giving various performances, and then mapping them onto cards, with [[motion capture|motion-capture tools]] used to track their movements for three-dimensional compositing.&lt;ref name=TheMill/&gt; The Mill created over 90 visual effects shots, comprising approximately nine minutes of the film's running time.&lt;ref name="Landau 122"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unexpected post-production job was caused by the death of [[Oliver Reed]] of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] during the filming in Malta, before all his scenes had been shot. The Mill created a digital [[body double]] for the remaining scenes involving his character Proximo&lt;ref name=TheMill/&gt; by photographing a live action body-double in the shadows and by mapping a three-dimensional computer-generated imagery mask of Reed's face to the remaining scenes during production at an estimated cost of $3.2 million for two minutes of additional footage.&lt;ref name="Landau 123"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ORtwo"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2000-04-12#celeb4|title=Oliver Reed Resurrected On Screen|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|date=April 12, 2000|accessdate=February 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110052505/http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2000-04-12#celeb4|archive-date=2010-01-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual effects supervisor [[John Nelson (visual effects artist)|John Nelson]] reflected on the decision to include the additional footage: "What we did was small compared to our other tasks on the film. What Oliver did was much greater. He gave an inspiring, moving performance. All we did was help him finish it."&lt;ref name="Landau 123"/&gt; The film is dedicated to Reed's memory.&lt;ref name="Schwartz p142"&gt;Schwartz, p.142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical authenticity==

===Development===
The film is loosely based on real events that occurred within the [[Roman Empire]] in the latter half of the 2nd century AD. As Ridley Scott wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film, he hired several historians as advisors. Nevertheless, some deviations from historical fact were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. Scott also stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like, some historical facts were "too unbelievable" to include. For instance in an early version of the script, gladiators would have been carrying out [[Testimonial|product endorsements]] in the arena; while this would have been historically accurate, it was not filmed for fear that audiences would think it anachronistic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/035/035289p1.html Not Such a Wonderful Life: A Look at History in Gladiator] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627225537/http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/035/035289p1.html |date=2008-06-27 }} IGN movies February 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one historical advisor resigned due to these changes. Another asked not to be mentioned in the credits (though it was stated in the director's commentary that he constantly asked, "where is the proof that certain things were exactly like they say?"). Historian Allen Ward of the University of Connecticut believed that historical accuracy would not have made ''Gladiator'' less interesting or exciting, stating "creative artists need to be granted some poetic license, but that should not be a permit for the wholesale disregard of facts in historical fiction".&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite web|last =Ward|first =Allen|date =May 2001|title =The Movie "Gladiator" in Historical Perspective|work =[[University of Connecticut]]|url =http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/showcase/wardgladiator1.html|accessdate =December 8, 2010|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130513100700/http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/showcase/wardgladiator1.html|archive-date =2013-05-13|dead-url =no|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GladFilmH"&gt;{{Citation|last=Winkler|first=Martin |title=Gladiator Film and History|year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=1-4051-1042-2|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictionalization===
*[[Marcus Aurelius]] was not murdered by his son Commodus; he died at [[Vindobona]] (modern [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]]) in 180 AD from the [[Antonine Plague]]. The epidemic, believed to be either [[smallpox]] or [[measles]], swept the Roman Empire during the reign of Marcus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Roman Empire: From Severus to Constantine| author=Patricia Southern| year=2001| p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There is no indication Marcus Aurelius wished to return the Empire to a [[Roman Republic|republican]] form of government, as depicted in the film. Moreover, he shared the rule of the Empire with Commodus for three years before his own death.

*In the film, [[Lucilla]] is portrayed as a lone widow of [[Lucius Verus]] with one son, also named Lucius Verus. While Lucilla was the widow of Verus and also had a son by that name, their son died young, long before the reign of Commodus, and Lucilla remarried [[Claudius Pompeianus]] soon after Verus' death.&lt;ref name="Peacock"&gt;Peacock, Phoebe B., Library of Congress, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/lverus.htm Lucius Verus (161–169 A.D.)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328095946/http://www.roman-emperors.org/lverus.htm |date=2018-03-28 }}, roman-emperors.org.

The film omits Lucilla's other two children with Verus, Lucilla Plautia and Aurelia Lucilla.&lt;ref name="Peacock"/&gt;
*Lucilla was implicated in a plot to assassinate her brother in 182 AD, along with her husband Pompeianus and several others. She was first exiled to the island of [[Capri]] by her brother, then executed on his orders later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Roman Emperors| author=Michael Grant| year=1985| p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The character of Maximus had a similar career (and personality traits as documented by [[Herodian]]) to [[Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus|Claudius Pompeianus]] (a [[Syria]]n) who married [[Marcus Aurelius]]' daughter [[Lucilla]] following the death of [[Lucius Verus]]. It is believed Aurelius may have wanted Pompeianus to succeed him as [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] in preference to Commodus but was turned down. Pompeianus had no part in any of the many plots against Commodus. He was not depicted in the film.&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt;
*In the film the character Antonius Proximo claims "the wise" Marcus Aurelius banned gladiatorial games in Rome forcing him to move to [[Mauretania]]. The real Aurelius did ban the games, but only in [[Antioch]] as punishment for the city's support of the usurper [[Avidius Cassius]]. No games were ever banned in Rome. However, when the Emperor started conscripting gladiators into the legions, the resulting shortage in fighters allowed ''[[Gladiator#Schools and training|lanistae]]'' such as Proximo to make "windfall" profits through increased charges for their services.&lt;ref name="Winkler"/&gt;
*In real life, the death of Commodus did not result in a peace for Rome, nor a return to the Roman Republic. Rather, it ushered in a chaotic and bloody power struggle that culminated in the [[Year of the Five Emperors]] of AD 193. According to Herodian, the people of Rome were overjoyed at the news of Commodus dying, although they feared that the praetorians would not accept the new emperor [[Pertinax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Echols|first1=Edward|title=Herodian 2.2 - Livius|url=http://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodian-s-roman-history/herodian-2.2/|website=Livius, Articles on ancient history|accessdate=13 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214045549/http://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodian-s-roman-history/herodian-2.2/|archive-date=2017-02-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anachronisms===
Costumes in the film are rarely historically correct. Some of the soldiers wear [[Galea (helmet)|fantasy helmets]]. The bands wrapped around their lower arms were rarely worn. Their appearance is the product of historical movies always depicting peoples of antiquity wearing such bands. Although the film is set within the 2nd century AD, the [[Lorica segmentata|Imperial Gallic armor]] and the [[Imperial helmet#Imperial Gallic|helmets]] worn by the legionaries are from AD 75, a century earlier. This was superseded by [[Imperial helmet#Imperial Italic|new design]]s in AD 100. The legions' [[Aquilifer|standard bearers (Aquilifer)]], [[centurion]]s, [[Roman cavalry|mounted forces]], and [[auxilia]]ries would have worn scale armour, [[lorica squamata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kelly &amp; Robert Douglas Smith|last=DeVries|title=Medieval Weapons: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2007|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jdcrsCOB-VcC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q=Lorica%20squamata 24–27]|isbn=9781851095261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid1/student_projects97/armour/scale/scale.html|title=Scale (Lorica Squamata)|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=20 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620213422/http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid1/student_projects97/armour/scale/scale.html|archive-date=2015-06-20|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic tribes are dressed in clothes from the Stone Age period.&lt;ref&gt;Junkelmann, Marcus in ''Hollywoods Traum von Rom'' (Hollywood's Dream of Rome), p. 117, 120 and 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman cavalry]] are shown using [[stirrup]]s. This is anachronistic in that the horse-mounted forces of the [[Roman army]] used a two-horned saddle, without stirrups. Stirrups were only employed in filming for safety reasons because of the additional training and skill required to ride with a Roman saddle.&lt;ref name="Winkler"&gt;{{cite book | last = Winkler | first = Martin M. | year = 2004 | title = Gladiator: film and history | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location =  | isbn = 1-4051-1042-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movie Nitpick: Gladiator|url=http://www.nitpickers.com/movies/nitpick.cgi?np=16281|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040107011248/http://www.nitpickers.com/movies/nitpick.cgi?np=16281|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-01-07|publisher=The Nitpickers Site|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catapult]]s and [[ballista]]e would not have been used in a forest. They were reserved primarily for [[siege]]s and were rarely used in open battles.&lt;ref name="Winkler"/&gt;

The Praetorian Guards seen in the film are all wearing black uniforms. No historical evidence supports that. On campaign they usually wore standard legionary equipment with some unique decorative elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Praetorian Guard (Elite)|last=Rankov|first=Boris|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bird's eye view of Rome when the city is introduced for the first time there are several buildings that did not exist at the time of ''Gladiator''. For example, the [[Basilica of Maxentius|Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine]] is quite prominent; however, it was not completed until AD 312.

==Influences==
The film's plot was influenced by two 1960s [[Hollywood]] films of the [[Peplum film genre|sword-and-sandal]] genre, ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Scholia Reviews ns 14 (2005) 11.|author=Martin M. Winkler|url=http://www.classics.und.ac.za/reviews/05-11win.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040825235238/http://www.classics.und.ac.za/reviews/05-11win.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 25, 2004|publisher=|date=June 23, 2002|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shares several plot points with ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'', which tells the story of Livius, who, like Maximus in ''Gladiator,'' is Marcus Aurelius's intended successor. Livius is in love with Lucilla and seeks to marry her while Maximus, who is happily married, was formerly in love with her. Both films portray the death of Marcus Aurelius as an assassination. In ''Fall of the Roman Empire'' a group of conspirators independent of Commodus, hoping to profit from Commodus's accession, arrange for Marcus Aurelius to be poisoned; in ''Gladiator'' Commodus himself murders his father by smothering him. In the course of ''Fall of the Roman Empire'' Commodus unsuccessfully seeks to win Livius over to his vision of empire in contrast to that of his father, but continues to employ him notwithstanding; in ''Gladiator'', when Commodus fails to secure Maximus's allegiance, he executes Maximus's wife and son and tries unsuccessfully to execute him. Livius in ''Fall of the Roman Empire'' and Maximus in ''Gladiator'' kill Commodus in single combat, Livius to save Lucilla and Maximus to avenge the murder of his wife and son, and both do it for the greater good of Rome.

Scott cited ''Spartacus'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' as influences on the film: "These movies were part of my cinema-going youth. But at the dawn of the new millennium, I thought this might be the ideal time to revisit what may have been the most important period of the last two thousand years&amp;nbsp;– if not all recorded history&amp;nbsp;– the apex and beginning of the decline of the greatest military and political power the world has ever known."&lt;ref name="Landau 28"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spartacus'' provides the film's gladiatorial motif, as well as the character of Senator Gracchus, a fictitious senator (bearing the name of a [[Gracchi|pair of revolutionary]] [[Tribune]]s from the 2nd century BC) who in both films is an elder statesman of [[ancient Rome]] attempting to preserve the ancient rights of the Roman Senate in the face of an ambitious [[Autocracy|autocrat]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] in ''Spartacus'' and Commodus in ''Gladiator.'' Both actors who played Gracchus (in ''Spartacus'' and ''Gladiator''), played [[Claudius]] in previous films&amp;nbsp;– [[Charles Laughton]] of ''Spartacus'' played Claudius in the unfinished 1937 film ''[[I, Claudius (film)|I, Claudius]]'' and Sir [[Derek Jacobi]] of ''Gladiator'', played Claudius in [[I, Claudius (TV series)|the 1976 BBC adaptation]]. Both films also share a specific set piece, wherein a gladiator (Maximus here, [[Woody Strode]]'s Draba in ''Spartacus'') throws his weapon into a spectator box at the end of a match, as well as at least one line of dialogue: "Rome is the mob", said here by Gracchus and by [[Julius Caesar]] ([[John Gavin]]) in ''Spartacus''.

The film's depiction of Commodus's entry into Rome borrows imagery from [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s [[Nazism|Nazi]] propaganda film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' (1935), although Scott has pointed out that the [[iconography]] of Nazi rallies was itself inspired by the Roman Empire. ''Gladiator'' reflects back on the film by duplicating similar events that occurred in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s procession. The Nazi film opens with an aerial view of Hitler arriving in a plane, while Scott shows an aerial view of Rome, quickly followed by a shot of the large crowd of people watching Commodus pass them in a procession with his [[chariot]].&lt;ref name="Winkler p114"&gt;Winkler, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; The first thing to appear in ''Triumph of the Will'' is a Nazi eagle, which is alluded to when a statue of an eagle sits atop one of the arches (and then is shortly followed by several more decorative eagles throughout the rest of the scene) leading up to the procession of Commodus. At one point in the Nazi film, a little girl gives flowers to Hitler, while Commodus is met by several girls who all give him bundles of flowers.&lt;ref name="Winkler p115"&gt;Winkler, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oscar-nominated score was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Lisa Gerrard]], and conducted by [[Gavin Greenaway]]. Zimmer was originally planning to use Israeli vocalist [[Ofra Haza]] for the score, after his work with her in ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]''. However, Haza died in late February 2000, before she was able to record, and so Gerrard was chosen instead. Lisa Gerrard's vocals are similar to her own work on ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' score.&lt;ref name="reel"&gt;{{Citation|title=Zimmer and Gladiator |url=http://www.reel.com/reel.asp?node=movienews/confidential&amp;pageid=16882 |publisher=Reel.com |accessdate=February 27, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210040935/http://www.reel.com/reel.asp?node=movienews%2Fconfidential&amp;pageid=16882 |archivedate=February 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The music for many of the battle scenes has been noted as similar to [[Gustav Holst]]'s "[[The Planets|Mars: The Bringer of War]]", and in June 2006, the Holst Foundation sued Hans Zimmer for allegedly copying the late Holst's work.&lt;ref name="Priscilla2006"&gt;{{Citation|title="Gladiator" Composer Accused of Copyright Infringement|author=Priscilla Rodriguez|publisher=KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO|url=http://www.knx1070.com/pages/45400.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516225847/http://www.knx1070.com/pages/45400.php|archivedate=2008-05-16|date=June 12, 2006|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael2006"&gt;{{Citation|author =Michael Beek|title=Gladiator Vs Mars&amp;nbsp;– Zimmer is sued:|publisher=Music from the Movies|url=http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/article.asp?ID=695|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618112502/http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/article.asp?ID=695|archivedate=2008-06-18|date=June 2006|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another close musical resemblance occurs in the scene of Commodus's triumphal entry into Rome, accompanied by music clearly evocative of two sections&amp;nbsp;– the Prelude to ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and Siegfried's Funeral March from ''[[Götterdämmerung]]''&amp;nbsp;– from [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring of the Nibelung]]''.

It was not without its deriders. [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and criticized the look of the film as "muddy, fuzzy, and indistinct."

===Accolades===
{{Main|List of accolades received by Gladiator}}
''Gladiator'' was nominated in 36 individual ceremonies, including the [[73rd Academy Awards]], the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA Awards]], and the [[Golden Globe Awards]]. Of 119 award nominations, the film won 48 prizes.&lt;ref name="awards"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/awards|title=Gladiator awards tally|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=February 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223191533/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/awards|archive-date=2008-12-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film won five Academy Awards and was nominated for an additional seven, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Ridley Scott. It was the first movie to win Best Picture without winning either a directing or screenwriting award since ''[[All the King's Men (1949 film)|All the King's Men]]'' at the [[22nd Academy Awards]] in 1950. In [[75th Academy Awards|2003]], ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' became another Best Picture winner which didn't win an Academy Award in either of these two major categories. Due to [[Academy Awards|Academy]] rules, only [[Hans Zimmer]] was officially nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and not [[Lisa Gerrard]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/gladiator.html| title=Filmtracks: Gladiator (Hans Zimmer/Lisa Gerrard)| newspaper=Filmtracks.com| date=May 5, 2000| author=| accessdate=July 25, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713015903/http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/gladiator.html| archive-date=2015-07-13| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pair did win the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]] as co-composers.

==Impact==
The film's mainstream success is responsible for an increased interest in Roman and classical history in the United States. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', this has been dubbed the "Gladiator Effect".

{{quote|It's called ''the 'Gladiator' effect'' by writers and publishers. The snob in us likes to believe that it is always books that spin off movies. Yet in this case, it's the movies&amp;nbsp;– most recently ''Gladiator'' two years ago&amp;nbsp;– that have created the interest in the ancients. And not for more Roman screen colossals, but for writing that is serious or fun or both.&lt;ref name=nytg/&gt;}}

The [[Cicero]] biography ''Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician'' and Gregory Hays's translation of [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]'' received large spikes in sales after the release of the film.&lt;ref name="nytg"&gt;{{Citation|last=Martin|first=Arnold|title=Making Books; Book Parties With Togas|publisher=The New York Times|date=July 11, 2002|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D61530F932A25754C0A9649C8B63|accessdate=February 27, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117055645/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D61530F932A25754C0A9649C8B63 |archivedate = January 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also began a revival of the historical epic genre with films such as ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'', ''[[The Alamo (2004 film)|The Alamo]]'', ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', ''[[300 (film)|300]]'', ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (the last two were also directed by Scott).&lt;ref name="Ref_2004"&gt;{{Citation|title=The 15 Most Influential Films of Our Lifetime|publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''|page=115|date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gladiator arena set piece from the 2002 film ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'', which entered production shortly after the release of ''Gladiator'', has been compared to the arena setting in the Scott film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/reviews/star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones-1200549814/|title=Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones|author=Todd McCarthy|date=May 8, 2002|publisher=Variety|access-date=May 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921112028/https://variety.com/2002/film/reviews/star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones-1200549814/|archive-date=2018-09-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-big-picture-star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones-pg-9150797.html|title=The Big Picture: Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (PG)|author=Anthony Quinn|date=May 16, 2002|publisher=The Independent|access-date=May 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010060628/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-big-picture-star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones-pg-9150797.html|archive-date=2018-10-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redlettermedia.com/mr-plinketts-star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones-review/|title=Mr. Plinkett's Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones Review|website=RedLetterMedia.com|date=July 8, 2010|access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was first released on [[DVD]] on November 21, 2000, and has since been released in several different extended and special edition versions. Special features for the [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]] and DVDs include [[deleted scene]]s, [[trailer (promotion)|trailers]], [[Documentary film|documentaries]], [[Audio commentary|commentaries]], [[storyboard]]s, image galleries, [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]], and [[audition|cast auditions]]. The film was released on Blu-ray in September 2009, in a 2-disc edition containing both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film, as part of [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount]]'s "Sapphire Series" (Paramount acquired the rights to the film when it bought the DreamWorks library in 2006).&lt;ref name="blu-ray"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/movies.php?id=4735|title=Gladiator|publisher=Blu-ray.com|accessdate=2009-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707212829/http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/movies.php?id=4735|archive-date=2009-07-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reviews of the Blu-ray Disc release criticized poor image quality, leading many to call for it to be remastered, as Sony did with ''[[The Fifth Element]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref name="bigscreen"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bigscreen.com/journal.php?id=1632|title=Initial "Gladiator" Blu-ray Reviews Report Picture Quality Issues|publisher=Netflix|accessdate=2009-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707235536/http://www.bigscreen.com/journal.php?id=1632|archive-date=2011-07-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A remastered version was later released in 2010.

The DVD editions that have been released since the original two-disc version, include a film only single-disc edition as well as a three-disc "extended edition" DVD which was released in August 2005. The extended edition DVD features approximately fifteen minutes of additional scenes, most of which appear in the previous release as deleted scenes. The original cut, which Scott still calls his director's cut, is also select-able via [[seamless branching]] (which is not included on the UK edition). The DVD is also notable for having a new commentary track featuring director Scott and star Crowe. The film is on the first disc, the second one has a three-hour documentary into the making of the film by DVD producer [[Charles de Lauzirika]], and the third disc contains supplements. Discs one and two of the three-disc extended edition were also repackaged and sold as a two-disc "special edition" in the EU in 2005.

In June 2001, [[Douglas Wick]] said a ''Gladiator'' [[prequel]] was in development.&lt;ref name="Stax2001"&gt;{{Citation|author=Stax|title=IGN FilmForce Exclusive: David Franzoni in Negotiations for Another Gladiator!|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 16, 2001|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/300/300625p1.html|accessdate=February 27, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226104104/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/300/300625p1.html|archivedate=February 26, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Wick, [[Walter Parkes]], [[David Franzoni]], and [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]] switched direction to a sequel set fifteen years later;&lt;ref name="Brian2002"&gt;{{Citation|author=Brian Linder|title=A Hero Will Rise ...

This includes a suggestion by Parkes that, in order to enable Russell Crowe to return to play Maximus, who dies at the end of the original movie, a sequel could involve a "multi-generational drama about Maximus and the Aureleans and this chapter of Rome", similar in concept to ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''.

In 2006, Scott stated he and Crowe approached [[Nick Cave]] to rewrite the film, but their ideas conflicted with DreamWorks's idea of a spin-off involving Lucius, whom Scott revealed would turn out to be Maximus's son with Lucilla. Scott noted that a tale of corruption in Rome was too complex, whereas ''Gladiator'' worked due to its simple drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1646784/ridley_lays_quotgladiator_2quot_to_rest/| title=Ridley Lays "Gladiator 2" to Rest - Rotten Tomatoes| newspaper=Rottentomatoes| date=May 8, 2006| author=Scott Weinberg| accessdate=July 25, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820200250/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1646784/ridley_lays_quotgladiator_2quot_to_rest/| archive-date=2012-08-20| dead-url=no| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, details of Cave's ultimately-rejected script surfaced on the internet: the script having Maximus being reincarnated by the Roman gods and returned to Rome to defend Christians against persecution; then transported to other important periods in history, including [[World War II]], the [[Vietnam War]], and finally being a general in the modern-day [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]. This script for a sequel, however, was rejected as being too far-fetched, and not in keeping with the spirit and theme of the original film.&lt;ref name="Michaels2009"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/06/nick-cave-rejected-gladiator-script | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Nick Cave's rejected Gladiator 2 script uncovered! | first=Sean | last=Michaels | date=May 6, 2009 | accessdate=May 3, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928001620/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/06/nick-cave-rejected-gladiator-script | archive-date=2013-09-28 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cave"&gt;{{Citation | last=Cave | first=Nick | title=Gladiator 2 Draft | url=http://www.mypdfscripts.com/unproduced/gladiator-2-by-nick-cave | accessdate=16 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225095848/http://www.mypdfscripts.com/unproduced/gladiator-2-by-nick-cave | archivedate=25 February 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, Scott again stated that he has an idea of how a sequel could be done, and that he is currently trying to convince Russell Crowe to reprise his role as Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/03/10/ridley-scott-gladiator-sequel/?preview_id=5594789|title=Ridley Scott On 'Gladiator' Sequel: 'I Know How to Bring Him Back'|date=11 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314194739/http://ew.com/movies/2017/03/10/ridley-scott-gladiator-sequel/?preview_id=5594789|archive-date=2017-03-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, it was announced that [[Paramount Pictures]] greenlit a sequel, which Universal has the option to co-finance, with Scott returning as director and Peter Craig writing the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jr |first1=Mike Fleming |title=Ridley Scott Moving Forward With ‘Gladiator 2’; Peter Craig To Write Script For Paramount |url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/gladiator-sequel-ridley-scott-maximus-peter-craig-writing-paramount-universal-1202494152/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=2 November 2018 |date=1 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102014746/https://deadline.com/2018/11/gladiator-sequel-ridley-scott-maximus-peter-craig-writing-paramount-universal-1202494152/ |archive-date=2018-11-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3484">The '''Golden Pectoral from Tovsta Mohyla''' is an ancient [[Scythian]] treasure discovered in a burial [[kurgan]] at a site called [[Tovsta Mohyla]] in 1971 by the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] archaeologist [[Boris Mozolevski]].  The Tovsta Mohyla burial mound, meaning fat [[Tumulus|barrow]], is located in present day southern [[Ukraine]] near the city of [[Pokrov, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Pokrov]] in [[Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]] region.&lt;ref name=Kuzych&gt;Kuzych and Bekhtir, "The golden pectoral from Tovsta Mohyla.".&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ancient [[Scythians]] were a semi-nomadic [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] people that lived around the northern area of the [[Black Sea]] with territory that stretched up into the [[Ural Mountains|Ural]] and [[Altai Mountain]] region.  Their culture is thought to have lasted almost 1000 years, during which time they traded regularly with many [[Mediterranean]] and [[Asia]]n cultures including the ancient [[Greeks]], the ancient [[Persian people|Persians]] and the ancient [[Chinese people|Chinese]].&lt;ref name=Kuzych/&gt;

The golden [[pectoral cross|pectoral]] or [[breastplate]] is thought to have been ordered by a Scythian chieftain, made either by the native Scythian artisans, as some modern scholarly opinion maintains, or as usually thought, by [[ancient Greek art|ancient Greek metalworkers]] probably located in [[Pantikapaion]] which is in present day [[Crimea]] on the [[Black Sea]].  At any rate the style is certainly Greek, although the imagery reflects Scythian interests.  The [[pectoral cross|pectoral]] is made of solid 24 carat gold, with a diameter of 12 inches (30.6 cm) and weighs just over 2.5 pounds (1150 g)&lt;ref name=Kuzych/&gt; It is in the shape of a [[crescent]] and can be stylistically broken down into three sections.&lt;ref name=Pidvysotska&gt;Pidvysotska ans Samina, "SCYTHIAN KING'S GOLD PECTORAL.".&lt;/ref&gt;  The top section, which is widely agreed to be the main focus of the piece, reflects Scythian daily life.&lt;ref name=Kuzych/&gt;  The middle section is believed to represent Scythian connection to nature.  Being that there are so many delicate details in this section the artisan(s) chose to solder all of the individual elements to a solid gold plate which serves as a backing for structural support.&lt;ref name=Reeder&gt;Reeder (ed.), "Scythian Gold: treasures from ancient Ukraine.".&lt;/ref&gt;  The third section is thought to represent Scythian belief in the [[cosmos]] and their mythology.&lt;ref name=Pidvysotska/&gt;

It is believed that the pectoral was created by soldering together dozens of individually cast figures and elements.&lt;ref name=Reeder/&gt;

The '''Grand Austrian State Prize''' ({{Lang-de|Großer Österreichischer Staatspreis}}) is a decoration given annually by [[Austria]] to an artist for exceptional work. The recipient must be an Austrian citizen with a permanent residence in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kunstkultur.bka.gv.at/site/8108/default.aspx | title=Großer Österreichischer Staatspreis | language=German | page= | publisher=Bundeskanzleramt Österreich | trans-title=Grand Austrian State Prize | format = | accessdate= April 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally created in 1950 by then education minister [[Felix Hurdes]]. The prize is given according to the recommendation by the Austrian Art Senate without a set rotation schedule for [[literature]], [[music]], [[visual art]], or [[architecture]]. Since 2003 it has been endowed with a 30,000 [[euro]] prize. In the areas of [[film]] and [[artistic photography]], the prize is awarded according to a jury and not the Art Senate.

Since 1971, the prize has been given to only one person a year, instead of sometimes given to multiple people in different categories.

'''Khyber Arts Society''' is a not-for profit charitable organization that operates the Khyber Centre for the Arts, an [[Canadian artist-run centres|artist-run centre]] located at 1880 Hollis St. in downtown Halifax NS, which is K’jipuktuk, unceded Mi’kmaq territory. The name “Khyber” commemorates the café owned and operated by the Nasr family in the old "[[The Khyber]] Building" at 1588 Barrington St., named for the Khyber Pass, a mountain pass that connects Afghanistan and Pakistan. 

== Mandate ==

The Khyber’s mandate is to present contemporary visual art, which exists in a wide variety of disciplines. We challenge traditional gallery conventions, encourage public understanding and appreciation of contemporary art through responsive and relevant programming. The Khyber works to prioritize, centre and promote the presentation of work by emerging local, national and/or international artists. Additionally, we aim to recognize and disrupt systemic forms of oppression, which include but are not limited to: racism, white supremacy, sexism, heterosexism, cissexism/transmisogyny, tokenism, ableism, ageism, sizeism, sexualized and all acts of violence and harassment. This will be implemented through anti-oppressive policy and practices through Khyber programming, operating and in relation to staff, Board members and artists presented. The Khyber provides a physical and flexible space for the support of socially-engaged Primary and Membership programming, as well as cultivating relationships with a variety of arts communities that engage in artistic research, experimentation, production, education and distribution.

In 1994, [[The Khyber]] Building was operated as an arts facility by a group of artists&lt;ref name="5e-rep"&gt;{{cite book|others=Regroupement des centres d'artistes autogérés du Québec|title=5e répertoire des centres d'artistes autogérés du Québec et du Canada|publisher=RCAAQ|year=2002|pages=257/259|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIlPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Khyber+Arts+Society%22&amp;dq=%22Khyber+Arts+Society%22|accessdate=1 September 2009|language=English, French}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously known as the No Money Down Cultural Society&lt;ref name="cultureandcommunities.ca"&gt;http://www.cultureandcommunities.ca/resources/cultural-facility-profiles/cultural-spaces-community-impacts/khyber.html&lt;/ref&gt;. They led a widespread and collaborative community campaign to ensure continued public access to "[[The Khyber]] Building" which was at risk of closer.

In March 1995, the Khyber Arts Society was established to operate The Khyber Centre for the Arts, a [[Canadian artist-run centres|Canadian artist-run centre]].&lt;ref name="5e-rep"/&gt; 

In 1997, the Society signed a lease to occupy the Khyber Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/ftp04/MQ63531.pdf|last=Kim|first=Joo-Hwan|date=July 2001|title=ETHOS:ART GALLERY, STUDIO AND HOUSING FOR ARTISTS|publisher=[[National Library of Canada]]|pages=17–18|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Khyber Club opened as a meeting place for visual artists and as an important venue for Halifax's emerging music scene&lt;ref name="cultureandcommunities.ca"/&gt; including acts by now well established Canadian recording artists [[Joel Plaskett]], [[Jenn Grant]], [[Old Man Luedecke]] and [[Buck 65]].

[[Sobey Art Award]] nominee, [[Emily Vey Duke]], was Artistic Director for the Society in 2004.

The Khyber Arts Society based its contemporary art programming out of "[[The Khyber]] Building"  until 2014, when the city required all tenants to leave.

In April 2014, the organization was temporarily relocated to 5521 Cornwallis St.

In November 2015, the organization moved to 1880 Hollis St. where it currently operates The Khyber Centre for the Arts and has continued to serve many artists and communities, offering an increasingly rigorous public program.

== Charitable Status ==

The Khyber Arts Society is a registered Canadian charitable organization.

[[File:Oplakávání Krista ze Žebráku, Národní galerie v Praze.jpg|thumb|400 px|''Lamentation of Christ'' from Žebrák, [[National Gallery in Prague]]]]
'''''Lamentation of Christ'' from Žebrák''' is a lime wood [[relief]] of the common subject of the [[Lamentation of Christ]], from about 1510.  It ranks among the finest works of [[International Gothic|Late Gothic]] sculpture in [[Bohemia]].  The anonymous artist, who is called the "Master of the Žebrák Lamentation of Christ" after this work, probably had his workshop in [[České Budějovice]] and could have been the same person as the woodcarver Alexandr (Alexandr Schniczer) who was in charge of that town’s guild between 1503 and 1516.&lt;ref&gt;Fajt J, Chlumská Š, 2014, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; The relief is now part of the permanent collection of medieval art at the [[National Gallery in Prague]].

== History of the work ==
The original location of the relief, which was created around 1510 and probably formed the central part of an altarpiece with side wings, is not known (possibly the castle chapel of [[Žebrák]]?). As recently as 1904 the [[relief]] was bought from a private owner in the village of Žebrák for the Prague City Museum. It was the art historian V.V. Štech who, in 1913, first mentioned the sculpture in literature.&lt;ref&gt;V.V. Štech, Oplakávání Krista, in: Umělecké poklady Čech I, Praha 1913, p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the collection of the [[National Museum (Prague)|National Museum]] until 1922, and from 1957 it has been part of the collection of the [[National Gallery in Prague]]. It was there that Jiří Tesář restored it in 1965.

== Description and context == 
The relief was carved out of lime wood; it measures 126 x 121 x 15&amp;nbsp;cm and features traces of original polychromy.

Portraying nine figures, the scene is arranged in two spatial planes. In the foreground, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] holds the body of the dead [[Christ]] in her arms. She is accompanied on her left by [[John the Apostle|St. John]], who is taking the crown of thorns from Christ’s head, and [[Mary Magdalene]] who brings a vessel containing balsam. In the background there probably stands one of the Jews mentioned in the [[Gospel of Nicodemus]] together with one of the Marys ([[Mary of Clopas]]?); on the right there is a weeping woman, probably [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]], with [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathaea]] who is holding the cloth for wrapping the body.

The gestures of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], who is holding Christ’s limp body in her arms, and St John, who turns away in pain, are restrained and free of pathos. The weeping woman standing on the right behind the Virgin Mary, modelled on a figure in the [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|''Descent from the Cross'' by Rogier van der Weyden]], is executed in careful and detailed carving. The pleating of most of the figures’ garments is subordinated to the overall composition and their decorative effect is suppressed. The dramatic aspect is created by the chaotic crumpling of the drapery under [[Christ]]’s body and the naturalistic depiction of his body with its wounds and sources of blood that refer to his human nature. The expressive effect is reinforced by the striking way Christ’s head hangs down; John’s crossed arms draw attention to his thorn crown. Christ’s body is long and bony, and resembles another work by the Master of the Žebrák Lamentation – the Group Sculpture of the [[Holy Trinity]] at the South Bohemian Museum in [[České Budějovice]]. The types of faces in both works also correspond with each other – God the Father and Joseph of Arimathaea. The face of [[Mary Magdalene]] also matches the free-standing sculpture of the same [[saint]] at the Museum in České Budějovice.&lt;ref&gt;Opitz J, 1935/36, pp. 88-91&lt;/ref&gt;

The central [[Pietà]] is modelled on the work by a Brussels master from the circle of [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (1448).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petruspapa2.org/pin/van-der-weyden/secutores/van-der-weyden-officina-fortasse-vel-circulus-pieta-1448-oude-abdij-van-drongen.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bart Fransen, Een piëta uit het atelier van Rogier van der Weyden, bestemd voor het Bendedictinessenklooster van Vorst in De oude abdij van Drongen, Leuven, 2006, pp. 471-473&lt;/ref&gt; The diagonal of Christ’s body with its hanging arms and the head of Mary Magdalene form a triangular composition. The diagonals of the main characters (Mary Magdalene, Christ and John) with their slender limbs form an X-shape in the centre of the relief along with another triangle whose top is formed by Joseph of Arimathaea’s head.&lt;ref&gt;Opitz J, 1935/36, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The motif of the scene is derived from paintings by the Netherlandish artist [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (Descent from the Cross, 1435, Miraflores Altarpiece, 1445) and [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer’s]] woodcut depicting the Lamentation of Christ (1496). Earlier literature mentioned a relationship between the Master of the Žebrák Lamentation and the [[Kefermarkt Altarpiece]];&lt;ref&gt;Kropáček J, 1960, pp. 160 -175&lt;/ref&gt; however more recent works have highlighted the Swabian influence (the ''Velhartice [[retable]]'', [[Gregor Erhart]]) as well as that of Danube-region sculptures and the Viennese work of [[Nikolaus Gerhaert|Nicolaus Gerhaert]] and [[Erasmus Grasser]].&lt;ref&gt;Homolka J, 1969, pp. 563-564&lt;/ref&gt;

The Master of the Žebrák Lamentation followed on from the tradition of late 15th-century woodcarving represented by the ''Velhartice retable''. In his work, the excited pathos and intensity of emotional experience dominates over the physical essence of the figures that are characterised by small heads and elongated bodies. The lyrical element, whose [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] proportional arbitrariness recalls echoes of the [[International Gothic]] style, mingles here with detailed realistic carving of the faces and the expressive modelling of drapery characteristic of the Late Gothic ''crumpled folds'' period.&lt;ref&gt;Kutal A, 1972, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Libeaus Desconus''''' is a 14th-century [[Middle English]] version of the popular "[[Gingalain|Fair Unknown]]" story. Its author is thought to be [[Thomas Chestre]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M (Ed). 1969. ''Lybeaus Desconus''. Oxford University Press for the Early English Text Society. 302 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lupack, Alan. 2005. Oxford Guide to Arthurian Literature and Legend. Oxford University Press. p 320.&lt;/ref&gt; The story matter displays strong parallels to that of [[Renaut de Beaujeu]]'s ''[[Le Bel Inconnu]]''; both versions describe the adventures of [[Gingalain]], the son of [[King Arthur]]'s knight [[Gawain]] and a [[fairy|fay]] who raises him ignorant of his parentage and his name. As a young man, he visits Arthur's court to be knighted, and receives his nickname; in this case Sir Libeaus Desconus, before setting forth on a series of adventures which consolidate his new position in society. He eventually discovers who is his father, and marries a powerful lady.

Other versions of the story include the [[Middle High German]] romance ''Wigalois'' (1204–1209) by [[Wirnt von Gravenberc]]. The "Fair Unknown" story has parallels in the tale of [[Sir Breunor|La Cote Male Taile]], [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Conte du Graal]]'', Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''Tale of Sir [[Gareth]]'' from ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', and the 14th century [[Italy|Italian]] epic ''Carduino''.

==Manuscripts==
Versions of ''Libeaus Desconus'' can be found in the following manuscripts:&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M (Ed). 1969. pp 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
* British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, mid-fifteenth century;
* Lambeth Palace MS 306, mid-fifteenth century;
* Lincoln’s Inn MS Hale 150, late-fourteenth/early-fifteenth century;
* Bodleian Library MS Ashmole 61, late-fifteenth century;
* Biblioteca Nazionale, Naples, MS XIII B. 29, mid-fifteenth century;
* British Library Additional MS 27879 (also known as MS Percy), seventeenth century.

Judged by the number of surviving manuscripts, the ''Libeaus Desconus'' was the most popular of the Arthurian romances in Middle English.&lt;ref&gt;P. J. C. Field, ''Malory: Texts and Sources'' (1998), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
(This summary is based on the Lambeth Palace text.)

Gyngelayne is raised in the forest by his mother, who tries to keep him away from arms since she fears that her 'wild' son might otherwise come to harm. Gyngelayne is never told his real name by his mother. Instead, she calls him ‘Bewfiȝ’, since he is 'gentle of body' and has an attractive face. One day, Gyngelayne finds a dead knight in the forest. He dons the man’s armour and goes to Glastonbury, where King Arthur is holding court. There he asks Arthur to dub him a knight although his upbringing is uncourtly. Arthur is so pleased by young Gyngelayne's sight that he gives him a name – Libeaus Desconus, ‘The Fair Unknown’ – and knights him that same day. Libeaus at once asks King Arthur if he might be offered the first challenge for which the king is required to provide a champion.

Soon a fair maiden, Ellyne, and a dwarf, Theodeley, come riding in. They have been sent by the lady of Synadowne, who has been imprisoned. Cannot Arthur send a knight to free her mistress? When Arthur grants the youthful Libeaus the quest, the maiden is angered, yet the king refuses to replace Libeaus with another knight. 

Libeaus, Ellyne, and the dwarf set off on their journey, in acrimony. On the third day, Libeaus defeats a knight called Syr William Delaraunche, who had never yet been overcome in combat. Only now does Ellyne's ridicule of Lybeaus subside. Libeaus sends 'Syr William' to Arthur’s court, where he is to tell the king who defeated him. Next morning, Libeaus is attacked by William’s three cousins. He breaks one's thigh, another's arm and forces them all to go to Arthur’s court, where they are to tell the king by whom they were defeated, and subject themselves to him.

In a wild forest, Libeaus saves a maiden from two giants and sends their heads to King Arthur. The maiden's father, an earl, offers Libeaus his daughter’s hand in marriage, but Libeaus declines because he has a mission to accomplish. He is then given beautiful armour and a fine steed and he, the maiden Ellyne and the dwarf continue on their journey. Libeaus next defeats the Lord of Cardiff, winning a gyrfalcon, a scene that bears striking similarities with an episode in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' twelfth century romance ''Erec and Enide'', retold in the Welsh [[Mabinogion]] tale ''Gereint and Enid''.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Jeffrey. 1976. The Mabinogion. Penguin Books Limited. pp 263–268.&lt;/ref&gt; He has the prize taken to Arthur, who is so satisfied with his knight that he decides to send him a hundred pounds. Libeaus uses the gold to hold a forty-days feast, and then moves on with his companions.

In a forest, Libeaus catches a many-coloured hunting dog at Ellyne's request. A man called Sir Otis claims that it is his, but Libeaus refuses to give it up. He soon finds himself faced by a full-fledged army, which he defeats single-handedly. Sir Otis, too, is sent to Arthur’s court. And after many adventures in Ireland and Wales, Libeaus arrives at the beautiful Isle of Gold ('Jl de Ore'), a city of castles and palaces. Its lady is besieged by a Saracen giant called Maugys. After a long and eventful fight, Libeaus is able to kill the giant. La Dame Amour, Lady of the Island, offers the hero her love, and lordship over the Jl de Ore. Libeaus gladly accepts, and for twelve months he lives a life of 'recreauntise'. When one day Libeaus meets the maiden Ellyne, she points out to Libeaus that he has been disloyal to his lord in abandoning his quest. He feels deeply ashamed and leaves the Jl de Ore. With him he takes his horse, his armour and Jurflete, La Dame Amour’s steward, whom he makes his squire. They travel onwards, he, Ellyne and his new squire, towards Synadowne.

Arriving at Synadowne at last, Libeaus defeats Lanwarde, the city’s steward, who has the habit of fighting every knight who comes to the city looking for a place to stay. Libeaus asks who the knight is who is holding the Lady of Synadowne prisoner. Lanwarde informs Libeaus that the Lady of Synadowne is being held captive not by any knight but by two clerics who practice black magic (‘nigermansye’):
:"Quod Lambert, 'Be Seint John!
:Knyght, sir, is ther none
:That durste hir away lede.
:Twoo clerkys ben hir foone,
:Fekyll off bloode and bone,
:That hauyth y-doo this dede." &lt;ref&gt;Mills, M (Ed). 1969. Lambeth Palace MS 306 version, lines 1749–1754.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lanwarde informs Libeaus that these two clerics, called Jrayne and Mabon, have created a 'paleys', an edifice which no nobleman dares enter, and they say that they will kill the lady unless she transfers all of her power to Mabon.

Next morning, Libeaus enters this palace and, leading his horse by the reins, finds nobody there but minstrels playing their music. Going deeper into the palace, searching for someone to fight with, he passes magnificent columns and stained glass windows and sits down on the raised platform at the far end of the space. The minstrels who had been playing now vanish, the earth shakes, and stones fall down. On the field outside appear the two clerics, Mabon and Jrayne, armed and on horseback. They are intent on killing Libeaus, who does battle with them both, but Jrayne disappears before Libeaus can deal him the final blow: he was too busy slaying Mabon, 'the more shreweos'.

Depressed, Libeaus sits down in the palace hall: Jrayne might well cause him trouble in the future. While Libeaus contemplates his situation, a window appears in one of the walls, and a serpent with wings and a woman’s face crawls through. It speaks, asserting that it is 'young', and then kisses a terrified Libeaus. Consequently, it changes into a beautiful young woman: the Lady of Synadowne. She thanks Libeaus for freeing her, and tells him that he has slain both of the evil clerks. She also tells him that the only way the curse which had changed her into a serpent could be lifted was by kissing Gawain or someone else of his kin. Then the lady offers herself and her many possessions to Libeaus, who gladly accepts. 

After seven joyous days in Synadowne, Libeaus and the Lady of Synadowne go to King Arthur’s court, where Arthur grants Libeaus the lady’s hand. A forty-day feast follows, after which the newly-weds are escorted back to Synadowne by Arthur and his knights, where they live happily together for many years.

==Style==
''Libeaus Desconus'' is a late-fourteenth century Middle English poem of around 2200 lines (the exact number of lines varies amongst the six manuscripts).&lt;ref name="Mills, M Ed. 1969"&gt;Mills, M (Ed). 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many Middle English romances (e.g. [[The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle]] and [[Emaré]]) the poem is divided into stanzas of tail-rhyme verse, a rhyming couplet followed by a tail-rhyme, repeated four times in each stanza in a [[rhyme scheme|scheme]] like AABCCBDDBEEB.&lt;ref name="Mills, M Ed. 1969"/&gt;

Writing principally in a dialect of southern England,&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, William Henry. 1895. ''Studies on the Libeaus Desconus''. Ginn and Company, Boston, for Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly the SE Midlands,&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M (Ed). 1969. pp 28–36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Chestre]] has been described as a 'hack writer' who had an acquaintance with a number of other [[Middle English]] romances and was able to borrow from them, often retaining the different dialects of the bits and pieces he incorporated into his own [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M (Ed). 1969. p 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Libeaus Desconus was written for a more popular audience than the Old French romances on which it models itself.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, William Henry. 1895. p 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thomas Chestre's sources==
Most of the themes and motifs in ''Libeaus Desconus'' are drawn from a common stock of medieval Arthurian material. It is difficult to assign a unique work from which this Middle English poem derives, although some have argued for a lost twelfth century romance from which both ''Libeaus Desconus'' and the much earlier, late-twelfth or early-thirteenth century Old French ''[[Le Bel Inconnu]]'' have their source.&lt;ref name="Schofield, William Henry 1895. p 107"&gt;Schofield, William Henry. 1895. p 107.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Bel Inconnu'' may have been known to the author in a manuscript copy that was not identical to the only copy which now survives, and [[Thomas Chestre]] may have had access to this 'as well as other, related, material'.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M (Ed). 1969. p 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There are Old French, Middle High German and Italian versions of this tale, however, ranging in date from the late-twelfth/early thirteenth century to the fifteenth century, and the similarities, links and differences between them seem too complex simply to assume a lost twelfth-century work from which they all originate.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M (Ed). 1969. p  50.&lt;/ref&gt;  This, despite a line in Libeaus Desconus that refers to a French source, “in Frensshe as it is j-ffounde” &lt;ref&gt;Mills, M (Ed). 1969. ''Lybeaus Desconus'', Lambeth Palace MS 306, line 673. p 117&lt;/ref&gt; when describing a scene that differs from ''[[Le Bel Inconnu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, William Henry. 1895. p 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and influences==
As well as the late-twelfth/early thirteenth century Old French romance ''[[Le Bel Inconnu]]'', or its hypothesised precursor,&lt;ref name="Schofield, William Henry 1895. p 107"/&gt; there are a number of other influences which may have contributed to Thomas Chestre's story ''Libeaus Desconus''.

===Perceval===
The story of a young man who is brought up in the forest by his mother because she does not want him to learn about chivalry and fighting, and who later arrives at King Arthur's court in an innocent and dishevelled state with the desire to be made a knight, is none other than an account of the childhood of [[Perceval]]. [[Chrétien de Troyes]] introduced Perceval at the beginning of his unfinished last romance, [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Perceval, le Conte du Graal]], written between 1180 and 1190&lt;ref&gt;Kibler, William W and Carroll, Carleton W. 1991. Chrétien de Troyes: Arthurian Romances. Penguin Books Limited. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt; in which this young man, following his unlikely arrival at King Arthur's court, becomes embroiled in a search for a castle that, from the quills of other authors, evolved into a quest for the [[Holy Grail]].&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, Roger Sherman. 1963, reprinted 1991. ''The Grail: From Celtic Myth to Christian Symbol''. Princeton University Press. 287 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; There are indications that the author of ''[[Le Bel Inconnu]]'' knew not only Chretien de Troyes' ''Perceval, le Conte du Graal'' but also the Second Continuation of this story, written some few years after Chretien de Troyes' death.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, William Henry. 1895. p 139.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Libeaus Desconus'' describes a succession of events immediately preceding the appearance of Mabon and Jrayne outside the palace in which Libeaus waits with his horse (sudden darkness, slamming of doors and windows, shower of stones, earthquake) that correspond very closely to one found in another adventure in Arthurian romance: the description in the ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Lancelot]]'' of Sir Bors visit to the Grail Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M (Ed). 1969. p 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Middle English verse romance ''[[Sir Perceval of Galles]] (Sir Perceval of Wales)'' relates early events in the life of Perceval that are similar to those in Chretien de Troyes' ''Perceval, le Conte du Graal''  but then goes off at a tangent and omits any reference to the graal castle.&lt;ref&gt;Braswell, Mary Flowers. 1995. ''Sir Perceval of Galles and Yvain and Gawain''. Kalamazoo, Michigan: Western Michigan University for TEAMS.&lt;/ref&gt; 'This omission has prompted the question of whether or not the tale's author knew Chrétien's version of the story.'&lt;ref&gt;Lupack, Alan. 2005. p 232.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sir Perceval of Galles'' may draw upon an earlier and more primitive version of the tale than Chrétien's, which would explain why it omits any reference to the graal castle or the graal, since these were inventions of Chrétien de Troyes.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, William Henry. 1895. p194.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the young man Libeaus Desconus 'is only Perceval with a new name.'&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, William Henry. 1895, p 146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Welsh mythology===

The collection of medieval Welsh stories known as the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' includes a short romance ''Peredur'', considered to date from the late-twelfth or early-thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Thomas. 2007. Concepts of Arthur. Tempus Publishing. P 108.&lt;/ref&gt; This tale follows Chrétien's ''Perceval, le Conte du Graal'' for the most part (with deviations) and seems to know of the Graal continuation by Manessier&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Jeffery. 1976. P 218.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Peredur'' may not simply be a working over of Chretien's ''Perceval'', however, but based upon an earlier version of the story, one from which both Chretien de Troyes and the author of a lost twelfth century romance – a romance upon which both ''[[Le Bel Inconnu]]'' and ''Libeaus Desconus'' may be based – each took as the basis for their respective works.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, William Henry. 1895. p 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of ''Peredur'' climaxes near the end of the tale with the slaying of a serpent. Many of the incidents in the story not following Chretien's ''Conte du Graal'' are likely to represent a 'Celtic tradition'.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Thomas. 2007. p 208.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'confused or half-remembered stories about the hero.'&lt;ref&gt;Lovecy, I. 1991. Historia Peredur ab Efrawg. In: Bromwich, R, Jarman, A O H and Roberts, B F (Eds). 1991. ''The Arthur of the Welsh. The Arthurian Legend in Medieval Welsh Literature''. Cardiff, pp 171–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peredur may be the original name of Perceval, since Perceval in Old French is a meaningless 'pierce-valley'.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Jeffery. 1976. p 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Peredur seems similar to the ''Mabinogion'' character Pryderi in temperament and other evidence suggests as well that Pryderi may be the original of Peredur.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Jeffery. 1976. p 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Pryderi was born to the goddess Rhiannon, elsewhere in the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', but snatched away by a monster and a dead puppy disguised to be his body. He returned again when the monster was killed and was brought up as Gwri Golden Hair, brought to his father's court, returned to Rhiannon and renamed Pryderi.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Jeffery. 1976. pp 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, like the mythological Ulster hero [[Cú Chulainn]], Pryderi had two names and associations with a dog. It has been considered 'well known that the stories of the youth of Cú Chulainn  resemble those of the youth of Perceval.'&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, William Henry. 1895. p 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Peredur goes to one of the nine Hags of Gloucester to learn how to wield arms, just as Cú Chulainn went to the witch Skatha to learn how to fight.&lt;ref&gt;Rolleston, Thomas, 1911. Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race. The Gresham Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chrétien de Troyes' ''Erec and Enide''===
When Libeaus Desconus sends all the knights whom he defeats back to King Arthur's court, he is following the behaviour of Perceval in Chretien's adventure that leads him to the castle of the Fisher King.&lt;ref&gt;Kibler, William W and Carroll, Carleton W. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  And in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' earlier romance ''Erec and Enide'', retold in the [[Mabinogion]] tale of ''Geirant and Enid'', following the episode where the hero fights a knight in a kind of beauty competition whose prize is a sparrow-hawk,&lt;ref&gt;Kibler, William W and Carroll, Carleton W. 1991. p 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Chretien's story, retold in the ''Mabinogion'', describes a knight and a lady, who are not on speaking terms with one another, travelling through the countryside and encountering a succession of hostile knights whom the hero jousts with and kills.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Jeffery. 1976. pp 278–297.&lt;/ref&gt; This story has itself been considered a successful reworking of material from which the tales of the Fair Unknown derive, in particular creating a heroine 'who is more complex and interesting than any of her counterparts in ''Le Bel Inconnu''.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M (Ed). 1969. pp 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that Arthurian tales were often reworked,&lt;ref&gt;Green, Thomas. 2007. Concepts of Arthur. Tempus Publishing, p 109.&lt;/ref&gt; and that characters not originally associated with King Arthur in the eleventh and twelfth centuries were absorbed into his epic.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Thomas. 2007. p 110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hue de Rotelande's ''Ipomedon''===
The twelfth century romance ''Ipomedon'', written in Norman French by [[Hue de Rotelande]], is found in a Middle English version ''[[Ipomadon]]'' in MS Chetham 8009, lying in Chetham's Library, Manchester, England and dating from 'between the last decade of the fourteenth century and the middle of the fifteenth century'.&lt;ref&gt;Purdie, Rhiannon. 2001. ''Ipomadon''. Oxford University Press for the Early English Text Society. Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a number of adventures in which the eponymous hero demonstrates his martial prowess, [[Ipomadon]] puts on the garb of a fool and goes to the court of the uncle of the lady he loves, the King of Sicily, where he agrees to stay only if he is granted the 'fyrste battayle'.&lt;ref&gt;Purdie, Rhiannon. 2001. ''Ipomadon'', line 6323. p 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after he arrives, a maiden appears, 'apon a palfreye white as mylke'&lt;ref&gt;Purdie, Rhiannon. 2001. ''Ipomadon'', line 6454. p 186.&lt;/ref&gt; seeking a champion to free her lady from oppression. The fool (Ipomadon) asks again that the quest be given to him. Since nobody else at court wants to undertake this task, the king concedes his request. The maiden is far from impressed. Only slowly does she moderate her acrimony as the fool travels along with her, defeating one hostile knight after another, until they reach the maiden's land and he frees the lady, who is, in fact, the lady he loves. The maiden's name is Imayne, she travels with a dwarf, and along the way, Ipomadon defeats a knight named Maugys.

===Breton lays===
The upbringing-in-the-wild motif is evident not only in tales of the Fair Unknown and in Chretien de Troyes' ''Perceval, le Conte du Graal'' but in the Breton lay [[Tyolet]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, William Henry. 1895. p 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Known from only one Old French manuscript, dating to the late-thirteenth or early-fourteenth century, the lay itself was probably composed by the beginning of the thirteenth century&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Glyn S and Brook, Leslie C (Eds and translators). 2005. Doon and Tyolet: two Old French Narrative Lays. Liverpool Online Series: Critical Editions of French Texts, p 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Perceval and Libeaus Desconus, Tyolet arrives at King Arthur's court as a young man who has spent all his childhood living alone in the forest with his mother. Like Perceval and Libeaus Desconus, what prompts Tyolet to go to King Arthur's court in the first place is the sight of armour. Unlike Chretien's ''Perceval'', but like ''Libeaus Desconus'', an animal in this story is transformed into a human, in this case a stag which changes into an armed knight, a 'knight-beast'.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Glyn S and Brook, Leslie C (Eds and translators). 2005,  pp 81–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Breton lays that we have from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, on the evidence of the opening passages in ''[[Tyolet]]'' and others, describing their transmission, are possibly derived from stories that are considerably older, although the desire of medieval authors to 'seek to ensure a measure of authenticity for their tales' should be remembered.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Glyn S and Brook, Leslie C (Eds and translators). 2005, p 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities in ''[[Tyolet]]'' and the Second Continuation of Chretien's ''[[Perceval, le Conte du Graal]]'' has led R H Loomis to observe that the two stories 'must derive from a common remote source'.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, Roger Sherman. 1949. Arthurian Tradition and Chretien de Troyes. New York: Columbia University Press, p 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Instances of animals transforming into human beings occur also in the twelfth century Breton lays of [[Marie de France]], in particular [[Bisclavret]] and [[Yonec]].

===Irish mythology===
The episode of the many-coloured hunting dogs and Libeaus's taking of one of them for Ellyne occurs also in ''[[Le Bel Inconnu]]'' and has parallels with  a ''Lay of the Great Fool'', recorded by O'Daly in his Fenian poems,&lt;ref&gt;O'Daly. 1861. Transactions of the [[Ossianic Society]] for 1858, vol VI. Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; and well as a similar story in Campbell's ''Popular Tales of the West Highlands''.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, William Henry. 1895. pp 171–172.&lt;/ref&gt;
R S Loomis notes the similarities between the early life of Perceval and a twelfth-century text detailing the boyhood deeds of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]]&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, Roger Sherman. 1963, reprinted 1991. p 62&lt;/ref&gt; and makes a similar comparison with the boyhood of Sir Gawain's son Gingalais, who arrives at King Arthur's court to become the Fair Unknown.&lt;ref name="Loomis, Roger Sherman 1963, p 85"&gt;Loomis, Roger Sherman, 1963, reprinted 1991. p 85&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]], for example, was a high-born son, first named Demne, deliberately reared deep in the forest, away from the threat of arms, spent his childhood hunting in this forest and at last came upon the home of a great lord where he was given the name Fionn, or Fair.&lt;ref name="Loomis, Roger Sherman 1963, p 85"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolleston, T. W. 1910. The High Deeds of Finn and other Bardic Romances of Ancient Ireland. London, pp 106–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are examples of [[retroactive continuities]] (or retcons).

==Film==
*''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), features [[Obi Wan Kenobi]] telling [[Luke Skywalker]] that [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin Skywalker (Luke's father)]], was betrayed and killed by [[Darth Vader]]. The sequel film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), plot has Vader reveal himself as Anakin Skywalker (Luke's father). [[George Lucas]] decided to merge both characters while writing ''The Empire Strikes Back''. The following film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) has Obi-Wan, justifying his original description of Vader having 'murdered' Anakin, as being truth from "a certain point of view" because from his point of view when Anakin became Vader he destroyed everything that was good about his former friend and apprentice. Similarly [[Princess Leia]] had been previously set as an upper-class romantic interest for the farm boy Luke; but in ''Empire Strikes Back'' Leia falls in love with [[Han Solo]], so in order to avoid a possible love triangle, ''Return of the Jedi'' reveals Leia as Luke Skywalker's twin sister (and therefore, daughter of Darth Vader), Lucas had originally planned Luke's sister to be a separate character, before deciding to accommodate it into the already established Leia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secrethistoryofstarwars.com/ |title=東京の婚活パーティーってどんなの？ |publisher=Secrethistoryofstarwars.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rogue One]]'' (2016) explains the improbable vulnerability of the [[Death Star]] in ''A New Hope'' to small rebel ships as a consequence of deliberate sabotage on the part of the key Death Star architect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vulture.com/2016/12/rogue-one-star-wars-retcon-death-star.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' (2015) the seventh entry of the ''[[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]]'' film series which serves as a sequel and spin-off to 2006's ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (the sixth film), contains a major change into the continuity of the previous films. ''Creed'' establishes that during the events of ''[[Rocky IV]]'', Rocky's friend and rival [[Apollo Creed]] had an affair that resulted in a woman's pregnancy shortly before his boxing match against [[Ivan Drago]] during which Apollo dies on the ring. Months after the fight, the woman gives birth to [[Adonis Creed]], the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. Adonis never meets his father and is the protagonist of the film ''Creed''; furthermore the film reveals Apollo won the fight at the end of ''[[Rocky III]]'' implying that that is the reason why Apollo agreed to fight Ivan Drago.&lt;ref&gt;http://screenrant.com/rocky-40th-anniversary-retcon/&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Godzilla (franchise)#Heisei series (1984–1995)|Heisei]] and [[Godzilla (franchise)#Millennium series (1999–2004)|Millennium]] eras of the ''[[Godzilla]]'' film series, the events of the [[Godzilla (franchise)#Shōwa series (1954–1975)|Showa]] era after the [[Godzilla (1954 film)|original film]] never happened.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} In particular, each film in the Millennium series – except for ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', which serves as the direct sequel to ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' – serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/articles/art_mill_conti.htm |title=Godzilla Millennium Series Continuity |publisher=Tohokingdom.com |date=2005-07-19 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', [[Jon Favreau]]'s son Max appears as a child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone. This was [[retcon|retroactively]] made the introduction of a young [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] to the MCU, as confirmed in June 2017 by eventual Spider-Man actor [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], [[Marvel Studios]] president [[Kevin Feige]] and ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' director [[Jon Watts]].&lt;ref name="PeterParker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-holland-officially-confirms-spider-man-was-in-iron-man-2_us_59508ea4e4b0da2c731c7080|title=Tom Holland Confirms Popular Fan Theory: Spider-Man Was In ‘Iron Man 2’|last=Bradley|first=Bill|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=June 26, 2017|accessdate=June 26, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6rVzoB543?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-holland-officially-confirms-spider-man-was-in-iron-man-2_us_59508ea4e4b0da2c731c7080|archivedate=June 26, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PeterParker2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/peter-parker-iron-man-2-jon-watts/|title=‘Spider-Man: Homecoming’ Director Jon Watts Explains Real Story Behind Peter Parker’s ‘Iron Man 2’ Cameo|last=Ryan|first=Mark|work=[[Uproxx]]|date=June 27, 2017|accessdate=June 27, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6rXDt2Exj?url=http://uproxx.com/movies/peter-parker-iron-man-2-jon-watts/|archivedate=June 27, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
*When [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] killed off his character [[Sherlock Holmes]] by plunging him to his death over the [[Reichenbach Falls]] with his nemesis [[Professor Moriarty]], the public's demand for Holmes was so great that Doyle was compelled to bring him back to life in a subsequent story, where he details that Holmes had merely faked his death.
*Though the term "retcon" did not yet exist when [[George Orwell]] wrote ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', the totalitarian regime depicted in that book is involved in a constant, large-scale retconning of past records. For example, when it is suddenly announced that "Oceania was not after all in war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia and Eurasia was an ally" (Part Two, Ch. 9), there is an immediate intensive effort to change "all reports and records, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks and photographs" and make them all record a war with Eastasia rather than one with Eurasia. "Often it was enough to merely substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the geographical knowledge needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable." See [[historical revisionism (negationism)]].
*When [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the character of ''[[Sauron|The Necromancer]]'' was not originally intended to be more than an abstract "bad guy" concept because ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' had not yet been conceived.  However, as Tolkien developed ''The Lord of the Rings'', the abstract ''Necromancer'' came to be "discovered" to be [[Sauron]].

==Television==

*In 2004, ''[[Coronation Street]]'' retconned the Baldwin family after [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s nephew [[Danny Baldwin|Danny]] and wife [[Frankie Baldwin|Frankie]] moved to the area from [[Essex]], with their two sons [[Jamie Baldwin|Jamie]] and [[Warren Baldwin|Warren]]. Mike had been portrayed as an only child prior to this moment, with [[Frank "Frankie" Baldwin|his father]] appearing in the program between 1980 and 1982 to confirm the notion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
*''[[First of the Summer Wine]]'', the prequel to the long-running British sitcom ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'', retconned the character Seymour Utterthwaite as a pre-World War II friend of the other central characters. Seymour had been introduced into later series of ''Last of the Summer Wine'' and was previously unknown to the stalwart characters, Compo and Clegg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First of the Summer Wine, Uncovered |url=http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm |accessdate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082703/http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The revived series of British science fiction television program ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and its television [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s use retroactive continuity as a plot device. 
**Show runner [[Steven Moffat]]'s [[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|fifth series finale]] depicted the Doctor [[reset button technique|rebooting the universe]]. In answer to a fan's question, Moffat tweeted: "The whole universe came exactly as it was. Except for any continuity errors I need to explain away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/steven_moffat/status/80157148893556736 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724045625/http://twitter.com/steven_moffat/status/80157148893556736 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 July 2012 |title=Steven Moffat: ...The whole universe... |work=Steven Moffat on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**In the [[Doctor Who (series 6)|sixth series]], Moffat introduces new aliens the [[Silence (Doctor Who)|Silence]], who erase your memory of them the moment you look away. Commenting on this device, writer [[MaryAnn Johanson]] writes, "That could be happening throughout this story... indeed, through the entire history of ''Doctor Who''. Moffat has just created a pretty much unassailable narratively sound reason for inserting retcons ''anywhere'' throughout the half-century history of the show."{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
**In the [[The Name of the Doctor|seventh series finale]], Moffat creates a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the [[War Doctor]] in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]".&lt;ref name="HurtDoctor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/10065201/Doctor-Who-The-Name-of-the-Doctor-BBC-One-review.html|title=Doctor Who: The Name of the Doctor, BBC One, review|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=22 May 2013|author=Hogan, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is shown in the mini-episode "[[The Night of the Doctor]]" [[retroactive continuity|retroactively inserted]] into the show's fictional chronology between the [[Eighth Doctor|Eighth]] and [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors.&lt;ref name="HurtDoctorNumber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a533505/doctor-who-steven-moffat-on-regeneration-limit.html?rss|title='Doctor Who': Steven Moffat on regeneration limit|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=24 November 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013|author=Rigby, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 50th anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]", Moffat revealed, that at the last instant of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], the Doctor hid his war-torn home planet in time, rather than destroy it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
** In the ''Doctor Who'' spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'', created by [[Russell T Davies]], a drug used to erase the memory of characters is called "retcon"; the use of the drug is often referred to by characters as "retconning".{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==''Star Trek'' in various media==

*When ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' was released in 1979, [[Gene Roddenberry]] claimed that the radically different appearance of the [[Klingon]]s in the film was how they were always supposed to have looked, but they did not have the budget for it in the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In the 1990s, an episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' featured three Klingon characters from the original series, made to fit the new look. However, the later episode "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]", used footage from the original series with old-look Klingons; Commander [[Worf]] acknowledged their different appearance, saying it was "a long story" and, after receiving incredulous looks, added with a scowl "we do not discuss it with outsiders."
*A 2005, two-episode arc of ''Star Trek: Enterprise'', "[[Affliction (Enterprise episode)|Affliction]]"/"[[Divergence (Enterprise episode)|Divergence]]", revealed that the Klingons that appeared in the 1960s episodes were the product of genetic engineering using augmented human [[genes]]. This explanation was used in [[Shane Johnson (author)|Shane Johnson]]'s 1989 ''The Worlds of the Federation'': "The 'Klingons' encountered along the Federation border with the Empire were a Klingon-human fusion, genetically created to infiltrate the Federation. The interception of the Amar transmission during the V'Ger incident revealed the true nature of the Imperial Klingon race and stunned Federation science. Before that time, no one had suspected the Klingons were capable of such advanced genetic engineering, and a great deal of rethinking was done concerning the level of Klingon technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Shane|last2=Punchatz|first2=Don Ivan|title=The Worlds of the Federation|date=1989|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=9780671708139|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; John M. Ford, in ''The Final Reflection'', suggests that human-Klingon fusions are similar to the human-Vulcan fusion that resulted in Spock's birth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Video games==

*The chronology of ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series was subject to much debate among fans until an official timeline was printed in the collector's book ''[[The Legend of Zelda#Fictional chronology|Hyrule Historia]]'', released in Japan on December 21, 2011.&lt;ref name="Official Legend of Zelda Timeline Revealed"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://gamecrunch.co/2011/12/22/official-legend-of-zelda-timeline-revealed/ |title=Official Legend of Zelda Timeline Revealed |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2011-12-22 |accessdate=2016-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426070944/http://gamecrunch.co/2011/12/22/official-legend-of-zelda-timeline-revealed/ |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/ |title=Nintendo of Europe &amp;#124; Nintendo |publisher=Officialnintendomagazine.co.uk |date=2015-08-15 |accessdate=2015-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031155115/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/ |archivedate=2014-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyrule Historia contains a timeline that explains how each game fits within the storyline. This includes introducing a three-way split after ''Ocarina of Time''. ''The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword'' helps explain the appearance of multiple Zelda, Link and Ganondorf characters across hundreds of years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
*The original ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'' trilogy for the NES was followed years later by a new series of sequels produced by [[Team Ninja]] beginning with ''[[Ninja Gaiden (2004 video game)|Ninja Gaiden]]'' for the Xbox in 2004. However, the second generation of ''Ninja Gaiden'' video games, being prequels to original series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mielke |first=James |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3164447 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522141623/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3164447 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-22 |title=Ninja Gaiden 2 Preview for 360 from |publisher=1UP.com |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2015-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yin |first=Wesley |url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/ninja_gaiden_2/preview-948.html |title=Ninja Gaiden 2 Interview for Xbox 360 |publisher=VideoGamer.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205161412/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/ninjagaidenii/news.html?sid=6191514&amp;part=rss&amp;subj=6191514 ]&lt;/ref&gt; has many differences from the NES trilogy. The character design of [[Ryu Hayabusa]] in the new games is now based on the ''[[Dead or Alive (franchise)|Dead or Alive]]'' incarnation of the character with long hair and green eyes, the character design of Ryu's father, Ken Hayabusa, has been updated as well, the character now being addressed in the English versions by his original name in the Japanese versions (Jo Hayabusa), and producer Tomonobu Itagaki hints at the possibility that Sonia, a character from the new games, might be Irene Lew from the original series.&lt;ref name="gamespot1"/&gt; With the release of ''[[Dead or Alive: Dimensions]]'' in 2011, it has been revealed that Sonia is indeed Irene Lew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video game | title = Dead or Alive: Dimensions | developer = Team Ninja| publisher = Tecmo| date = 2011-05-24| platform = Nintendo 3DS| version = 1.0| level = Chapter 2| quote = '''Ryu Hayabusa''': Hayate, meet Irene /...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a-mn2EVpFI&amp;t=10m7s |title=Dead or Alive Dimensions Nintendo 3DS Chronicle Mode Chapter 2 Part 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Metal Gear (video game)|Metal Gear]]'', the character [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]] serves as [[Solid Snake]]'s commanding officer and is apparently revealed near the end of the game to also be the main antagonist. However, ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' establishes the antagonist character to actually be a body double of the real Big Boss, called Venom Snake, who is killed by Solid Snake during this encounter. The original Big Boss later becomes the antagonist in the series' second entry, ''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title= Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain |developer= Kojima Productions |publisher= Konami |date= 2015-09-01 |platform= PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PC |version= |scene= |level= Truth: The Man Who Sold The World |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the ending of 2006's ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', Sonic and Elise blow out the flame of Solaris, undoing all changes made by Iblis and causing the entire story to never happen; thus undoing all the inconsistencies the game's plot caused. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Ignored sequels in various media==

*The film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' loosely continues the storylines of ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Superman II]]'', and disregards the events of ''[[Superman III]]'' and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=superman-returns |title=Movies |publisher=Superman Homepage |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'' is the only entry in the series that does not feature the series antagonist [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], nor does it include story elements from either ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) or ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981). In fact, it treats the first film and, apparently, its sequel as [[Story within a story#Film within a film|fictional films]], as one of the characters watches a trailer for the original during the film; additionally, the film's tagline is a reference to the tagline from the original as well. The film ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' is a direct sequel to ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' and ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'', dismissing the events that take place in the sequels ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'', ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' and ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]''. The subsequent film ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'' follows the new continuity of ''Halloween H20'', however, it retcons that film's ending in order to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karina Wilson |url=http://www.horrorfilmhistory.com/index.php?pageID=1970s |title=Horror Film History — Horror Films in the 1970s |publisher=Horrorfilmhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 film, [[Halloween (2018 film)|''Halloween'']], will be a direct sequel to the [[Halloween (1978 film)|original film]] while disregarding the previous sequels from [[canon (fiction)|canon]], and [[retcon]]ing the ending of the first film.&lt;ref name="DontPeople"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/danny-mcbride-halloween-just-hope-dont-fk-piss-people-off-183213419.html |title=Danny McBride on 'Halloween': 'I just hope that we don't f*** it up and piss people off' |last=Bierly |first=Mandi |date=2017-11-13 |website=[[Yahoo!]] |access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Texas Chainsaw 3D]]'' and its prequel ''[[Leatherface (2017 film)|Leatherface]]'' follow the continuity of ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', ignoring the events of the other sequels.
*The fifth film in the [[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator series]], ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' (2015), completely disregards the events of the third and fourth Terminator films, ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003) and ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' (2009). In the upcoming [[Terminator 6|sixth Terminator film]] in 2019, ''Terminator Genisys'' itself will be ignored, in addition to ignoring the 2003 and 2009 sequels. Only the [[The Terminator|original 1984 film]] and the first sequel ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991) will be considered canon to the 2019 film.

[[File:Hans Baluschek Peterchens Mondfahrt Einband 1915.jpg|thumb|180px|Original book cover from 1915]]
'''''Little Peter's Journey to the Moon''''' ([[German language|German]] '''''Peterchens Mondfahrt''''') is a [[fairy tale]] written by German author and playwright [[Gerdt von Bassewitz]]. It was first performed as a play in [[Leipzig]] in 1912 and appeared in 1915 as a storybook for children with illustrations by [[Hans Baluschek]]. A 2007 English translation names the book '''''Peter and Anneli's Journey to the Moon'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bassewitz|first1=Gerdt|title=Peter and Anneli's Journey to the Moon|date=2007|publisher=Bell Pond Books|location=Great Barrington, MA|isbn=978-0880105842|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the story of Little Peter and his sister Anneli, who help a [[Cockchafer|May beetle]] named Mr. Zoomzeman (German: ''Herr Summsemann'') to retrieve his missing sixth leg from the moon. After a fantastic and dangerous overnight adventure they recover the leg and are returned to their beds at home.

A thief, stealing wood in the forest, had cut off Mr. Zoomzeman’s great-great grandfather's sixth leg many years before. The Night Fairy banished the thief to the moon as punishment, but he took the leg with him, causing later generations of the Zoomzeman family to only have five legs.

The current Mr. Zoomzeman can break the curse and recover his missing leg if he finds two children who are pure of heart and have never been cruel to animals. He enters the house of Little Peter and his younger sister Anneli (''Anneliese'') and tells them the story. They promise to help him retrieve the lost leg. Mr. Zoomzeman teaches them a magical chant that allows them to fly and they set off for the moon.

On the moon they meet the [[Sandman]], who looks after the star children, each corresponding to a child on Earth. As their own stars are untarnished and shine brightly it proves Peter and Anneli are pure of heart. The Sandman is impressed and offers to take the three heroes to the Night Fairy's tea party at her castle.

They travel in Sandman's celestial chariot, along the [[milky way]], where the children learn about cosmic phenomena.

Meanwhile, the Night Fairy has invited lots of celestial guests to her midnight party. These include the thunder man (''Donnermann''), the wind bride (''Windliesel''), the cloud woman (''Wolkenfrau''), the lightning witch (''Blitzhexe''), Rainy Fritz (''Regenfritz''), the gale giant (''Sturmriese''), Hail Hans (''Hagelhans''), [[Mother Hulda]] (''Frau Holle''), Ice Max (''Eismax''), the [[vodyanoy]] (''Wassermann''), Mary-of-the-dew (''Taumariechen''), [[morning glory]] (''Morgenröte''), the [[afterglow]] (''Abendröte''), the [[Sirius|morning star]] (''Morgenstern'') and the [[Venus|evening star]] (''Abendstern''). The Guardian of the Milky Way appears and complains about the chaos caused by the guests travelling to the meeting. The guests apologize and offer the guardian gifts.

Sandman and the adventurers arrive, surprising the guests as he is never usually late and by bringing humans. Mr. Zoomzeman's sad story prompts the celestial spirits to offer help. The Night Fairy asks the Guardian of the Milky Way to summon the [[Ursa major|Great Bear]]. Peter, Anneli and Mr. Zoomzeman are carried by the bear to the moon cannon, via a meadow where gifts and sweets are grown for Christmas and past the nest where a hen lays colourful Easter eggs. The cannon fires the adventurers up onto a hill where the lost sixth leg is nailed to a sacred birch tree.

At the tree the heroes are confronted by the Man in the Moon, a cruel, violent cannibal. In the fight to prevent the children from being eaten the celestial spirits attack the Man in the Moon and Peter battles with his wooden toy sword. Anneli summons her and Peter's stars, who blind the Man in the Moon. The evil giant cannot see and gets lost in the deep moon woods.

Little Peter retrieves the sixth leg and Anneli attaches it to the unconscious beetle. Mr. Zoomzeman wakes and is delighted, but they must return to earth immediately to avoid being stuck on the moon forever. He uses an old charm which creates a hole. The children jump into the hole and fall back into their bedroom on Earth.

Dawn breaks and the children open the window to let Mr. Zoomzeman fly away. Their mother enters the bedroom bringing a gift of gingerbread from Father Christmas.

== Background ==
In 2010 a biography of [[Otto Klemperer]] by Eva Weissweiler published in Germany stated that Peter and Anneli were based on the children of [[Oskar Kohnstamm]], in whose sanatorium von Bassewitz had been a patient.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Weissweiler: ''Otto Klemperer: Ein deutsch-jüdisches Künstlerleben'', Köln, 2010, p.85 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Kohnstamm (1908–1995) was the father of [[Angus Konstam]].

== Film Adaptation ==
It was adapted as a German [[animated film]] [[Peter in Magicland]] ([[German language]] title: '''Peterchens Mondfahrt''') in 1990.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5451">[[File:Malaysian Batik.jpg|thumb|right|A batik craftsman making [[batik]], Malaysian batik are usually patterned with floral motifs with light colouring.]]

'''Malaysian Batik''' is [[batik]] textile art of [[Malaysia]], especially on the east coast of Malaysia ([[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Pahang]]). The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik depicting humans or animals are rare because Islam norms forbid animal images as decoration. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception. The Malaysian batik is also famous for its geometrical designs, such as spirals. The method of Malaysian batik making is also quite different from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern is larger and simpler, it seldom or never uses ''canting'' to create intricate patterns and rely heavily on [[brush]] [[painting]] method to apply colours on fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik.

In line with the Malaysia concept, the Malaysian government is now endorsing Malaysian batik as a national dress to every level of the general population, by having local designers to create new batik designs which reflect the Malaysia idea.&lt;ref&gt;Malaysia Activities At State Level Throughout Next Year Bernama.com, accessed 4 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Drawing Malaysian Batik.jpg|thumb|left|The drawing of Malaysian batik.]]
The origin of batik production in Malaysia it is known trade relations between the [[Melayu Kingdom]] in [[Jambi]] and Javanese coastal cities have thrived since the 13th century, the northern coastal batik producing areas of [[Java]] (Cirebon, Lasem, Tuban, and Madura) has influenced Jambi batik. This Jambi (Sumatran) batik, as well as Javanese batik, has influenced the batik craft in the [[Malay peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Traveller Indonesia, Vol 1, No 6, 2009, Jakarta, Indonesia, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Museum of Cultural History, Oslo|Museum of Cultural History]] of Oslo, it is known for certain that the Javanese influenced Malay batik-making technically as well as in the development of designs. At an early stage the Malaysians used wooden blocks in order to produce batik-like textiles. As late as the 1920s Javanese batik makers introduced the use of wax and copper blocks on Malaysia's east coast. The production of hand drawn batik in Malaysia is of recent date and is related to the Javanese batik tulis.

Commercial production started in the 1960s. This craft has developed its own particular aesthetic and design, peculiar to Malaysia. The new Malaysian batik is clearly different from the Javanese tradition of hand-painted batiks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khm.uio.no/utstillinger/malaysia/engelsk/0_b_side1.html Malaysia - Batikktradisjoner i bevegelse]&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian batik can be found on the east coast of Malaysia such as Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang, while batik in Johor clearly shows Javanese and Sumatran influences since there are a large number of Javanese and Sumatran immigrants in southern Malaysia.

==Culture==
[[File:Malaysian Batik shop.jpg|thumb|right|A Batik shop in Malaysia selling a variety of Malaysian batik.]]
Batik was mentioned in the 17th century [[Malay Annals]]. The legend goes when [[Laksamana Hang Nadim]] was ordered by Sultan Mahmud to sail to India to get 140 pieces of ''serasah'' cloth (batik) with 40 types of flowers depicted on each. Unable to find any that fulfilled the requirements explained to him, he made up his own. On his return unfortunately, his ship sank and he only managed to bring four pieces, earning displeasure from the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dewan sastra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYVkAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society: 1952|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZlhAAAAMAAJ|year=1953|publisher=The Branch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For men, Batik can be worn at dinner functions. Even the ladies wear the fabric as formal dress, combining batik with modern fashion.
The Malaysian government encourages civil servants to wear batik during the 1st and 15th day of the month. In Sabah, East Malaysia, teachers are encouraged to wear batik shirts or baju kurung to school on Thursdays - usually the school will have a particular patterned fabric which will be provided to every teacher to take to the tailor, so that their clothing matches.

'''''Megaville''''' is an [[independent film|independent]]/[[low-budget film|low-budget]] [[direct-to-video]] 1990 [[United States|American]] [[science fiction]] film, starring [[Billy Zane]] in his first lead role. ''Megaville'' is a [[neo-noir]] [[psychological thriller]] which utilizes elements of science fiction such as [[cyberpunk]] and [[existentialism]].

==Plot==
National boundaries have been broken, two giant super-states remain—a bleak, decaying Hemisphere, and the sprawling media state Megaville. Travel between the states is restricted. The "CKS" governs daily life in the Hemisphere. All forms of media are illegal here.

Raymond Palinov, an unassuming captain of the media police finds himself drawn to a spaghetti western and cannot pull away from it during a media raid. Palinov is ostracized by his superior for the incident. After nearly losing his job, Palinov begins to exhibit strange character traits. During a rally in which outlawed media recordings are shown to the media police as examples of contraband, Palinov laughs out loud at a comedy clip. Palinov then appears to have a complete mental breakdown and loses consciousness. Whereas most agents would have been terminated following such an incident, Palinov is spared. Palinov is found to be exhibiting unusual brain activity and is sent for an examination. Palinov explains to Dr. Vogel that he has been having bizarre flashbacks and seeing memories in dreams which are not his own. Dr. Vogel tells Palinov he believes the strange behavior is due to years of exposure to media "filth" and initiates a procedure which will remove the unexplained brain activity and restore Palinov's personality in its entirety. The procedure doesn't work and Palinov's mental episodes become steadily worse.

Palinov is contacted by Mr. Duprell, the director of the CKS, with an infiltration assignment. The Hemisphere war against media is about to intensify with news of the introduction of "Dream-A-Life" (DAL) a hallucination-inducing consumer product. People in Megaville could start new lives in their own fantasy world of choice. The government of Megaville has deemed DAL legal and its use has become prevalent with the help of a mysterious figure in the Megaville underworld known as Mr. Newman. Duprell explains that Palinov bears a striking physical resemblance to Newman's only known contact in the Hemisphere, Mr. Jensen. Palinov's mission is to assume Jensen's life and infiltrate the criminal underworld of both the Hemisphere and Megaville, discover who Newman is working with, and who Newman's contacts are in the Hemisphere. In order to assist his infiltration, Palinov is implanted with some of Jensen's memories.
As he slips into the role, he soon meets Jensen's almost lover, Christine, a former demolitions expert for the armed forces who went AWOL after being ordered to kill civilians. Christine demands that Jensen take her to Megaville. Christine and Palinov travel to Megaville and meet Newman, who refuses to reveal any information about his operation. Meanwhile, the president of Megaville, outspoken against DAL, is assassinated. Palinov suspects Newman is involved, but the only witness is the president's personal aide, who is now permanently trapped in a DAL induced hallucination.

When Palinov attempts to remove the headset, the aide is shot in broad daylight by Newman. Duprell contacts Palinov through his [[brain implant]], informs him to close the deal with Newman or his mother will die; Duprell does not want to stop DAL, he wants in on the deal. Palinov refuses and Duprell attempts to kill him via the implant. Palinov's mother saves him by destroying Duprell's transmitting device, but is then murdered. However, before she dies she reveals the truth to Palinov; she is not his mother at all, he is actually Jensen the man he thinks he is impersonating, Palinov's mind is the fake. Palinov escapes with Christine, pursued by Megaville's underworld; all except Palinov are killed in a shoot-out.
Duprell has been watching Palinovs mind, which Palinov finally realizes. He uses a DAL device to fake Duprell's activities on a Megaville national broadcast, which Duprell believes to be real. Palinov says all the evidence of the conspiracy is in a briefcase at Christine's apartment. Duprell opens it and detonates the bomb inside. Newman reveals to Palinov that he is Jensen's biological father and claims he wishes they had spent more time together before shooting Palinov. Newman then notices his leg is handcuffed to Palinov and he is now trapped in the desert.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22277">'''Modular art''' is art created by joining together standardized units ([[Modular design|module]]s) to form larger, more complex compositions. In some works the units can be subsequently moved, removed and added to – that is, ''modulated'' – to create a new work of art, different from the original or ensuing configurations.

== Origins ==
Historically, alterable objects of art have existed since the [[Renaissance]], for example, in the [[Triptych]] "[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]" by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] or in the so-called "alterable [[altarpiece]]s", such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] by [[Matthias Grünewald]], or [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Dürer's]] [[Paumgartner altarpiece]], where changing motifs could be revised in accord with the changing themes of the ecclesiastical calendar.

== 20th century ==
Beginning in the first half of the 20th century, a number of contemporary artists sought to incorporate [[kinetic art|kinetic techniques]] into their work in an attempt to overcome what they saw as the predominantly static nature of art. [[Alexander Calder|Alexander Calder's]] mobiles are among the most widely known demonstrations of physical dynamism in the visual arts, in which form has the potential to continually vary through perpetual motion, sometimes even without the agency of the human hand. [[Jean Tinguely|Jean Tinguely's]] efforts to create a self-destructive art machine constitute perhaps the ultimate expression of art's mutability, in this case by taking the form of its total eradication. [[Victor Vasarely]] postulated in his ''Manifest Jaune'' in 1955 in Paris that works of art should feature the properties of being multiplicable and repeatable in series. More recently, the notion that visual art need not be conceived solely in terms of perpetually fixed objects is embodied in performance and installation art by virtue of their unfolding and temporary qualities.&lt;ref&gt;See "Modularity in the arts" in [[Modularity]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Industrial design and architecture ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Image:Pfarrkirche Liesing - Erwin Hauer Design 3.JPG|thumb|alt=An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.|An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.]][[Modularity]] enters the modern artistic repertory largely through the disciplines of industrial design and architecture. Belgian architect [[Louis Herman De Koninck]] led a team of countrymen in creating one of the first modular product systems in their Cubex kitchen series of 1932. The series consisted of standardized and industrially produced components that could be combined and arrayed in limitless combinations to accommodate almost any size kitchen. New York designer [[Gilbert Rohde]] crafted several lines of modular casework for the [[Herman Miller (office equipment)|Herman Miller Corporation]] in the 1930s and 40s; like De Koninck, Rohde standardized the units in dimensions, materials and configurations to facilitate mass production and interchangeability. His Executive Office Group (EOG) line, launched in 1942, was a similarly ground-breaking systems approach to office furniture. Just a year before [[Eero Saarinen]] and [[Charles Eames]] had jointly produced a suite of modular domestic furniture for the Red Lion Company, a result of a competition held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1950 Herman Miller brought out the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100526040623/http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Eames-Desk-and-Storage-Units EAS Storage Unit series] by Charles and Ray Eames, a very successful modular shelving and wall unit system that remains in production today.

The module enjoys a long history in the realm of architecture. In antiquity architects utilized the module primarily as a unit of measurement guiding the proportions of plan and elevation. The Roman author and architect Vitruvius deployed the modular method in his descriptions of the classical orders and the composition of buildings in his treatise ''Ten Books on Architecture'', the only complete text on architecture to survive from antiquity. Architects of the Renaissance perpetuated the Vitruvian system in their resurrection of the classical orders, a tradition which continues to the present day. Among modern architects, the module is frequently employed as a design and planning tool.

=== Modular constructivism ===
{{main|Modular Constructivism}}
Architecture and modular sculpture intersected starting in the 1950s in the work of [[Norman Carlberg]], [[Erwin Hauer]] and Malcolm Leland. All three received commissions to design perforated architectural screens built out of repetitive modular motives cast in concrete. Non-structural, the screens were used on building exteriors to divide space, filter light and create visual interest. Their work has come to be described as [[Modular Constructivism]], reflecting both its compositional methodology and its architectural context. Each created stand-alone modular-themed sculptures into the 1960s and after as well.

=== Modularity in the fine arts===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s [https://www.flickr.com/photos/ondahalfoster/2546134482/ "White Painting"] of 1951; consisting of just four equal white squares, with its geometry of interlocking forms, is among the earliest statements of modularity as an autonomous subject of art. Rauschenberg explored this theme that same year in a three- and seven-panel format; the linear array of rectangular panels in these versions suggests their potentially infinite replication.  The cool abstraction of these canvases presages the emergence of modularity as a full-fledged topic of [[Minimalist art]] in the 1960s. [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Flavin]] and [[Donald Judd]] are among this school's most prolific exponents during the period. In particular, the work of Smith is key to understanding the transformation of modularity from a compositional and production tool into a broadly investigated artistic theme in its own right.

[[Image:Minneapolis14.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, Minnesota.|Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, MN.]]Smith began his career as an architectural designer. To further his education he apprenticed himself on some projects by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] for a couple of years starting in 1938. From Wright he learned to utilize modular systems in generating architectural designs in two-dimensional plans as well as in three-dimensional applications, such as the development of building sections and interior built-ins. As an architect, Wright himself was part of a centuries-old continuum stretching back through [[Vitruvius]] to Greco-Roman antiquity in which the module was utilized to proportion built and sculpted form. In the case of Wright, the interest in modular design also may have derived from his familiarity with [[tatami|modular practice in traditional Japanese architecture]].

Wright's Hanna House of 1937 is a clear example of the master's facility with modern modular design in multiple dimensions. Its striking angled forms are built up from the individual hexagonal modules that define the floor plan and various vertical elements. Wright's use of the hexagon here is by no means an arbitrary aesthetic choice, but an example of how he rooted his architecture in nature by drawing from its forms and principles – the interlocking hexagonal cells of the bee's honeycomb being nature's most perfect representation of modular design. Not surprisingly, this project is sometimes  referred to as the "Honeycomb House".

Smith would employ the hexagon and other elemental geometries in his own architectural practice and again in the sculpture he began to fabricate in the early 1960s. Freed from the programmatic and extensive structural requirements of his architectural work, Smith's sculptures are three-dimensional extrusions of modular form with no ostensible pragmatic purpose beyond aesthetic contemplation.

Significantly, Smith himself did not manually fabricate the final version of his sculptures. Instead, he outsourced their production to skilled ironworkers in foundries and industrial facilities, who worked off his drawings and models to manufacture the designs. In part this reflects Smith's training as an architect, who customarily designs and documents but does not construct his art. It further reinforces the idea of modular art as a [[generative art|generative system]] in which the arrangement of pre-determined formal units – rather than wholesale imaginative invention – defines the creative act. Finally, it is consistent with the notion implicit in modularity that the supply of modules in a modular system must be infinite, that is, that they be industrially rather than artisanally produced, for the system to be realized. (Bees in a honeycomb are essentially operating as an industrial enterprise insofar as the production of cells is without end.)

The work of Smith and the minimalist school constitute the most far-ranging exploration of modularity in art before the millennium. However, neither it nor the explorations of movable and alterable art in the preceding centuries synthesized the two central features of modular art. Mobiles and other kinetic pieces were not modular, and the modular work of the mid-century Minimalist artists was, with a few exceptions, not changeable.

=== Co-creativity ===
A school of thought coming out of the United States emphasizes modular art's alignment with the [[post-industrial]] character of 21st century culture and its contrast with traditional notions of art.&lt;ref&gt;[Rattner, Donald]. "A Comparison of Conventional and Modular Art" in ''[http://issuu.com/art-rethought/docs/art_catalogue?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed A.R.T. Catalogue v2.0]''. New York: lulu.com, 2010. Pp. C-1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Core characteristics of post-industrialism, as largely defined by the theorist [[Daniel Bell]] in his 1973 book ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'', include the emergence of a service economy in place of a manufacturing one; the social and economic pre-eminence of the creative, professional and technical classes; the central place of theoretical knowledge as a font of innovation; the strong influence of technology on daily life; and high levels of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Daniel. ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society''. New York: Harper Colophon Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modular art appears to synchronize perfectly with several of these criteria. For example, its manual changeability opens up the possibility of co-creative art, in which the collector or user collaborates with the originating modular artist to jointly determine the appearance of the work of art. This presupposes the existence of creative people capable of and interested in serving such a role – a demographic evolution that was already underway in Bell's time and that has since been studied in works like Richard Florida's ''Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Florida, Richard. ''The Rise of the Creative Class and How It's Transforming Work, Leisure and Everyday Life''. Basic Books, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Co-creation]] is closely associated with [[mass customization]], a production model that combines the opportunity for individual personalization with mass production. Modular art and mass customization share a commonality in their synthesis of two opposing qualities. On the one hand, as previously stated the very concept of modularity implies a limitless supply of identical modules such as only industrial production can provide; on the other hand, the ability of the individual to re-arrange these modules in the work of art based on aesthetic criteria re-injects a subjective and purely human dimension into the creative act.

Mass customization is itself only made possible with the advent of computers and a type of software known as a [[configurator]]. A configurator is a software tool used by the buyer to configure a product from the options made available by the vendor. Applied to the purpose of composing a work of modular art onscreen, it can greatly facilitate the design of a modular assembly by allowing the user to study multiple design options more quickly and in far greater depth than by using analog methods. Once the design is established a computer file is then sent over the air to a manufacturing facility where robotically controlled equipment produces the object according to its specifications. Not only does this computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) allow for the customization of mass-produced objects, it also enables a much higher level of precision and fit – qualities critical for modules to be physically joined together. Bell's identification of technology as a central axis of post-industrial life is underscored in the intertwining of the digital with the physical realization of modular art.

=== The de- and re-constructive approach in Europe ===
In Europe, where the 1960s Minimalist school of modular art was often seen as a principally American phenomenon, the discussion of modularity often focuses on its changeability. For example, the mutability of art is a core principle of [[Arte Povera]], a contemporaneous movement that emerged in Italy which holds that works of art "should not be seen as fixed entities", but as objects of change and movement to "include time and space in a new manner. At stake is the issue of transferring the phenomenology of human experience" into the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monopol-magazin.com/magazine/2009/09/interview-carolyn-christov-bakargiev Interview with Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev.] See also: Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. ''Arte Povera (Themes &amp; Movements)''. New York: Phaidon Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the artist [[Leda Luss Luyken]] has produced modular paintings, composed of movable painted panels set in steel frames. Luss Luyken has dubbed her work "ModulArt".&lt;ref&gt;The term "ModulArt" was first mentioned in 1975 in a German arts encyclopedia as "a form of art […] made by movable elements that […] transfer the object into a new state of being by moving their variable parts" in: Ludewig, Werner (Ed.). ''Kunst – Literatur – Musik, Daten und Fakten''. Lexikon-Institut Bertelsmann, 1975, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, changing the configuration of a modular painting constitutes a form of motion, offering the spectator alternative views and alternative interpretations, and thus aligning the work more closely than a static object to the dynamism of physical human experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/ModulArt&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian and theorist [[Denys Zacharopoulos]] called this "a new way of motion in painting".&lt;ref&gt;von Kap-herr, Georg (Ed.). ''ModulArt''. Bobingen (Germany), 2008, pp. 6-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of modular art allows the user to de-compose and to re-compose a work of art that is already completed by re-arranging its parts, thus providing numerous possibilities for ever newer pictures not yet imagined. The original painting can be re-contextualized ad libitum and ad infinitum.

== Modular artists and their work ==

===Visual artists===
Working in the 1950-60s in Manchester (UK), American artist [[Mitzi Cunliffe]] developed sculptures consisting of multiple blocks about twelve inches square which she put together in a variety of combinations to give a sculptured effect on a large scale. She referred to them as ''modular sculptures''. The University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) acquired some of these works, although there are no references to them in published accounts of her work.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated 19 December 08 by Prof. E.G. Wedell, Manchester (UK), friend and landlord of Mitzi Cunliffe in Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptor and ceramicist Malcolm Leland designed in 1954 a similar [http://www.mocad.org/store/Vessel_LS_Fountain.html modular sculpture system] based on a single 23-inch tall module that could be stacked vertically by means of a centering pin; the module has a generally biomorphic, curvilinear outline that yields an undulating silhouette when multiple modules are placed on top of each other. The technique of stacking repetitive elements in the round recalls [[Endless Column|Brancusi's "Endless Column"]] of 1938.

Starting in the 1970s, Leland's contemporary Norman Carlberg produced groups of [http://www.francisfrost.com/carlbergprint.html square framed prints] which he placed together on a wall in a tight grid, each print conceived as an independent module. The viewer is then invited to rotate or reposition them to generate new composite images. The abstract quality of the prints enhanced the creative possibilities of their re-orientation insofar as they are non-directional and geometrically inter-related.

Greek-born [[conceptual artist]] [[Leda Luss Luyken]], who was initially trained as an architect, has been exploring [[modularity]] in the medium of painting since the 1990s. In her work standardized canvas panels are mounted as modules onto a steel frame within which they can be moved and rotated.

In the U.S. Moshé Elimelech creates what he has called [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107101439/http://www.mosheart.com/cubes/index.html "Cubic Constructions"]. These are multiple groupings of approximately three-inch cubes set inside pockets in a framed shadow box. On each cube he applies paint in fields of bright color and abstract pattern with precise, controlled brush strokes. Like Carlsberg, Elimelech then invites the viewer to reposition any or all of the cubes to display one of their six sides, each of which is painted in a different pattern. Exhibiting since the 1980s, Elimelech shows primarily in California galleries, and has work represented in several museum design stores as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807164738/http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |archive-date=2003-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another portfolio of interactive modular art comes out of [http://www.s4aa.com Studio for A.R.T. and Architecture], a New York-based firm headed by Donald Rattner. Rattner has designed modular art in the media of wall sculpture, rotational paintings, tapestries, artist's wallpapers and artist's books. To bring his work and those of other "modulartists" to the marketplace, Rattner founded [http://www.art-rethought.com A.R.T. (art-rethought)], an art storefront focused on co-creative and modular work. In his writings Rattner has emphasized the post-industrial aspect of the most recent trends in modular art, coining the term "New Industrialism" to denote mass customization, production on demand, open innovation, co-creative design, tele-fabrication, robotics and other computer-driven technologies that are re-defining how things are made in the global marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/the_studio_portfolio/docs/studio_portfolio_-_art?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true. Pp. A-3f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composers===
Modularity in music can be seen as bringing two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting:{{Clarify|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--Painting? What has this to do with music?--&gt; [[Variation (music)|variation]] of a theme and [[Moving image|movement]] of and within a picture. For this very reason the contemporary composer Minas Borboudakis has dedicated the third part of his trilogy ROAI III for piano and electronics to the modular methodology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Italian composer and arts theoretician [[Stefano Vagnini]] has developed a theory of [[Open source|open-source composition]] based on modular aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;Vagnini, Stafano, ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, 161 pp, Rome: Falcon Valley Music, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a musical work of art being something closed, limited and immobile disappears in favor of a process of numerous aggregations that allow a composition to become infinite in principle. Several such compositions were performed in Europe, South America, Asia and in North America and discussed through conferences in Europe. The approach is being academically discussed at the [[University of West Georgia]] and the Carrollton Cultural Arts Centre in the USA. Writer, painter, and art theorist Gian Ruggero Manzoni described the modularity of Vagnini's compositions  as “circular like the existence, his works are not finished, but merely stimulus for new voices”. &lt;ref&gt;Gian Ruggero Manzoni, in: Vagnini, Stefano:'' SalmodieSubliminali'', Campanotto Editions, Udine, 2007, pp 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

  |quote= Some of Moorcock's genre fiction is borderline SF, though most of it is better described as fantasy. One of the most impressive aspects of this achievement is the way in which he has linked much of his fiction together into one monumental sequence, The Tale of The Eternal Champion. Central to this ongoing series is Moorcock's concept of the Multiverse. The Multiverse was introduced in Moorcock's early novel ''The Sundered Worlds'' and is an imaginative construct of transitorally intersecting parallel and alternate worlds, an infinite series of concurrent, sometimes intertwined universes between which the Eternal Champion moves.  This Multiverse concept has been accepted by Physics as the Many World Theorem lending authenticity to Moorcock's ideas.  The idea that there are an infinite number of worlds as real as our own provides quite the platform for elaboration and conjecture by authors of today and tomorrow.  Moorcock's multiverse stands as perhaps the first exploration of these many worlds and the possibilities within"

Worlds governed by incompatible premises are not, however, barred from each other and in this sense the overall concept belongs more properly to fantasy than to Sf.

'''''[[Odalisque]] with Slave''''' (French: ''L'Odalisque à l'esclave'') is an 1839 painting by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] commissioned by Charles Marcotte. Executed in oil on canvas, it depicts a nude odalisque, a musician, and a [[eunuch]] in a harem interior. 
The painting is in the [[Fogg Art Museum]] in [[Cambridge (Massachusetts)|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]]. It is a classic piece of [[Orientalism]] in French painting.

==History==
Ingres painted a number of harem scenes during his long career, starting with the ''[[Grande Odalisque]]'' (1814). These works exemplify a taste for Orientalist subject matter shared by many French painters of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era, notably Ingres' rival [[Eugène Delacroix]]. As Ingres never visited the Near East, ''Odalisque with Slave'' depicts an imaginary scene.&lt;ref&gt;Boime 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=24Hgr0U8K3QC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq= p. 381].&lt;/ref&gt; It was composed in Rome, where the artist lived from 1835 to 1841 while serving as director of the French Academy there.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn and Siegfried 1980, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The odalisque was painted from a life drawing Ingres had made years earlier.&lt;ref name=Cohn_Siegfried_116/&gt; The musician was painted from a model posed in the studio, and many details such as the [[tanbour]] were derived from engravings.&lt;ref name=Cohn_Siegfried_116&gt;Cohn and Siegfried 1980, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingres labored over the execution with his usual great care, and enlisted some of his students as assistants. One of them was [[Raymond Balze]], who wrote of his experience:&lt;blockquote&gt;Ingres began his studies from nature and prepared the rough sketch on his canvas, then had made by his students the less important parts, ''very finished'', such as the architecture, mosaics, rugs, furniture, instruments, which he often had [them] reposition, reluctantly [as he was] satisfied with their execution ... Then everything being finished with the figures, he alone undertook to harmonize the ensemble with onion skins of color.&lt;ref name=Cohn_Siegfried_118&gt;Cohn and Siegfried 1980, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Jean-Paul_Flandrin_-_Odalisque_with_Slave_-_Walters_37887.jpg|thumb|300px|1842 version, in the [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]]]]
In September 1840 the painting was delivered to Paris, where it won praise from critics who viewed it in the owner's home. When exhibited publicly in 1845, the painting was widely admired, and written about by [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] and [[Théophile Thoré-Bürger]].&lt;ref name=Cohn_Siegfried_118/&gt;

Ingres made a second version in 1842 with the help of two of his students, [[Paul Jean Flandrin|Paul]] and [[Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin]], which is at the [[Walters Art Museum]] in [[Baltimore]]. In this version the background wall, described by art historian Karin Grimme as imprisoning the odalisque in "a room with no exit",&lt;ref&gt;Grimme 2006, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; was replaced with a garden painted by Paul Flandrin, inspired by the park at the [[Château de Dampierre]].

The [[Louvre]] owns a carefully finished drawing Ingres made in 1858 that replicates the 1839 composition.&lt;ref&gt;Prat 2004, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Victor Jules Signac''' ({{IPA-fr|pɔl siɲak|lang}}; 11 November 1863 – 15 August 1935) was a French [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] [[Painting|painter]] who, working with [[Georges Seurat]], helped develop the [[pointillism|Pointillist]] style.

== Biography ==
Paul Signac was born in Paris on 11 November 1863. He followed a course of training in [[architecture]] before deciding at the age of 18 to pursue a career as a painter after attending an exhibit of [[Monet]]'s work. He sailed around the coasts of Europe, painting the landscapes he encountered. He also painted a series of watercolors of French harbor cities in later years.

[[File:Signac - Portrait de Félix Fénéon.jpg|thumb|alt=painting|Paul Signac, ''Portrait of [[Félix Fénéon]]'', 1890, oil on canvas, 73.5 × 92.5 cm (28.9 × 36.4 in), [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]
[[File:Seurat Paul Signac.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=painting|[[Georges Seurat]] ''Portrait of Paul Signac,'' 1890, [[conté]] crayon, private collection]]
In 1884 he met [[Claude Monet]] and [[Georges Seurat]]. He was struck by the systematic working methods of Seurat and by his theory of colors and became Seurat's faithful supporter, friend and heir with his description of [[Neo-Impressionism]] and [[Divisionism]]  method.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhberg Kark, Art of the 20th Century Benedikt Taschen Verlag GMBH 1998 {{ISBN|3-8228-4089-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Seurat's influence he abandoned the short brushstrokes of [[Impressionism]] to experiment with scientifically juxtaposed small dots of pure color, intended to combine and blend not on the canvas but in the viewer's eye, the defining feature of Pointillism.
Many of Signac's paintings are of the French coast. He loved to paint the water. He left the capital each summer, to stay in the south of France in the village of Collioure or at [[St. Tropez]], where he bought a house and invited his friends.

Paul Signac, [[Albert Dubois-Pillet]], [[Odilon Redon]] and Georges Seurat were among the founders of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]]. The association began in Paris 29 July 1884 with the organization of massive exhibitions, with the device "No jury nor awards" (''Sans jury ni récompense''). "The purpose of Société des Artistes Indépendants—based on the principle of abolishing admission jury—is to allow the artists to present their works to public judgement with complete freedom".&lt;ref name="Indépendants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistes-independants.fr/index.php?page=historique&amp;chlangue=us|title=Société des Artistes Indépendants|website=www.artistes-independants.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the following three decades their annual exhibitions set the trends in art of the early 20th century.

At the 1905 Salon des Indépendants, [[Henri Matisse]] exhibited the proto-[[Fauvism|Fauve]] painting ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]''. In the [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] technique and brightly colored, it was painted in 1904, after a summer spent working in [[St. Tropez]] on the [[French Riviera]] alongside the [[neo-Impressionism|neo-Impressionist]] painters Paul Signac and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;UCLA Art Council et al. 1966, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is Matisse's most important work in which he used the Divisionist technique advocated by Signac, which Matisse had first adopted after reading Signac's essay, ''d'Eugène Delacroix au Néo-Impressionnisme'' in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online, "Henri Matisse"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/deugnedelacroi00signuoft Paul Signac, ''d'Eugène Delacroix au Néo-Impressionnisme'', 1898 (Third edition 1921)]&lt;/ref&gt; Signac purchased the work after the 1905 Salon des Indépendants. In 1908 Signac was elected president of the 24th Salon des Indépendants.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=salle+VII,+salon+d'automne+de+1905&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=alVRJahAml&amp;sig=6SkzgOftNxhpsdYdDNKbJjzqXUY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Russell T.

In 1886 Signac met [[Vincent van Gogh]] in [[Paris]]. In 1887 the two artists regularly went to [[Asnières-sur-Seine]] together, where they painted such subjects as river landscapes and cafés. Initially, Van Gogh chiefly admired Signac’s loose painting technique. In March 1889, Signac visited Van Gogh at [[Arles]]. The next year he made a short trip to Italy, seeing [[Genoa]], [[Florence]], and [[Naples]].

In 1888, Signac discovered [[anarchist]] ideas by reading [[Elisee Reclus]], [[Kropotkin]] and [[Jean Grave]], who all developed the ideas of anarchist communism. With his friends Angrand Cross, [[Maximilien Luce]] and [[Camille Pissarro]] he contributed to Jean Grave’s paper Les Temps Nouveaux (New Times). His financial support was considerable; he sent regular cheques and made a gift of his works for five lotteries between 1895 and 1912.&lt;ref name="PaulSignac"&gt;{{cite web

Signac loved sailing and began to travel in 1892, sailing a small boat to almost all the ports of France, to the Netherlands, and around the Mediterranean as far as [[Constantinople]], basing his boat at St. Tropez, which he "discovered". From his various ports of call, Signac brought back vibrant, colorful watercolors, sketched rapidly from nature. From these sketches, he painted large studio canvases that are carefully worked out in small, mosaic-like squares of color, quite different from the tiny, variegated dots previously used by Seurat.

Signac himself experimented with various media. As well as oil paintings and [[watercolor painting|watercolors]] he made [[etching]]s, [[lithography|lithographs]], and many pen-and-ink sketches composed of small, laborious dots.
The Neo-Impressionists influenced the next generation: Signac inspired Henri Matisse and [[André Derain]] in particular, thus playing a decisive role in the evolution of [[Fauvism]].

As president of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]] from 1908 until his death, Signac encouraged younger artists (he was the first to buy a painting by Matisse) by exhibiting the controversial works of the Fauves and the [[Cubism|Cubists]].

Signac served as a juror with [[Florence Meyer Blumenthal]] in awarding the [[Prix Blumenthal]], a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"&gt;{{cite web

== Personal life ==
[[File:Paul Signac, 1893, Femme à l'ombrelle, oil on canvas, 81 x 65 cm, Musée d'Orsay.jpg|thumb|alt=painting|Paul Signac, 1893, ''Femme à l'ombrelle'' (''Woman with Umbrella''), oil on canvas, 81 x 65&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris; a portrait of Signac's wife Berthe, painted at Saint-Tropez]]
On 7 November 1892 Signac married Berthe Roblès at the town hall of the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]]; witnesses at the wedding were Alexandre Lemonier, [[Maximilien Luce]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Georges Lecomte]]. In November 1897, the Signacs moved to a new apartment in the ''Castel Béranger'', built by [[Hector Guimard]], and a little later, in December of the same year, acquired a house in [[Saint-Tropez]] called ''La Hune''; there the painter had a vast studio constructed, which he inaugurated on 16 August 1898.

In September 1913, Signac rented a house at [[Antibes]], where he settled with [[Jeanne Selmersheim-Desgrange]], who gave birth to their daughter Ginette on 2 October 1913. In the meantime Signac had left ''La Hune'' as well as the ''Castel Beranger'' apartment to Berthe: they remained friends for the rest of his life. On 6 April 1927, Signac adopted Ginette, his previously illegitimate daughter. His granddaughter, [[Françoise Cachin]], was an art historian.

Paul Signac died from [[sepsis|septicemia]] in Paris on 15 August 1935 at the age of 71. His body was cremated and buried three days later, on 18 August, at the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].

Some of his well-known paintings are: ''In the Time of Harmony'', ''Femmes au puits'', ''Port St. Tropez'', ''The Papal Palace'', and ''The Demolisher''.

In 2010, a previously unknown work was discovered at a hotel which was preparing an exhibition of its many paintings.  The {{Interlanguage link multi|Hotel Spaander|nl}} in [[Volendam]] has about 1,400 works of art and Signac apparently gave this one to pay for his stay there in 1894.  Valued at €100,000, the untitled oil "representing a view of the harbour used to hang off a rusty nail in the lobby".&lt;ref NAME="COLLIN"&gt;Collin, Branko.

== Writer ==
Signac left several important works on the theory of art, among them ''From Eugène Delacroix to Neo-Impressionism'', published in 1899; a monograph devoted to [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]] (1819–1891), published in 1927; several introductions to the catalogues of art exhibitions; and many other still unpublished writings.

Politically he was an [[anarchist]], as were many of his friends, including Félix Fénéon and Camille Pissarro.

The '''Royal West of England Academy''' ('''RWA''') is Bristol's oldest art gallery, located in [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]], [[Bristol]], near the junction of Queens Road and [[Whiteladies Road]]. Situated in a Grade 2* listed building, it hosts five galleries and an exhibition programme that celebrates the best of historic and contemporary British art.

== History ==

The Royal West of England Academy was the first art gallery to be established in Bristol. Its foundation was financed by a bequest of £2,000 in the  will of [[Ellen Sharples]] in 1849,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal West Of England Academy|url=http://www.saatchigallery.com/museums/museum-profile/Royal+West+Of+England+Academy/378.html|publisher=Saatchi Gallery|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a well-known group of artists in Bristol, known as the Bristol Society of Artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.rwa.org.uk/about/history/|publisher=Royal West of England Academy|accessdate=20 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222121310/http://www.rwa.org.uk/about/history/|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=artbiogs&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal West of England Academy|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/royal-west-england-academy|publisher=Artist Biographies|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were mostly landscape painters, and many, such as [[William James Müller]], [[Francis Danby]], [[James Baker Pyne]] and [[John Syer]] were well known.&lt;ref name=artbiogs/&gt; In 1844, when the Bristol Academy for the Promotion of Fine Arts was founded, the Bristol Society of Artists was incorporated into it. At this time the president and committee was predominantly its patrons, rather than its artists. In 1913 King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] granted the academy its Royal title,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951|url=http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib1_1218014208|publisher=University of Glasgow|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the reigning monarch as its Patron,&lt;ref name=bridgeman&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal West of England Academy|url=http://www.bridgemanimages.com/en-GB/collections/collection/royal-west-of-england-academy/|publisher=Bridgeman Images|accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1914 a major extension to the front of the building, including the dome and [[Walter Crane]] lunettes, was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lunettes|url=http://www.elizabethholford.co.uk/thelunettes.html|publisher=Elizabeth Holford Associates|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willsdon|first1=Clare A.|title=Mural Painting in Britain 1840-1940: Image and Meaning|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198175155|page=283|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oNJo8VKfBmkC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=Royal+West+of+England+Academy+Walter+Crane+lunettes+1914&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e60D39G8sn&amp;sig=7KcY1eJLHJxYwMNtMD8v_O5Bk5Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjczZHJhevJAhUHuhoKHRqxDi0Q6AEIOzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Royal%20West%20of%20England%20Academy%20Walter%20Crane%20lunettes%201914&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] the academy building was taken over by various organisations including the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] and the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref name=bridgeman/&gt; Immediately after the war ended the council applied for the release of the galleries but was informed that they would be occupied by the [[Inland Revenue]] until further notice. It was not until 1950 that the building was returned to its original function, after the intervention of the then prime minister, [[Clement Attlee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the RWA |work=Royal West of England Academy |url=http://www.rwa.org.uk/histfrm.htm |accessdate=2006-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716064532/http://www.rwa.org.uk/histfrm.htm |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bridgeman/&gt; During the 1950s the Royal West of England Academy Schools became the West of England College of Art.&lt;ref name=artbiogs/&gt; This moved to the Bower Ashton campus in 1966, where it was then absorbed by the University of the West of England (School of Visual Studies), now the [[Department of Creative Industries, UWE, Bristol]].

'''Samuel Collings''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1780–1790?) was a British painter and caricaturist of 18th century.

==Life==
He first appeared as an exhibitor at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1784, sending ''The Children in the Wood, a Sketch;'' in 1785 he exhibited ''The Chamber of Genius,'' which was engraved by [[Thomas Rowlandson]]; in 1786 ''The Triumph of Sensibility.'' 
He exhibited for the last time in 1789, sending 'The Frost on the Thames, sketched on the spot.'{{sfn|Cust|1887}}

Collings is best known, however, as a caricaturist; he was a friend of [[Thomas Rowlandson]], and contributed designs, which were etched by Rowlandson for some of his satirical publications, notably the satires on [[Johnson]] and [[James Boswell|Boswell]]'s  ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides|Tour to the Hebrides]]'', (published by [[Elizabeth Jackson (publisher)| Elizabeth Jackson]] in 1786), and on [[Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''. 
The original drawings for the former are in the [[South Kensington Museum]], and have been erroneously attributed to [[Henry Bunbury (caricaturist)|Henry Bunbury]].{{sfn|Cust|1887}}

To the ''[[The Wit's Magazine|Wit's Magazine]]'' for 1784 Collings contributed some designs of a humorous character, which were engraved by [[William Blake]] and others. 
To the same magazine he contributed verses, and seems to have been as productive with his pen as with his pencil. 
He painted a portrait of [[Lord Thurlow]], which was engraved by J. Condé; a picture by him, entitled 'The Disinherited Heir,' was published in aquatint by [[Francis Jukes]]. 
It is not known when he died.{{sfn|Cust|1887}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2546">The '''Sarmish Gorge''' (better known as '''Sarmishsay''') is located on the southern slopes of the [[Karatau]] mountain range, 30–40&amp;nbsp;km to the north-east of the city of [[Navoi]] (Kermine) in [[Uzbekistan]]. The mountain range of the Karatau is considered to be one of the western spurs of the [[Turkestan]] Mountain Ridge of the Western [[Tien Shan]]. To the south of the Karatau lies the [[Zarafshan]] Valley, bordering the [[Kyzyl Kum]] desert. Since ancient times, the Karatau area has been an intersection of seasonal migration routes for people and animals.

Sarmishsay is the largest of many picturesque gorges along the southern slopes of the Karatau range. This place is famous for various ancient monuments of anthropogenic activity concentrated in an area of about 20&amp;nbsp;km². The sights include [[flint]] quarries, mines, old settlements, burial mounds, crypts and petroglyphs, including monuments of the [[Middle Ages]], early [[Iron Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and even [[Stone Age]].

There are over 4,000 [[petroglyph]]s still intact in Sarmishsay. They are mainly located at the beginning of a narrow stone canyon of 2-2.5&amp;nbsp;km (approx. 1.5 miles) long. The paintings are made on vertical, and sometimes on horizontal outcroppings of reddish [[sandstone]] streaked with [[slate]] and [[limestone]].

Next to the petroglyphs the burial grounds of ancient [[nomads]] and some [[pagan]] altars are located. Since ancient times this territory has been a sacred zone, where locals performed their sacred ceremonies on holy days.

The Petroglyphs of Sarmishsay&lt;ref name="sarmyshsaypetroglyphs"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.people-travels.com/uzbekistan-cities/navoi/sarmyshsay-gorge-and-asrlar-sadosi-2013-as-a-main-national-festival.html| title=Sarmyshsay petroglyphs| accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; give quite a comprehensive picture of local fauna thousands of years ago. Today most of the animals they portray, which once inhabited this area, have disappeared, unable to compete for food with man and domestic livestock. Most of animals included in the stone "book" of the Sarmish Gorge now are extinct.

{{History of printing}}
[[File:TeeshirtCopyleft cadre.jpg|thumb|A silk screen design]]
'''Screen printing''' is a printing technique whereby a mesh is used to transfer ink onto a substrate, except in areas made impermeable to the ink by a blocking [[stencil]]. A blade or squeegee is moved across the screen to fill the open mesh apertures with ink, and a reverse stroke then causes the screen to touch the substrate momentarily along a line of contact.  This causes the ink to wet the substrate and be pulled out of the mesh apertures as the screen springs back after the blade has passed. One color is printed at a time, so several screens can be used to produce a multicoloured image or design.

There are various terms used for what is essentially the same technique. Traditionally the process was called screen printing or silkscreen printing because silk was used in the process. It is also known as '''serigraphy''', and '''serigraph printing'''. Currently, synthetic threads are commonly used in the screen printing process. The most popular mesh in general use is made of polyester. There are special-use mesh materials of nylon and stainless steel available to the screen printer. There are also different types of mesh size which will determine the outcome and look of the finished design on the material.

==History==
Screen printing first appeared in a recognizable form in [[China]] during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheng|first1=Angela|title=Review: Why Ancient Silk Is Still Gold: Issues in Chinese Textile History|journal=Ars Orientalis|date=1999|volume=29|jstor=4629553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="screenweb.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenweb.com/content/historys-influence-screen-printings-future |title=History's Influence on Screen Printing's Future &amp;#124; ScreenWeb |publisher=screenweb.com |date=2006-05-04 |accessdate=2012-11-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121150312/http://www.screenweb.com/content/historys-influence-screen-printings-future |archivedate=2013-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was then adapted by other Asian countries like Japan, and was furthered by creating newer methods.

Screen printing was largely introduced to Western Europe from Asia sometime in the late 18th century, but did not gain large acceptance or use in Europe until silk mesh was more available for trade from the east and a profitable outlet for the medium discovered.

Early in the 1910s, several printers experimenting with photo-reactive chemicals used the well-known [[actinic light]]–activated cross linking or hardening traits of potassium, sodium or ammonium [[chromate and dichromate]] chemicals with glues and [[gelatin]] compounds. Roy Beck, Charles Peter and Edward Owens studied and experimented with chromic acid salt sensitized emulsions for photo-reactive stencils. This trio of developers would prove to revolutionize the commercial screen printing industry by introducing photo-imaged stencils to the industry, though the acceptance of this method would take many years. Commercial screen printing now uses sensitizers far safer and less toxic than bichromates. Currently there are large selections of pre-sensitized and "user mixed" sensitized emulsion chemicals for creating photo-reactive stencils.

A group of artists who later formed the National Serigraph Society, including [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] artists [[Max Arthur Cohn]] and [[Anthony Velonis]], coined the word Serigraphy in the 1930s to differentiate the artistic application of screen printing from the industrial use of the process."Serigraphy" is a compound word formed from Latin "sēricum" (silk) and Greek "graphein" (to write or draw).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/serigraphy?r=14 |title=Serigraphy &amp;#124; Define Serigraphy at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025131823/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/serigraphy?r=14 |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Printers' National Environmental Assistance Center says "Screenprinting is arguably the most versatile of all printing processes. Since rudimentary screenprinting materials are so affordable and readily available, it has been used frequently in [[underground art|underground]] settings and [[subculture]]s, and the non-professional look of such [[DIY culture]] screenprints have become a significant cultural aesthetic seen on movie posters, record album covers, flyers, shirts, commercial fonts in advertising, in artwork and elsewhere.

=== 1960s to present ===
Credit is given to the artist [[Andy Warhol]] for popularising screen printing as an artistic technique. Warhol's silk screens include his 1962 [[Marilyn Diptych]], which is a portrait of the actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] printed in bold colours.  Warhol was supported in his production by master screen printer [[Michel Caza]], a founding member of [[Fespa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_183_300089967.pdf] Author: Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.).

[[Sister Mary Corita Kent]], gained international fame for her vibrant serigraphs during the 1960s and 1970s. Her works were rainbow colored, contained words that were both political and fostered peace and love and caring.

American entrepreneur, artist and inventor Michael Vasilantone started to use, develop, and sell a rotatable multicolour garment screen printing machine in 1960. Vasilantone later filed for patent&lt;ref name="patft.uspto.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/ |title=patft » Page 1 of 1 |publisher=Patft.uspto.gov |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2012-11-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019041123/http://patft.uspto.gov/ |archivedate=2012-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on his invention in 1967 granted number 3,427,964 on February 18, 1969.&lt;ref name="patft.uspto.gov"/&gt; The original machine was manufactured to print logos and team information on [[bowling]] garments but soon directed to the new fad of printing on T-shirts. The Vasilantone patent was licensed by multiple manufacturers, the resulting production and boom in printed T-shirts made this ''garment'' screen printing machine popular. Screen printing on garments currently accounts for over half of the screen printing activity in the United States.&lt;ref name="sgia.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sgia.org/surveys_and_statistics/ |title=Industry Analysis |publisher=Sgia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014161004/http://www.sgia.org/surveys_and_statistics/ |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic screenprinting is widely used today to create mass or large batch produced graphics, such as posters or display stands. Full colour prints can be created by printing in [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] (cyan, magenta, yellow and black ('key')).

Screen printing lends itself well to printing on canvas. [[Andy Warhol]], [[Arthur Okamura]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Harry Gottlieb]] and many other artists have used screen printing as an expression of creativity and artistic vision.

==Printing technique==

A screen is made of a piece of mesh stretched over a frame. The mesh could be made of a [[synthetic polymer]], such as [[nylon]], and a finer and smaller aperture for the mesh would be utilized for a design that requires a higher and more delicate degree of detail. For the mesh to be effective, it must be mounted on a frame and it must be under tension. The frame which holds the mesh could be made of diverse materials, such as wood or aluminum, depending on the sophistication of the machine or the artisan procedure. The tension of the mesh may be checked by using a tensiometer; a common unit for the measurement of the tension of the mesh is [[Newton (unit)|Newton]] per [[centimeter]] (N/cm).

A stencil is formed by blocking off parts of the screen in the negative image of the design to be printed; that is, the open spaces are where the ink will appear on the substrate. 

Before printing occurs, the frame and screen must undergo the pre-press process, in which an emulsion is 'scooped' across the mesh and the 'exposure unit' burns away the unnecessary emulsion leaving behind a clean area in the mesh with the identical shape as the desired image. The surface to be printed (commonly referred to as a pallet) is coated with a wide 'pallet tape'. This serves to protect the 'pallet' from any unwanted ink leaking through the screen and potentially staining the 'pallet' or transferring unwanted ink onto the next substrate. Next, the screen and frame are lined with a tape. The type of tape used in for this purpose often depends upon the ink that is to be printed onto the substrate. These aggressive tapes are generally used for UV and water-based inks due to the inks' lower viscosities. The last process in the 'pre-press' is blocking out any unwanted 'pin-holes' in the emulsion. If these holes are left in the emulsion, the ink will continue through and leave unwanted marks. To block out these holes, materials such as tapes, speciality emulsions and 'block-out pens' may be used effectively.

The screen is placed atop a substrate. Ink is placed on top of the screen, and a floodbar is used to push the ink through the holes in the mesh. The operator begins with the fill bar at the rear of the screen and behind a reservoir of ink. The operator lifts the screen to prevent contact with the substrate and then using a slight amount of downward force pulls the fill bar to the front of the screen. This effectively fills the mesh openings with ink and moves the ink reservoir to the front of the screen. The operator then uses a [[squeegee]] (rubber blade) to move the mesh down to the substrate and pushes the squeegee to the rear of the screen. The ink that is in the mesh opening is pumped or squeezed by capillary action to the substrate in a controlled and prescribed amount, i.e. the wet ink deposit is proportional to the thickness of the mesh and or stencil. As the squeegee moves toward the rear of the screen the tension of the mesh pulls the mesh up away from the substrate (called snap-off) leaving the ink upon the substrate surface.

There are three common types of screen printing presses: flat-bed, cylinder, and rotary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenprinting-technology.org/en/applications/screen-printing-variations/flatbed-cylinder-screen-printing.html|title=Flatbed cylinder screen printing|author=|date=|website=Screenprinting Technology|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414011500/http://www.screenprinting-technology.org/en/applications/screen-printing-variations/flatbed-cylinder-screen-printing.html|archivedate=14 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Textile items printed with multicoloured designs often use a wet on wet technique, or colours dried while on the press, while graphic items are allowed to dry between colours that are then printed with another screen and often in a different colour after the product is re-aligned on the press.

Most screens are ready for re-coating at this stage, but sometimes screens will have to undergo a further step in the reclaiming process called dehazing. This additional step removes haze or "ghost images" left behind in the screen once the emulsion has been removed. Ghost images tend to faintly outline the open areas of previous stencils, hence the name. They are the result of ink residue trapped in the mesh, often in the knuckles of the mesh (the points where threads cross).

While the public thinks of garments in conjunction with screen printing, the technique is used on tens of thousands of items, including decals, clock and watch faces, balloons, and many other products.  The technique has even been adapted for more advanced uses, such as laying down conductors and resistors in multi-layer circuits using thin ceramic layers as the substrate.

==Stencilling techniques==

[[File:Ssc.jpg|Right|thumb|A [[macro photography|macro photo]] of a screen print with a photographically produced [[stencil]]. The ink will be printed where the stencil does not cover the substrate.]]
A method of stencilling that has increased in popularity over the past years is the [[photo emulsion]] technique:
[[File:Hand painted color separation on transparent overlay.png|thumb|Hand-painted colour separation on transparent overlay by serigraph printer [[Csaba Markus]]]]
# The original image is created on a transparent overlay, and the image may be drawn or painted directly on the overlay, [[photocopier|photocopied]], or printed with a computer printer, but making so that the areas to be inked are not transparent. Any material that blocks ultra violet light can be used as the film, even card stock. A black-and-white positive may also be used (projected onto the screen).  However, unlike traditional plate-making, these screens are normally exposed by using film positives.
# A screen must then be selected. There are several different mesh counts that can be used depending on the detail of the design being printed. Once a screen is selected, the screen must be coated with emulsion and dried.  Once dry, it is then possible to burn/expose the print.
# The overlay is placed over the screen, and then exposed with a light source containing ultraviolet light in the 350-420 nanometer spectrum.
# The screen is washed off thoroughly. The areas of emulsion that were not exposed to light dissolve and wash away, leaving a negative stencil of the image on the mesh.


== Materials ==
;Caviar beads
:A caviar bead is a glue that is printed in the shape of the design, to which small plastic beads are then applied – works well with solid block areas creating an interesting tactile surface.
;Cracking ink
:Cracking ink effect is when the ink produces an intentional cracked surface after drying.
;Discharge inks
:Discharge ink is used to print lighter colours onto dark background fabrics, they work by removing the dye of the garment – this means they leave a much softer texture. The cons with this process is that they are less graphic in nature than plastisol inks, and exact colours are difficult to control. One of the pros of using this process is they are especially good for distressed prints and under-basing on dark garments that are to be printed with additional layers of plastisol. It adds variety to the design or gives it that natural soft feel. 
;Expanding ink (puff)
:Expanding ink, or puff, is an additive to plastisol inks which raises the print off the garment, creating a 3D feel and look to the design. Mostly used when printing on apparel. 
;Flocking
:Flocking consists of a glue printed onto the fabric and then flock material is applied for a velvet touch. 
;Foil
:Foil is much like flock, but instead of a velvet touch and look it has a reflective/mirror look to it. Although foil is finished with a heat press process it needs the screen printing process in order to add the adhesive glue onto the material for the desired logo or design. 
;Four-colour process or the [[CMYK colour model]]
:Four-colour process is when the artwork is created and then separated into four colours (CMYK) which combine to create the full spectrum of colours needed for photographic prints. This means a large number of colours can be simulated using only 4 screens, reducing costs, time, and set-up. The inks are required to blend and are more translucent, meaning a compromise with vibrancy of colour.
;Glitter/Shimmer
:Glitter or Shimmer ink is when metallic flakes become an additive in the ink base to create this sparkle effect. Usually available in gold or silver but can be mixed to make most colours.
;Gloss
:Gloss ink is when a clear base laid over previously printed inks to create a shiny finish.
;Metallic
:Metallic ink is similar to glitter, but smaller particles suspended in the ink. A glue is printed onto the fabric, then nano-scale fibers applied on it. This is often purchased already made. 
;Mirrored silver
:Mirrored silver is a highly reflective, solvent-based ink.
;Nylobond
:Nylobond is a special ink additive for printing onto technical or waterproof fabrics.
;[[Plastisol]]
:Plastisol is the most common ink used in commercial garment decoration. Good colour opacity onto dark garments and clear graphic detail with, as the name suggests, a more plasticized texture. This print can be made softer with special additives or heavier by adding extra layers of ink. Plastisol inks require heat (approx. 150 °C (300 °F) for many inks) to cure the print.
;PVC and Phthalate Free
:PVC and Phthalate Free is relatively new breed of ink and printing with the benefits of plastisol but without the two main toxic components. It also has a soft texture.
;Suede Ink
:Suede ink is a milky coloured additive that is added to plastisol. With suede additive you can make any color of plastisol have a suede feel. It is actually a puff blowing agent that does not bubble as much as regular puff ink. The directions vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, but generally up to 50% suede can be added to normal plastisol.
;Water-Based inks
:these penetrate the fabric more than the plastisol inks and create a much softer feel. Ideal for printing darker inks onto lighter coloured garments. Also useful for larger area prints where texture is important. Some inks require heat or an added catalyst to make the print permanent.
;High Build
:High Build is a process which uses a type of varnish against a lower mesh count with many coats of emulsion or a thicker grade of emulsion (e.g., Capillex®). After the varnish passes through to the substrate, an embossed-appearing, 'raised' area of varnish is created. When cured at the end of the process, the varnish yields a Braille effect, hence the term 'High Build'.

==Versatility==
[[File:Maker Faire 2008 San Mateo 246.JPG|thumb| Screen with exposed image ready to be printed.]]
Screen printing is more versatile than traditional printing techniques. The surface does not have to be printed under pressure, unlike [[etching]] or [[lithography]], and it does not have to be planar.  Different inks can be used to work with a variety of materials, such as textiles,  ceramics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fespa.com/news/features/understanding-ceramic-and-glass-decorating-techniques.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707082610/http://www.fespa.com/news/features/understanding-ceramic-and-glass-decorating-techniques.html |archivedate=2015-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  wood,  paper,  glass, metal,  and plastic.  As a result,  screen printing is used in many different industries, including:
* [[Balloon]]s
* [[Clothing]]
* [[Decals]]
* [[Medical devices]]
* [[Printed electronics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fespa.com/news/blogs/printed-electronics-a-new-world-of-opportunity.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707053928/http://www.fespa.com/news/blogs/printed-electronics-a-new-world-of-opportunity.html |archivedate=2015-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Printed circuit board|circuit board printing]]
* Product labels
* Signs and displays
* [[Snowboard]] graphics
* Textile [[fabric]]
* [[Thick film technology]]
* [[Pinball]] machines

== Semiconducting material ==
In screen printing on wafer-based solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, the mesh and buses of silver are printed on the front; furthermore, the buses of silver are printed on the back. Subsequently, aluminum paste is dispensed over the whole surface of the back for [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] and surface reflection. One of the parameters that can vary and can be controlled in screen printing is the thickness of the print. This makes it useful for some of the techniques of printing solar cells, electronics etc.

[[Solar wafer]]s are becoming thinner and larger, so careful printing is required to maintain a lower breakage rate, though high throughput at the printing stage improves the throughput of the whole cell production line.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Screen printing press ==
To print multiple copies of the screen design on garments in an efficient manner, amateur and professional printers usually use a screen printing press. Many companies offer simple to sophisticated printing presses. These presses come in one of three types, Manual (also referred to as Handbench), Semi-Automatic, and Fully Automatic.  Most printing companies will use one or more semi-automatic or fully automatic machines.

== Rotary screen printing ==
A development of screen printing with flat screens from 1963 was to wrap the screen around to form a tube, with the ink supply and squeegee inside the tube.  The resulting roller rotates at the same speed as the web in a roll-to-roll machine.  The benefits are high output rates and long rolls of product.  This is the only way to make high-build fully patterned printing/coating as a continuous process, and has been widely used for manufacturing textured wallpapers.

[[Lennox Berkeley]] composed his '''Symphony No. 2''' in 1958. The work was commissioned by the [[City of Birmingham Symphony]], who premiered it under [[Andrzej Panufnik]] in February 1959. Berkeley revised the symphony in 1976 for its first recording, by the [[London Philharmonic]] under [[Nicholas Braithwaite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnett|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Structure==

The composition is in four movements: 
# ''[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Lento – Allegro]]''
# ''Allegro vivace''
# ''Lento''
# ''Allegro''

Typical playing time is around 27 minutes

[[File:Bihari Sándor Önarckép.jpg|thumb|200px|Self-portrait (1880s?)]]
'''Sándor Bihari''' (19 May 1855, [[Rézbánya]] - 28 March 1906, [[Budapest]]) was a [[Jewish]] Hungarian [[Genre art|genre]] painter.

== Life ==
Born to a [[Jewish]] family, Sándor spent his childhood in [[Nagyvárad]]. Originally, he worked with his father as a decorative painter. In 1874, he moved to Budapest, where he did [[photo manipulation|retouching]] at a photography studio while attending a drawing school operated by [[Bertalan Székely]].&lt;ref name="M"&gt;[http://www.mke.hu/lyka/05/353-365-bihari.htm Béla Fónagy: Bihari Sándor] @ Művészet (from 1906)&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he used his meager resources on a move to Vienna, where he hoped to enroll in the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]]. At first he had to find work as a retoucher again and might have remained in that position, had he not received a gift of 600 [[Forint]]s from Székely, which enabled him to quit his job and enter the Academy.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt;

He returned to his hometown, where he spent three years struggling as a portrait painter until a benefactor who liked his work provided the means for him to study in Paris. He travelled there in 1883, where he studied at the [[Académie Julian]] with [[Jean-Paul Laurens]]&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; and improved his technique by copying the [[Old Masters]] at the [[Louvre]]. While there, he became acquainted with [[plein-air]] painting and [[Impressionism (art)|Impressionism]], which had a decisive influence on his style. Upon returning to Hungary, he settled in [[Szolnok]], a popular gathering place for painters, and would later become one of the founders of an art colony there.

He continued to travel, making lengthy visits to Italy especially, until his health began to fail in 1893.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; During his final years, he lived in Budapest but continued to spend his summers in Szolnok. In 1896, he was awarded the [[Order of Franz Joseph]].

'''''The Dance of Life''''' or '''''Life's Dance''''' is an 1899&amp;ndash;1900 [[Expressionism|expressionist]] painting by [[Edvard Munch]], now in the [[National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design|National Museum of Art]] in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edvardmunch.org/the-dance-of-life.jsp#prettyPhoto|title=The Dance of Life, 1899 by Edvard Munch|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was an important work in Munch's project "The Frieze of Life." In creating the paining, Munch was allegedly inspired by the [[Helge Rode]] play "''Dansen gaar,"'' of which Munch kept a copy in his personal library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nasjonalmuseet.no/en/collections_and_research/our_collections/edvard_munch_in_the_national_museum/The+Dance+of+Life,+1899%E2%80%931900.b7C_wljW5c.ips|title=The Dance of Life, 1899–1900|website=nasjonalmuseet.no|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Olaf Schou purchased the paining in [[Oslo]] in 1910, immediately presenting it to the National Gallery.

== Content ==
In 1933, eight young female friends graduate from [[Vassar College]].  The book describes these women's lives post-graduation, beginning with the marriage of one of the friends, Kay Strong, and ending with her funeral in 1940.  Each character struggles with different issues, including sexism in the work place, child-rearing, financial difficulties, family crises, and sexual relationships.  Nearly all the women's issues involve the men in their lives: fathers, employers, lovers, or husbands.  As highly educated women from affluent backgrounds, they must strive for autonomy and independence in a time when a woman's role is still largely restricted to marriage and childbirth.  The plot is influenced by the political and economic atmosphere of the time. Over the course of the book, the reader learns about the women's views on contraception, love, sex, socialism, and psychoanalysis.

== Characters ==
'''Kay Strong''':  Marries Harald Petersen, who is involved in theater management and stage directing.  Kay calls him a "Yale man", even though he did only graduate work there; this mildly offends the analytical Lakey.  Harald writes plays that are not produced and is frequently unemployed.  Kay has "a ruthless hatred of poor people", and is frustrated by their financial situation.  She supports them by working at Macy's and cares greatly about her material surroundings.  Her husband has multiple extramarital affairs.  Their fights and his drinking escalate; finally he hits her until she threatens him with a bread knife.  The next morning, he commits her to a psychiatric hospital, where Polly is working as a nurse.  Kay is later released from the hospital; she divorces Harald.  Her death at the end of the book is mysterious; no one knows whether she fell from the window on the twentieth floor of the Vassar Club, while airplane spotting, or whether she jumped.  Her friends reunite at the end of the novel at her funeral, where they shun Harald.

'''Mary Prothero, "Pokey"''':  The wealthiest of the Group.  Described as a "fat, cheerful New York society girl", "very rich and lazy".  Pokey says she made it through Vassar only with the help of Priss, a [[Phi Beta Kappa]].  Pokey's father gives her a plane so she is able to commute to Cornell Agricultural School; her mother, upon learning that Harald was arrested at a labor demonstration, is devastated that a "jailbird" once dined at the Prothero home.  Pokey eventually marries.  Her family has an earnest, eccentric, and observant butler named Hatton, who comes to Kay's funeral.

'''Dottie Renfrew''':  From a Boston family, she aims to be a welfare worker after Vassar. She goes home from Kay's wedding with Dick Brown, a poor artist, and he proceeds to take her virginity. He treats her abruptly and warns her not to fall in love with him. He tells her things can be a lot better between them (sexually) if she would go see a "lady doctor" (so that he wouldn't have to use withdrawal, which he did use in this instance, or condoms). He explains that he prefers diaphragms for upper-class women and condoms for lower-class women. She is fitted for a [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] by a woman doctor who is willing to fit unmarried as well as married women.  Dick has not called her or returned her calls. She returns to Dick's apartment, but he is gone.  She waits for him for hours in Washington Square Park; eventually she hides the birth control kit under a bench and goes back to Boston.  Dottie eventually marries Brook Latham from Arizona. Before the wedding, she admits to her perceptive mother that she has slept with Dick and is still in love with him. Her mother suggests she postpone the wedding and see Dick to explore her feelings, but Dottie refuses and marries Brook on schedule.

'''Elinor Eastlake, "Lakey”''':  From Lake Forest, Illinois.  After Pokey, she is the wealthiest of the group; she is cool and aristocratic, a "dark beauty", with pale skin, black hair, and large green eyes.  She spends most of the book in Europe, where she goes to study art history and get a doctorate.  At the end of the book, she returns to America, having fled the war in Europe.  The Group assembles at the pier to greet her arrival, where they find Lakey accompanied by the Baroness, who, it transpires, is her lesbian lover.  The group notes that the Baroness is not terribly bright; they are conflicted over Lakey's sexual orientation.

'''Polly Andrews''':  Her family suffers financial losses due to the Depression.  She is pretty, with "almost flaxen hair", "milk-white skin” and "big blue eyes".  She lives in a building where most of her neighbors are socialists, and she works as a technician in a local hospital.  She has an affair with Gus LeRoy, a married publisher, who is going through [[psychoanalysis]] at the request of his wife.  Polly does not understand why he needs analysis, and after reading Freud, she decides that she herself needs analysis.  Gus eventually leaves Polly and goes back to his wife.  Polly's father, who has just gotten divorced from Polly's mother and suffers from [[bipolar disorder]], comes to live with Polly.  Her father converts to [[Trotskyism]].  In the manic phase of his disorder, he overspends their budget, forcing Polly to sell her blood at the hospital.  Polly marries Dr. Jim Ridgeley, a psychiatrist, who offers her financial and moral support.

'''Priss Hartshorn''':  An idealistic believer in the FDR program, she marries Dr. Sloan Crockett, a pediatrician.  She has a job with the [[National Recovery Administration]].  She gives birth to Stephen, whom she has difficulty breast-feeding and potty-training.  Under the hospital regimen, she sleeps apart from her son, whom she hears crying most of the nights. Her husband wishes her to feed Stephen her breast milk rather than formula, a somewhat radical notion at the time.  Priss, pressured at the hospital to allow them to bottle feed the baby, also feels pressured by her husband, thinking, "Sloan…was enamored of his own theories, which he wanted to enforce, like Prohibition, regardless of the human factor".

'''Helena Davison''':  "A short, sandy haired girl with an appealing snub nose", Helena was "regarded as the droll member of the group", because of her sense of humor.  Her mother has her "tutored in every conceivable subject", including athletics, musical instruments, outdoor activities and crafts.  Despite her Vassar education, she gets a job as a teacher at an experimental school in Cleveland, Ohio, teaching "finger-painting".  She catches Kay's husband kissing another woman, Norine, a Vassar girl who was involved in left politics and not in The Group.  She decides not to tell Kay, but agrees to go to Norine's house to talk.  Norine's husband is impotent and Norine has had several affairs.  Norine asks Helena how she should fix her life, and Helena makes several suggestions, including scrubbing the floor, painting the sitting room a different color, and buying "some real food". By the end of the novel, Helena moves to New York to pursue an art career. She is the only character who remains single.

'''Libby MacAusland''':  A "tall, pretty blonde", who majored in English and is determined to break into the New York publishing industry.  Gus LeRoy, the publisher, hires her to read book manuscripts.  For five dollars apiece, she reads the manuscripts and writes a summary and opinion.  Libby can read Italian, so Gus gives her an Italian manuscript to summarize.  However, the book is mostly in a dialect, which she can't understand and she writes an inaccurate report. Gus fires her, telling her that "Publishing's a man's business…. Marry a publisher, Miss MacAusland, and be his hostess."  He later gets her a job as a literary agent's assistant and then an agent herself, becoming wealthy in the process and living well.  A Norwegian baron and ski jumper, Nils Aslund, tries to seduce her by reading Marlowe's "The Passionate Shepherd to His Love".  Libby tries to fend him off by quoting Sir Walter Raleigh's "The Shepherdess Replies".  Nils replies by ripping her clothes off and attempting to rape her; he desists when she tells him she is a virgin.

'''Norine Schmittlapp''': She is Vassar '33, but not a member of The Group.  Talking to Helena, she says, "You people were the aesthetes.  We were the politicals."  Norine is interested in psychoanalysis, socialism, and anthropology.  She has a dog named [[Nietzsche]].  While married to Putnam Blake, she has an affair with Harald, Kay's husband.  Norine's husband, Put, suffers from impotency; according to Norine, he is only aroused by "fallen women".  Norine helps Harald put Kay in the psychiatric ward by convincing Kay that she needs a rest.  She spreads the rumor that Kay was mentally disturbed, saying to Priss, "A lot of basic things were the matter.  Sex.  Competitiveness with men.  An underlying Lesbian drive that was too firmly repressed.  Thwarted social strivings."  Norine later divorces Put, and marries Freddy Rogers, a wealthy banker who has suffered from anti-Jewish discrimination.  She has a son, Ichabod.  Priss is horrified by her choice of name and her careless manner of raising Ichabod.  Norine tells Priss that her husband expects her to be a dutiful housewife, but Norine says "Our Vassar education made it tough for me to accept my womanly role".  Norine believes that because of her education, she is "crippled for life".

== Background ==
In some aspects the novel is autobiographical, in a satirical tone. Mary McCarthy studied literature at Vassar College and graduated in 1933, which is the class year of her group of eight characters. McCarthy's classmates from Vassar accused her of basing ''The Group'' characters on them and their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Elizabeth. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/29/the-group-mary-mccarthy "The Group by Mary McCarthy."] The Guardian, 29 November 2013. Retrieved 6 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, her first husband, Harald Johnsrud, shares the first name of the husband of the character Kay; the unusual (Nordic) spelling of the name is discussed several times in the novel. In parts of the book where McCarthy discusses sex, such as when Dottie loses her virginity, the author claims to come from her memories with past lovers, as an observer.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Alan. "Just Words." Yale University Press, 2011, p.174.&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy was also a supporter of [[Leon Trotsky]], a political position shared by another of the characters in the novel, Polly Andrews.

Mary McCarthy adopted the title of "lady-writer" mostly given by male critics. Although her works are supposedly written for women, they are commended by feminists. However, McCarthy denies being a feminist or writing for the "second-wave of feminism" as she believes in equality and freedom of rights, but does not view it as a gendered issue.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, Sabrina Fuchs. "Mary McCarthy: Gender, Politics, and the Postwar Intellectual." Peter Lang Publishing Inc., 2004, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The novel topped the ''New York Times'' best-seller for almost two years. It was banned in Australia, Italy, and Ireland for being offensive to public morals.&lt;ref&gt;Brightman, Carol. "Writing Dangerously: Mary McCarthy and Her World." Clarkson Potter/Publishers, 1992, p.486.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was reviewed critically and intensely for its vivid detail, length, and number of characters. At the time of its release, men questioned McCarthy's ability to be a professional writer. Notably, Norman Mailer for [[The New York Review of Books]]  wrote that, "her book fails as a novel by being good but not nearly good enough...she is simply not a good enough woman to write a major novel." &lt;ref&gt;Mailer, Norman. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1963/10/17/the-mary-mccarthy-case/ "The Mary McCarthy Case."] New York Review of Books, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

When an editor suggested to [[Candace Bushnell]] that she write "the modern-day version of ''The Group''", she wrote ''[[Sex and the City]]'', a collection of revealing essays that became the popular TV series and film. As Bushnell summarizes: "''The Group'' reminds us that not much has really changed".&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite news |first=Elizabeth |last=Day |title=The Group by Mary McCarthy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/29/the-group-mary-mccarthy |work=[[The Observer]] |location=London |date=29 November 2009 |accessdate=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film adaptation ==
{{Main article|The Group (film)}}
In 1966 [[United Artists]] released a [[The Group (film)|film]] adaptation of McCarthy's novel directed by [[Sidney Lumet]]. The main characters were played by [[Candice Bergen]] (Lakey), [[Joan Hackett]] (Dottie), [[Elizabeth Hartman]] (Priss), [[Shirley Knight]] (Polly), [[Joanna Pettet]] (Kay), [[Mary-Robin Redd]] (Pokey), [[Jessica Walter]] (Libby), [[Kathleen Widdoes]] (Helena), [[Larry Hagman]] (Harald), [[James Broderick]] (Jim), [[Richard Mulligan]] (Dick), [[Carrie Nye]] (Norine), and [[Hal Holbrook]] (Gus). The film was exhibited in competition in the 1966 [[Berlinale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Group (1966) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060479/ |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio ==
In 2001, ''The Group'' was broadcast on BBC Radio 4.  It was adapted by Moya O'Shea, produced/Directed by Tracey Neale, and starred [[Gayle Hunnicutt]], [[Rebecca Front]], [[Teresa Gallagher]], [[Joanna Weir]], [[Tara Ward]], [[Laurel Lefkow]], [[Lorelei King]], [[Moya O'Shea]], [[Mark Caven]], [[Henry Goodman]], and [[William Hope (actor)|William Hope]].

== Popular culture references ==
The book appears in episode ten, season three of the television series ''[[Mad Men]]''. It is also referred to in the pilot episode of the series ''[[American Dreams]]'', during a scene in which one member of a woman's book group suggests "The Group" as a title that might make her contemporaries re-evaluate their lives as housewives. The suggestion is quickly dismissed by the group's leader, ("Oh!  That sounds so…depressing"), who rules in favor of Book of the Month Club's ''[[The Shoes of the Fisherman (novel)|The Shoes of the Fisherman]]''. In the following episode of ''American Dreams'', one of the main characters, Helen Pryor, reads the book and she says that "her whole world is falling apart" because of it. 

It is also mentioned in the ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' short "The Home Economics Story" (where Joel Robinson referring to the group of college students from said short as "The Group") as well as the episode featuring the film "[[The Sinister Urge (film)|The Sinister Urge]]" (where Mike Nelson refers to a group of young women as "Mary McCarthy's 'The Group'"). 

In the film ''[[The Sterile Cuckoo]]'', the character of Pookie Adams ([[Liza Minnelli]]) can be seen clutching a copy of ''The Group'' when she departs the bus after her first encounter with love interest Jerry Payne.  Mentioned in ''[[A Right to Die]]'' by Rex Stout: Nero Wolfe "had read two chapters and ditched it."

In Season 1, episode 9 of "[[Gilmore Girls]]", Rory is seen reading a copy of the book as she stands on line to buy tickets to a dance.

'''''The Holy Family with Angels'''''  (1645) is an [[oil painting]] on canvas by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Rembrandt]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[Hermitage Museum]].

== Description ==
This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1915, who wrote; "94. THE HOLY FAMILY WITH THE ANGELS. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. 72.]]; [[Wilhelm von Bode|Bode]] 321 ; [[Eugène Dutuit|Dutuit]] 59; [[Alfred von Wurzbach|Wb.]] 391 ; B.-HdG. 251. In the foreground of [[St. Joseph|Joseph's]] carpenter's workshop, the Virgin Mary sits on a low chair, holding a large open book on her left arm. She rests her left foot on a foot-warmer and leans over to the left to draw the green curtain of the cradle in which the Child lies asleep under a red fur-lined coverlet. Mary wears a deep red gown and dark blue skirt, and a white kerchief and cap. Behind her in half-shadow, Joseph, in a brown working-dress, is shaping a [[yoke]] with his axe. From above to the left child-angels flutter down, throwing a bright light on the Virgin and the cradle. Full-length figures, almost half life-size. Signed on the left at foot, "Rembrandt f. 1645 " ; canvas, 46 1/2 inches by 36 inches. An old copy without the angels was in the possession of an English dealer in 1899, and afterwards in the possession of a New York dealer. Another copy without the angels was in the sale : --London, June 7, 1912, No. 23 (£15 : 15s.). A pen-drawing for the picture is in the collection of [[Leon Bonnat]], Paris ; reproduced by Lippmann-Hofstede de Groot, No. 20. A study in chalk for the Child in the cradle was in the collection of [[John Postle Heseltine|J. P. Heseltine]], London, and is now in the collection of H. Oppenheim, London ; reproduced by Lippmann, No. i883. Engraved by J. Vendramini, 1836 ; by J. Sanders in outline in F. Labenski, ''Description de I'Ermitage'', i. 28. Etched by N. Mossoloff in ''Les Rembrandts de l' Ermitage''. Lithographed by H. Robillard in Gohier Desfontaines and P. Petit, ''Galerie de l' Ermitage'', i. 4. Mentioned by [[Carel Vosmaer|Vosmaer]], pp.&amp;nbsp;262, 537 ; by Bode, pp.&amp;nbsp;474, 599 ; by Dutuit, p.&amp;nbsp;38 ; by [[Emile Michel|Michel]], pp.&amp;nbsp;299, 566 [228-9, 441] ; by [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Waagen]], ''The Picture Gallery of the Hermitage'', p.&amp;nbsp;177.

==Unusual portrayal in home setting==
[[File:Harmensz van Rijn Rembrandt - Святое семейство - Google Art Project (cropped for mother and child).jpg|thumb|The baby Jesus is wearing a skull-cap with band known as a [[valhoed]] and he is propped up with cushions into a sitting position as was customary at that time]]
Rembrandt portrays the [[Holy Family]] as a typical family of [[Amsterdam]] in his day. In the foreground Jesus is asleep in the same style of wicker crib that can be seen in period paintings of mothers with babies by [[Pieter de Hooch]]. Mary looks up from her book to take a peek at the sleeping child under the crib curtain (Dutch: ''klamboe''). In the background Joseph is working on making a [[yoke]].The yoke refers both to the coming of the Lord according to [[Isaiah]]  ("For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian"), as well as the words of Jesus according to [[Matthew the Apostle]] ("Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light").

'''Trade dress''' is a legal [[term of art]] that generally refers to characteristics of the visual appearance of a product or its packaging (or even the design of a building) that signify the source of the product to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert P. |last=Merges |first2=Peter S. |last2=Menell |authorlink3=Mark A. Lemley |first3=Mark A. |last3=Lemley |title=Intellectual Property in the New Technological Age |edition=4th rev. |year=2007 |location=New York |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |isbn=978-0-7355-6989-8 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade dress is a form of [[intellectual property]].

== India ==
The new ''Trade Marks Act'', 1997, which came into force in September 2003 introduced a  new legal definition of a trade mark, which, in part, encompasses almost all the elements of trade dress as defined by the US law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indialawjournal.com/volume1/issue_4/article_by_purnime.html "Trade dress protection for 'look and feel' of the Website"] ''India Law Journal'' (retrieved October 13, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
{{main|Passing off}}
Trade dress can be protected as getup under the law of [[passing off]] in the UK. Passing off is a common law remedy for protecting an unregistered [[trademark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Birgit|last2=Hitchens|first2=Ben|title=United Kingdom: The perils and powers of passing off|url=http://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/Magazine/Issue/54/Country-correspondents/The-perils-and-powers-of-passing-off|website=World Trademark Review|publisher=Globe Business Media Group|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Getup, packaging, business strategy, marketing techniques, advertisement themes etc. can also be protected under passing off.

==United States==
Trade dress protection is intended to protect consumers from packaging or appearance of products that are designed to imitate other products; to prevent a consumer from buying one product under the belief that it is another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Trademark Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/intellectual_property/trademark_law.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=12 September 2017|date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merges at 29&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the shape, color, and arrangement of the materials of a children's line of clothing can be protectable trade dress (though, the design of the garments themselves is not protected),&lt;ref&gt;''Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc.'', 529 U.S. 205 (2000), https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-150.ZS.html&lt;/ref&gt; as can the design of a magazine cover,&lt;ref&gt;''Reader’s Digest Ass’n v.

Cir. 1987), http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/821/821.F2d.800.86-7004.86-5495.html&lt;/ref&gt; the appearance and décor of a chain of Mexican-style restaurants,&lt;ref name="twopesos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Pesos, Inc. v.

===Statutory source===
In the U.S., like [[trademark]]s, a product’s trade dress is legally protected by the [[Lanham Act]], the federal statute which regulates trademarks and trade dress.&lt;ref&gt;The Lanham Act, http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/ch22.html&lt;/ref&gt; Under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, a product's trade dress can be protected without formal registration with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (PTO).&lt;ref&gt;Merges at 650, Lanham Act 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)&lt;/ref&gt; In relevant part, section 43(a) states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which
:(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive [...] as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of  his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person, or
:(B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another person’s goods, services, or commercial activities,
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged by such an act.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This statute allows the owner of a particular trade dress ("container for goods") to sue an infringer (a person or entity who illegally copies that trade dress) for violating section 43(a) without registering that trade dress with any formal agency or system (unlike the registration and application requirements for enforcing other forms of intellectual property, such as patents).  It is commonly seen as providing “federal common law” protection for trade dress (and trademarks).&lt;ref&gt;Merges at 650&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal registration===

Trade dress may be registered with the PTO in either the [[Principal Register]] or the [[Supplemental Register]].&lt;ref&gt;PTO website, http://www.uspto.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; Although registration is not required for legal protection, registration offers several advantages.  In the Principal Register, a registrant gains nationwide [[constructive use]] and [[constructive notice]], which prevent others from using or registering that registrant’s trade dress (without contesting the registration).&lt;ref&gt;Lanham Act § 7(c), 15 U.S.C. § 1057(c)&lt;/ref&gt; Further, a registrant in the Principal Register gains [[incontestable status]] after five years, which eliminates many of the ways for another party to challenge the registration.&lt;ref&gt;Lanham Act § 15, 15 U.S.C. § 1057(c)&lt;/ref&gt; Registration under the Supplemental Register allows the registrant to protect its trade dress in foreign countries, although the protections are much more limited than protections under the Principal Register in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Menell at 696&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal requirements===

It can be difficult to obtain protection for trade dress, as applicants must prove that the design has secondary meaning to consumers and is then further limited by the functionality doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michael Best &amp; Friedrich, LLP|title=Entrepreneur’s Guide to Intellectual Property – Blog Series: Protecting Your Products and Packaging with Trade Dress|journal=The National Law Review|date=10 June 2012|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/entrepreneur-s-guide-to-intellectual-property-blog-series-protecting-your-products-a|accessdate=17 November 2014|issn=2161-3362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Functionality====

To gain registration in the Principal Register or common law protection under the Lanham Act, a trade dress must not be “functional.”  That is, the configuration of shapes, designs, colors, or materials that make up the trade dress in question must not serve a utility or function outside of creating recognition in the consumer’s mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 US 159, 115 S. Ct. 1300, 131 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1995)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17905304466595211702|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, even though consumers associated a distinct spring design for wind resistant road signs with a particular company, the spring design was not protectable for trade dress purposes because the springs served the function of withstanding heavy wind conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc., 532 US 23, 121 S. Ct. 1255, 149 L. Ed. 2d 164 (2001)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12704680276957369308|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is considered “functional” depends upon the specific product or thing sought to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feisthamel|first1=Karen|last2=Kelly|first2=Amy|last3=Sistek|first3=Johanna|title=Trade Dress: Best Practices for the Registration of Product Configuration Trade Dress with the USPTO|journal=The Trademark Reporter|date=November 2005|volume=95|issue=9|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/thetmr95&amp;div=121|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the color red in a line of clothing may not be functional (and thus part of protectable trade dress) whereas the same color on a stop sign would be functional because the color red serves the function of putting drivers on alert (and thus would not be part of a protectable trade dress).

====Distinctiveness====
To gain registration in the Principal Register or common law protection under the Lanham Act, a trade dress must be “distinctive.”  This means that consumers perceive a particular trade dress as identifying a source of a product.&lt;ref name="twopesos"/&gt;

Claimed trade dress in the product design—as opposed to product packaging—context can no longer be "inherently distinctive"; it must acquire distinctiveness through "secondary meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers, Inc.'', 529 U.S. 205, 120 S. Ct. 1339, 146 L. Ed. 182, 54 USPQ2d 1065 (2000)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11551321958641509496|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctiveness through secondary meaning means that although a trade dress is not distinctive on its face, the use of the trade dress in the market (the “[[Goodwill (accounting)|good will]]” of the trade dress) has created an association between that trade dress and a source in the mind of the consumer.

Although the law is evolving, as it stands now, product packaging (including packaging in very general terms, such as a building’s décor) may be inherently distinctive.&lt;ref name="twopesos"/&gt; However, product design, that is the design or shape of the product itself, may not be inherently distinctive, and must acquire secondary meaning.

===Protection for electronic interfaces and websites===
Although the exact boundaries of protection are still uncertain, courts are beginning to allow trade dress protection for the overall “[[look and feel]]” of a website.  In ''Blue Nile, Inc. v. Ice.com, Inc.'', the plaintiff sued the defendant for copying the overall “look and feel” of plaintiff’s retail jewelry websites, including the design of plaintiff’s search pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Blue Nile, Inc. v. Ice.com, Inc.'', 478 F. Supp. 2d 1240 (W.D. Wash., 2007)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16544665442853652360|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the court ordered more factual development before it could rule definitively on the issue, the court did hold that it was possible for the look and feel of the websites to have trade dress protection if the plaintiff’s copyright claims did not already cover those parts.  In ''[[SuicideGirls|SG Services]], Inc. v. [[GodsGirls|God’s Girls]], Inc.'', the court denied trade dress protection for the plaintiff’s website because the plaintiff did not demonstrate that the website was non-functional or distinctive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SG Serv., Inc. v. God’s Girls, Inc.'', non-reported case, 2007 WL 2315437 (C.D. Cal. 2007)|url=http://www.websupp.org/data/DOR/3:05-cv-01526-28-DOR.pdf|website=WebsUpp|accessdate=12 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705111818/http://www.websupp.org/data/DOR/3:05-cv-01526-28-DOR.pdf|archivedate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case shows the court’s willingness to consider trade dress protection for a website, even though the court did not find protection in this case.  It is notable, however, that the ''SG Services'' court did not look at the overall “look and feel” of the website, but rather, at specific characteristics (such as color) of the website that the plaintiff claimed were infringed.

Although the future of trade dress protection for websites is still very unclear, much thought has been given to this area and it will likely continue to be actively developing area for courts and litigants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Xuan-Thao N. |last=Nguyen |title=Should it be a Free for All?

'''WinCustomize''' is a [[website]] that provides content for users to customize [[Microsoft Windows]]. The site hosts thousands of [[skin (computing)|skins]], [[theme (computer)|themes]], [[icon (computing)|icons]], [[computer wallpaper|wallpapers]], and other graphical content to modify the Windows [[graphical user interface]].  There are some premium or paid content, however the vast majority of the content is free for users to download.

== Site history ==
WinCustomize was launched in March 2001 by [[Brad Wardell]] and [[Pat Ford (businessman)|Pat Ford]], both of whom work at [[Stardock]]. After the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com recession]] had taken down many popular [[skin (computing)|skin]] sites, WinCustomize quickly grew in popularity due to a combination of wide variety of content, uptime reliability, and being the preferred content destination by [[Stardock]] customers.

The site has grown at a far greater pace than its founders had anticipated. It has managed to avoid having to put many limitations on users or having to resort to pop-up advertising because of its corporate patron Stardock subsidizing its costs.
This growth has prompted several site redesigns to offer improved functionality and reliability to users.

Since launch, WinCustomize has undergone several iterations:

'''WinCustomize 2k5''' - Launched at the end of 2004, WinCustomize was redesigned for improved stability, and added functionality (personal pages for subscribers, an articles system, tutorials etc.).

'''WinCustomize 2k7''' - Launched January 15, 2007, WC2k7 was a from-the-ground-up rewrite using [[ASP.NET]]. The focus was to build a foundation that was easier to maintain and, in the future, expand.

'''WinCustomize v6''' - Planned for Late 2008/Early 2009, the WC v6 project aims be a major revision to how users navigate and interact with the site and the community as a whole. Where 2k7 was focused on the core codebase, v6 is focused on the user interface and experience.

In July 2007 the WinCustomize Wiki was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.wincustomize.com/?aid=157328|title=Welcome to the WinCustomize Wiki!|author=Mike Crassweller|date=2007-07-10|accessdate=2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WinCustomize 2010''' - WinCustomize 2010 was launched on April 20, 2010.  This major revision represents a major change in the sites look and navigation for users. A guided tour of the new site was published for users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wincustomize.com/article/378698/|title=WinCustomize 2K10 Guided Tour|author=Frogboy|date=2010-03-25|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forum criticisms==
{{peacock|section|date=July 2011}}
While nearly all users visit WinCustomize.com to download [[skin (computing)|skins]], [[Theme (computing)|themes]], [[icons]], [[computer wallpaper|wallpapers]], and other content for their personal computers, WinCustomize does have extensive forums and articles areas. As with most large sites, WinCustomize is not without its critics with regards to how the forums are run and the content in the articles and forums area.

The site's news contains a great deal of editorial content. As a result, some users are occasionally concerned with stories that they feel are biased against policies or issues they disagree with. For example, site owner [[Brad Wardell]] has written articles that are critical of Apple, European policy, commercialism, anti-commercialism, and more. One recent article criticized Norway's banning of the iPod music store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wincustomize.com/articles.aspx?aid=142193 Norway bans iTunes store, cuts nose, spites face]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of WinCustomize is the site's close association with [[Stardock]] which owns the site. Some feel there is a [[conflict of interest]] in the world's largest skinning site (over 20 million visitors monthly){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} being operated by a software developer that sells skinning solutions.

'''Young adult fiction''' ('''YA''') is a category of [[fiction]] published for readers in their [[youth]]. YA books are catered towards readers from 12 to 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/the-young-adult-book-market-2799954|title=Young Adult Book Market Facts and Figures|work=The Balance|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the genre is targeted to teenagers, approximately half of YA readers are adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/12/why-so-many-adults-are-love-young-adult-literature/547334/|title=Why So Many Adults Read Young-Adult Literature|last=Kitchener|first=Caroline|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject matter and genres of YA correlate with the age and experience of the protagonist. The genres available in YA are expansive and include most of those found in adult fiction. Common themes related to YA include: friendship, first love, relationships, and identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ils.unc.edu/MSpapers/2861.pdf|title=THEMES FOUND IN YOUNG ADULT LITERATURE: A COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN 1980 AND 2000|last=Wells|first=April|date=2003|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories that focus on the specific challenges of youth are sometimes referred to as [[problem novel]]s or [[Coming-of-age story|coming-of-age novel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Nancy, Crafting Stories for Children. Cincinnati: Writer's Digest Books, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

YA was developed to soften the transition between children's novels and adult literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunning|first=Stephen|date=1962|title=Criticism and the "Young Adult Novel"|jstor=40366769|journal=The High School Journal|volume=45|issue=5|pages=208–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years{{when|date=August 2018}}, diversity has become a defining feature of young adult novels.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==History==

===Beginning===
The history of young adult literature is tied to the history of how childhood and young adulthood has been perceived. One early writer to recognize young adults as a distinct group was [[Sarah Trimmer]], who, in 1802, described "young adulthood" as lasting from ages 14 to 21.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt; In her children's literature periodical, ''[[The Guardian of Education]]'', Trimmer introduced the terms "Books for Children" (for those under fourteen) and "Books for Young Persons" (for those between fourteen and twenty-one), establishing terms of reference for young adult literature that still remains in use.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt; Nineteenth century literature presents several early works,  that appealed to young readers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation | Garland | 1998 | p = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; though not necessarily written for them, including ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' (1812), [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' (1814), [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1838), [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1844), ''[[Tom Brown's Schooldays]]'' (1857), Dickens' ''[[Great Expectations]]'' (1860), ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1865), [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' (1876), and  ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884), [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'' (1886), [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' (1894), and ''[[Moonfleet]]'' (1898) by [[J. Meade Falkner]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===20th century===
In the 1950s, two influential adult novels, ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' (1951) and ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' (1954), which were not initially marketed to adolescents, still attracted the attention of the adolescent demographic.&lt;ref name=test/&gt;

The modern classification of young-adult fiction originated during the 1950s and 1960s, especially after the publication of [[S. E. Hinton]]'s ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'' (1967). The novel features a truer, darker side of adolescent life that was not often represented in works of fiction of the time, and was the first novel published specifically marketed for young adults as Hinton was one when she wrote it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/hinton-outsiders-young-adult-literature|title=S. E. Hinton and the Y.A. Debate|last=Michaud|first=Jon|date=2014-10-14|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written during high-school and published when Hinton was only 17, ''The Outsiders'' also lacked the nostalgic tone common in books about adolescents written by adults.&lt;ref name=Peck&gt;Dale Peck, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/books/review/Peck-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=3 'The Outsiders': 40 Years Later], ''New York Times'', 23 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Outsiders'' remains one of the best-selling young adult novels of all time.&lt;ref name=Peck/&gt;

The 1960s became the era "when the 'under 30' generation became a subject of popular concern, and research on adolescence began to emerge. It was also the decade when literature for adolescents could be said to have come into its own".&lt;ref&gt;Cart, p. 43,&lt;/ref&gt; This increased the discussions about adolescent experiences and the new idea of adolescent authors. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, what has come to be known as the "fab five"&lt;ref&gt;Cart, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; were published: ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' (1969), an autobiography of the early years of American poet [[Maya Angelou]]; ''The Friends'' (1973) by [[Rosa Guy]]; the semi-autobiographical ''[[The Bell Jar]]'' (US 1963, under a pseudonym; UK 1967) by poet [[Sylvia Plath]]; ''[[Bless the Beasts and Children (novel)|Bless the Beasts and Children]]'' (1970) by [[Glendon Swarthout]]; and ''[[Deathwatch (novel)|Deathwatch]]'' (1972) by [[Robb White]], which was awarded 1973 [[List of Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Juvenile winners|Edgar Award]] for Best Juvenile Mystery by the [[Mystery Writers of America]]. The works of Angelou, Guy, and Plath were not written for young readers.

As publishers began to focus on the emerging adolescent market, booksellers and libraries began creating young adult sections distinct from [[children's literature]] and novels written for [[adult]]s. The 1970s to the mid-1980s have been described as the [[golden age]] of young-adult fiction, when challenging novels began speaking directly to the interests of the identified adolescent market.&lt;ref name=test&gt;Owen, Mary, "Developing a Love of Reading"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, young adult literature began pushing the envelope in terms of the subject matter that was considered appropriate for their audience: Books dealing with topics such as [[rape]], [[suicide]], parental death, and [[murder]] which had previously been deemed taboo, saw significant critical and commercial success.  A flip-side of this trend was a strong revived interest in the romance novel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}  With an increase in number of teenagers the genre "matured, blossomed, and came into its own, with the better written, more serious, and more varied young adult books (than those) published during the last two decades".&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson and Lynch-Brown, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first novel in [[J.K. Rowling]]'s seven-book ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', was published in 1997. The series was praised for its complexity and maturity, and attracted a wide adult audience. While not technically YA, its success led many to see Harry Potter and its author, J.K. Rowling, as responsible for a resurgence of young adult literature, and re-established the pre-eminent role of speculative fiction in the field,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grady |first1=Constance |title=The Outsiders reinvented young adult fiction. Harry Potter made it inescapable |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/26/15841216/outsiders-harry-potter-ya-young-adult-se-hinton-jk-rowling |accessdate=21 June 2018 |work=Vox |date=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a trend further solidified by ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' trilogy by Suzanne Collins. The end of the decade saw a number of awards appear such as the [[Printz Award|Michael L. Printz Award]] and [[Alex Awards]], designed to recognize excellence in writing for young adult audiences.

The category of young adult fiction continues to expand into other media and genres: [[graphic novels]]/[[manga]], [[light novels]], [[fantasy]], [[mystery fiction]], [[romance novels]], and even subcategories such as [[cyberpunk]], [[techno-thriller]]s, and [[contemporary Christian fiction]].

== Themes ==
Many young adult novels feature coming-of-age stories. These feature adolescents beginning to transform into adults, working through personal problems, and learning to take responsibility for their actions.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.com/reference/article/qualities-young-adult-literature/|title=Qualities of Young Adult Literature  {{!}} Education.com|website=www.education.com|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; YA serves many literary purposes. It provides a pleasurable reading experience for young people, emphasizing real life experiences and problems in easier-to-grasp ways, and depicts societal functions.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

An analysis of YA novels between 1980 to 2000 found seventeen expansive literary themes. The most common of these were friendship, getting into trouble, romantic and sexual interest, and family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ils.unc.edu/MSpapers/2861.pdf|title=Themes Found in Young Adult Literature: A comparative study between 1980 and 2000|last=Wells|first=April|date=2003|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common thematic elements revolve around the coming-of-age nature of the texts. This includes narratives about self-identity, life and death, and individuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/101928/GRADU-1504520036.pdf?sequence=1|title="We Are All Adolescents Now" The Problematics of Categorizing Young Adult Fiction as a Genre|last=Risku|first=Johanna|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genre ==
There are no distinguishable differences in genre styles between YA fiction and adult fiction. Some of the most common YA genres include contemporary fiction, fantasy, romance, and dystopian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.whsmith.co.uk/explore-the-themes-and-genres-of-young-adult-books/|title=Explore the Themes and Genres of Young Adult Books|last=|first=|date=|website=blog.whsmith.co.uk|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genre-blending, which is the combination of multiple genres into one work, is also common in YA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slj.com/2015/11/collection-development/focus-on-collection-development/ya-genre-blending-focus-on/|title=YA Genre-Blending {{!}} Focus On {{!}} School Library Journal|website=www.slj.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New adult fiction===

[[New adult fiction]] (also known as NA) is a genre, generally written about and aimed towards young adults between 18 and 30 years old.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebscohost.com/novelist/novelist-special/what-is-new-adult-fiction-anyway|title=What is New Adult Fiction, Anyway? {{!}} NoveList {{!}} EBSCOhost|last=Wetta|first=Molly|date=|website=www.ebscohost.com|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many publishers specifically target the genre towards the 18 to 24 age range.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/What-Is-New-Adult-Fiction-Gillian-Engberg/pid=6918519|title=What Is New Adult Fiction?, by Gillian  Engberg {{!}} Booklist Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "new adult" was popularized in 2009 when [[St. Martin's Press]] ran a contest requesting stories about "a sort of older YA or new adult."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/63285-new-adult-matures.html|title=New Adult: A Book Category For Twentysomethings by Twentysomethings|last=Naughton|first=Julie|date=2014|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some disparities in defining new adult, but it generally focuses on characters exploring the challenges of adult life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Common themes include: relationships, college life, self-identity, new responsibilities, and issues like abuse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Often, new adult is seen as a subcategory of [[Romance novel|romance]] as many books feature themes like [[Human sexuality|sexual exploration]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Critics of the new adult genre claim that the terminology is condescending because it implies that readers need "training wheels" before reading adult fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/lauren-sarner/the-problem-with-new-adul_b_3755165.html|title=The Problem With New Adult Books|last=Sarner|first=Lauren|date=2013-08-14|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that New Adult bridges the gap between Young Adult and Adult Fiction by detailing how to adjust to life after adolescence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Popular new adult authors include [[Jennifer Armentrout|Jennifer L. Armentrout]], [[Jamie McGuire (author)|Jamie McGuire]], [[Colleen Hoover]] and [[Tammara Webber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libproxy.highpoint.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1327564186?accountid=11411|title="New Adult" is growing up and finding its way|last=Donahue|first=Deidre|date=2013|website=libproxy.highpoint.edu|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problem novels ===
{{see also|Social novel|Social protest novel}}
[[File:The outsiders 1967 first edition.jpg|thumb|Front cover of ''The Outsiders'' by S.E. Hinton]]
"Social-problem" novels or [[Social novel|problem novels]] are a [[sub-genre]] of literature focusing and commenting on overarching social problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/social-problem-novel|title=Social problem novel {{!}} literature|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a type of [[realistic fiction]] that characteristically depict contemporary issues such as [[poverty]], [[drug]]s, and pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallo|first=Donald|date=1989|title=Problem Novels|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/H1420091656/GLS?u=nclivehpu&amp;sid=GLS&amp;xid=3f289278.|journal=Children's Literature Review|volume=142|pages=|via=Gale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 1967, [[S. E. Hinton|S.E. Hinton's]] ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'' is often credited as the first problem novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cart|first=Michael|date=2016|title=Young Adult Literature: The State of a Restless Art|url=https://aquila.usm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1099&amp;context=slisconnecting|journal=Youth Services|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nichols|first=Kristen|date=2005|title=Teen pregnancy in young adult literature|url=https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=17165&amp;context=rtd|journal=Iowa State University Digital Repository|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this release, problem novels were popularized and dominated during the 1970s.

[[Sheila A. Egoff Children's Literature Prize|Sheila Egoff]] described three reasons why problem novels resonate with adolescents:&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturm|first=Brian|last2=Michel|first2=Karin|date=Winter 2008|title=The Structure of Power in Young Adult Problem Novels|url=http://libproxy.highpoint.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/217702509?accountid=11411|journal=Young Adult Library Services|volume=7|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* They depict real situations that the readers are experiencing so they have "therapeutic value"
* They are interesting, new and foreign to those not experiencing these issues,
* They feature mature story lines which appeals to a child's desire to grow up.

A classic example of a problem novel and one that defined the sub-genre is ''[[Go Ask Alice]]'' by Anonymous (pseudonym for [[Beatrice Sparks]]) published in 1971. ''Go Ask Alice'' is written in first-person as the diary of a young girl who experiences a lot of problems while growing up. In order to cope with her problems, the protagonist begins experimenting with drugs. Modern examples of problem novels include ''[[Speak (Anderson novel)|Speak]]'' by [[Laurie Halse Anderson]]'', [[Crank (novel)|Crank]]'' by [[Ellen Hopkins]], and ''[[The Perks of Being a Wallflower]]'' by [[Stephen Chbosky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/problem-novels|title=Popular Problem Novels Books|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boundaries between children's, young adult, and adult fiction===

The distinctions among [[children's literature]], young adult literature, and adult [[literature]] have historically been flexible and loosely defined. This line is often policed by adults who feel strongly about the border.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Flynn, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/childrens_literature_association_quarterly/v033/33.2.flynn.html Boundary Issues], ''Children's Literature Association Quarterly'', Volume 33, Number 2, Summer 2008&lt;/ref&gt; At the lower end of the age spectrum, fiction targeted to readers age 9 to 12 is referred to as middle-grade fiction. Some novels originally marketed to adults are of interest and value to adolescents, and vice versa, as in the case of books such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.write4kids.com/feature6.html|title=The Difference Between Middle School and Young Adult|author=Backes, Laura Backes|journal=Children's Book Insider|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020106161246/http://www.write4kids.com/feature6.html|archivedate=6 January 2002|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of middle grade novels and novel series include the ''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'' series by Rick Riordan, ''[[The Underland Chronicles]]'' by Suzanne Collins, and ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'' by Jeff Kinney. Some examples of young adult novels and novel series include the ''Harry Potter'' series by J.K. Rowling, ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' trilogy by Suzanne Collins, and the ''[[Mortal Instruments]]'' series by Cassandra Clare.

Middle grade novels are typically for the ages of 8–12. They tend to have an [[Readability|ATOS level]] of 5.0 or below, have a smaller word count, and are significantly less mature and complex in theme and content than YA, NA, or adult fiction. Young adult novels are for the ages of 12–18. They tend to have an ATOS level of 5.0 or above, have a larger word count, and tackle more mature and adult themes and content. Middle grade novels usually feature protagonists under the age of 13, whereas young adult novels usually feature protagonists within the age range of 12–18.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Sometimes, a variety of subcategories are recognized. These include early readers and picture books (''[[If You Give a Mouse a Cookie]]'', ''[[Magic Tree House]]'' series), chapter books (''[[The Boxcar Children]]''), lower middle grade (''[[Charlotte's Web]]'', [[Roald Dahl]]'s works), upper middle grade (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'', the first two ''Harry Potter'' installments), new young adult (''[[Northern Lights (novel)|The Golden Compass]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''), young adult (''The Hunger Games'', ''[[Catching Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter]]'' numbers four, five, and six), and edgy young adult (''[[Twilight: Breaking Dawn]]'', ''[[Mockingjay]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', ''[[Go Ask Alice]]'').{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Uses in the classroom==
[[File:Rick riordan 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Rick Riordan]], author of the ''Percy Jackson and the Olympians'' books]]
YA has been integrated into classrooms to increase student interest in reading. There is a common misconception that YA lit is solely for "struggling" or "reluctant" readers and should only be used in [[Remedial education|remedial classes]]. Studies have shown that YA can be beneficial in classroom settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hays|first=Alice|date=2016-07-08|title=Using Young Adult (YA) Literature in a Classroom: How Does YA Literature Impact Writing Literacies|url=https://journals.shareok.org/studyandscrutiny/article/view/205|journal=Study and Scrutiny: Research on Young Adult Literature|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=53–86|doi=10.15763/issn.2376-5275.2016.2.1.53-86|issn=2376-5275}}&lt;/ref&gt; YA fiction is written for young adults so often it is more relevant to students' social and emotional needs than [[Classic book|classic literature]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ostenson|first=Jonathan|last2=Wadham|first2=Rachel|date=Fall 2012|title=Young Adult Literature and the Common Core: A Surprisingly Good Fit|url=|journal=American Secondary Education|location=Bowling Green|volume=41|pages=4–13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of YA in classrooms is linked to:&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scherff|first=Lisa|last2=Groenke|first2=Susan|date=April 2009|title=Young Adult Literature in Today's Classroom|url=|journal=English Leadership Quarterly|volume=31|pages=1–3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* higher levels of engagement and motivation among students
* increased levels of self-confidence, personal development and self-identification
* increased desire to read similar books

Students who read YA are more likely to appreciate literature and have stronger reading skills than those that don't.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; YA also allows teachers to talk about "[[taboo]]" or difficult topics with their students. For example, a 2014 study shows that using [[Laurie Halse Anderson|Laurie Halse Anderson's]] novel ''[[Speak (Anderson novel)|Speak]]'' aided in discussions on consent and complicity. Those who read about tough situations, like [[date rape]], are more emotionally prepared to handle the situation if it arises.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; It is important to use diverse literature in the classroom, especially when discussing taboo topics, to avoid excluding minority students.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Literature written for young adults can also be used as a stepping stone to [[Western canon|canonical works]] that are traditionally read in classrooms, and required by many school [[curriculum]]s. In ''Building a Culture of Readers: YA Literature and the Canon'' by Kara Lycke, Lycke suggests pairing young adult literature and canon works to prepare young adults to understand the classic literature they will encounter.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lycke|first=Kara|date=Summer 2014|title=Building a Culture of Readers: YA Literature and the Canon|url=|journal=SIGNAL Journal|volume=|pages=24–29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; YA can provide familiar and less alienating examples of similar concepts than those in classic literature.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Suggested pairings include [[Rick Riordan|Rick Riordan's]] ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians|Percy Jackson]]'' series with the [[Iliad]] or the [[Odyssey]], or [[Stephenie Meyer]]'s ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' with ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''. When discussing identity, Lycke suggests pairing [[Nathaniel Hawthorne|Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' with [[Sherman Alexie]]'s ''[[The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian|The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian.]]''&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Young adult fiction and [[children's literature]] in general have historically shown a lack of diversity, that is, a lack of books with a main character who is a [[person of color]], [[LGBT]], or [[disability|disabled]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}  The numbers of children's book authors have shown a similar lack of diversity.&lt;ref name="ccbc table"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccbc.education.wisc.edu/books/pcstats.asp|title=Children's Books by and About People of Color|website=ccbc.education.wisc.edu|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diversity is considered beneficial{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} since it encourages children of diverse backgrounds to read and it teaches children of all backgrounds an accurate view of the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://diversebooks.org/faq/ |website=We Need Diverse Books (WNDB) |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid-2010's, more attention was drawn to this problem from various quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Charles |first1=Ron |title=‘We need diverse books,’ they said. And now a group’s dream is coming to fruition. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/we-need-diverse-books-they-said-and-now-a-groups-dream-is-coming-to-fruition/2017/01/03/af7f9368-d152-11e6-a783-cd3fa950f2fd_story.html |accessdate=4 November 2018 |work=Washington Post |date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the several years following, diversity numbers seem to have improved: One survey showed that in 2017, a quarter of children's books were about minority protagonists, almost a 10% increase from 2016.&lt;ref name="ccbc table"/&gt;
