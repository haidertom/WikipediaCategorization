'''Abuja Investments Company Limited''' (AICL) is a leading business development and investment holding company for the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), based in the Capital City - Abuja, Nigeria.

==History==
AICL was incorporated in 1994 as Abuja Investment and Property Development Company (AIPDC). The firm has since undergone a number of restructuring processes and currently functions as an interface between the government and investors interested in operating within the Federal Capital Territory. AICL was created and is wholly owned by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) with the vision to build capacity in public private partnership administration and asset management for sustained development. AICL was conceived to be a publicly owned yet privately funded Limited Liability Company to act as the FCT’s Holding Company. With over $100M currently under management AICL has grown to become a world class investment firm with a diversified portfolio to include investments in Transportation, Technology, Real Estate, etc.

{{for|ads that follow you around|behavioral retargeting}}

'''Ad tracking''', also known as post-testing or ad effectiveness tracking, is in-market research that [[Copy testing|monitors a brand’s performance]] including [[brand awareness|brand]] and [[advertising]] awareness, product trial and usage, and attitudes about the brand versus their competition.

Depending on the speed of the [[purchase cycle]] in the category, tracking can be done continuously (a few interviews every week) or it can  be “pulsed,” with interviews conducted in widely spaced waves (ex. every three or six months). Interviews can either be conducted with separate, matched samples of consumers, or with a single ([[longitudinal study|longitudinal]]) panel that is interviewed over time.

Since the researcher has information on when the ads launched, the length of each advertising flight, the money spent, and when the interviews were conducted, the results of ad tracking can provide information on the effects of advertising.

==Purpose==
The purpose of ad tracking is generally to provide a measure of the combined effect of the [[media weight]] or spending level, the effectiveness of the media buy or targeting, and the quality of the advertising executions or creative.

Advertisers use the results of ad tracking to estimate the [[return on investment]] (ROI) of advertising, and to refine advertising plans. Sometimes, tracking data are used to provide inputs to Marketing Mix Models which marketing science statisticians build to estimate the role of advertising, as compared to [[pricing]], distribution and other marketplace variables on sales of the brand.

==Methodology==
Today, most ad tracking studies are conducted via the [[Internet]]. Some ad tracking studies are conducted continuously and others are conducted at specific points in time (typically before the advertising appears in market, and then again after the advertising has been running for some period of time). The two approaches use different types of analyses, although both start by measuring advertising awareness. Typically, the respondent is either shown a brief portion of a commercial or a few memorable still images from the TV ad. Other media typically are cued using either branded or de-branded visual of the ad. Then, respondents answer three significant questions.
# Do you recognize this ad? (recognition measure)
# Please type in the sponsor of this ad. ([[Wiktionary: unaided awareness|unaided awareness]] measure)
# Please choose from the following list, the sponsor of this ad. ([[Wiktionary: aided awareness|aided awareness]] measure)

The continuous tracking design analyzes advertising awareness over time, in relation to ad spending; separately, this design tracks brand awareness, and then develops indices of effectiveness based on the strength of the correlations between ad spending and brand awareness.

The most popular alternate approach to the continuous tracking design is the [[Communicants]] System longitudinal design, in which the same people are interviewed at two points in time. Changes in brand measures (for example, brand purchasing and future [[purchase intention]]s) exhibited among those who have seen the advertising are compared to the changes in brand measures that occurred among those unaware of advertising. By means of this method, the researchers can isolate those marketplace changes that were produced by advertising versus those that would have occurred without advertising.

==Internet tracking==
There are several different tools to track [[online ad]]s: [[banner ad]]s, [[Pay per click|ppc]] ads, [[pop-up ad]]s, and other types.  Several online advertising companies such as [[Google]] offer their own ad [[internet tracking|tracking]] service ([[Google Analytics]]) in order to effectively use their service to generate a positive ROI.  Third-party ad tracking services are commonly used by affiliate marketers.  Affiliate marketers are frequently unable to have access to the order page and therefore are unable to use a 3rd-party tool.  Many different companies have created tools to effectively track their commissions in order to optimize their profit potential.  The information provided will show the marketer which advertising methods are generating income and which are not and allows him to effectively allocate his budget.

==Measures==
Here is a list of some of the data a post-test might provide: 
&lt;div style="column-count:2;-moss-column-count:2;-web kit-column-count:2"&gt;
*[[Top of mind awareness]]
*Unaided brand awareness

A '''concern''' ({{lang-de|Konzern}}) is a type of [[Corporate group|business group]] common in Europe, particularly in [[Germany]]. It results from the merger of several legally independent companies into a single economic entity under unified management.

A concern consists of a controlling enterprise and one or more controlled enterprises.&lt;ref name="s17"&gt;Stock Corporation Act 1965 (Germany), section 17&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the controlling and controlled enterprises is based on the actual commercial and management relationships, unlike [[parent company|parent]] and [[subsidiary]] companies which are related by share ownership and voting rights.&lt;ref name="s16"&gt;Stock Corporation Act 1965 (Germany), section 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of professionals, the term ''Group'', also mistakenly ''within the meaning of large companies'' – regardless of its corporate structure – is understood.

The Group concept is one of [[European Union competition law|anti-trust]] relevance: the so-called Group privilege, the [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] of the consolidated Group companies involved, means that in itself, [[prohibition]] included practices did not violate [[Law of Germany|German]] or [[European Commission]] (EC) anti-trust law. On the other hand, the Group concept in [[Banking Act]] in the formation of [[borrower unit]] and particularly of the [[trade credit|large credit]] limits of paramount importance.

==Types of Concern==
The 1965 ''Aktiengesetz'', literally "stock law", but commonly known in English as the German Stock Corporation Act, defines a concern as: "one dominant and one or more dependent companies, together under the unified leadership of the ruling company".&lt;ref name="s18"&gt;Stock Corporation Act 1965 (Germany), section 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Aktiengesetz'' applies only to any ''[[Aktiengesellschaft]]en'' (AG; literally "stock company"; singular ''Aktiengesellschaft''), which are analogous to [[public company|public companies]] in the English-speaking world. An ''Aktiengesellschaft'' differs from a ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]]'' (GmbH), which is analogous to [[limited liability]] companies in other countries. A GmbH is regulated under the ''Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung'' of 1892 (GmbH-Gesetz; literally "law concerning companies with limited liability").

Three different kinds of concern are identified under ''Aktiengesetz'': the contractual concern, the factual concern, and the flat concern.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reich-Graefe|first1=Rene|title=Changing Paradigms: The Liability of Corporate Groups in Germany|journal=Connecticut Law Review|date=2005|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contractual Concern===
In this form of concern, the controlling enterprise and controlled enterprise enter into a control agreement – wherein the controlling enterprise can obtain management powers over the controlled enterprise, sometimes amounting to complete control – and/or a profit transfer agreement.&lt;ref name="s291"&gt;Stock Corporation Act 1965 (Germany), section 291&lt;/ref&gt; These powers may be used in a way that is detrimental to the subsidiary, provided that they are in the interests of the concern and do not damage the legal separateness of the subsidiary.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt;

In return, the controlling enterprise is liable to compensate the controlled enterprise for all deficits of the controlled enterprise during the term of the agreement.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt;

===Factual Concern===
In this form of concern, the controlling enterprise exerts a controlling influence on the controlled enterprise, but there is no formal control or profit transfer agreement.&lt;ref name="s17" /&gt; If one company owns a majority in another company, then the first company is deemed to exert a controlling influence.&lt;ref name="s17" /&gt; The parent company is then liable for any damage which results from the interference of the parent company in the subsidiary, which is judged on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt; This kind of concern is more difficult to establish and so is more common.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt;

===Flat Concern===
In this version, there is no parent company, instead a number of legally separate companies are subject to common direction.&lt;ref name="s18" /&gt;

==Other forms of Concern==
To apply the law of concern to concerns involving German limited liability companies, the German courts have created the qualified de facto concern, beginning in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt; This form of concern applies only in parent subsidiary relationships. If the parent is shown to have a long-standing and pervasive control over the affairs of the subsidiary, then there is a presumption that the parent was not acting in the best interests of the subsidiary. If the parent is unable to displace this presumption, then the parent is liable for all the obligations of the subsidiary.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt;

This type of concern was limited by the German Federal Supreme Court in 2002 to only apply where the control is such that the subsidiary will inevitably collapse or become insolvent, on the basis that the parent has abused the separate legal personality of the subsidiary.&lt;ref name="Changing Paradigms" /&gt;

==Conglomerate==
''(inorganic groups)''
The '''[[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]''' consists of enterprises in different businesses. Unlike the concern, the companies in a conglomerate have limited business relationships with each other.

==Criticism of corporations==
The result of the merger often emerging political power of (wholesale) companies has been criticised for their formation. The critics can be divided into three groups:
#'' ''Politicians: Political criticism about the group size are reflected in the [[European Union competition law]] and [[competition law|anti-trust laws]].
#'' ''The Church: The Church's criticism comes through Christian [[catholic social teaching|social teaching]] (or [[business ethics|corporate ethics]]).
#'' ''Society: Social criticism can be found since the formation of the [[labour movement]], especially in the currents of [[Social democracy]] and [[Marxism]].
Since the emergence of [[social movement|New Social Movements]], corporations have also become the focus of movements such as the [[Environmental movement]] and the [[Anti-globalization movement]] (see [[Black Book brand companies]]).

Dan Olof Olofsson, born 24 September 1950, is a Swedish [[entrepreneur]], business leader and [[philanthropist]].

Olofsson has been married to Christin since 1973. Together, they have three children: Johan (born 1974), Andreas (born 1977) and Hanna (born 1980).

== Biography ==

===Early life and education===
Dan Olofsson was born in Ekenäs in Finland. His father was employed as pastor of Karis from 1948 to 1951. His parents and family are rooted in [[Jämtland]] in northern Sweden. When Olofsson was one year old his family moved to [[Malmö]] in southern Sweden, where he was brought up and still lives.&lt;ref name="Reference1"&gt;[http://www.sydsvenskan.se/familj/fodelsedag/hemma-bast-for-it-kungen/ "Hemma bäst för IT-kungen"], ''[[Sydsvenskan]]'', 23 September 2010 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressen.se/kvp/it-miljardaren-dan-har-hittat-sin-oas-i-malmo/ "IT-miljardären Dan har hittat sin oas i Malmö"], [[Kvällsposten]], 9 September 2012 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olofsson attended upper secondary technical school at Pauliskolan in Malmö and graduated as Master of Science in Engineering at Lunds Tekniska Högskola in 1974.&lt;ref name="Reference1"/&gt;

===Career===
After his education, Olofsson began a career in the technology consulting industry. He started at VBB (what is now [[Sweco]]) and then proceeded to Skandiaconsult.

In 1986 Sapia was established, and Dan Olofssons was assigned the task of building its technical consultancy part, which he then acquired in 1993. The company was renamed [[Sigma]], and an [[IPO]] took place in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisionwire.se/sigma/r/sigmas-erbjudande-overtecknat-40-ggr,c146725 "Sigmas erbjudande övertecknat 40 ggr"], Pressmeddelande Sigma AB., 10 February 1997 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, each of Sigma's three business areas became separate companies and went public as [[Sigma]], [[Epsilon]] and [[Teleca]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.affarsvarlden.se/hem/nyheter/article2568473.ece, "Sigma delas upp i tre bolag"], Affärsvärlden, 24 januari 2001 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the start in 1986, Sigma, Epsilon and Teleca has grown from zero to approximately 9,000 employees in an entrepreneurial development with subsidiaries in over ten countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varldenidag.se/nyhet/2007/12/04/Kamp-mot-aids-ny-utmaning-for-IT-miljardaren "Kamp mot aids ny utmaning för IT-miljardären"], Världen idag, 4 december 2007  {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a concept called entrepreneurial packages some 25 companies with currently more than 3,000 employees have been established.

Today, Dan Olofsson is conducting his business through the family-owned company Danir AB, where his son Johan Glennmo is CEO. Via a public offer in 2013, Danir acquired the entire Sigma group. Sigma has since developed very well and grown organically with approximately 600 employees per year. Currently it has 3,300 employees. Danir also has a number of other investments in different countries.

In the autumn of 2012, Dan Olofsson’s autobiography "Mina tre liv" ("My three lives") was published by the publishing house Ekerlids Förlag. The book has received particular attention for its claim that the Swedish government should have committed a financial miscarriage of justice at financier Maths O Sundqvist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svd.se/opinion/ledarsidan/pa-ett-ogonblick-kan-allt-forandras_7541344.svd "Göran Skytte: På ett ögonblick kan allt förändras"], Svenska Dagbladet, 30 September 2012 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Dan Olofsson has actively participated in the public debate on issues relating to business conditions and entrepreneurship.

===Commitment in Africa and in Malmö===
After having devoted himself to his great hunting interest in [[Africa]], he and his wife Christin Olofsson in the early 2000s decided to develop the safari facility Thanda Safari with more than 14,000 hectares of land in KwaZulu-Natal in eastern [[South Africa]]. Every year 2009–2016 this safari facility has been named "The World’s Leading Luxury Lodge" by the World Travel Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtravelawards.com/award-worlds-leading-luxury-lodge-2012 "World Travel Awards 2012"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the marine reserve Thanda Island opened in Tanzania with major contribution from Vaughan.

Dan Olofssons’s philanthropic commitment is best seen through the organization [[Star for Life]], which he and his wife Christin launched in 2005. So far, 250,000 young people has participated in a three-year preventive programme against [[HIV|hiv/aids]] in [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=Reference9&gt;[http://www.gbchealth.org/award/107/?words=olofsson "Community Philanthropy Award Commended (2008)"], GBCHealth, 31 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/internationell/frankrike/zlatan/article13797700.ab "Jag känner att jag vill ge tillbaka"], Aftonbladet, 18 oktober 2011 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Star for Life recently was established also in Sweden, to strengthen young people's self-esteem and belief in the future.

Dan Olofsson is also the founder of the Thanda Foundation, working with projects in KwaZulu-Natal and in Nelson Mandela's birthplace Mvezo in Eastern Cape Province in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisionwire.se/thanda-foundation "Genombrott för Sydafrikaprojektet som engagerar Dan Olofsson:   Siemens bygger gymnasium i världsklass i Nelson Mandelas födelseby"], Pressmeddelande Thanda Foundation, 29 juni 2011 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2011, Dan Olofsson initiated the funding of "Uppstart Malmö", a trust aimed at creating more job opportunities in the under-privileged areas of his hometown Malmö. The concept behind the trust is to offer advice, support and financial help to local entrepreneurs who want to develop their business ideas and create more jobs, and to help young people enter the labor market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34761">The '''Employers' Association of Greater Chicago''' ('''EA''') was a [[nonprofit]] [[voluntary association|association]] of employers based in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. It was founded as the Employers' Association of Chicago in 1903, although it was also known colloquially as the Chicago Employers' Association.  Its goal was to oppose the unionization of companies in the Chicago area, and assist unionized companies in deunionization.

Over time, the organization's commitment to union avoidance lessened greatly and the organization became more heavily involved in traditional [[human resources]] training and consulting.  The organization changed its name to the Employers' Association of Greater Chicago in 1959, and merged with the Midwest Industrial Management Association in 1981.

==Founding and early years==
The group was founded as the Employers' Association of Chicago (the EA) in 1902 during a [[Strike action|strike]] against telephone equipment manufacturers.

In January 1902, Brass Molder's Union Local 83 struck [[Stromberg-Carlson]] and [[Western Electric]], seeking to win the [[closed shop]] in [[collective bargaining]] negotiations. The employers [[Lockout (industry)|locked out]] the workers and brought in [[strikebreaker]]s. Union members began attacking the strikebreakers.  On May 7, 1903, the union struck the [[Kellogg Switchboard &amp; Supply Company]]. Kellogg Switchboard, too, locked out 90 percent of its workforce and hired strikebreakers. The [[Teamsters|Teamsters Joint Council of Chicago]] began a [[sympathy strike]] on June 24, 1903.  The three employers sought injunctions against the sympathy strike, which they won on July 20, 1903. The Brass Molders' strike collapsed soon afterward.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, ''The Racketeer's Progress: Chicago and the Struggle for the Modern American Economy, 1900-1940,'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, ''Lawyers Against Labor: From Individual Rights to Corporate Liberalism,'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1902, the Employers' Association of Chicago was formed.  [[John G. Shedd]], vice-president of [[Marshall Field &amp; Company]], was the primary force behind the organization of the group.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; Shedd became the first president. [[Montgomery Ward]] manager (later president) [[Robert J. Thorne]] was the first vice-president; grocery store president [[Frank H. Armstrong]] of [[Reid, Murdoch &amp; Company]] the second vice-president; and [[William E. Clow]], president of plumbing manufacturer [[J.B. Clow &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref name="LaborWar"&gt;"Labor War in Chicago," ''New York Times,'' November 1, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal was to secure the [[open shop]], resist unionization, and break unions in workplaces where they existed.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LaborWar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plans"&gt;"Plans War on Teamsters," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' June 17, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; The group kept its membership secret for fear of generating strikes by the Teamsters. By the end of the year, the EA's existence had become public knowledge and the organization had hired its first staff person, former labor arbitrator Frederick W. Job.&lt;ref name="LaborWar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Job"&gt;"Job Quits As Arbitrator," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' December 9, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; The EA was heavily funded by the city's banks, and by other large companies such as [[Rand McNally]].&lt;ref name="LaborWar" /&gt;

The EA took its first active role in a labor dispute during the 1902-03 telephone equipment strike.  The Teamsters and team owners had formed a body known as the Chicago Board of Arbitration (CBA) in early 1903. Ostensibly, the CBA was established to mediate disputes between drivers and their employers. But the CBA quickly asserted jurisdiction over all labor disputes in the city.  The Teamsters could force employers to the table by striking, where the team owners would win decisions which enabled them to profit at the expense of other business owners.  When the CBA attempted to intervene in the telephone equipment strike, the EA retaliated.  The EA threw its entire support behind Kellogg Switchboard, which subsequently refused to bargain with the union. The EA also supplied funds and legal expertise which enabled Kellogg Switchboard to win a court injunction forcing the Teamsters to end their sympathy strike.  These actions helped break the strike.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Facing Defeat, Unions Weaken," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' July 18, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teamsters quickly became the biggest target of the EA.  In early 1904, the Teamsters aligned all their contracts to expire simultaneously on May 1, 1905. The EA then passed a resolution on June 16, 1904, declaring that no employer would sign a contract with the Teamsters after May 1, 1905.&lt;ref name="Plans" /&gt;

The EA's biggest anti-union push came in 1905.  On December 15, 1904, 19 clothing cutters at Montgomery Ward went on strike to protest the company's use of nonunion subcontractors.  The Montgomery Ward quickly locked them out.  Sympathy strikes by several tailors' unions broke out, as did sympathy strikes by other unions.  By April, 5,000 workers were on the picket line.  The Teamsters engaged in a sympathy strike on April 6, 1905, adding another 10,000 members to the strike.  The EA collected $250,000 (about $6.2 million in 2007 dollars) from its members to hire [[strikebreaker]]s.  The EA also raised $1 million (about $25 million in 2007 dollars) to establish the Employers' Teaming Association-a new company which, within a matter of weeks, bought out a large number of team owners and imported hundreds of [[African American]] strikebreakers from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to drive the wagons. [[Mark Morton (businessman)|Mark Morton]], president of [[Morton Salt]] and an EA member, convinced the railroads to pressure the remaining team owners to lock out their Teamster members as well. The Teamsters upped the ante, and another 25,000 members walked off the job on April 25, 1905, paralyzing grocery stores, warehouses, railway shippers, department stores and coal companies. The EA and its members sued nearly every union as well.  Local and state courts issued numerous injunctions against the unions, ordering them to stop picketing and return to work.  When a wagon owner refused to do business with Montgomery Ward for fear that the Teamsters would picket him, a court forced the team owner to do business with the retailer.  Few courts were impartial in their administration of justice. One judge seated a [[grand jury]] whose foreman was [[A. A. McCormick]], the reactionary publisher of the ''[[Chicago Evening Post]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gigantic Strike Is In Full Swing," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' April 28, 1905; "Big Strike Has Small Beginning," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' May 20, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike ended not through the efforts of the EA or the unions, but due to the allegations of John C. Driscoll.  In June 1905, the grand jury led by foreman McCormick heard testimony by Driscoll, who at the time was secretary of the team owners' association.  Driscoll claimed that he had taken at least $10,000 in bribes from Thorne and executives at other companies to force the unions out on strike.  Driscoll also alleged that the Teamsters and other unions had demanded bribes to end the strike, and that Driscoll had skimmed portions of these bribes into his own pocket.  $50,000 in cancelled checks were produced in court to support Driscoll's claims.  Although Driscoll's testimony undercut both sides, public support for the unions suffered most. Although nearly every union continued to support the strike publicly, most sent their members back to work by the end of June.  The Teamsters continued to support the strike, but various divisions of the union also went back to work in June and July. By August 1, 1905, the strike was over and the employers ended the lockout.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Strike Leads to 49 Indictments," ''New York Times,'' July 2, 1905; "Project to End Strike," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' June 18, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1920s and 1930s==
The EA pressed its advantage against Chicago's unions.  It added building owners as members in 1913, and supported them in their fight with the [[Service Employees International Union|Building Service Employees International Union]]. It helped expose efforts to [[extortion|extort]] money from property owners in 1921, which led to the indictment and eventual imprisonment of BSEIU president [[William Quesse]].&lt;ref&gt;"Owners Leagued Against Janitors," ''Chicago Daily Tribune," December 28, 1913; "Hounded Flat Owners," ''New York Times,'' February 18, 1921; Jentz, "Unions, Cartels, and the Political Economy of American Cities: The Chicago Flat Janitors' Union in the Progressive Era and the 1920s," ''Studies in American Political Development,'' Spring 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, the EA attacked nascent unions in grocery stores and food industries, accusing them of vandalism, bombings and extortion as well.&lt;ref&gt;"Terror Plot to Bomb Grocers Bared in Report," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 25, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early and mid-1920s, the EA put pressure on unions in the city's milk and ice industries, accusing unions of blackmail, extortion, and establishing [[United States antitrust law|anti-competitive trusts]] and [[price fixing]].&lt;ref&gt;"Charge Labor Czars Control Citizens' Milk," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' September 16, 1925; "Bomb Milk Plant Which Bucks 'Trust'," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' September 17, 1925; "Renews Attack, Charging Trust in Selling Milk," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' September 18, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on illegal activities by unions proved so effective that the EA's main priority became attacking [[Racket (crime)|labor racketeering]]. The term "racketeering" was, in fact, coined by the Employers' Association of Chicago in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of [[organized crime]] in the [[Teamsters]] union.&lt;ref&gt;Witwer, "'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s," in ''Corrupt Histories,'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports about rackets and other illegal activities by labor unions and employers were issued annually by the EA.  In 1928, for example, the Employers' Association claimed that exactly 46 rackets were operating in Chicago.  The EA reported on the use of thugs and gunmen by both unions and employers, and excoriated the public and government officials for not prosecuting rackets more often or more successfully.&lt;ref&gt;"46 Species of Rackets Still Active, Charge," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' April 6, 1928; "Gunmen Taken Into Business for Trade War," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' May 27, 1928; "Blames Public Laxity for Racketeering," ''New York Times,'' October 2, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; EA reports also focused on bombings in the city. These reports provide statistical documentation of the level of organized crime-related violence in the city (although the EA reports rarely distinguish between union- or employer-instigated violence and violence undertaken by mob-dominated unions or employers). The Association's October 1928 report, which documented an astonishing 727 bombings in Chicago in the previous year, led to the formation of the city's first arson unit.&lt;ref&gt;"May Ask Mayor to Form Bomb, Arson Bureau," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' October 26, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1928, Employers' Association president [[James W. Breen]] was linked to the rackets himself. Chicago police investigators alleged that Breen had helped form a battery makers' cartel, and that this trade group was shaking down non-members. Breen promptly resigned as president of the association.  A year later, organized crime figures bombed Breen's home for fear that the ongoing investigation might lead to Breen's indictment and that he might inform on his associates.  But Breen was never indicted, however.&lt;ref name="Breen"&gt;"Breen Is Linked to New Battery Station Racket," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' October 27, 1928; "J.W. Breen's House Bombed," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' November 15, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Employers' Association made its first foray into legislative lobbying in 1928 as well.  That year, it called for repeal of the state of Illinois' "horse thief law," which permitted posses to form legally so long as they were in [[hot pursuit]] of criminals. The EA claimed that the law led citizens and employers to mistakenly believe gangs of union members were legal deputies when they were not.&lt;ref&gt;"Call Old 'Horse Thief' Law Aid to Modern Racketeers," ''Chicago Daily Tribune.,' November 11, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, the Association campaigned for a new city ordinance which would ban the resale of seized weapons to the public. The sale of the guns, the EA claimed, merely put more weapons in the hands of criminals while inducing law enforcement personnel to seize the weapons of law-abiding citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"Police Resell Weapons to Gangsters, Macoy Charges," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 22, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Employers' Association campaign against rackets remained strong through 1935.  In 1929, the EA issued a report estimating the costs of racketeering in the city of Chicago at $136 million a year (about $1.6 billion in 2007 dollars).  In August 1929, the Association reported 67 bombings in the past year, compared to 46 in 1928. The organization also posted a $5,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of any bomber, and a $1,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of any racketeer who assaulted an Employers' Association member. The bombing campaign only intensified, however, with another 30 bombings in August and September 1929. In 1931, the Association went public with a report which estimated the cost of bombings at $500 million ($6.8 billion in 2007 dollars), and the cost of racketeering at $145 million ($1.9 billion in 2007 dollars).  By 1932, the Employers' Association was claiming that the bombings and rackets cost the city more than the taxes it paid to fight [[World War I]]. Whether the EA's anti-racketeering campaign had any effect is unclear.  The [[Great Depression]] had caused union membership to drop significantly, and the end of [[Prohibition in the United States]] largely ended organized crime's primary motive for engaging in widespread violence.  But the EA campaign had also led to strengthened anti-racketeering laws and stronger enforcement as well.  By 1934, the number of bombings had dropped to their lowest since 1923.&lt;ref&gt;"Racketeering Costs Put at $136,000,000," ''New York Times,'' February 23, 1929; "Employers Join War on Bombers," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' August 4, 1929; "Bomb Campaign," ''Time,'' August 12, 1929; "97 Bombings in Ten Months, Record in City," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' October 7, 1929; "Rackets In Gain While Year Old Threat Grows Cold," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 14, 1930; "Chicago Pictured in Grip of Rackets," ''New York Times,'' January 18, 1931; "Finds Rackets Cost More Than War Did," ''New York Times,'' September 21, 1932; "Bombing Total in 1933 Lowest in Last 10 Years," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' November 16, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks on federal labor policy==
The passage of the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (the Wagner Act) in 1935 energized the Employers' Association, and drew it into a new field of activity.  Although the EA had long opposed [[collective bargaining]], federal legislation protecting labor unions took the organization by surprise.  The Association vociferously attacked [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s labor policies. But like many employers, the EA took a "wait and see" attitude until the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] had ruled on the Wagner Act's constitutionality.  The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute in 1937 in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation]]'' 301 U.S. 1 (1937). The EA rarely attacked the act for the remainder of the 1930s or during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Employers"&gt;"Employers Hear New Deal Labor Policy Attacked," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 8, 1935; "Blame Wagner Act for Labor Killings In City," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' January 16, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the post-war period it once more blasted unions and the federal government's labor policies. The EA undertook a campaign to influence Congressional opinion, and pushed strongly for repeal of the Wagner Act.  When repeal seemed out of reach, the EA supported the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] and the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]] (LMRDA).  It also sponsored a program to take advantage of the provisions of both acts by bolstering the role foremen played in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;"Truman Labor Stand Assailed By Chicagoans," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' December 22, 1945; "Charges Union Groups Try to Rule Business," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' September 21, 1946; "Trade Groups Hail Adoption of Labor Bill," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' June 24, 1947; "Seek to Boost Foreman Role in Production," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' October 28, 1947; "Query On Labor Law Is Send to Business Men," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 18, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1930s, labor-related disruptions and violence in Chicago had been greatly reduced.  Chicago law enforcement was also cracking down heavily on labor violence and racketeering, which won high praise from the Employers' Association.&lt;ref&gt;Bromage, "Lack of Labor Trouble Helps Chicago Trade," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 9, 1938; "Commend Police Labor Detail, At Work For Year," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 9, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association became much less active in labor relations in the 1950s and 1960s.  The organization undertook a brief resurgence of interested in rackets in 1951, however.  It attacked the Chicago Retail Druggists Association for "forcing" pharmacies to pay dues to the group, accused the restaurant workers' union of extorting money from cafes, threatened to sue the Teamsters union for violations of the LMRDA, and more.  It even went so far as to hire a former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, Frederick W. Turner, Jr., to investigate labor racketeering in the city.  But none of these campaigns had the impact of its 1920 efforts, and Turner's investigations produced next to nothing.  No indictments or grand jury investigations occurred, either.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, "Urged to 'Buy' Labor Peace, Druggists Say," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 24, 1951; Hartmann, "Boyle Probes 51 Cafe Strikes in Union Racket," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' March 20, 1951; Hartmann, "Employers Fight Investigator to Fight Rackets," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' April 3, 1951; Bliss, "Clean Up Your Union, Warning to Teamsters," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' July 4, 1957; "Demands Quiz on Charges of Work Ban Plot," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' July 19, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;  By November 1951, the EA dropped its pretense of "fair play" and announced it openly opposed unionization of every workplace. But this militaristic stand did little to revive the group.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, "Dealers Fight Organizing of Car Salesmen," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' November 22, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EA tried again to focus public attention on labor racketeering in 1962.  Once more, it hired an ex-FBI agent to investigate racketeering in the city of Chicago, and accused unions of using simple picketing as a means of extortion.  But the legal and political climate had changed, and these efforts were often unsuccessful.  In November 1964, [[Chicago City Council]] [[Alderman]] Thomas E. Keane accused the EA of anti-union bias—a charge the Association roundly denied.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, "Union Peace for 25 Years Is Celebrated," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 22, 1962; "Ex-FBI Agent Takes Job In Labor Field," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' July 10, 1962; Bliss, "Charge Unions Picketing to Force Pacts," ''Chicago Tribune,'' August 7, 1966; "Keane Charges Are Denied By Employers Unit," ''Chicago Tribune,'' November 21, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EA played a role in three more strikes, both of them affecting mechanics at auto dealerships.  In 1968, the Association acted as a spokesperson for the auto dealers in their attempt to resist unionization.&lt;ref&gt;"Auto Dealer Group Official Is Threatened," ''Chicago Tribune,'' May 14, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanics unionized, and struck the auto dealers in 1975, 1978 and 1981.  During each strike, the EA strongly and publicly supported the dealerships and continued to act as their primary spokesperson.  But the EA played little role other than that of public relations.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, "Work, Pay Dispute," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 4, 1975; "Mechanic Strike Set," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 6, 1975; Strong, "Striking Mechanics to Vote Friday," ''Chicago Tribune,'' September 19, 1975; "Car Dealers to Hold Firm," ''Chicago Tribune,'' September 25, 1975; Strong, "Car-Dealer Mechanics' Contract Vote Sunday," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 1, 1978; Strong, "Mechanic, Dealer Talks Resume," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 8, 1978; Strong, "U.S. Seeks New Talks in Mechanics' Strike," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 13, 1978; "Mediator Pushes End of Mechanics Strike," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 21, 1978; "Average Here: $285,224," ''Chicago Tribune,'' May 31, 1981; Strong, "Mechanics' Strike Could Strand Cars at Dealers," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 1, 1981; Strong, "Car Dealers, Mechanics Reach Truce," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 2, 1981; "Auto Mechanics' Strike Hits Most of Dealers Here," ''Chicago Tribune,'' July 11, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human resources and other initiatives, 1950-1980==
The Employers' Association had engaged in its first [[human resources]] consulting in 1918.  That year, it undertook a very successful campaign to encourage local businesses to hire middle-age managers with experience rather than discharge them.&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Bureau Puts Oslerism Out of Business," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' January 2, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EA did little in this field, however, until the 1940s.  As its anti-union campaigns flagged, the organization began to become more of a human resources consulting agency for its members.  In 1941, it released its first survey of workforce needs.  Some of its human resources educational efforts remained linked to its traditional anti-unionism, however.  In 1942, it campaigned for a longer workweek—ostensibly to meet wartime production demands, but which also violated union demands for shorter work periods.  In 1949, the group denounced fringe benefits such as health insurance, pensions, and life insurance as "unnecessary" and "unwise" and exorbitantly expensive.  It also declared unemployment insurance to be too costly and unnecessary, and demanded dismantling of public [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Predict Large Labor Need In Area," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' April 11, 1941; "40 Hour Week Must Be Abandoned to Win War, Civic Club Is Told," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' February 20, 1942; "'Fringe' Pay Rolls Amount to Millions," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' August 29, 1949; Hartmann, "Claims For Dole Mount As Many Jobs Go Begging," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' May 1, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EA also became involved in broader social issues.  Its leadership, always concerned with the spread of collectivist ideals, denounced President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a socialist and demanded that Congress rein in the president's economic policies.  The organization also attacked the publishers of elementary and junior high school textbooks for allowing "[[communism|communist]]" influences.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, "Ask Watchdogs of Congress to 'Guard People'," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' March 5, 1951; "Our Enemies," ''Time,'' July 16, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-time Association executive director (now president) Gordon L. Hostetter died in 1962, depriving the Employers' Association of its most active leadership.  Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the organization quietly worked with its members to improve their human resources capacities.  It defended employers when they were accused of racial bias in the administration of employment tests.&lt;ref&gt;"Criticize FEPC Order Banning Test On Hiring," ''Chicago Tribune,'' March 7, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; But the EA abandoned most of its anti-union programs.  The organization's membership, which had hovered at the 1,000-member mark for 60 years, remained stable.  But the Association became less and less of an important political and workplace player in Chicago.  In 1971, EA president Roland E. Fulton was elected president of the Employer Association Group of the [[National Association of Manufacturers]].  But this was the last major role the EA played in either local or national labor relations.&lt;ref name="NAM"&gt;"Employer Association Group, Chairs Since 1953," National Association of Manufacturers, no date.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the Employers' Association of Greater Chicago (as the group was now known) merged with the Midwest Industrial Management Association. In 1989, MIMA changed its name to become the [[Management Association of Illinois]]. The group still has about 1,000 member companies, roughly half of which are in manufacturing and half in the service sector.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, "Groups Proclaim New Era in Personnel Services," ''Chicago Tribune,'' December 6, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7704">In [[marketing]], '''geomarketing''' (also called '''marketing geography''') is a discipline that uses [[geolocation]] ([[Geography|geographic]] information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.&lt;ref name= "qr10"&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf "Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data"], Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in any aspect of the [[marketing mix]] – the product, price, promotion, or place ([[geo targeting]]).  [[Market segments]] can also correlate with location, and this can be useful in targeted marketing.

Geomarketing isapplied  in the financial sector through identifying ATMs traffic generators and creating hotspots maps based on geographical parameters integrated with customer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amcham.org.eg/Publications/BusinessMonthly/december%2007/CoverStory.asp Geomarketing] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080312045856/http://www.amcham.org.eg/Publications/BusinessMonthly/december%2007/CoverStory.asp |date=2008-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geomarketing has a direct impact on the development of modern trade and the reorganization of retail types. Site selection becomes automated and based on scientific procedures that saves both time and money. Geomarketing uses key facts, a good base map, [[Whois]] data layers, consumer profiling, and success/fail criteria.

[[GPS tracking]] and [[GSM localization]] can be used to obtain the actual position of the travelling customer.

==Geo marketing software==
[[Geolocation software]] is used to display data that can be linked to a geographic region or area.  It can be used to:
* Recommend nearby social events.&lt;ref name = "qr10"/&gt;
* Determine where the customers are (on country, city, street or user level).
* Determine who the customer is (on organisation or user level), or make a guess on it based on earlier encounters by tracking [[IP address]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipinfodb.com/ip_location_api.php|publisher=IPInfoDB|author=IPInfoDB|title=IP location XML API|date=2010-04-18|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; credit card information, VOIP address, etc.
* Visualize any data in a geographic context by linking it to a digital map.
* Locate a web client's computer on a digital map.
* Calculate summary information for specific areas.
* Select customers within specific areas.
* Select customers with a certain radius of a point.
* Using micro-geographic segmentation select customers similar to a specific type in the rest of the country.

Some of the software used includes [[Geoconcept]] Sales&amp;Marketing Portal, MapInfo, ArcGIS (ESRI), RegioGraph (GfK), WIGeoWeb (WIGeoGIS) assorted open source like Mapwindow, DIVA (which while normally used for bio-diversity creates very visually pleasing density maps), GRASS (which works in Linux and Windows environments) [[GeoEdge]] (tracking local ads and pages). Several other software are available. Indeed, Google Earth provides an excellent set of images that are always useful.

==Applications for Geo==

===Different content by choice===
Location-based social media marketing uses geo-specific tools to draw imaginary perimeters that will display all of the social content posted by users in that particular area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://growingsocialmedia.com/location-based-social-media-marketing/|title=Location Based Social Media Marketing|author=Lauren Wilson |publisher=Growing Social Media|date=22 August 2016|access-date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical example for different [[web content]] by location is the FedEx website at FedEx.com where users have the choice to select their country geo —location first and are then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection.

===Automated different content===
Individuals can deliver different content in [[internet marketing]], through paid or organic search results, based on the geographical [[geolocation]] of the targeted audiences.

===Other applications===
* Solve problems regarding location of a new [[retail]] outlet
* Map consumer demand trends to best distribute products and advertising. This links with trade zone management.
* Scope digital advertising towards individual consumers and producers.
* Research consumer shopping patterns and observe traffic within shopping centers and between retail outlets. It also helps in visualisation of market research findings and help improve the overall planning ability of organisations.
* Improve customer cooperation.
* Creation of sales territories

We can define the geo-marketing as a strategy and mechanism that provides valuable information that helps in the process of making business decisions using geographical information. The functions of this to search and evaluate marketing opportunities, analyzing geographical information such as location residential areas, topography, it also analyzes demographic information such as age, genre, annual income and lifestyle. This information can be segmented as primary data and sub-segmented as secondary data; in addition, it helps us to develop successful promotional campaigns achieving our marketing goals. This also works with retail chain stores in the sales industry, real estate, and renewable energy, among others.

With geomarketing, the general data of a company changes to be more specific regarding their customers and market trends. This allows companies to use secondary data wisely, providing excellent results at low cost compared with traditional market research methods. All data is acquired accurately with GPS equipment and geographical information software, once the data is acquired, this information is processed by professionals in the field.

Geomarketing has helped companies to acquire valuable information such as transit behaviors, most visited places or areas, etc., this information will help these companies to deliver the right message (or promotion), at the right time and place. Most companies use their mobile apps to obtain this information. Mobile apps became more sophisticated using GPS, Bluetooth, and also social networks to obtain their market information, this information helps to improve their promotional campaigns. According to [[comScore]], about 60 percent of all Internet activities in the U.S. originates from mobile devices and about half of total Internet traffic flows through mobile apps.

One example of Geo Location is Google Maps - you can search in Google Maps Restaurants near me and it will show different options around your location. One important factor that companies (in this case restaurants) is that they must be sure to optimize their business in Google's directory list.

'''Hierarchical storage management''' ('''HSM''') is a [[Computer data storage|data storage]] technique that automatically moves data between high-cost and low-cost [[data storage media|storage media]]. HSM systems exist because high-speed storage devices, such as [[solid state drive]] arrays, are more expensive (per [[byte]] stored) than slower devices, such as [[hard disk drive]]s, [[optical disc]]s and magnetic [[tape drive]]s. While it would be ideal to have all data available on high-speed devices all the time, this is prohibitively expensive for many organizations. Instead, HSM systems store the bulk of the enterprise's data on slower devices, and then copy data to faster disk drives when needed. In effect, HSM turns the fast disk drives into [[cache (computing)|cache]]s for the slower mass storage devices. The HSM system monitors the way data is used and makes best guesses as to which data can safely be moved to slower devices and which data should stay on the fast devices.

HSM may also be used where more robust storage is available for long-term archiving, but this is slow to access. This may be as simple as an [[off-site backup]], for protection against a building fire.

HSM is a long-established concept, dating back to the beginnings of commercial data processing. The techniques used though have changed significantly as new technology becomes available, for both storage and for long-distance communication of large data sets. The scale of measures such as 'size' and 'access time' have changed dramatically. Despite this, many of the underlying concepts keep returning to favour years later, although at much larger or faster scales.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;

== Implementation ==
In a typical HSM scenario,{{efn-lr|An example from around 2000, which even now is looking dated as tape falls from favour.}} data files which are frequently used are stored on disk drives, but are eventually ''migrated'' to tape if they are not used for a certain period of time, typically a few months. If a user does reuse a file which is on tape, it is automatically moved back to disk storage. The advantage is that the total amount of stored data can be much larger than the capacity of the disk storage available, but since only rarely used files are on tape, most users will usually not notice any slowdown.

HSM is sometimes referred to as [[#Tiered storage|tiered storage]].&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;

HSM (originally DFHSM, now DFSMShsm) was first{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} implemented by [[IBM]] on their [[mainframe computer]]s to reduce the cost of data storage, and to simplify the retrieval of data from slower media. The user would not need to know where the data was stored and how to get it back; the computer would retrieve the data automatically. The only difference to the user was the speed at which data was returned.

CSIRO Australia's Division of Computing Research implemented an HSM in its DAD (Drums and Display) operating system with its Document Region in the 1960s, with copies of documents being written to 7-track tape and automatic retrieval upon access to the documents.

HSM in the shape of the IBM 3850 Mass Storage Facility was (according to IBM) announced in 1974.

Later, IBM ported HSM to its [[IBM AIX|AIX operating system]], and then to other [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[HP-UX]] and [[Linux]].

HSM was also implemented on the DEC [[OpenVMS|VAX/VMS]] systems and the Alpha/VMS systems. The first implementation date should be readily determined from the VMS System Implementation Manuals or the VMS Product Description Brochures.

Recently, the development of [[Serial ATA]] (SATA) disks has created a significant market for three-stage HSM: files are migrated from high-performance [[Fibre Channel]] [[storage area network]] devices to somewhat slower but much cheaper SATA [[redundant array of independent disks|disk array]]s totaling several [[terabyte]]s or more, and then eventually from the SATA disks to tape.

The newest development in HSM is with [[hard disk drive]]s and [[flash memory]], with flash memory being over 30 times faster than disks, but disks being considerably cheaper.

Conceptually, HSM is analogous to the [[CPU cache|cache]] found in most computer [[central processing unit|CPU]]s, where small amounts of expensive [[static random access memory|SRAM]] memory running at very high speeds is used to store frequently used data, but the [[cache algorithms|least recently used]] data is evicted to the slower but much larger main [[DRAM]] memory when new data has to be loaded.

In practice, HSM is typically performed by dedicated software, such as [[IBM Tivoli Storage Manager]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle's]] [[QFS|SAM-QFS]], [[Versity Storage Manager]], [[Quantum Corporation|Quantum]], Novell's Dynamic Storage Technology (DST) on Open Enterprise Server (OES) Linux Platform, [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise|HPE]] [[Data Management Framework]] (DMF, formerly [[Silicon Graphics International|SGI]] Data Migration Facility), [[StorNext File System|StorNext]], or [[EMC Corporation|EMC]] [[DiskXtender|Legato OTG DiskXtender]].

The deletion of files from a higher level of the hierarchy (e.g. magnetic disk) after they have been moved to a lower level (e.g. optical media) is sometimes called '''file grooming'''.&lt;ref name="DillonLeonard1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick M. Dillon|author2=David C. Leonard|title=Multimedia and the Web from A to Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LjVyJ8RuGtMC&amp;pg=PA116|year=1998|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57356-132-7|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use cases==
HSM is often used for deep archival storage of data to be held long term at low cost. Automated tape robots can silo large quantities of data efficiently with low power consumption.

Some HSM software products allow the user to place portions of data files on high-speed disk cache and the rest on tape. This is used in applications that stream video over the internet—the initial portion of a video is delivered immediately from disk while a robot finds, mounts and streams the rest of the file to the end user. Such a system greatly reduces disk cost for large content provision systems.

==Tiered storage==
''Tiered storage'' is a [[data storage device|data storage]] environment consisting of two or more kinds of storage delineated by differences in at least one of these four attributes: price, performance, capacity and function.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;

Any significant difference in one or more of the four defining attributes can be sufficient to justify a separate storage tier.

Examples:
*[[Hard disk|Disk]] and [[tape drive|tape]]: two separate storage tiers identified by differences in all four defining attributes.
*Old technology disk and new technology disk: two separate storage tiers identified by differences in one or more of the attributes.
*High performing disk storage and less expensive, slower disk of the same capacity and function: two separate tiers.
*Identical enterprise class disk configured to utilize different functions such as [[RAID]] level or replication: a separate storage tier for each set of unique functions.

Note: Storage Tiers are ''not'' delineated by differences in vendor, architecture, or geometry except where those differences result in clear changes to price, performance, capacity and function.

[[File:Hope Gibbons at Maori Memorial.jpg|thumb|[[Mayor of Wanganui]], Hope Gibbons, placing soil from the battlefields of Belgium in the Wanganui Maori War Memorial on Anzac Day 1925]]
'''Hopeful Gibbons''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|MBE}} (4 October 1856 &amp;ndash; 25 June 1947), known as '''Hope Gibbons''', was a New Zealand businessman, philanthropist and local politician.

Born in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], [[Tasmania]], Australia on 4 October 1856 he arrived in New Zealand in 1862. He started in business on his own in 1879 by buying a run-down brewery but his principal businesses were the supply and distribution of bicycles and motorcycles throughout the country and [[Colonial Motor Company]] which held the Ford franchise for the country and assembled their cars.&lt;ref name="DNZB Gibbons"&gt;{{DNZB|Beaglehole|Diana|3g5|Hopeful Gibbons}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1936 it ceased assembly but retained most metropolitan dealerships.

He was [[Mayor of Wanganui]] from 1924 to 1927.&lt;ref name="DNZB Gibbons"/&gt;

Hope Gibbons married Jessie Barnes in 1881 and they had one daughter and four sons:&lt;ref name="DNZB Gibbons"/&gt; Hopeful Barnes Gibbons (1882–1955), Alfred Barnes Gibbons (1884–1961), Robert Barnes Gibbons (1889–1973) and Norman Barnes Gibbons (1891–1951). Hope Gibbon's Grandson Hopeful Hope Gibbons, by his eldest son Hope Gibbons, was killed serving as [[Second Lieutenant]] during World War II in 1941, serving with the Reserve Mechanical Transport Company of the [[New Zealand Army Service]] in Crete.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aucklandmuseum.com/war-memorial/online-cenotaph/record/C24295&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Hot Springs Story'' received mostly positive reviews, the reception was muted compared to the hype and success that Kairosoft's previous Western release, ''Game Dev Story'', garnered; it received an 83/100 from [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; [[IGN]]'s Levi Buchanan felt that although it lacked the charm of ''Game Dev Story'', that ''Hot Springs Story'' was in some ways deeper, with the building aspects giving it more depth overall.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; ''[[TouchArcade]]'' noted that although the game could feel daunting at first, it ultimately was an incredibly deep and addicting simulation game.&lt;ref name="toucharcade" /&gt; ''[[Pocket Gamer]]''{{'s}} Mike Rose praised the game's content and special features, but felt that the game held little to no direction in the very beginning.&lt;ref name="pocketgamer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Springs Story Review|author=Rose, Mike|publisher=''[[Pocket Gamer]]''|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Multiformat/Hot+Springs+Story/review.asp?c=27950|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gamezebo]]'s Dan Zuccarelli heavily criticized the game for "playing itself", noting that he fell asleep during one playthrough without it affecting his progress in the game.&lt;ref name="gamezebo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Springs Story Review|author=Zuccarelli, Dan|date=March 7, 2011|publisher=[[Gamezebo]]|url=http://www.gamezebo.com/games/hot-springs-story/review|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iliya Pavlov Naydenov''' ({{lang-bg|Илия Павлов Найденов}}) (August 6, 1960 - March 7, 2003) was a [[Bulgaria]]n [[businessman]]. A banker, financier, philanthropist and mason, he was the leader and founder of the [[Multigroup]] organization and G-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.novinite.com/newsletter/print.php?id=20190 | title = MG Corporation Board Meets on Iliya Pavlov's Successor | date = 10 March 2003 | publisher = Sofia News Agency | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121012042553/http://www.novinite.com/newsletter/print.php?id=20190 | archivedate = 12 October 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2832167.stm | date = 8 March 2003 | title = Bulgarian tycoon gunned down | publisher = [[BBC]] News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pavlov was ranked the eighth richest man in Central and [[Eastern Europe]] by the Polish magazine [[Wprost]] in 2002. He was said to be worth $US1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://najbogatsieuropejczycy.wprost.pl/ide,13/edycja-2002.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Darina Pavlova, who inherited his fortune after his murder.&lt;ref name="novinite2" /&gt;

==Death==
Pavlov was shot outside his office with a single bullet to the heart by a sniper and died instantly.&lt;ref name=novinite1&gt;http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=20098&lt;/ref&gt; The day before his death, he had testified in the trial of the accused murderers of [[Andrey Lukanov]], Bulgaria's first prime minister after the fall of communism who died in 1996. Pavlov had claimed that he had no conflict with Lukanov.

No one has been charged in Pavlov's murder and while several possible theories have been put forth the motive is unknown.&lt;ref name=novinite1 /&gt; A previous attempt on Pavlov's life was made in 1997 when a bomb destroyed his car. He was not in it at the time.&lt;ref name=novinite2&gt;http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=112713&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Pavlov's sister, Slavka Naydenova, and her 8-year-old son were murdered in [[Dale City, Virginia]]. A Russian-American woman who was the wife of Naydenova's ex-husband pleaded guilty to the murders. The motive was jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=137307&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports career==

Pavlov was a former Bulgarian wrestling champion {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} who graduated from the [[National Sports Academy]] in Sofia.&lt;ref name=novinite2 /&gt;

'''Ingrid Antonijevic Hahn''' (born 22 July 1952) is a Chilean [[economist]], [[entrepreneur]], [[academic]] and former [[Ministry of Economy, Development and Reconstruction (Chile)|Minister of Economy, Development and Reconstruction]] (2006) for only two months, in the first cabinet of [[socialist]] [[President of Chile|president]] [[Michelle Bachelet]]. In her youth, she was a militant in the [[Popular Unitary Action Movement|MAPU]] organisation, and after the end of the [[Pinochet]] regime she was one of the founders of the [[Party for Democracy (Chile)|Party for Democracy]] (''Partido Por la Democracia a.k.a. PPD'') that has led the transition towards democracy in [[Chile]]. She is a progressive entrepreneur who promotes [[corporate social responsibility]] and the involvement of the [[private sector]] in projects initiated by the government that aim to benefit the whole country. She has acquired notoriety in her country for holding positions in organisations that have traditionally been held by men.

==Biography==
Antonijevic was born in the northern Chilean port city of [[Iquique]] in the [[Tarapacá Region]] to a politically right-wing [[upper middle class]] family. She is the youngest daughter of [[Croats|Croatian]] [[immigrant]] and entrepreneur, Leandro Antonijevic Bezmalinović, and Ingeborg Hahn Von Neumann from [[Germany]].

At the age of 7 her family transferred to [[Santiago, Chile]] where she continued her education and excelled academically, graduating in economics from the [[University of Chile]]. As a young student radical she became a militant in the [[Popular Unitary Action Movement|MAPU organisation]] that formed part of the [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] coalition headed by [[Salvador Allende]] that was overthrown in a [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|military coup]] on September 11, 1973.

In 2006 she was awarded the ''Circle of Honour'' by the [[University of Chile]] in recognition of her services to the [[public sector]] and for being among the most prominent graduates of this university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.fen.uchile.cl/index.php/main/contenido/cont/6 Excellence and Global Vision – Facultad Economía y Negocios Universidad de Chile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonijevic was interested in [[meditation]] for many years before she became a devotee of [[Buddhist meditation|zen meditation]] after a holiday in [[Japan]], where she became a student of zen Buddhist priest [[Gudo Wafu Nishijima]]. She lives and works in [[Santiago, Chile]] and promotes zen meditation among her employees in the workplace. She has two elder sisters, Nadja and Ilona, two children, Felipe and Carolina Saint Jean, and two grandchildren.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10549">'''Iosif Constantin Drăgan''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈjosif konstanˈtin drəˈɡan}}; June 20, 1917 – August 21, 2008) was a [[Romania]]n and [[Italy|Italian]] businessman, writer, historian and founder of the [[ButanGas]] company. In 2005, he was the second-wealthiest Romanian, according to the Romanian financial magazine ''Capital'', having a wealth estimated at $850 million.&lt;ref name="jurnat2"&gt;''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', [http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol_40664/top_300___ion_tiriac_the_richest_romanian.html "Top 300 – Ion Tiriac the Richest Romanian"], 16 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same financial magazine, in 2006, he became the wealthiest Romanian, at $1.3-1.6  billion.&lt;ref name="evz"&gt;''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', [http://www.expres.ro/article.php?artid=280367 "Cei mai bogaţi români" ("The Richest Romanians)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043523/http://www.expres.ro/article.php?artid=280367 |date=2007-09-30 }}, 15 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Drăgan was involved in a series of controversies, including some alleged deals with the [[Securitate]], his admiration of Romanian leader [[Ion Antonescu]] and being one of the main figures in the [[Protochronist]] current of Romanian historiography.&lt;ref name="primulevz"&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/817690/Primul-miliardar-roman-isi-ia-secretele-in-groapa/ Primul miliardar român îşi ia secretele în groapă], ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', 23 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===

Born in [[Lugoj]], Drăgan graduated from Law School at the [[University of Bucharest]] in 1938, and earned in 1940 a scholarship at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]], where he studied political science and economics, earning a Ph.D. in law. At the time, Drăgan was attracted to [[Fascism|fascist]] ideals and the [[Iron Guard]], representing a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] trend inside the latter.&lt;ref name="Veiga"&gt;Francisco Veiga, ''Istoria Gărzii de Fier, 1919-1941: Mistica ultranaționalismului'' ("History of the Iron Guard, 1919-1941: The Mistque of Ultra-Nationalism"), Humanitas, Bucharest, 1993, p.287, 307&lt;/ref&gt;

Drăgan explained his views on the Fascist Iron Guard in 1940 in the pro-Mussolini newspaper ''[[Conquiste d'Impero]]'' in two articles entitled "The Mystique of Codreanu's Legionnaires" and "Romanian Corporatism: Pieces of Legionnaire Doctrine". In 1987, based on these articles, the Italian magazine ''[[Il Panorama]]'' called him "a Legionnaire", but Drăgan sued them and won the trial, as they were not able to bring a proof that he was an actual member of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/817798/Misterul-lui-Dragan-de-la-legionar-la-gazarul-rosu/ "Misterul lui Drăgan: de la legionar la „găzarul roşu“"], ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', 24 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business in Italy===
In 1941, he started a company which exported Romanian petroleum products to [[Fascism in Italy|Fascist Italy]]. After [[World War II]], in 1948, he established a gas distribution company in Italy, [[ButanGas]].&lt;ref name="jurnat"&gt;''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', [http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol_14692/omul_care_transforma_gazul_in_bani_gheata.html "Omul care transformă gazul în bani gheaţă" ("The Man Turning Gas into Cash")], 26 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, with the [[Romanian Communist Party]] gaining power in Romania, he was not allowed for 30 years to return to Romania.&lt;ref name="jurnat"/&gt;

===Protochronism and the relation with Ceaușescu===

In 1967, he started the "European Foundation Drăgan", which has the goal to promote the "values of the Romanian civilization".&lt;ref name="jurnat"/&gt; He was also the founder of two publishing houses (''Nagard'' in Italy and ''Europa Nova'' in Romania), a privately owned university, ''[[Universitatea Europeană Drăgan]]'' (founded in 1991 in Lugoj), a TV station, a radio station (''Radio NovaFm'') and a weekly newspaper (''Redeșteptarea'') and a daily local newspaper (''Renașterea Bănățeană''), all in Romania. He also funded the [[Statue of Decebalus]], a 40-meter high carving, near [[Orşova]].

He wrote many historical works associated with the [[protochronism]] [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movement in Romanian history, which was later promoted by [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s regime.&lt;ref name="Verdery"&gt;Katherine Verdery, National Ideology under Socialism. Identity and Cultural Politics in Ceaușescu's Romania, University of California Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-520-20358-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a sympathiser of the Iron Guard, Drăgan became a semi-official collaborator of Ceaușescu and the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]], and as a result, he had access to some documents never published before on [[Ion Antonescu]], using them in a four volume-book which put him in a good light.&lt;ref name="repilici"&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_yad/what_new/index_whats_new-report.html Report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania] (RICHR) submitted to President [[Ion Iliescu]] in Bucharest on November 11, 2004, [http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/index.php?content=programs/presentations/2005-03-10/ and accepted by the Romanian government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504102002/http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/index.php?content=programs%2Fpresentations%2F2005-03-10%2F |date=2006-05-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to historian [[Lucian Boia]], Drăgan promoted an extreme version of protochronism, which claimed that the Romania was the cradle of civilization, and the Romanian people the oldest in Europe: 

{{quote|text=As the author of ''We, the Thracians'' (1976) and editor of the periodical of the same title (Noì, tracii) that was launched in 1974, he was the leading figure of an entire movement aimed at amplifying the role of the Thracians in European history, a movement supported by all sorts of amateurs (even a lawyers' group!) but also by some less than scrupulous professionals (among them the archaeologists Dumitru Berciu and Ion Horaţiu Crişan). In the periodical Noi, tracii it was possible, for example, to claim that the ancestors of the Romanians lived 100,000 years ago, eloquent proof that the Romanian people is the oldest in the continent, if not in the world. As for the extent of the Thracians' territory, Drăgan generously allows them almost half of Europe, centered, evidently, on the present-day space of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, Lucian, ''History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness'', Central European University Press, Budapest, 2001, p.105&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===After 1989===
After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], it was alleged that he supported financially [[Eugen Barbu]] and [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]] to launch their [[far right]] ''[[Greater Romania Party|România Mare]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="Verdery"/&gt; Nevertheless, in 2008, Vadim denied that he got any funding from Drăgan.&lt;ref name="primulevz"/&gt; Together with Vadim Tudor, he was the founder of "Liga Mareșal Ion Antonescu" in 1990, later renamed to "Liga Mareșalilor" following the changes in the Romanian legislation which disallowed the praise of the pro-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] dictator.&lt;ref name="repilici"/&gt;

After his first wife, Teresa Maria Moriglioni, died in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antena3.ro/romania/iosif-constantin-dragan-mostenitorii-de-miliarde-se-pregatesc-de-batalie-53291.html|title=Iosif Constantin Drăgan. Moştenitorii de miliarde se pregătesc de bătălie|accessdate=September 10, 2014|language=Romanian|publisher=Antena3|date=August 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drăgan married, at the age of 78, Daniela Veronica Gușă, aged 22 at the time, the daughter of [[Ştefan Guşă]], a [[Romanian Army]] General involved in the 1989 Revolution, who died of cancer in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;"Ștefan Gușă" Foundation, [http://www.fundatiagusa.ro/index.php?id=372 Biography of the general on the "Ştefan Guşă" Foundation site], accessed on June 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ziua2"&gt;''[[Ziua]]'' [http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?id=178022&amp;data=2005-06-09&amp;ziua=c9b2ce17bae421659fd2ae99739d01f0 "Fiul rătăcitor în căutarea lui Iosif Constantin Drăgan" ("The Prodigal Son in Search for Iosif Constantin Drăgan")] 9 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had three sons. Mike Fink (b. 1970), who claims to be Drăgan's son,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gandul.info/stiri/batalia-pentru-miliardele-lui-i-c-dragan-teste-de-paternitate-negocieri-de-culise-procese-interminabile-3050426|title=Bătălia pentru miliardele lui I.C.

''[[Ziua]]'' reached the conclusion that Drăgan was being held captive by his younger wife and his business partners.&lt;ref name="ziua"&gt;''[[Ziua]]'', [http://www.ziua.net/display.php?id=177752&amp;data=2005-06-06&amp;ziua=72598cb63e13ff9b2612a49f4dc16dd8 "Drăgan, tot în geam" ("Drăgan, Still on Display")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224111/http://www.ziua.net/display.php?id=177752&amp;data=2005-06-06&amp;ziua=72598cb63e13ff9b2612a49f4dc16dd8 |date=2007-09-26 }}, 6 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was seen dining in a restaurant only a few days later in Bucharest, together with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Averea]]'', "L-am descoperit pe I. C. Dragăn" ("We Have Uncovered I. C. Dragăn"), 14 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on August 21, 2008, at his house in [[Palma de Mallorca]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="primulevz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vnnforum.com/showthread.php?t=78839 Ex-Nazi Romanian billionaire Iosif Constantin Dragan dead at 91]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Arthur Fentener van Vlissingen''' (born 4 March 1939 in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]) is a Dutch businessman. He is one of the wealthiest people in [[the Netherlands]] and has made major investments in the [[travel industry]]. The total capital of the family is, according to ''Quote'' magazine, around 9.2 billion euros. The wealth of Fentener van Vlissingen was  calculated to be €1.6 billion in ''Quote 500''.

Of the three brothers (Frits, who died in March 2006, and [[Paul Fentener van Vlissingen|Paul]], who died in August 2006) only John Fentener van Vlissingen's career was not with the family company, [[SHV Holdings]]. He began his own company, [[BCD Group|BCD Holdings N.V.]], a market leader in the travel industry. 

BCD Holdings began as a [[real estate]] company in 1975 as Property Management Advisory Services.  In 1976, the company was renamed  NORO since the name NIRO was already appropriated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Art of Enterprise-BCD Holdings 1975-2000'' {{ISBN|90-901399-5-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 BCD was founded, after the separation of Noro management advisories and investments by the establishment of BCD.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1987, WorldTravel Advisors was purchased. In 1999, WorldTravel Advisors merged with BTI Americas to form WorldTravel BTI.  In 2006, WorldTravel BTI was renamed  BCD Travel with the takeover of the German company, TQ3, and the dissolution of the BTI brand, thus creating the third largest travel company in the United States.

'''John George Bartholomew''' [[FRSE]] [[FRGS]] (22 March 1860 – 14 April 1920) was a British [[cartography|cartographer]] and [[geography|geographer]].  As a holder of a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|royal warrant]], he used the title "Cartographer to the King"; for this reason he was sometimes known by the epithet "the Prince of Cartography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bartholomew 150 Years|author=Leslie Gardiner|publisher=John Bartholomew &amp; Son Ltd|isbn=0-85152-791-4|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartholomew's longest lasting legacy is arguably naming the continent of [[Antarctica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John George Bartholomew and the naming of Antarctica, CAIRT Issue 13|url=http://www.nls.uk/collections/maps/subject-info/cairt|publisher=National Library of Scotland|year=2008|issn=1477-4186}}, and also {{Cite web|title=The Bartholomew Archive|url=http://digital.nls.uk/bartholomew/highlights/antarctica.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which until his use of the term in 1890 had been largely ignored due to its lack of resources and harsh climate.

==Biography==
Bartholomew came from a celebrated line of map-makers - he was the son of Annie McGregor (d.1872) and [[John Bartholomew]] Junior, and the grandson of the founder of [[John Bartholomew and Son Ltd.]]

He was educated at the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh]].

Under his administration the family business became one of the top operations in its field. Bartholomew himself was not merely a specialist in production, but also a talented [[geographer]] and [[cartography|cartographer]]. It was he who introduced the use of coloured contour layer maps; he also anticipated the needs of late nineteenth and early 20-century travellers by publishing street maps of major cities, cycling maps, railway timetable maps, and road maps for automobiles. 

He collaborated with major scientific figures and travelers of the period on projects involving their studies. Bartholomew's ''Atlas of Meteorology'' and ''Atlas of Zoogeography''&lt;ref&gt;[[Bartholomew, J.G.]], [[Clarke, W.E.]], [[Grimshaw, P.H.]], 1911. ''[https://archive.org/details/AtlaszoogeograpVBart Atlas of Zoogeography]''. [[John Bartholomew and Co.]], Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; were issues from a planned five-volume series that was never completed. Before he died he was able to plan out the first edition of the [[Times Atlas of the World|''Times Survey Atlas of the World'']]; this and its succeeding editions represent the most successful atlas project of the twentieth century. John was a great friend of geographer and writer [[John Francon Williams]]. Correspondence between the two friends is held in the Bartholomew Archive at the [[National Library of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/bartholomew/|title=Bartholomew Archive|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also acted as a literary agent for Bartholomew in America.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew Archive, Inventory No. 975 - Williams, J.F. 1898-1900, 1906-7:https://www.nls.uk/catalogues/online/cnmi/inventories/acc10222.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889 he married Janet MacDonald.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He handed the reins of the business on to his son [[John (Ian) Bartholomew]] (1890-1962).

A memorial to Bartholomew, sculpted by [[Pilkington Jackson]], exists on the northern wall of the 20th century extension to [[Dean Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]].

His wife, Jennie, sons, Hugh and [[John (Ian) Bartholomew|Ian Bartholomew]] and grandson, [[John Christopher Bartholomew]] are buried at the monument.

His daughter Margaret married Philip Francis Hamilton-Grierson, grandson of Sir Philip James Hamilton-Grierson.

Sir '''John Maynard Hedstrom''' (22 February 1872 – 2 June 1951) was a [[Fiji]]an businessman and politician. He served as a member of the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]] for over 30 years.

==Biography==
Maynard Hedstrom was born in [[Levuka]] on 22 February 1872.&lt;ref name=HDF&gt;Brij V. Lal (2015) ''Historical Dictionary of Fiji'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p109&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Suva Grammar School|Suva Public School]] and [[Wesley College (Victoria)|Wesley College]] in Australia,&lt;ref name=TCF&gt;Stewart Firth &amp; Daryl Tarte (2001) ''20th Century Fiji: People who shaped this nation'', USP Solutions, pp45–46&lt;/ref&gt; before graduating from the University of Melbourne.&lt;ref name=HDF/&gt; After returning to Fiji, he initially worked in the post office in [[Suva]],&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; before going into business, joining the [[Union Company|Union Steamship Company]] and becoming manager of the Levuka branch.&lt;ref name=TCF/&gt; He later became a partner in Brown &amp; Joske and was involved in several other companies before founding the [[Morris Hedstrom]] firm with Percy Morris in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;Brij V. Kal &amp; Kate Fortune (2000) ''The Pacific Island: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1'', University of Hawaii Press, p219&lt;/ref&gt; which went on to become the country's leading retailer.&lt;ref name=TCF/&gt; He became President of the Chamber of Commerce in 1924, a position he held for 23 years.&lt;ref name=TCF/&gt;

Maynard Hedstrom entered politics in the 1900s, serving as mayor of Levuka in 1905 and 1906. In [[1908 Fijian general election|1908]] he was elected to the Legislative Council in the Levuka constituency, defeating the incumbent [[David Robbie (Fijian politician)|David Robbie]]. He was re-elected in [[1911 Fijian general election|1911]], again defeating Robbie. Prior to the [[1914 Fijian general election|1914 elections]], the constituency was reorganised and renamed Eastern. Maynard Hedstrom was returned unopposed and held the seat until the [[1937 Fijian general election|1937 elections]]; during this time he was returned unopposed again in [[1917 Fijian general election|1917]], after which he became a member of the [[Executive Council of Fiji|Executive Council]]. He was returned unopposed in [[1920 Fijian general election|1920]], [[1929 Fijian general election|1929]], [[1932 Fijian general election|1932]] and only faced opponents in [[1923 Fijian general election|1923]] and [[1926 Fijian general election|1926]], winning easily on both occasions. He did not contest a seat in the 1937 elections, at which point he also left the Executive Council,&lt;ref name=TCF/&gt; but was chosen as one of the two nominated European members.

In the [[1922 New Year Honours]], Maynard Hedstrom became the first resident of Fiji to be knighted.&lt;ref name=TCF/&gt; He was also awarded the [[Order of the Polar Star]] by the King of Sweden in 1939 after serving as honorary Vice-Consul for Sweden in Suva.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34744/page/8034/data.pdf The London Gazette], 1 December 1939, p8034&lt;/ref&gt;

Maynard Hedstrom had five children; three sons and two daughters. He died at his home in the [[Tamavua]] area of Suva on 2 June 1951 at the age of 79.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;[https://www.fijitimes.com/first-fiji-born-knight/ First Fiji born knight] Fiji Times, 28 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Manuel Ramírez Rosales''',  (1804, [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] - 1877, [[Valparaíso]]) was a Chilean painter who was educated in France. He specialized in landscapes and maritime scenes, often with mythological elements. Although mostly involved in various business enterprises, he is remembered as Chile's first significant artist. 
 
== Biography ==
He was born to an aristocratic family that was related to the patriot, {{ill|Juan Enrique Rosales|es}}. His first cousin was [[Vicente Pérez Rosales]].&lt;ref name="C"&gt;[http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/biografia.aspx?itmid=350 Biographical notes] @ Artistas Plásticos Chilenos.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825, he was part of a group of young people from the upper ranks of Chilean society who sailed to Europe with Don [[Mariano Egaña]]; a trip that was later described by Pérez Rosales in his book, ''Recuerdos del pasado'' (Times Gone By).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iC1jZAc9nAQC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Jos%C3%A9+Manuel+Ram%C3%ADrez+Rosales&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAWoVChMIspyn7o6QxgIVkZSICh0d-gA5#v=onepage&amp;q=Jos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20Rosales&amp;f=false Excerpt from "Times Gone By"] @ Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Ramirez-Talara.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A Street in [[Talara]].]]
After a stay in London, they arrived in Paris and enrolled in a school for Spanish-Americans run by [[Manuel Silvela y García de Aragón|Manuel Silvela]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sAeAKuiuAAIC&amp;pg=PT14&amp;dq=Jos%C3%A9+Manuel+Ram%C3%ADrez+Rosales&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzgKahUKEwi8ocT-kpDGAhXGKYgKHQ4dADc#v=onepage&amp;q=Jos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20Rosales&amp;f=false Excerpt from "The Girondins of Chile"] by Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna.&lt;/ref&gt; Ramírez initially studied music and art, and finally settled on studying the latter. He worked with [[Jean-Charles-Joseph Remond]], who introduced him to landscape painting derived directly from contact with nature. Eventually, he became a friend and associate of [[Raymond Monvoisin]].&lt;ref name="C" /&gt;

He returned to Chile in 1836 and settled in Valparaíso.&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; Never becoming a full-time painter, he also dabbled in business enterprises with his brother, Juan Enrique, and engaged in various other adventures. In this capacity, he got together with a young Englishman from [[Yorkshire]] named John Sampson and sailed to California in 1849, to join the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt;

==In California==
After suffering harassment from organized criminal gangs and being subjected to a special tax imposed on foreign miners, he and Sampson changed their plans, joined with two French immigrants, Theodore Sicard and Charles Covillaud, and acquired most of the Rancho Cordua in [[Yuba County]], at the confluence of the [[Yuba River|Yuba]] and [[Feather River]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marysville.ca.us/index.php/city-council/marysville-golden-history Marysville's Golden History] @ the Marysville website.&lt;/ref&gt; Sampson died shortly after, at the age of only thirty-one. This was a strategic point for steamboats travelling from San Francisco to the goldfields and soon after became part of the city of [[Marysville, California|Marysville]]. 
[[File:Ninfas con Fauno.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Nymph]]s with a [[Faun]].]] 
After that, Ramírez was primarily engaged in agricultural pursuits and imported some of California's first  wine grape vines from Chile. In 1853, the writer [[Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna]] reported that Ramírez' farm produced some of the best watermelons in the state. With wood from Chile, he built a manorial residence which is still standing in the center of Marysville and is known as the "[[Jose Manuel Ramirez House|Ramírez Castle/Ellis House]]".&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/5views/5views5h74.htm Ramírez Castle] @ the [[National Park Service]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Ramirez, California|town]] just outside Marysville is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://localwiki.org/yuba-sutter/Ramirez Yuba-Sutter] @ LocalWiki.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these successes, he suffered from the racist attitudes prevalent at the time. In 1854, under the pretext of searching for stagecoach robbers, a [[vigilante]] group entered his home, confiscated his weapons, and shot him, leaving him seriously injured.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; As soon as he recovered, he returned to Valparaíso, where he started the city's first horse-drawn trolley line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biografiadechile.cl/detalle.php?IdContenido=154&amp;IdCategoria=8&amp;IdArea=30&amp;TituloPagina=Historia%20de%20Chile Biographical notes] @ Biografías de Chile.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35068">This is a '''list of [[Technopole|technology centers]]''' throughout the world.  Governmental planners and business networks like to use the name "silicon" or "valley" to describe their own areas as a result of the success of [[Silicon Valley]] in [[California]].  Nevertheless, there are a few qualitative differences between these places, and metrics may be applied to measure their dominance.

These metrics include:
* How much and to what extent public and/or private research and development funds are spent in the zones
* What percentage of local employment is technology related.
* If the zone is mainly government funded or is mainly corporate driven (or both)
* If mainly corporate, how much revenue and profit and which corporates have headquarters there.
* If mainly corporate, how much [[venture capital]] has been made available to companies in the zone.
* What supporting higher educational institutions are located in nearby.

== Globally Prominent clusters (with specific dominant markets listed) ==
&lt;!-- Note: this area should be a summary of major globally dominant in a particular field.  If there isnt a particular market to point out, it does not belong in this section, but the worldiwde list section below--&gt;
 {{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
*[[Silicon Valley]] - originating in Stanford University (Palo Alto and Menlo Park), and spreading south towards [[San Jose, California]] and suburbs. San Francisco and nearby areas including Berkeley and Oakland are technically not part of Silicon Valley but have seen growth in industries such as [[web development]] (2013-2016) and [[venture capital]].  Silicon Valley has maintained dominance for decades in core industries such as microprocessor development as well as software and web development.  
*[[Silicon Wadi]] - is an area with a high concentration of [[high-tech]] industries&lt;ref name="Viva Tel Aviv"/&gt; in the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|coastal plain]] in [[Israel]]. [[Israel]] as a whole country has strong innovation in Cyber Security, Agritech and more. The Silicon Wadi area covers much of the country, although especially high concentrations of hi-tech industry can be found in the area around [[Tel Aviv]], including small clusters around the cities of [[Ra'anana]], [[Petah Tikva]], [[Herzliya]], [[Netanya]], the academic city of [[Rehovot]] and its neighbour [[Rishon Le Zion]]. In addition, hi-tech clusters can be found in [[Haifa]] and [[Caesarea, Israel|Caesarea]]. More recent hi-tech establishments have been raised in [[Jerusalem]] ([[Jerusalem Technology Park|Technology Park, Malha]], [[Har Hotzvim]] and [[Jerusalem Venture Partners|JVP Media Quarter]] in [[Talpiot]]), and the [[Startup Village, Yokneam|Startup Village Ecosystem in the Yokneam area]].
*[[Silicon Fen]] - is the name given to the region around Cambridge, England, which is home to a large cluster of high-tech businesses focusing on software, electronics and biotechnology. Many of these businesses have connections with the University of Cambridge, and the area is now one of the most important technology centres in Europe.
*[[Shenzhen Hi-Tech Industrial Park]] - [[Shenzhen, Guangdong]], China Shenzhen municipality and surrounds, including [[Dongguan]]'s factories had been for a decade the world's dominant peripheral hardware suppliers.  More recently Shenzhen has become the dominant place worldwide for hardware startups (excluding microprocessors, chip memory, and [[pure-play semiconductor foundry]]).

The expression " operating lease" is somewhat confusing as it has a different meaning based on the context that is under consideration.
From a product characteristic stand point, this type of a lease, as distinguished from a finance lease, is one where the lessor takes residual risk. As such, the lease is non full payout. From an accounting stand point, this type of lease (if it fails to meet varied criteria that define a finance lease) results in off balance sheet financing.

The determination of whether a lease is a finance (also called capital) lease or an operating lease from an accounting point of view is defined in the United States by [http://www.fasb.org/pdf/fas13.pdf Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 (FAS 13)]. In countries covered by [[International Financial Reporting Standards]], the tests are defined in [http://www.ifrs.org/Documents/IAS17.pdf IAS 17]. In July 2006, the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) and the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) announced the commencement of a joint project to comprehensively reconsider lease accounting. In July 2008, the boards decided to defer any changes to lessor accounting, while continuing with the project for lessee accounting, with the stated intention to recognise an asset and liability for all lessee leases (in essence, eliminating operating lease accounting). This culminated in the issuance of IFRS 16 and FASB Topic 842. Both are effective January 1,2019.The similarity in the two pronouncements is that leases, which previously qualified as operating leases- and hence resulted in off balance sheet treatment, are now to be capitalized by the lessee.

Unlike a finance lease, at the end of the operating lease the title to the asset does not pass to the lessee, but remains with the lessor. Accordingly, at the end of an operating lease, the lessee has several options:

*Return of the equipment
*Renewal of the lease 
*Purchase of the equipment

Operating leases, where the lessor takes a residual position, offer a host of benefits to the lessee the type of which finance leases do not

'''Pavel Tykač''' (born 15 May 1964 in [[Čelákovice]]) is a [[Czech people|Czech]] entrepreneur and investor with long-term experience in the energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/tykac-je-pripraven-investovat-miliardu-eur-na-energetickem-trhu/1589379&lt;/ref&gt; At present, he is the sole owner of Sev.en Energy Group, a major player in the Czech energy market which is planning to expand to the European energy market.&lt;ref&gt;https://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-66056680-miliardar-tykac-planuje-velkou-expanzi-po-evrope-chce-kupovat-uhelne-i-plynove-elektrarny&lt;/ref&gt; His wealth is estimated at US$1.03 billion, which according to [[Forbes]] magazine makes him the fifth richest person in the [[Czech Republic]] (Forbes rankings 2015).&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/pavel-tykac/?list=billionaires|title=Pavel Tykac|author=Agustino Fontevecchia|work=Forbes|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his wife, Pavel Tykač is significantly engaged in charity projects and support for the North Bohemian Region and the Pardubice Region.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.euro.cz/archiv/financnik-tykac-se-dal-na-dobrocinnost-1255048&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blesk.cz/clanek/zpravy-politika/355432/5-nejbohatsi-muz-v-cesku-tykac-zaplatil-novou-porodnici-vedeli-jste-ze-ma-8-deti.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.7.cz/cz/promedia/aktuality/tz/2017/20170502.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavel Tykač started his entrepreneurial career after the Revolution by sale of computer technology. In the beginning of the 90s he and his partners established Vikomt company which had a great break through on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-48596050-zuzana-kubatova-tykac-opet-hraje-vabank-ted-o-uh|title = Zuzana Kubátová: Tykač opět hraje vabank. Teď o uhlí|date = 2010-12-14|website = Hospodářské noviny|language = cs-CZ|access-date = 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold his share of the company in the middle of the 90s. He used the acquired money to buy at the time small Regiobanka in [[Karlovy Vary]] (today`s Hypoteční banka); he subsequently sold it to IPB at a very advantageous price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.penize.cz/akcie/15460-tykac-vs-takac|title = Tykač vs. Takáč {{!}} Peníze.cz|website = www.penize.cz|access-date = 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already at that time he was considered to be a very rich man. In 1995 he participated in the creation of free community of investors around Motoinvest whose participants gained shares in several banks and investment funds thanks to buying cheap shares after the privatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://janmachacek.webgarden.cz/rubriky/homepage/respekt/ja-na-to-nemel-nervy|title = Respekt|last = Macháček|first = Jan|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced termination of their activities has led to the rapid sale of assets of the majority of participants in this community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://hn.ihned.cz/c1-48596050-zuzana-kubatova-tykac-opet-hraje-vabank-ted-o-uhli|title = Zuzana Kubátová: Tykač opět hraje vabank. Teď o uhlí|date = 2010-12-14|website = Hospodářské noviny|language = cs-CZ|access-date = 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the turn of the millennium, after several years in seclusion, Tykač returned to the world of big business. Share trades (mainly electricity company [[ČEZ Group|ČEZ]] and Telefónica) and currency rate movement speculations are probably the biggest source of Tykač`s billion-dollar assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/byznys/cesko/pavel-tykac-nakupuje-akcie-unipetrolu-a-telefoniky_52426.html|title = Pavel Tykač nakupuje akcie Unipetrolu a Telefóniky|last = webmaster@tyden.cz|first = TYDEN, www.tyden.cz, e-mail:|date = 2008-04-06|website = TÝDEN.cz|access-date = 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, he entered the energy sector by investing in a minority stake in the Czech Coal mining group. In 2010, he became its sole owner.&lt;ref&gt;https://ekonomika.idnes.cz/novi-uhlobaroni-v-moste-0ss-/ekoakcie.aspx?c=A060516_210147_ekoakcie_zra&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, Pavel Tykač significantly developed the company in the energy sector and, primarily, invested in the know-how in assets and energy market. In 2013, he bought the Chvaletice Power Station, creating a new entity in the domestic energy market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investicniweb.cz/news-2013-9-2-severni-energeticka-je-vlastnikem-elektrarny-chvaletice/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he completed a commercially successful period with several major contracts, rebranding Czech Coal to Sev.en Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://iuhli.cz/od-noveho-roku-vznikne-skupina-severni-energeticka/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, he decided to enter the European energy market through the emerging Sev.en Energy (SE) holding, which relies on renowned experts. The new company will focus on investing in innovative technologies in energy, as well as in operating and innovating conventional resources that will enable European energy systems to switch to renewable resources in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-66057540-konec-neobnovitelnych-zdroju-prijde-pozdeji-nez-si-politici-naplanovali-rika-pavel-tykac-do-elektraren-v-evrope-chce-investovat-desitky-miliard&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Tykač studied at the [[Czech Technical University in Prague]] where he obtained an [[engineer's degree]] in 1987.

== Career ==

After completing military service, he worked as a technician in the TOS Čelákovice. In 1990 he started to import and sell computer equipment, and later, in 1991, he founded Vikomt company with three other partners, which became one of the top three companies on the market in the first half of the nineties

In 1995 he sold his share and used the money (up to one billion dollars) to take over a small Regiobanka in [[Hradec Králové|Hradec Kralove]], which he subsequently sold to IPB. IPB transformed it into Czechomoravian mortgage bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.penize.cz/akcie/15460-tykac-vs-takac|title=Tykač vs. Takáč {{!}} Peníze.cz|website=www.penize.cz|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proceeds from this transaction were the source for his further activities.

Tykač gained a significant portion of his assets while trading with shares of the coupon privatization in the nineties. He participated in the creation of a free group of people and companies around Motoinvest (brokerage house) which the media later called "the Motoinvest group".  The group shared common vision of the emergence of strong Czech financial and industrial group. Individual members of this group were massively buying shares from small shareholders during the privatization. Thanks to these activities the group gained shares in a number of large investment funds (e.g. funds managed by [[Komerční banka]], [[Československá obchodní banka|ČSOB]], Živnobanka, [[C. S. Fondy a.s.|CS Funds]], Creditanstalt or [[PPF (company)|PPF]]), several banks (Credit banka Plzeň, Agrobanka) and many other major companies (e.g. Slovácké Machinery, Gravel and sand pits of Olomouc, ...).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://janmachacek.webgarden.cz/rubriky/homepage/respekt/ja-na-to-nemel-nervy|title=Respekt|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 1996, after the purchase of a significant share in the then state-majority-owned [[Česká spořitelna]] and an attempt to gain influence and position among its authorities a hard clash between "group [[Motoinvest]]" on one side and the ČNB together with the then largest banks (Czech Savings Bank, Commercial Bank, ČSOB) on the other started blazing. The result was a forced administration of Agrobanka by ČNB. This forced investors around Motoinvest to a rapid sale of their assets; it caused their forced departure from the Czech capital market and extinction of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hn.ihned.cz/c1-48596050-zuzana-kubatova-tykac-opet-hraje-vabank-ted-o-uhli|title=Zuzana Kubátová: Tykač opět hraje vabank. Teď o uhlí|date=2010-12-14|website=Hospodářské noviny|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the new millennium, after several years in seclusion, Tykač started to invest into equities on the Prague Stock Exchange and speculative trading in foreign currencies. He was trading with shares of Telefónica or Czech Radiokomunikace, but his best-known business has been a massive purchase of [[ČEZ Group|ČEZ]] shares at a time, when one share cost less than 100 CZK. Within a few years he was able to sell the same share for more than 1000 CZK. He was sure that ČEZ fusion with various regional distributors into "SuperČEZ" will result into a significant increase in the value of the investments in a relatively short time. According to some sources, he earned up to ten billion CZK solely on this transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/byznys/cesko/pavel-tykac-nakupuje-akcie-unipetrolu-a-telefoniky_52426.html|title=Pavel Tykač nakupuje akcie Unipetrolu a Telefóniky|last=webmaster@tyden.cz|first=TYDEN, www.tyden.cz, e-mail:|date=2008-04-06|website=TÝDEN.cz|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 he was involved in securing funding for the company EC Group, which won the tender for the purchase of receivables from the Czech Consolidation Agency in the nominal amount of 38 billion CZK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfcr.cz/cs/archiv/transformacni-instituce/agenda-byvale-cka/komunikace-cka-archiv/tiskove-zpravy-cka/2002/blok-pohledavek-ceske-konsolidacni-agent-15639|title=Blok pohledávek České konsolidační agentury odkoupí společnost EC Group|website=Ministerstvo financí České republiky|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czech Consolidation Agency (CKA) has been called the "bad bank" of the state, into which the problem loans from the privatization of large banks after debt relief were redirected. EC Group, which was then owned by former collaborators of Pavel Tykač Jan Dienstl and Pavel Šimek paid 3.4 billion CZK for a package of receivables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://euro.e15.cz/dienstlova-klicka-804776|title=Dienstlova klička|date=2003-09-26|website=Euro.cz|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; The group overpayed such renowned consortiums as Goldman Sachs / Flow East or PPF / CS First Boston, by about half a billion CZK. In 2003, the EC Group sued ČKA and demanded the return of about 570 mil CZK against portions of the claims that ČKA never owned due to legal shortcomings and therefore the claims could not even be sold. ČKA eventually returned about 440 mil CZK based on a judicial verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://euro.e15.cz/cka-zlobi-sobotku-804185|title=ČKA zlobí Sobotku|date=2003-11-21|website=Euro.cz|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;

In 2006 Tykač invested via a [[Cyprus]] company Indoverse Investment Limited into a minority share of the mining group Czech Coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/novi-uhlobaroni-v-moste-0ss-/ekoakcie.aspx?c=A060516_210147_ekoakcie_zra|title=Noví uhlobaroni v Mostě|date=2006-05-17|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2010 Indoverse Investment Limited became the sole 100% owner of the Czech Coal group.

The Czech Coal Group is one of the leading mining and energy groups in the Czech Republic. Its core business is the production and sale of coal, sale of electricity and heat production. In the region of northern Bohemia, in which the group operates, they are one of the largest employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-12-09|title=Czech Coal|url=https://cs.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Czech_Coal&amp;oldid=13125103|journal=Wikipedie|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2013 Litvínovská uhelná a. s., which operates a ČSA mine and Chvaletice power plant purchased from the ČEZ group, separated from the Czech Coal group. This business move created a new group on the market called Severní energetická, in which Tykač owns a 40% share.

== Criminal investigations ==

Tykač is the effective owner of [[Czech Coal Group|Czech Coal]] with 50% of its shares. He originally purchased a 40% share in the company in spring 2006 and then quickly increased that share to 49% for allegedly nearly CZK 10 billon.&lt;ref name="Tykac"&gt;Hospodařský noviny, 3 September 2009. “Moves among the coal barons. Financier Tykač now owns exactly half of Czech Coal [http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-38214500-pohyb-mezi-uhlobarony-financnik-tykac-uz-vlastni-presnou-polovinu-czech-coal] (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt; Tykač purchased the additional 1% from his partners Petr Pudil and Vasil Bobela in 2009.&lt;ref name="Tykac" /&gt;

Apart from his holding in Czech Coal, Tykač  also operates on the real estate and financial markets. He has been described as “a person with the reputation of an unscrupulous player and a secretive pirate of Czech business comparable to [[Gordon Gekko]] …, professing greed as the highest virtue”.&lt;ref name="pirate"&gt;Lidový noviny, 19 October 2011. “Roman wants to destroy the pirate of Czech business. Who is Pavel Tykač?” [http://byznys.lidovky.cz/romana-chce-znicit-pirat-ceskeho-byznysu-kdo-je-pavel-tykac-p4f-/firmy-trhy.asp?c=A111019_100938_firmy-trhy_nev] (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

His earlier activities on the financial market in the 1990s included the acquisition of CS Fund, the asset manager of three smaller investment funds, which Tykač divested himself of just a few weeks before it was ‘tunneled’ or defrauded in March 1997.&lt;ref name="pirate" /&gt; The most valuable acquisition of his investment company, Motoinvest, established in 1991, however, was [[Agrobanka]]. It was this company that financed most of Tykač’s activities, which before long led it to the brink of ruin as the bank was unable to meet its liabilities, leading to the intervention the Czech National Bank to rescue its clients by pumping CZK 20 billion into it.&lt;ref name="pirate" /&gt; Tykač also acquired shares through Motoinvest in other banks whose capital was subsequently passed on to companies and funds linked to Tykač whereupon those banks also went bankrupt as a result of these transactions, e.g. [[Kreditní banka Plzeň]], and [[Ekoagrobanka]]. As a result, he is often called "the pest of the capital market" in the Czech Republic, an appellation which he failed to have the Czech courts prohibit the magazine [[Respekt]] from using in connection with his person.&lt;ref&gt;Spurný, J., Účet pro Pavla Tykače [A bill for Pavel Tykač], Respekt, 13 August 2006 [http://respekt.ihned.cz/c1-36279580-ucet-pro-pavla-tykace]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tykač was investigated by the police in 2006 over the tunneling of CS Fund, but the prosecution was later suspended. Many of his former associates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/krimi/339191-soud-ulozil-makleri-z-kauzy-cs-fondu-podminku.html|title=Soud uložil makléři z kauzy CS fondů podmínku|work=novinky.cz|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been convicted of financial crimes and have often ended up behind bars, although Tykač himself has always remained at liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/192328-tykac-bude-kvuli-cs-fondum-znovu-stihan/|title=Tykač bude kvůli CS Fondům znovu stíhán|author=Česká televize|work=ČT24|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations against him, however, continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/c1-61650180-tykac-se-stihani-v-kauze-cs-fondu-nevyhne-valkova-zrusila-stiznost-sve-predchudkyne|title=Tykač se stíhání v kauze CS Fondů nevyhne. Válková zrušila stížnost své předchůdkyně|work=Hospodářské noviny|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, František Bušek alleged in court that he assisted Tykač in defrauding CS Fund of CZK 1.23 billion. Tykač said the allegation was the result of an earlier failed attempt by Bušek to blackmail him.&lt;ref&gt;Lidový noviny, 29 February 2012.“I tunnelled CS Fund with Tykač, says court witness [http://www.lidovky.cz/tuneloval-jsem-s-tykacem-cs-fondy-oznamil-soudu-svedek-pg2-/ln_domov.asp?c=A120229_144525_ln_domov_spa] (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt; Tykač kept a very low profile from the late 1990s only to re-emerge in 2006 with his purchase of shares in [[Czech Coal Group|Czech Coal]], since when he has aggressively defended the price demands of the company and lobbied for the cancellation of the [[brown coal mining limits in North Bohemia]], beyond which lie huge coal reserves.&lt;ref name="pirate" /&gt;

Further examples of Tykač’s alleged unscrupulousness include posting letters to the wives of shareholders who were refusing to sell him a Czech Coal competitor, Sokolovské uhelné,  urging them to talk their husbands into the deal, and the way he dealt with a run-down but listed residence he owned in the exclusive Prague quarter of Vinohrady – it mysteriously caught fire twice and was eventually demolished without permission.&lt;ref name="pirate" /&gt;

== Involvement into the energy sector ==

=== Ending coal war with the ČEZ group ===

At the turn of 2012-13, as the owner of Czech Coal, Tykač ended the so-called coal war about the price of brown coal with the [[ČEZ Group|ČEZ]] group. Eight years of conflict, which began even before Tykač joined the coal business, was terminated by a mutual agreement of the parties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zpravy.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/cez-se-dohodl-s-tykacem-nakoupi-uhli-za-skoro-200-miliard-966841|title=ČEZ se dohodl s Tykačem, nakoupí uhlí za skoro 200 miliard|date=2013-03-18|website=E15.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by signing a 50-year contract about coal supply to the power plant [[Počerady]].

=== Hard clash with EPH because of power plant Opatovice ===

In 2012 Tykač`s Czech Coal terminated the contract for the supply of coal to the power plant [[Opatovice I|Opatovice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-56072400-uhelna-valka-miliardaru-se-vyhrocuje-czech-coal-vypovedel-smlouvu-elektrarne-opatovice|title=Uhelná válka miliardářů se vyhrocuje. Czech Coal vypověděl smlouvu elektrárně Opatovice|date=2012-06-07|website=Hospodářské noviny|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which belongs to the Energy and Industrial Holding (EPH) owned by [[Daniel Křetínský|Křetínský]] and JT Bank. Tykač justified this step by EPH having claims of half a billion CZK. The conflict between Czech Coal and EPH ended with amicable settlement in 2014. Part of the deal was the mutual termination of litigation.

=== The dispute with Sokolovská uhelná ===

Since 2006 Tykač supported the minority shareholder of Sokolov coal company Jan Kroužecký in his conflict with the majority shareholders. Subsequent litigation lasted for years. In 2015 the whole issue ended in an agreement when Kroužecký sold his shares to the company, that was now completely controlled by its majority shareholders František Štěpánek and Jaroslav Rokos. The price of Kroužecký`s 30% share of the company was supposedly around 4-5 billion CZK. There are speculations that most of this money was received by Tykač, who had previously bought Kroužecký`s share. Only Štěpánek publicly addressed ending of the dispute by saying that the company bought Kroužecký`s share, there was a longstanding dispute settlement and that the parties consider the transaction to be positive and beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-64039900-konec-sporu-o-sokolovskou-uhelnou-firmu-plne-ovladli-stepanek-a-rokos-vydela-i-tykac|title=Konec sporů o Sokolovskou uhelnou: Firmu plně ovládli Štěpánek a Rokos, vydělá i Tykač|date=2015-05-20|website=Hospodářské noviny|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The case with Respekt ===

In 2013 weekly magazine [[Respekt]] published an information&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://respekt.ihned.cz/c1-59515860-drobni-miliardari-placte|title=Drobní miliardáři, plačte!|last=Spurný|first=Jaroslav|website=respekt.ihned.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the alleged freezing of Tykač`s assets of roughly 19 bil CZK by Swiss claimants. This should have occurred due to the renewed prosecution in the case of stripped assets of [[C. S. Fondy a.s.|CS Funds]] in the Czech Republic. Tykač denied any blocking of his assets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/1110919-svycari-meli-zmrazit-tykacovi-19-miliard-podnikatel-poprel|title=Švýcaři měli zmrazit Tykačovi 19 miliard, podnikatel to popřel|last=televize|first=Česká|website=ČT24|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a statement that it is a deliberate or unconscious attempt to prevent the signing of a contract between ČEZ and Czech Coal about a long-term supply of coal to power plant Počerady.

=== Tykač and the CS Funds ===

One of the media monitored cases associated with Pavel Tykač are the CS Funds. 1,3 bil CZK was fraudulently withdrawn from the funds in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.respekt.cz/tydenik/1997/12/z-c-s-fondu-se-ztratila-vice-nez-miliarda|title=Z C.

Dorazil sám|date=2009-08-20|website=tn.nova.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 prosecution of Tykač and another five people started. The prosecution of Tykač and other three suspects was terminated after a review by the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office in 2008 with the conclusion that the conduct of these persons in connection with CS Funds had not been a criminal offense.&lt;ref name="ceskapozice.lidovky.cz"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/divoka-leta-s-cs-fondy-0ty-/tema.aspx?c=A150210_011449_pozice-tema_kasa|title=Česká pozice {{!}} Informace pro svobodné lidi|date=2015-02-15|website=Lidovky.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining two suspects were indicted in the same year, but were subsequently freed by the Municipal Court in [[Prague]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/nezastavil-kradez-miliardy-nyni-chce-odskodne-8-milionu/r~8049859c9b3311e4a7d8002590604f2e/|title=Nezastavil krádež miliardy, nyní chce odškodné devět milionů|website=Aktuálně.cz - Víte co se právě děje|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tykač prosecuted again because of the CS Funds ===

Tykač`s involvement in the money withdrawal from the CS Funds became a subject of criminal prosecution again in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/krimi/290317-soud-obnovil-stihani-miliardare-tykace.html|title=Soud obnovil stíhání miliardáře Tykače|website=Novinky.cz|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; when criminal proceedings against him were resumed. New facts that led to the restoration of the process were represented by a particularly dubious testimony of people who either changed their testimony or refused to testify in the retrial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://euro.e15.cz/archiv/dlouha-tykacova-nocni-mura-vypoved-tunelare-ve-vysluzbe-stacit-nebude-1184310|title=Dlouhá Tykačova noční můra: Výpověď tuneláře ve výslužbě stačit nebude|date=2015-05-10|website=Euro.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this testimony, the police and the prosecution tried to secure Tykač`s property twice. In both cases the court found the decision as unjustified and it was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/soud-odblokoval-tykacovi-majetek-za-100-milionu-korun-f9t-/ekonomika.aspx?c=A130814_134546_ekonomika_fih|title=Soud odblokoval Tykačovi majetek za 102 milionů korun|date=2013-08-14|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015 the police investigation ended after two and a half years with a recommendation for indictment submitted to the Chief Prosecutor's Office in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/1522422-policie-navrhla-obzalovat-tykace-z-vytunelovani-cs-fondu|title=Policie navrhla obžalovat Tykače z vytunelování CS Fondů|last=televize|first=Česká|website=ČT24|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tykač is innocent ==
In December 2015 the High Prosecutor's Office in Prague terminated the prosecution against Tykač.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/tykacovi-obhajci-zastaveni-jsme-cekali-svedci-byli-neverohodni_367129.html|title=Tykačovi obhájci: Zastavení jsme čekali, svědci byli nevěrohodní|last=webmaster@tyden.cz|first=TYDEN, www.tyden.cz, e-mail:|date=2015-12-29|website=TÝDEN.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; State prosecutor Zdeněk Matula stated in the preamble that no evidence of Tykač`s guilt had been found. This verdict thus ended 19 years of CS Funds cause. In his interview for [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]] in 2014 Tykač stated that, in his opinion, the money from the funds disappeared during the management of its new owners, to whom the funds were sold by the Motoinvest group after pressure caused by a hostile attack of ČNB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iuhli.cz/forbesovske-ohlednuti-tykac-ve-verzi-2014/3/|title=Forbesovské ohlédnutí: Tykač ve verzi 2014 {{!}} iUHLI.cz {{!}} Page 3|date=2015-12-01|website=iUHLI.cz|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a wave of inspections of tax authorities, the Stock Exchange, Securities Office, a wave of police interrogations and strongly negative media atmosphere directed against "Motoinvest group".&lt;ref name="ceskapozice.lidovky.cz"/&gt;

=== Support of the North Bohemia region ===

Through his company Czech Coal and Vršanská uhelná Tykač supports number of projects and activities related to the region in northern Bohemia, for example, a grant program to support education called Clever Heads for the North,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kr-ustecky.cz/chytre-hlavy-pro-sever-2015/d-1689624|title=Chytré hlavy pro Sever 2015: Environmentální výchova, vzdělání a osvěta (EVVO): Ústecký kraj|website=www.kr-ustecky.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the top club of Women Handball DHK Baník Most, he also supports municipalities in the region, an example is his investment into the reconstruction of the Most hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mostecky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/miliardar-tykac-a-modelka-erbova-si-prohledli-vylepsenou-mosteckou-porodnici-20151112.html|title=Miliardář Tykač a modelka Erbová si prohlédli vylepšenou mosteckou porodnici|date=2015-11-12|website=Mostecký deník|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support for single parents ===

Together with his second wife Ivana Tykač established a non-profit organization Women for Women that is helping women and single mothers with children who find themselves in difficult circumstances and can not solve them on their own. The organization provides them with subsidized housing, psychosocial and legal assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.women-for-women.cz|title=WOMEN FOR WOMEN, o.p.s.|last=(m.vitasek@seznam.cz)|first=Michal Vitásek|website=www.women-for-women.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== School meals for starving children ===

Women for Women, o.p.s. is the initiator and operator of the Czech largest award-winning project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-64855470-kazdy-desaty-skolak-nema-penize-na-obed-varuje-ocenena-reklama|title=Každý desátý školák nemá peníze na oběd, varuje oceněná reklama|date=2015-11-12|website=Hospodářské noviny|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provides school meals to starving children in Czech elementary schools - Lunches for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.obedyprodeti.cz|title=Domů {{!}} Obědy pro děti|website=www.obedyprodeti.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project fed nearly 2,100 children in almost 500 schools during the 2014/2015 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tn.nova.cz/clanek/tisice-ceskych-deti-hladovi-rodice-nemaji-na-obedy-ve-skole.html|title=Budou děti o hladu?

== Family and personal life ==
Pavel Tykač is married for the second time. Together with his wife Ivana Tykač is raising eight children. He currently lives with his family in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lidovky.cz/manzelka-podnikatele-tykace-porodila-seste-dite-fug-/lide.aspx?c=A131104_111144_lide_ape|title=Manželka podnikatele Tykače porodila šesté dítě {{!}} Lidé|date=2013-11-04|website=Lidovky.cz|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tykač played competitive table tennis in his youth, nowadays he plays recreational tennis and badminton league in Prague.

Schroder, Technical Proceedings of the 2011 NSTI Nanotechnology Conference and Trade Show, 2, 220-223, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  When this transient processing is done on a low-temperature substrate such as plastic or paper, it is possible to attain a significantly higher temperature than the substrate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novacentrix.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Schroder-NSTI-2011.pdf|title=Mechanisms of Photonic Curing™: Processing High Temperature Films on Low Temperature Substrates|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; can ordinarily withstand under an equilibrium heating source such as an [[oven]].&lt;ref name="Schroder 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schroder 2006" /&gt;  Since the rate of most thermal curing processes (drying, [[sintering]], reacting, annealing, etc.) generally increase exponentially with temperature (i.e. they obey the [[Arrhenius equation]]), this process allows materials to be cured much more rapidly than with an oven.&lt;ref name="Schroder 2006"&gt;K. A. Schroder, S. C. McCool, W. R. Furlan, Technical Proceedings of the 2006 NSTI Nanotechnology Conference and Trade Show, 3, 198-201, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R&amp;DMag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rdmag.com/RD100-Awards-Flexible-Electronics-Process/|title=In flexible electronics, it’s all about protecting the paper|work=Research &amp; Development|accessdate=24 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725022503/http://www.rdmag.com/RD100-Awards-Flexible-Electronics-Process/|archivedate=25 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has become a transformative process used in the manufacture of printed electronics as it allows inexpensive and flexible substrates to be substituted for traditional glass or ceramic substrates. Additionally, the higher temperature processing afforded by photonic curing reduces the processing time exponentially, often from minutes down to milliseconds, which increases throughput all while maintaining a small machine footprint.

==Uses==
Photonic curing is used as a thermal processing technique in the manufacturing of [[printed electronics]] as it allows the substitution of glass or ceramic substrate materials with inexpensive and flexible substrate materials such as polymers or paper. The effect can be demonstrated with an ordinary camera flash.&lt;ref name="Patent"&gt;US Pat. #7,820,097.&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial photonic curing systems are typically water cooled and have controls and features similar to industrial [[lasers]]. The pulse rate can be fast enough to allow curing on the fly at speeds beyond 100&amp;nbsp;m/min making it suitable as a curing process for [[roll-to-roll processing]]. Material processing rates can exceed 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s.&lt;ref name="Schroder 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ORNL poster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ms.ornl.gov/mpg/pdf/researchthrusts/AP_PTPposterv2.pdf|title=NovaCentrix R&amp;D 100 Award Winner, 2009|accessdate=July 18, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001171054/http://www.ms.ornl.gov/mpg/pdf/researchthrusts/AP_PTPposterv2.pdf|archivedate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maturing complexity of modern printed electronics for customer applications demands high throughput manufacturing and improved device function. The functionality of the printed electronics is critically important as customers demand more out of each device. Multiple layers are designed into each device, requiring ever more versatile processing techniques. Photonic curing is uniquely suited to complement the processing needs in the manufacture of modern printed electronics by providing a fast, reliable and transformative processing step. Photonic curing enables a lower thermal processing budget with current materials, and it can provide a path to incorporate more advanced materials and functionality into future printed electronics.

==Development==
Photonic curing is similar to Pulse Thermal Processing, developed at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], in which a plasma arc lamp is used.  In the case of photonic curing, the radiant power is higher and the pulse length is shorter.   The total radiant exposure per pulse is less with photonic curing, but the pulse rate is much faster.&lt;ref name="ORNL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ms.ornl.gov/mpg/AP_ptp.shtml|title=Materials Process Group, OakRidge|accessdate=July 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001171107/http://www.ms.ornl.gov/mpg/AP_ptp.shtml|archivedate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Quick Reference Guide on Arbitration, Conciliation &amp; Mediation''''' is a book authored by Vishnu S Warrier published by [[Lexis Nexis]] in 2015.

The book studies the concept of [[Arbitration]], [[Mediation]] and [[Conciliation|Conciliation Procedure]] in Ancient India and present. Considering law students in mind, author did justice to conceptualize the Alternative Dispute Resolutions such as Arbitration, Mediation &amp; Conciliation into an easily understanding language.

== Key Concepts ==
In pursuit of globalisation, India responded positively by opening up its economy. Along with the benefits promised, it also brought lots of issues. As we all know major concern of law is the conflict resolution. Traditional justice delivery system through the adjudication of courts, had already given way a large extent of alternative mode of dispute Resolution in common law countries. Following are the Key Concepts covered under this Book.
Alternative dispute resolution in India is not new and it was in existence even under the previous Arbitration Act, 1940. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has been enacted to accommodate the harmonisation mandates of UNCITRAL Model. To streamline the Indian legal system the traditional civil law known as Code of Civil Procedure, (CPC) 1908 has also been amended and section 89 has been introduced. 
Section 89 (1) of CPC provides an option for the settlement of disputes outside the court. It provides that where it appears to the court that there exist elements, which may be acceptable to the parties, the court may formulate the terms of a possible settlement and refer the same for arbitration, conciliation, mediation or judicial settlement

=== Arbitration ===
The process of arbitration can start only if there exists a valid Arbitration Agreement between the parties prior to the emergence of the dispute. As per Section 7, such an agreement must be in writing. The contract regarding which the dispute exists, must either contain an arbitration clause or must refer to a separate document signed by the parties containing the arbitration agreement. The existence of an arbitration agreement can also be inferred by written correspondence such as letters, telex, or telegrams which provide a record of the agreement. An exchange of statement of claim and defense in which existence of an arbitration agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by other is also considered as valid written arbitration agreement.

=== Conciliation ===
Conciliation is a less formal form of arbitration. This process does not require an existence of any prior agreement. Any party can request the other party to appoint a conciliator. One conciliator is preferred but two or three are also allowed. In case of multiple conciliators, all must act jointly. If a party rejects an offer to conciliate, there can be no conciliation.

=== Mediation ===
The term "mediation" broadly refers to any instance in which a third party helps others reach agreement. More specifically, mediation has a structure, timetable and dynamics that "ordinary" negotiation lacks. The process is private and confidential, possibly enforced by law. Participation is typically voluntary. The mediator acts as a neutral third party and facilitates rather than directs the process.

=== Negotiation ===
Negotiation is a dialogue between two or more people or parties intended to reach a mutually beneficial outcome, resolve points of difference, to gain advantage for an individual or collective, or to craft outcomes to satisfy various interests.

'''Ralph Douglas Doubell''' [[Order of Australia|AM]] (born 11 February 1945) is an Australian former [[Athletics (sport)|athlete]], and gold medallist at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]].

==Athletic career==
Doubell was born in [[Melbourne]], was educated at [[Melbourne High School]]&lt;ref name=sahof/&gt; and graduated from the [[University of Melbourne]], where he had come under the tutelage of Austrian-born coach [[Franz Stampfl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/sportsfactor/ralph-doubell--franz-stampfl/3482188 The Sports Factor – Ralph Doubell &amp; Franz Stampfl]. abc.net.au. 12 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Doubell's first major international victory in 800 metres was at the [[World Student Games]] in Tokyo in 1967 in a time of 1:46.7. His next season (the Olympic season) was severely curtailed by [[Achilles' tendon]] injuries, and he was unable to compete for six months prior to the Olympic Games in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=sr/&gt; Doubell, however, was able to recover in time for Mexico City and won the 800 m gold medal, passing the pre-race favourite [[Wilson Kiprugut]] of [[Kenya]] down the straight to win in a [[world record]] equalling time of 1:44.3.&lt;ref name=sr/&gt;

Doubell also won the 800 metres gold medal at the 1969 [[Pacific Conference Games]] in a time of 1:48.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/pcg.htm |title=Pacific Conference Games |accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doubell had planned to compete at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]] in [[Munich]], but was prevented in doing so by calf injuries, which brought on his retirement from competitive athletics.&lt;ref name=sahof&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahof.org.au/hall-of-fame/member-profile/?memberID=63&amp;memberType=athlete |title=Ralph Doubell AM – Athletics |publisher=Sport Australia Hall of Fame |accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-athletic career==
After retirement from sports, Doubell enrolled at [[Harvard Business School]]. He then worked as a Head of Relationship Management and a Director and Divisional Head of Corporate and Institutional Banking of the [[Deutsche Bank]] Group in Australia. He was a Director of [[Telstra Stadium]] in Sydney until 2007.&lt;ref name=sr/&gt;

Doubell was inducted into the [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=sahof/&gt; On 12 June 2006, in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours List]], he was made a Member (AM) of the [[Order of Australia]], for "services to athletics through administrative roles, particularly with Athletics New South Wales, and as a competitor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/qb/qb2006/Media%20Notes%20AM%28A-I%29.pdf#page=29|title=The Queen's Birthday 2006 Honours List, Member (AM) in the General Division of the Order of Australia: Mr Ralph Douglas Doubell|format=pdf|page=65|website=[[Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia]]|publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]]|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schering AG''' was a research-centered [[Germany|German]] [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[pharmaceutical company]] headquartered in [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Berlin]], which operated as an independent company from 1851 to 2006. In 2006 it was bought by [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] and merged to form the Bayer subsidiary [[Bayer Schering Pharma|Bayer Schering Pharma AG]], which was renamed [[Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals]] in 2011. Schering was listed on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] and had 26,000 employees as of 2004.

The American pharmaceutical company [[Schering-Plough]], formerly the Schering Corporation, was originally the US subsidiary of Schering AG, and merged with [[Merck &amp; Co.]] in 2009.

==History==
In 1851, [[Ernst Christian Friedrich Schering]] opened the ''Grüne Apotheke'' (Green Pharmacy) in [[Berlin]]'s ''Chausseestraße'', and in 1871 converted into the name ''Chemische Fabrik auf Actien'' (formerly E. Schering). This date is the company's date of incorporation.

The company grew strongly in the following years. In 1913, the company employed 935 workers, 112 [[Master craftsman#Germany|master craftsman]] and 180 office employees. In addition to the Berlin site, two factories were also located in Russia ([[Moscow]] and Wydriza) with over 1,000 workers and a plant in [[Great Britain]]. Turnover at the time was about 10 million [[German gold mark]], created with the production of photochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Important products produced were [[salicylic acid]], the antigout preparation [[Cinchophen|atophan]], various sleeping and disinfecting agents.

At the beginning of the 1920s, Schering took over the wash and colouring company {{ill|W. Spindler|de}} located in the Berlin district ''Köpenick''. In 1922, the management acquired the majority of shares in the chemical factory ''Chemischen Fabrik auf Actien'' (formerly E. Schering) from the [[Upper Silesia|Upper Silesian]] {{ill|Oberschlesische Kokswerke und Chemische Fabriken|de}}.

In 1937, the companies ''Kokswerke und Chemische Fabriken AG'' and the ''Chemischen Fabrik auf Actien'' amalgamated with the sister company ''Schering-Kahlbaum AG'' and, on the same day, renamed on account of the internationally respected name ''Schering'' to ''Schering Aktiengesellschaft''. The pharmaceutical business thus became part of a mining and chemical group, which also produced [[Radiography|radiographic]] products and [[pesticide]] products.

Schering was the manufacturer of [[Primodos]].

=== Bayer takeover 2006 ===
In March 2006, [[Merck KGaA]] announced a €14.6bn bid for Schering, which by 2006 had annual gross revenue of around €5 billion&lt;ref&gt;Schering AG press release. Feb 20, 2006 [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2005-a-record-year-for-schering-ag-55363567.html 2005 a Record Year for Schering AG]&lt;/ref&gt; and employed about 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.&lt;ref name=KumarMergers/&gt; [[Bayer]] responded with a [[White knight (business)|white knight]] bid and in July acquired the majority of shares of Schering for €14.6bn,&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Eve Laforte for First Word Pharma. July 12th, 2006 [http://www.firstwordpharma.com/node/144265 Bayer completes acquisition of Schering AG]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007, Bayer took over Schering AG and formed Bayer Schering Pharma. The acquisition of Schering was the largest take-over in Bayer's history,&lt;ref name=KumarMergers&gt;B Rajesh Kumar. Mega Mergers and Acquisitions: Case Studies from Key Industries.

At the time of the merger, the company employed more than 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.  Schering's annual gross revenue was nearly €5 billion (2003).

[[File:Service Design Blueprint.png|thumb|A Service Blueprint for the organization of a Conference]]

The '''service blueprint''' is a technique originally used for service design and innovation, but has also found applications in diagnosing problems with operational efficiency. The technique was first described by G. Lynn Shostack, a bank executive, in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G. Lynn. "Designing Services that Deliver", ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 62, no. 1 January - February 1984, pp 133–139 &lt;Online:[http://hbr.org/1984/01/designing-services-that-deliver/ar/1]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The service blueprint is an applied process chart which shows the service delivery process from the customer's perspective. The service blueprint has become one of the most widely used tools to manage service operations, service design and service positioning.

==Elements==

A simple way to think about blueprints is as a process chart which consists of inputs, process and outputs.

::: Inputs (raw materials) → Process (transformation) → Outputs (finished goods)

[[File:Service blueprint.jpg|thumb|Service blueprints include actions and the amount of discretion for varying each step]]

A service blueprint is always constructed from the customer's perspective. A typical service blueprint identifies:&lt;ref&gt;Zeithmal, V. A. and Bitner, M.J., ''Services Marketing,'' Mc Graw-Hill, N.Y., 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

*Customer Actions: The steps that customers take as part of the service delivery process.
*Front-stage (Visible Contact Employee) Actions: Steps taken by contact employees as part of the face-to-face service encounter.
*Back-stage (Invisible Contact Employee) Actions: (The 'line of visibility' separates the front-stage and back-stage actions). Non-visible steps taken by contact employees behind the line of visibility. e.g. taking a hotel or restaurant reservation by telephone.
*Support Processes: Activities carried out by employees who are not contact employees, but whose actions are required for the service to be delivered.
*Physical Evidence: Tangible elements associated with each step that has the potential to influence customer perceptions of the service encounter e.g. uniforms, delivery vans
* Inventory (if required): the amount of inventory build up required for each step
* Line of Visibility: Line that separates front-stage and back-stage actions

''Optional inclusions – depending on intended application'':&lt;ref&gt;Fließ, S. and Kleinaltenkamp, M. (2004) "Blueprint the Service Company: Managing Service Processes Efficiently," ''Journal of Business Research,'' vol. 57, no. 4, pp 392-404&lt;/ref&gt;

* Line of Interaction which separates customer actions from service provider actions
* Line of  Internal Interaction which separates the front office and the back office
* Line of Implementation which separates management zone from the support zone. That is management are responsible for planning and controlling while support activities include preparation.  

Yet other scholars and practitioners have recommended adding different lines including

* Line of Order Penetration which separates customer-induced activities from customer-independent activities 
* Minimum expected wait times
* Potential bottlenecks and/or fail points&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V.A., Bitner, M. J. and Gremler, D. D., ''Services Marketing: Integrating Customer Focus Across the Firm,'' 4th ed, McGraw-Hill Irwin, Boston, Mass. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==

The service blueprint has become one of the most useful tools in the services marketer's repertoire. Since its original development, a number of scholars have sought to increase its usefulness by adding various modifications that provide additional information and more demarcations. Zeithaml and Bitner recommend adding four lines to the map. (1) the Line of Visibility (as in the original); (2) the Line of Interaction which separates customer actions from service provider actions (3) the Line of  Internal Interaction which separates the front office and the back office and (4) the Line of Implementation which separates management zone from the support zone.&lt;ref&gt;Zeithmal, V. A.  and Bitner, M.J., ''Services Marketing,'' Mc Graw-Hill, N.Y., 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of these lines helps to separate the functions of planning and controlling from support activities including preparation.  Yet other scholars and practitioners have recommended adding different lines including (5) the Line of Order Penetration which separates customer-induced activities from customer-independent activities.&lt;ref&gt;Fließ, S. and Kleinaltenkamp, M., "Blueprint the Service Company: Managing Service Processes Efficiently," ''Journal of Business Research'', vol. 57, no. 4, 2004, pp 392-404&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock, Patterson, and Walker (2001) suggest that the service blueprint may also be useful for specifying the level of variation from standards that would be tolerated at each step of the process without affecting customers' perceptions of quality and timeliness.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C.H., Patterson, P.G. and Walker, R.H., ''Services Marketing: An Asia-Pacific Perspective'', French's Forest, NSW, Prentice-Hall, 2001, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Zeithaml, Bitner and Gremler (2006) also recommended adding ''bottlenecks'' and ''fail points'' to the map. A bottleneck is a point in the system at which consumers waiting time is likely to exceed average or minimum tolerable expectations. A fail point is any point within the encounter that has potential to affect customer satisfaction or quality.&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V.A., Bitner, M. J. and Gremler, D. D. (2006), ''Services Marketing: Integrating Customer Focus Across the Firm'', 4th ed, Boston, MA, McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These additions increase the diagnostic value of the service blueprint.

==Applications==

Service blueprinting has three main applications: simple representation; diagnosing operational deficiencies and service design (planning for structural change or new service development).

: (1) ''Simple Representation''
: A basic application for blueprints is as a simple form of representing or codifying what is actually occurring in the current operation.  In visual form, the blueprint can be used in training programs, employee manuals to help clarify service processes. Blueprints may be used in market research as a means of helping respondents to visualise aspects of a service that may be the focus of an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G.L&gt; "How to Design a Service", ''European Journal of Marketing'', vol. 16 no. 1, 1993, pp. 49–63&lt;/ref&gt; Blueprints can also be used in employee training programs and manuals to assist staff to visualise the service process and the relationships between steps in the process. 

: (2) ''Diagnosing Operational Deficiencies''
: Blueprints have also found widespread applications as diagnostic tools designed to uncover operational weaknesses. A number of scholars have championed the diagnostic value of blueprints.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C. H., "Managing Interactions Between Operations and Marketing and their Impact on Customers," in Bowen, D.E. Chase, R.B. and Cummings, T.G. (eds), ''Service Management Effectiveness. Balancing Strategy, organization and Human Resources,'' San Francisco, 1990, pp 343-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swank&gt;Swank, C. K., "The Lean Service Machine, ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 81 no, 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|123–129}}
: The blueprint can be analysed in terms of the appropriateness of physical evidence provided at each contact point as well as the suitability of contact personnel in relation to activities.  In the event that any deficiencies are identified by the blueprinting process, management can develop operational standards for critical steps in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Womack, J. P. and Jones, D.  T. , "Lean Consumption," ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 83, no. 3, 2005, pp 58–68&lt;/ref&gt;

: (3) ''Service design: Planning for Structural Change/ New Service Development''
: Shostack's original intention was that blueprinting be used as a planning tool.&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G. L., "Service Positioning through Structural Change," ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 51, no. 1, 1987, pp 34-43&lt;/ref&gt; Using a simple diagrammatic representation of the process, management could pose "What if?" type scenarios and reconfigure the service process in the blueprint form, without causing major disruptions in real time. For example, a planner might ask, What if we give employees wider latitude? What if we reduce latitude by scripting every step?  What if we reduce complexity by combining two or more steps into a single procedure? What if we add complexity by having different contact staff take responsibility for each step?

==Building a blueprint==

The original service blueprint is a highly visual, graphical map that delineates the key contact points in the service process and the nature of the contact – whether with physical evidence, personnel or procedures. It can be seen as a two dimensional map in which the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents the basic steps in the process.  A line of visibility is included to separate actions visible to the customer from actions out of sight.  Employee latitude, which refers to the amount of discretion given to employees to vary the service process, is shown on the map a call-out sign attached to the step. Process complexity is shown simply by the number of steps in the process.

The process of structuring a blueprint involves between five and seven steps, depending on the intended application.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Alan/ Zeithaml, Valerie A./ Bitner, Mary Jo/ Gremler, Dwayne D. (2008): ''Services Marketing: Integrating Customers Focus Across the Firm'', Glasgow, 2008. (p. 203-206)&lt;/ref&gt; From the outset, the blueprint was designed to be seen from the customer's perspective while simultaneously providing insights for management. Accordingly, the starting point should be to imagine the customer's step-by-step contact points, indicating, where known, customer's expectations in terms of minimum tolerable waiting times for each step.

[[File:Symbols used in blueprints.jpg|thumb|Symbols typically used in service blueprints]]

''Basic Service Blueprint''

# Identify activities, sequence of activities and linkages between activities.  Activities include 
#: (a) customer actions
#: (b)  front stage contact personnel actions
#: (c)  back stage contact personnel actions 
#: (d) support activities
# Identify line of visibility and add to blueprint.
# Identify standards and tolerances, scripts, operating procedures, supporting services and inventory for each step and add to blueprint.
# If required, draw additional lines such as line of physical interaction and line of IT interaction (optional, but recommended for complex services).
# Specify timeframes. Show average timing or minimum tolerable customer expectations for each step and indicate responsible personnel. &lt;br/&gt; ''Diagnostic Information (optional)''
# Identify and note fail points and excessive waits.
# Manipulate divergence and complexity.

Traditionally, service blueprints have been depicted with lines and text boxes to depict anything from user actions to support processes.  Fail points, bottlenecks and average time taken for each step can also be added at the analyst's discretion. The amount of information included in the service blueprint largely depends on how it is to be used. Over the years, a system of commonly accepted symbols associated with service blueprints has been developed. Although blueprints are not difficult to prepare, there is no universal agreement about how to present the finished process map.

==Interpretation==

When interpreting service blueprints, there are two basic considerations, complexity and divergence.

''Complexity'' refers to the number and intricacy of the steps required to perform the service. A complex service process is one that has many steps.

''Divergence'' refers to the degree of latitude, freedom, judgment, discretion, variability or situational adaptation permitted within any step of the process. The number of call-out signs attached to steps is an indicator of a service process that allows wide latitude to vary steps in the service delivery process.

[[File:Salad Bar in USF's Market Cafe.jpg|thumb|A self-service cafeteria accommodates volume operations by reducing divergence. Patrons must select from a range of pre-prepared dishes and opportunities for customisation are minimal or non-existent]]

Manipulations of the blueprint diagram might include increasing complexity, by adding more steps, or increasing divergence by allowing employees greater latitude in varying each step. In general, service processes that include high levels of employee discretion to vary steps to meet the needs of individual customers are moving towards customisation. On the other hand, reducing divergence, by standardising each step, often adds to complexity, but can result in a production-line approach to service process design. By manipulating complexity and divergence, it is possible to envisage four different positioning strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G.L., "How to Design a Service," in Donnelly an, J.H. and George, W.R. (eds),  ''Marketing of Services'', [AMA Special Conference on Services Marketing], American Marketing Association, Chicago. Ill, 1981, pp 221-29&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Reduced Complexity:'' Specialisation strategy
: ''Reduced Divergence:'' Volume-operations
: ''Increase Complexity:''  Product development
: ''Increased Divergence:'' Niche market strategy

== Managerial actions for service design or structural change==

[[File:Ilbeccodenoche.jpg|thumb|Fine dining operations typically allow for increased divergence. Patrons can request special dishes, cooked to order, special ingredients or accompaniments]]

The examination of service blueprints 'may suggest opportunities for product improvement that might be achieved by reconfiguring delivery systems, adding or deleting specific elements, or repositioning the service to appeal to other segments'.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C.H. and Wirtz, J., ''Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy'', 5th ed.,  Upper Saddle River, NJ., Prentice Hall, 2004, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; By manipulating complexity and divergence, it is possible to envisage service process improvements, service product improvements or new service innovations.

''Reduce divergence'': Reducing divergence typically requires substituting equipment for labour, involving customers in self-service and introducing standardised operating procedures. The outcome is uniformity which reduces costs and improves productivity. This approach usually involves a shift to high-volume/low margin positioning and requires access to mass markets to be successful. The vulnerability of this approach is that it reduces customisation and flexibility.

''Increase divergence'': Increasing divergence results is effectively a niche market strategy. Higher levels of customisation and flexibility require significant investments in human resources, recruitment and training all of which adds to costs. The approach usually involves a shift towards the prestige market segment and requires access to customers who are willing to pay a premium for customised services. The vulnerability of increased divergence is that processes are more difficult to manage, control and distribute.

''Reduce complexity'': Reduced complexity usually involves a specialisation strategy. As steps are removed from the process, the service firm concentrates on a narrower range of offerings. Examples include an obstetrician, radiologist.  The advantage of this approach is that the service provider can develop high levels of expertise and that distribution and control are facilitated.  The vulnerability of this approach is that it exposes the service firm to risk, especially if competitors continue to offer the convenience of full-service alternatives.

''Increase complexity'': Increased complexity is the service-product development option (i.e. sell different products to existing markets).  Under this option, the service firm has an increased opportunity to maximise the revenue generated from each customer. The vulnerability inherent in this approach is that the firm's market positioning may become confused. Managing a broader array of products may also expose the firm to risks of spreading its effort too thin to the detriment of overall service quality.

== Managerial actions for improvements to operational efficiency==

While blueprints draw attention to operational deficiencies, the blueprint, per se, cannot suggest solutions.  In order to identify potential solutions to operating problems, the analyst must examine the service process and consider the factors that are likely to cause the problem. In addition, the range of possible solutions may be constrained by organisation's mission, current market position and access to resources. 
  
A very substantial body of marketing literature has addressed the question of possible solutions to problems identified through blueprinting. It is difficult to do justice to the wealth of studies using blueprints to gain managerial insights.  A short summary of key managerial actions follows:

[[File:Subway Helsingin yliopiston metroasemalla.JPG|thumb|Most fast food outlets use clearly articulated systems to process customers seamlessly. The blueprint is designed to support volume operations while allowing customers some flexibility to customise the offering]]

''Standardize Procedures''

Variable performance in service delivery is largely attributable to inseparability and human factors.  Even in the back office, lack of standardisation can indirectly influence the customer process. In many organisations employees chose their own systems for storing files. Swank (2003: 125) cites an example of an insurance company where some employees filed according to policyholder (alphabetical), others by policy number (chronological) while others by date received. When employees were absent, substitutes sometimes found it hard to figure out where files were stored, so the process of retrieving files was delayed.&lt;ref&gt;Wener, R.E., "The Environmental Psychology of Service Encounters," in Czepiel, J.A., Solomon, M.R. and  Suprenant, C.F. (eds), ''The Service Encounter: Managing Customer Interactions in Service Businesses'', Lexington Books, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce this variation, the service firm has several options.

::''Production-lining'' – The production-line approach utilises a combination of hard and soft technologies to facilitate production, standardise procedures and minimise deviations arising from human error. This approach is typically characterised by simplification of tasks, clear division of labour and low levels of employee latitude.&lt;ref&gt;Van Looy, B., Gemmel, P. and Van Dierdonck, R., ''Services Management: An Integrated Approach'', 2nd ed., Esse, UK, Prentice Hall, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

:: ''Introduce Standard Operating Procedures'' – In services where it is neither possible nor desirable to replace human labour with equipment, standardization may be achieved through soft technologies alone. Standards may include specifying the scripts for a technically correct performance, prescribing a uniform or dress code for employees, codifying operating procedures.  Wherever possible, standards should include measurable components.

::'' Isolate the technical core'' –  Deviations can also be reduced by decoupling the technical core from other aspects of the service system.  For example, a theatre may elect to use a ticketing agent for all reservations and do away with the box-office.  This approach may need to be accompanied by customer education programs to ensure seamless implementation.

Standardization is clearly designed to provide tighter control over service delivery with a view to improving consistency of quality and making it easier for management to assess processes. Other benefits include reductions in costs and improved productivity. However, it should be noted that gains in operational efficiency achieved through standardization usually involve sacrificing flexibility and customisation.  For the analyst, there is a constant trade off between improved operational efficiency and customised delivery.

''Identify and Manage Critical Incidents''

Some deviation is a normal aspect of service interactions; however any deviation that is likely to affect the customer's perceptions of value directly impacts on satisfaction.  Those incidents which have the potential to become especially satisfying or dissatisfying are known as critical incidents and may benefit from standardised procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Bitner, M.J., "Evaluating Service Encounters: The Effects of Physical Surroundings and Employee Responses," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 54, no. 2, 1990, pp 69-82&lt;/ref&gt;  Customer waiting time is often considered to be a critical incident and may also need to have standards and tolerances developed.

[[File:APC 77598 Webster Texas.jpg|thumb|Self-service technologies replace labour with equipment and deliver a standardised service efficiently]]

''Reduce the Number of Contact Points''

It is often suggested that a reduction in the number of contact points in the service processes can lead to greater efficiency since it reduces the total number of points where failure can creep into the system.&lt;ref&gt;Fließ, S. and Kleinaltenkamp, M. "Blueprint the Service Company: Managing Service Processes Efficiently," ''Journal of Business Research'', vol. 57, no. 4, 2004, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;  To simplify the delivery process, the most common way is to delegate activities to the customer through self-service technologies or self-guided processes.  However, replacing technologies for humans contributes to inflexibility of service processes and may ultimately lead to fewer opportunities to differentiate a service offering in the marketplace. Planners may need to balance competing interests of controlling the process with the overall positioning strategy.

''Increase customer participation''

Customer participation should not be confused with customer contact. Customer participation is the degree of effort and involvement, both mental and physical, required to produce and deliver the service.&lt;ref&gt;Bove, L., 'Service Delivery: The Role of Personnel and Customers',  in McColl-Kennedy, J., (ed.) ''Services Marketing: A Managerial Approach,'' Milton, Qld, Wiley, pp. 296–329.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of services high in customer participation include do-it-yourself car washes, salad bars and buffets, and distance (off-campus) education services.

The level of customer participation varies from providing simple information to the service provider, to joint-production with the assistance of service staff, to instances where the customer is the sole producer (i.e. self-service). Customer participation focuses on reducing the costs associated with delivering the service product.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock,, C. and Young, R.F., "Look to Customers to Increase Productivity," ''Harvard Business Review,'' in Bateson, J., ''Managing Services Marketing: Text and Readings'', Dryden, 1992 pp 178-188&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it costs approximately $3 for a bank to serve a customer over-the-counter as opposed to 1c via the Internet.  Although the additional 'work' customers have to perform may be associated with such benefits as extended service hours, time-savings and in some instances monetary savings, these benefits may not be immediately obvious—they must be promoted.

''Segregate Complexity''

Anyone who has stood in line at a bank while a single teller assisted a customer with a lengthy transaction understands this principle. One solution is to cluster tasks with similar levels of difficulty into separate groups with their own procedures and performance.&lt;ref name=Swank/&gt;{{rp|124}} For example, a bank branches with large numbers of retail customers (with relatively simple transactions) and commercial customers (making large deposits and withdrawals) might want to introduce separate teller windows for each group of customers.

''Place Linked Processes in Close Physical Proximity''

Complex services involve many steps and may require paperwork or customer files to be shuffled between contact staff, back office and support departments. The time taken to move paperwork or customers is very costly in terms of time and efficiency. Tertiary student enrolment provides a great example of complex processes that are often not very customer-friendly. Students must firstly see an  academic advisor to ensure that their course progress in on track, then see an administrative advisor to check that paperwork is in order and finally see a cashier to pay tuition fees and pay any fines, such as overdue library books before they can finalise their enrolment. In many institutions, this enrolment process can take half a day – and requires students to run from pillar to post as they complete each step.  Locating each stage in close proximity has many advantages. Not only does it improve operational efficiency, it has the potential to allow service staff to focus on the total process and gain a better understanding of the ways that their actions impact on other parts of the system. In short, it forces employees to focus not just on the activities for which they are directly responsible.

''Eliminate Loop-Backs''

In manufacturing, a loopback occurs when work is returned to a previous step for further processing. Loop-backs typically create delays because they cause consequential problems along the production line.  Given that service processes involve humans, rather than machines, processing may be complicated by employees' choices concerning which tasks to undertake and how to schedule them.  If loop-backs present a problem, management can assist employees to clarify roles and tasks by focusing on their place within the overall service process.&lt;ref name=Swank/&gt;{{rp|129}}

[[File:Shopping queue outside OG at Orchard Point.jpg|thumb|When systems have been poorly designed, lengthy queues or overcrowding may result.]]

''Control Fail Points''

Failures in service process may be attributed to either the service provider or the customer. It is possible that the service provider did not utilise resources in a way that best serves the customers needs.  Alternatively, service provider failures may be caused by mismanagement. For example, an employee, who chooses to deviate from the script, may fail to serve the customer correctly.  Finally, failures can be caused by customers who do not understand the process and do not know what they should be doing. For example, a customer might fail to provide appropriate documents to an appointment with a bank manager or lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Fließ, S. &amp; Kleinaltenkamp, M., "Blueprint the Service Company: Managing Service Processes Efficiently," ''Journal of Business Research'', vol. 57, no. 4, 2004, p.  398&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to spend time diagnosing the reasons for fail points before implementing solutions. Failures attributable to customers are often due to misinformation. In such cases, the service firm could, for instance, provide customers with information checklists at the time when they make an appointment. Failures due to lack of resources may require short-term solutions to alleviate the immediate problem while long-term solutions including resource acquisition can be pursued.

'''Stefano Bemer''' (1964 – 2012) was an Italian shoemaker, based in Florence.

Bemer's clients included the actor [[Andy Garcia]], designer [[Gianfranco Ferré]] and singer [[Julio Iglesias]].

The actor Sir [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]  worked as an apprentice for Bemer for eight months between 1999 and 2000, showing up for work at 8am every day. The London shoe designer Justin FitzPatrick also did an apprenticeship with the shoemaker in 2008-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrea Vogt |url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/jul/29/italian-shoemaker-stefano-bemer-dies |title=Italian shoemaker Stefano Bemer dies &amp;#124; Fashion |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His handmade shoes are highly prized.

Nowadays the company is carried on by Tommaso Melani and his Scuola del Cuoio family company. Stefano Bemer is now a large artisanal workshop nested in a chapel in Via San Niccoló in Florence and has a direct showroom in New York City.

'''''The Movies''''' is a [[business simulation game]] created by [[Lionhead Studios]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and subsequently ported to [[Mac OS X]] by [[Feral Interactive]]. It was released on 8 November 2005 in North America, and 11 November 2005 in Europe after reaching [[Release to manufacturing|gold]] status on 8 October 2005. The game allows players to take the role of a [[Hollywood]] [[film]] mogul, running a studio and creating films. Much has been made about the film-making aspect of the game, as it allows players to easily create viewable works or [[machinima]]. It won ''Best Simulation Game'' at the [[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA Video Games Awards]] and was nominated for best game at the [[Game Developers Choice Awards]].

On 6 June 2006, an expansion pack was released, ''[[The Movies: Stunts &amp; Effects]]''. This expansion added a host of new features, among which were [[stunt]]s (and [[stunt double]]s), and [[special effect]]s, as well as the ability to designate custom camera angles. This game is also available on the Mac. The Mac port of the game was published by [[Feral Interactive]] and developed by [[Robosoft Technologies]].

==Gameplay==
In ''The Movies'', players get the chance to run their own movie studio. The game can be divided into three main areas – designing the movie studio, forging the careers of film stars and making films. It is possible to focus on any of those areas that appeal most, and spend less time on the others. The game plays through from the birth of cinema to the present day and into the near future, with all the technology and historical advances that occur along that timeline. After the movies have been made, they can be played back for the viewer to watch. It is possible once the movie is made to add voice, text and music in [[post-production]].

The two most important types of staff in the game are actors and directors, referred to as "stars" in the game. In order to keep stars in a positive mood, the player will need to give them a salary the stars deem satisfactory (relative to their success), an image the stars deem decent, a [[mobile home|trailer]] of good quality, and a large [[wiktionary:entourage|entourage]]. Stars can also get stressed or bored, depending on how many movies the player puts them in. Each star has different thresholds regarding when they will get stressed or bored. If stars get stressed, they will resort to [[alcoholism]] or [[Eating disorder|over-eat]]ing. Actors play a big role in ''The Movies''. An actor's age and physique affects the quality of movies. Scary-looking actors are suited for horror roles. Younger, more handsome looking actors are more suited for romance movie roles. 30-year-old actors are suited for action roles, and older actors are suited for comedy roles. All actors and directors will retire at age 70. However, depending on a Star's experience in the movie's genre, the movie's quality will go up if they have an adequate level of experience, or down if they do not have enough experience. All films require crew members to carry out the filming process. Early films just require a camera operator and a [[clapperboard]] operator, but more advanced films require [[boom microphone|boom mike]] operators, lighting controllers and other specialised crew members. Other staff include [[extra (drama)|extra]]s (which can be promoted to Star status if they are good enough), [[janitor]]s, [[research and development|scientist]]s, scriptwriters, builders,  and [[film crew|crew member]]s.

The studio lot is where sets and buildings are built. In order to increase the 'prestige' of the studio lot, the studio must be neat, free of litter, well laid out and with areas of grass, trees and decoration. Buildings must also be linked together by paths. Buildings and [[film set|sets]] also decay, thus decreasing the quality of movies that they appear in. They will eventually become unusable if they do not receive maintenance or repair by staff. The game begins with four rival studios, and six studios are added later. No more studios open for business after the year 1970.

There is no limit on movie length. The average movie length is between 30 seconds and 3 minutes, but user created films can be as long as budget will allow (although a 10-minute film might require over 20 game years of filming). In sandbox mode however, a director can have the movie shoot automatically with the correct options turned on, allowing a 15–20 minute movie made in about a minute. If this is chosen, however, the movie's crew rating will be announced as "awful". Once the actors, extras, director and crew are assigned to a film, production begins, with the entire staff of the film travelling between sets to film the movie. The sandbox mode allows films to be created without undergoing the lengthy production process, and with budgets of over $100 million. A film can be one of five [[genre]]s: [[action film|action]], [[comedy film|comedy]], [[horror film|horror]], [[romance film|romance]] or [[science fiction film|science fiction]]. The main effect genre choice has is that real world events affect popularity of different genres. (The [[Vietnam War]] decreases popularity of action, the [[Space Race]] increases the popularity of science fiction, [[World War II]] decreases the popularity of horror, the [[Post-World War II|post-war period]] increases the popularity of horror, and the [[Great Depression]] increases the popularity of comedy.)

Players are able to pick a script provided by the studio's writers or write their own, although automated scripts take long to write in game time, while user-written scripts take longer to write in real time. For pre-written scripts, the player hires a writer at the Scriptwriting Office to make one. Multiple writers can collaborate on a single script in order to write it quicker. A series of upgrades, which are unlocked by winning studio awards, will allow the player to build higher quality Scriptwriting Offices, which increase the maximum rating a script can garner (1 star to 4 stars). The ability to write one's own script is enabled after unlocking the Custom Scriptwriting Office, which is itself unlocked from winning an award. It is limited in terms of quality to what the highest scripting office can produce. Writing a custom script follows a storyboard-like suite. For each scene, the player chooses a set for the scene and then the action that will occur during the scene (for example: 'Living Room 1: Enter Scared'). The actors and their costumes can be chosen, extras assigned roles and mood, and [[lighting]] and [[weather]] settings altered. The process will cost money though, the price increasing for each scene. The player can choose to have the structure set out for them (e.g., Introduction, pursuit, conflict, resolution) or "Freeform" mode, where there are no guidelines.

[[Set construction|Sets]] are the constructions in the studio lot where the cast and crew assemble to shoot movies. The sets are divided into categories such as [[Urban area|urban]], [[wild west|western]] and [[rural]]. Different scenes have different actions available (a bar might feature many drinking related actions, while a street would feature various [[car]] actions). Sets can be used to practice movies and increase genre experience. For example, an actor practising on the set of a spaceship will increase his/her science fiction proficiency, leading to a better performance in sci-fi movies he/she is cast in.

Once production has finished, the film undergoes [[post production]] (provided a Post Production Building has been erected), where [[music]], [[sound effect]]s, [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], [[Speech communication|speech]] and titles can be added to the movie. Cuts and changes can also be made to the length and order of the scenes, making [[editing]] the film easier. The player can also record sounds and a dialogue track for each character in that particular scene. The game allows for [[lip-sync]]hing, matching the speech to the actors. However, this only works for short sound files, and only shows basic lip movements. Once the movie has been completed, it can be saved in a proprietary file format for transferring to other [[Personal computer|PC]] users, or [[Windows Media Video|WMV]] format for online sharing. Outstanding player-made films can be nominated for a Stanley, a version of the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]. Once the player has reached Level 3 in story mode, the [[public relations|publicity]] office becomes available. This allows actors to hold [[press conference]]s and organizes [[marketing]] for the player's movie. Once a publicity office is built, players can also choose an advertising budget when releasing a film. A heavily advertised movie can make much more money, but using too much advertising can result in the movie being 'over-exposed'.

The game starts in 1920 and continues indefinitely, although technologies tail off in 2020. As a result, early films are in [[monochrome|black and white]] without sound, while modern movies feature [[digital sound]] and [[computer-generated imagery]]. Inventing these innovations before rival studios can increase the quality of the player's films, but hiring more researchers can cost more than the extra income the advances provide.

===''The Movies Online''===
''The Movies Online'' was the online portal for those who wished to release their movies to other gamers. As well as its own section on the general Lionhead forums, TMO allowed players to upload their own movies to the Internet for others to review and criticize. Reviews allowed users to rate movies from 1 to 5 stars, as well as leave a comment. When uploading a movie, the player could place the movie into one of five different categories: Romance, Action, Comedy, Horror, and Sci-Fi. This translated into Virtual Credits (VCs), a form of [[virtual economy|virtual currency]] that was used to buy new props, costumes, and sets, and to advertise online movies.

When the game was first released, a "propshop" was advertised as the only way to spend VCs. Moviemakers were asked, not required, to upload their movies made using the game, earning them around 500 VCs. Each review was worth 200 VC. After ''The Movies Stunts &amp; Effects'' was released, The Movies Online entire site was remade. The new TMO featured a way to advertise movies to the general public, using movie posters. Movie posters were uploaded and could be posted to the main movie-poster spot on the homepage for 1,000 VC. Posters were randomly shown. This was, besides the propshop, the only "official" way to spend VCs.

Every week, Lionhead picked out six movies to be featured on the TMO homepage. These movies could be submitted to fansites, who generally contacted Lionhead on which movies they nominated. The "Hall Of Fame" was the 9th TMO chart. Before the site was re-done, there was a "Top Stars" chart, in which Top Stars were featured on the site. The Top Stars were fictional, and were often judged by how many films they appeared in on TMO. The charts were generally updated every six hours. The exact formula for how the charts were resolved was not publicly known, but numbers of unique viewers, peer rating and time elapsed since release of any given movie all played a role in calculating chart position.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On 18 July 2008, The Movies Online was taken offline due to server problems.  On 4 August 2008, the servers were fixed.  On 2 September 2008, The Movies Online experienced yet more technical problems. These had been solved to an extent but much of The Movies Online website did not work including the chart system and many bugs remained. On 7 November 2008, it was announced by the Lionhead team that The Movies Online would be closing on 5 December.

On 5 December 2008, The Movies Online was shut down after three years and one month active. The website since its opening in 2005 has had two million visitors and 33025270 seconds' (more than one year's) worth of movies uploaded. The reason for closure was a drop in visitors and movies being uploaded to the website.

==Development==
Production of ''The Movies'' began in late 2002&lt;ref name=gamespy01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-movies/532487p1.html |title=GameSpy: The Beginnings of The Movies - Page 1 |publisher=Pc.gamespy.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Lionhead Studios]] brain-storming conference. The idea began when [[Peter Molyneux]] came up with a new idea for a simulation game. The idea was to create a more diverse and lifelike strategy aspect to the game giving players the option to create their very own movie.&lt;ref name=gamespy01/&gt; They announced the idea in April 2002 at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2002. The fan reaction was pretty big- ''The Movies'' booth was one of E3's most visited that year and many companies wanted to distribute the game. [[Lionhead Studios]] eventually chose [[Activision]].  The game took almost 4 years to make because of various changes to the graphic engine during production. It was finally released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in November 2005.

The game was originally going to be ported to [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[GameCube]], but development of the console ports was halted immediately before acquisition of Lionhead by [[Microsoft]]. The game was officially cancelled on 7 February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235032/http://www.palgn.com.au/article.php?title=The+Movies+on+consoles+canned&amp;id=3865 ''The Movies'' for consoles cancelled]&lt;/ref&gt; Poor sales was the reason cited for the cancellation.

In October 2006, the [[Macintosh]] version by [[Feral Interactive]] won a [[Bafta]] for the best simulation game of 2006 at the [[Bafta]] games awards. The Macintosh version added a number of additional features which aren't available in the original PC release, including [[iPod]] &amp; [[High-definition video|HD resolution video]] export modes, integration with [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[iLife]] applications such as [[iTunes]], [[iMovie]]HD and [[GarageBand]], and an extra bonus utility. The game was also nominated in the soundtrack category, although it did not win.

===Customization===
The game has been designed to be mod-able. Lionhead has stated that they might release the actual tools they used to create scenes (though no such thing has been seen yet), shortly after the release of the game, along with [[expansion pack]]s. Alongside this, unofficial mods are possible, leading to extra [[Theatrical property|prop]]s, sets, animations, scenes, and clothing designs.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.8eyedbaby.com&lt;/ref&gt; 8eyedbaby.com is one of the first and most popular modding sites for "The Movies".
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themovies3d.com&lt;/ref&gt; TheMovies3D.com originally went online as a small German modding site. But it quickly became one of the biggest and still active international modding communities for ''The Movies''. The outcome of this were some unofficial addons, HD export scripts and many unique mods.
Since even before the game's release, fans have been creating tools for the modification of meshes and costumes. In November 2007, The Movies Editor was released by [http://www.dcmodding.com DCMF], a tool which aims to make the task of creating new sets/costumes/props for The Movies possible for even the most non-technical of users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.lionhead.com/blogs/lh_formerhk_blog/archive/2007/11/20/2808508.aspx The Movies Editor – Released]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Movies'' website contains a section called the [http://movies.lionhead.com/propshop/ Propshop], which lets users purchase additional content using virtual credits, earned through other achievements online. The propshop was regularly updated with new props, sets and costumes up until recently. Lionhead has now subsequently closed down the propshop along with The Movies Online. ''The Movies'' has many virtual and other "Easter Eggs", undocumented features, unannounced features, unannounced content, oddities, [[glitches]] inside ''The Movies'' including all current EPs [[patch (computing)|patches]].

===Soundtrack===

The soundtrack for ''The Movies'' was composed by British film and television composer [[Daniel Pemberton]] with the orchestral elements recorded by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. The soundtrack is varied, containing the many different styles of music used in different genres of film, ranging from the silent film era to modern 20th century film composition. Many of the pieces by Pemberton are "tongue in cheek" homages to other notable cues from classic film scores. The limited Premiere Edition of ''The Movies'' included a 20 track official soundtrack, partitioned as an Audio CD on the bonus DVD and spanning 38 minutes. The soundtrack was met with mixed or average critical reaction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Other reviews by Dan Goldwasser |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=3959 |title=The Movies Soundtrack (2005) |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date=2005-12-20 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the film score used by the players to make their movies, in gameplay there is a [[radio station]] playing called '''KMVS'''.

At certain times newsworthy events will occur (and be read out on KMVS, but not by the current DJ; instead by real life TV and radio news anchor [[Tony Guida]]). There are two broadcasts for each event: a prediction, which usually occurs a couple of years before the actual event, and an actual bulletin. These generally shift the genre interests of the public when predicted and after occurring.

Although events can be read separately on the timeline, the KMVS broadcasts are typically parodies, gross understatements, or exaggerations of the event or opinions at the time regarding the event (for example, when the news broadcasts about the [[computer]] arrive, they state optimistically that by 2050 computers will be no bigger than a car and be able to store about 5000 words), and the various Red Scare broadcasts claim that communism is literally a [[virus|viral]] infection (a man is reported to catch it from a toilet manufactured in a communist country). The news extends into the "future" at least up to 2015, when it is reported that astronauts have landed on Mars and vandalised the landscape. There is an element of political [[satire]] within these broadcasts as well; the achievements and beliefs of countries opposed to America are usually mocked or condemned (Sputnik is "proven" to be a fake) by these broadcasters, whilst similar American policies are usually heartedly over-praised. Events such as the [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq WMD scare]] are also referenced.

==Release==
The game was released as a standard edition and a premiere edition, which contains additional content. ''[[The Movies: Stunts &amp; Effects]]'' is the only expansion pack for ''The Movies'' and was released in June 2006. It adds stunts, stunt actors, new sets and costumes to the game. The changes in gameplay include a freely movable camera position, the ability to hire stuntmen and overlay which can be used in players' films.
It won ''Best Simulation Game'' at the [[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA Video Games Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/2006/games/simulation |title=2006 Games Simulation &amp;#124; BAFTA Awards |publisher=Awards.bafta.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for best game at the [[Game Developers Choice Awards]].

==Reception==
By the end of 2005, ''The Movies'' had sold above 50,000 copies in the United Kingdom, a performance that [[Eurogamer]]'s Kristan Reed called "relatively minor".&lt;ref name=eurogamersales&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826234352/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_uksalespt3 | url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_uksalespt3 | title=2005 UK Sales Review | date=May 5, 2006 | author=Reed, Kristan | work=[[Eurogamer]] | archivedate=August 26, 2011 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game ultimately received a "Silver" sales award from the [[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]] (ELSPA),&lt;ref name=silverelspa&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221154943/http://www.elspa.com/?i=3942 |url=http://www.elspa.com:80/?i=3942 |title=ELSPA Sales Awards: Silver |work=[[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]] |archivedate=21 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the region.&lt;ref name=gamasutrasales&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918063107/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112220/ELSPA_Wii_Fit_Mario_Kart_Reach_Diamond_Status_In_UK.php |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112220/ELSPA_Wii_Fit_Mario_Kart_Reach_Diamond_Status_In_UK.php |title=ELSPA: ''Wii Fit'', ''Mario Kart'' Reach Diamond Status In UK | author=Caoili, Eric | date=November 26, 2008 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |archivedate=September 18, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editors of ''[[Computer Games Magazine]]'' presented ''The Movies'' with their 2005 "Best Utility" and "Best Original Music" awards.&lt;ref name=cgm15th&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[Computer Games Magazine]] | title=The Best (and Worst) of 2005; The 15th Annual ''Computer Games'' Awards |date=March 2006 | issue=184 | pages=42–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was a finalist for ''[[PC Gamer US]]''{{'}}s "Best Real-Time Strategy Game 2005" award, which ultimately went to ''[[Age of Empires III]]''.&lt;ref name=pcgamerusawards2005&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 2006 | title=The Twelfth Annual ''PC Gamer'' Awards | volume=13 | number=3 | pages=33–36, 38, 40–42, 44 | journal=[[PC Gamer US]] | author=Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''The Movies'' has been used often in [[machinima]] videos. Machinima is film making within a real-time, 3D virtual environment – often using 3D video-game technologies – using real-world film making techniques applied within an interactive virtual space where characters and events can be either controlled by humans, scripts or artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070812024307/http://www.machinima.com/channel/view&amp;id=2 Machinima.com – The Movies Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
==History==
Developed from 2002&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20020601194412/http://www.lionhead.com/themovies/&lt;/ref&gt; to 2005,&lt;ref&gt;http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-movies/513182p1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-movies/545656p1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-movies/532487p1.html&lt;/ref&gt; it was released on 8 November 2005 in North America, and 11 November 2005 in Europe after reaching [[Release to manufacturing|gold]] status on 8 October 2005. The game allows players to take the role of a [[Hollywood]] [[film]] mogul, running a studio and creating films. Much has been made about the film-making aspect of the game, as it allows players to easily create viewable works or [[machinima]].  
===Expansion===
An expansion pack, ''[[The Movies: Stunts &amp; Effects]]'', was released in June 2006. It adds new features including [[stunt]]s, [[stunt double]]s, [[special effect]]s, and custom camera angles. The Mac [[Porting of video games|port]] of the game was published by [[Feral Interactive]] and developed by [[Robosoft Technologies]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

'''The Trade Delegation (Representation) of the Russian Federation in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''' is a state institution ensuring foreign economic interests of the [[Russian Federation]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is an integral part of the [[Embassy of Russia, London|Diplomatic Mission of the Russian Federation]] in the UK. The Delegation acts under political guidance of the Ambassador of the Russian Federation in the United Kingdom. General governance of its activities is carried out by the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;http://economy.gov.ru/minec/activity/sections/foreignEconomicActivity/department&lt;/ref&gt;
The Trade Delegation was established on 24 February 1920.

By now the word “Delegation” still appears in the official English name for the Russian Trade Representative’s Office to the UK.
The Trade Delegation is headed by the Trade Representative who is appointed by the Government of the Russian Federation upon recommendation by the Ministry of Economic Development agreed with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.

== Main goals and objectives of the Russian Trade Delegation ==

'''Town &amp; Country Surf Designs''' (also known as T&amp;C Surf) is a world recognized manufacturer of [[surfboard]]s. T&amp;C's origins began in 1971 with a single store founded by [[Craig Sugihara]] in [[Pearl City, Hawaii]]. The company soon expanded into a full line of [[surfwear]] and [[surfing]] accessories and now has retail shops throughout the world in countries such as [[Japan]], [[Australia]], and [[Peru]].

In 1976, [[Tak Kawahara]] became the co-owner of Town &amp; Country (T&amp;C) Surfboard’s wholesale division and developed the apparel brand, which became one of the top five in the beach and active surfwear industry.  During his tenure at T&amp;C he expanded the brand’s product line by introducing surf watches, beach sandals and school stationery accessories, all of which were the first of its kind in the surfing industry. T&amp;C was also the first surf label to take production off shore. Tak continues to consult with many surf companies on product design, production processes, marketing, sales and operations. 

In the 1980s, T&amp;C became famous for their shirt designs featuring "Da' Boys," surfing cartoon characters designed by [[Steve Nazar]]. The most famous of these was Thrilla Gorilla, a surfing anthropomorphic gorilla. 
In 1988, [[LJN]] released a game on the [[NES]] based on the store, entitled ''[[Town &amp; Country Surf Designs: Wood &amp; Water Rage]]''. A sequel focusing on Thrilla Gorilla (''[[Town &amp; Country II: Thrilla's Surfari]]'') followed in 1992, before the character designs disappeared until re-launching as part of the [http://www.thrillakrewgear.com/ Thrilla Krew] brand in 2016.

'''Vinci''' is a Portuguese-based project for a brand of cars (possibly owned by a development stage company called Retroconcept or Retrosport (both names are referred to in sources)).

In 2007 the brand announced the first Portuguese sports car.  Its design was inspired by the cars of the 60's and 70's.  The car is equipped with the [[GM LS engine]], the same as the [[Chevrolet Corvette]].  The rest of car was claimed to be a product of Portuguese engineering (serious doubts on this matter are expressed on the [[:pt:Vinci (empresa)|Portuguese Wikipedia page for the car]]), produced with the experience of working for other brands like [[UMM (União Metalo-Mecânica)|UMM]] and [[Bravia (vehicles)|Bravia]] (builder of the [[Bravia Chaimite|Chaimite]] series of armoured vehicles).  The brand, Vinci, is also developing other models like Vinci Sport, Vinci TT (from the Portuguese "Todo-o-terreno" All Terrain) and Vinci Eco (a 'nature-friendly' car). The company wants to forget less successful Portuguese experiences in the automotive industry, such as UMM and Bravia, and instead follow the example of [[AJP Motos|AJP]], a Portuguese builder of motorcycles.

Some sources suggest that [http://www.ceiia.com/ CEIIA] (Centro para a Excelência e Inovação na Indústria Automóvel), from [[Maia Municipality]], was involved in the original development of the car, although the CEIIA site contained no obvious reference to the car in April 2009.

On 2009-04-19 the Brazilian TV program [http://tvautoesporte.globo.com/ Auto Esporte] ran an article on the car. The program reported that the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110831135736/http://turismo.maiadigital.pt/ocm5/motor/display_texto.asp?pagina=automuseudamaia200411234281135&amp;bd=turismo Auto Museu Da Maia], a car museum in the town of Maia, near the city of Porto, Portugal, had some role in the development of the car.

'''William Alexander''' (December 1844 – 27 May 1924) was an Australian businessman and politician who was a member of the [[Western Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] of [[Western Australia]] from 1895 to 1898.

Alexander was born in [[Dunnichen]], [[Forfarshire]], Scotland. He came to Australia in 1866, and initially lived in [[Queensland]], where he had interests in various mining ventures. In 1873, Alexander set up in [[Toowoomba]] as a storekeeper and [[draper]]. Having made two previous visits, he moved to Western Australia permanently in 1891, and settled in [[Geraldton]], where he had a store. Alexander was elected to parliament at an 1895 Legislative Council by-election for [[Central Province (Western Australia)|Central Province]], which had been necessitated by the death of [[Ernest Henty]]. He served out the remainder of Henty's term, but did not recontest his seat at the 1898 election. After leaving parliament, Alexander ran a drapery in [[Kalgoorlie]] until 1903, and thereafter concentrated on his mining investments. He returned to Queensland in 1913, and died there in 1924, aged 79.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/parliament/library/MPHistoricalData.nsf/(Lookup)/7F9BC7837D6E1CF3482577E50028A4FB?OpenDocument William Alexander] – Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia.
