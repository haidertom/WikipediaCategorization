'''''Aerobiz Supersonic''''', known as {{nihongo|'''''Air Management II: Kōkū Ō wo Mezase'''''|エアーマネジメントII 航空王をめざせ}} in Japan, is a business simulation [[video game]] released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Koei]] in North America in August 1994. It was later ported to the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]]. It is a sequel to Koei's previous [[airline]] simulation game, ''[[Aerobiz]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Aerobiz Supersonic-20101226-172426.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of a game of Aerobiz Supersonic, taking place in 1957.]]
In the game, which is essentially the same as its predecessor, the player is the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of a start-up international airline. The player competes with three other such companies (either [[Game artificial intelligence|AI]]-controlled or other players) for dominance in the worldwide travel industry. Such dominance is obtained by purchasing slots in various airports around the world, and flying routes to and from those slots. Once a route is created, the player has control of what type of planes fly the route, the price of airfare, and numerous other variables.

The game includes numerous historical events that can help or hinder airline performance. Four different eras of play available for the player to choose. They include 1955–1975 (which depicts the dawn of jet airplanes), 1970–1990 (which depicts a period of instability, oil crises, and the end of the [[Cold War]]), 1985–2005 (which depicts the present day of economic prosperity and relative stable peace), and 2000–2020 (which depicts the replacement of jet planes with supersonic airplanes, the European Union extending to Russia, and countries trying to get airlines to fund alternative fuel research). This futuristic era was chosen by SG and Koei to be illustrated by San Francisco illustrator Marc Ericksen for the packaging art, showing two executives conferring over a holographic aircraft design in a futuristic airline terminal.

Airlines must be able to achieve the goals assigned to them within 20 years; only one airline can achieve this victory with no draws permitted. If none of the airlines can achieve the goal, then all airlines lose because [[stalemate]]s are not permitted at the end of the game. [[Tiebreaker]]s are also not permitted because games are not usually designed to be in ties at the end of the 20-year contest. In the rare instance that all airlines go bankrupt simultaneously, then all airlines would also lose.

==Events==

===Historical events===
The simulation includes numerous historical events, including:

*[[Summer Olympic Games]] accurate up to [[Sydney 2000]]. (Note, the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] were in Montreal, although the game has them in Toronto as Montreal is not in the game. However, some events of these games were held in Toronto, and in other cities throughout Eastern Canada.)
*The downfall of [[colonialism]]
*The secession of [[Singapore]] from [[Malaysia]]
*The Rise of [[Fidel Castro]] (1959)
*[[Suez Crisis]]
*[[Vietnam War]]
*[[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]
*[[Yom Kippur War]]
*[[1973 oil crisis|An international oil crisis]] (1973)
*[[Iran–Iraq War]]
*[[Operation Desert Storm]]
*[[Perestroika]]
*Destruction of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the reunification of [[Germany]]
*[[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|Fall of the Soviet Union]]
*Return of [[Hong Kong]] to the [[People's Republic of China]]
*Growth of the [[European Union]]

===Hypothetical events===
The simulation also includes hypothetical events, including:

* After 2000, the Summer Olympics start occurring in random selection of the game's major cities.
*[[Ukraine]] joining the [[European Union]] at JUL 1998.
*[[Belarus]] joining the [[European Union]] at JAN 1999.
*[[Switzerland]] joining the [[European Union]] at JUL 2003.
*[[Russia]] joining the [[European Union]] at OCT 2005.
*[[Civil war]] by random cities and random times (Although in the game, they often occur in Lima, Peru, which had a civil war in real time)
*The introduction and quick [[obsolescence]] of [[supersonic transport|commercial supersonic aircraft]] (2007–2016)
*Global [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil crisis]] in the mid-late 2010s
*The nations of the world asking the airlines for money to find alternatives to [[fossil fuel]]s
*Volcanic eruption in New Zealand
*Floods in Thailand&lt;ref&gt;[http://flood.firetree.net/?ll=13.7314,97.9651&amp;z=10 Hypothetical flooding of Thailand] at flood.firetree.net&lt;/ref&gt; and Vancouver, Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://flood.firetree.net/?ll=49.2571,-123.1403&amp;z=8 Hypothetical flooding of Vancouver, Canada] at flood.firetree.net&lt;/ref&gt; (both events corresponding with global climate change)
*Earthquake in [[Sao Paulo]]

==Major players in the game==

===Eastern Bloc===
From the beginning of the game until 1986, the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries are stuck with tense relations with [[Western Europe]], [[North America]], and countries in the [[British Commonwealth]]. However, they have normal-excellent relations with [[Africa]]n countries, [[Middle East]]ern countries, countries in [[Central America]], [[South America]], and some [[Asia]]n countries. Airplanes from Eastern Bloc countries are small inefficient [[gas-guzzler]]s that can only do medium-range flights as their longest routes. After 1986, airlines from these countries can purchase more efficient [[Boeing]] planes from the United States of America. These airplanes become even cheaper when one of the Eastern European countries joins the European Union.

Russia enters in EU in 2005, so it will be much cheaper to buy Airbus planes. The latest models from [[Ilyushin]] and [[Tupolev]] are very cheap and a little bit more efficient than the previous models, so it can give the player an advantage when it comes to maximizing his profits.

===Western Bloc===

====Western Europe====
With normal-tense relations with Eastern European countries until around 1985, airlines that are headquartered in Western European countries must either purchase cheap airplanes from the "local" market or order slightly more expensive planes from the United States of America. After Perestroika, they can purchase from any plane manufacturing company. Joining the European Union in the mid-1990s makes airplanes cheaper or more expensive depending on relations with the United States prior to the founding of the EU.

====North America====
North America's situation in the game is identical to the situation found by Western European countries. The only difference is that planes from American companies are cheaper than planes from Western European countries. Since North America has a higher tourism rating than Europe until the 1990s, North America–based airlines can afford more airplanes and routes for a better risk-profit potential than European-based airlines.

===People's Republic of China and other countries===
Normalized relations with both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. allows all planes to be purchased by airlines headquartered in the People's Republic of China regardless of the year. However, improving relations with either country will reduce the price of the airplanes - giving the player a choice of acquiring either inefficient Soviet-made planes or efficient American-made planes at bargain prices. Like the People's Republic of China, countries that are not strongly affiliated with either [[NATO]] or [[Warsaw Pact]] may purchase from any manufacturer as long as relations are not tense (red). Relations with the country must be at least normal (yellow) in order to purchase airplanes from that country.

==Reception==
''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave the Super NES version a 7.2 out of 10, deeming it "a different type of game - one geared more toward strategy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Aerobiz Supersonic|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=59|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=June 1994|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gave the later Genesis version a 6.6 out of 10 and opined that "As always, Koei manages to make a unique strategy game that becomes very entertaining when you really get into it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Aerobiz Supersonic|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=66 |publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=January 1995|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the Genesis version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that "sim fans are sure to be pleased with the level of detail."&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=7|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=July 1995|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Auckland Chamber of Commerce''' (The Chamber) is a [[New Zealand]] [[business network]] representing the interests of [[business]]es in the [[Auckland]] region.  It is a [[Non-Governmental Organisation]]. Founded in 1856, the Chamber is intended to "inspire and influence business vitality".&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandchamber.co.nz/About-Us.aspx |title=About Us |publisher=aucklandchamber.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the Chamber claims a membership of 12,000 business owners.

==History==
The Chamber was founded in 1856, at a meeting of merchants on 24 January,&lt;ref name="McLintock1966"&gt;{{cite book|last=McLintock|first=Alexander H.|title=An encyclopaedia of New Zealand|year=1966|publisher=R. E. Owen, Govt. printer|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a period of [[economic depression]]. Active in the 1860s, the Chamber floundered somewhat before an 1869 reorganisation that opened its ranks to a wider variety of merchants, on an annual subscription basis.&lt;ref name="McLintock1966"/&gt;

Following its inception it focused on issues ranging from remedying trade abuses and obtaining adequate facilities for businesses, to standardization of grain weights and simplifying the customs tariff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8335993 |title=A Century of Auckland Commerce: 1856–1956; A History of the Auckland Chamber of Commerce. |publisher=journals.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core Activities==
The Chamber hosts events and training courses. As at 14 May 2013, courses offered included 'Organisational Mentoring', 'Customer Service Skills', 'Accounting for Non-Accountants' and 'Successful Business Communication'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chamber.federationmedia.com/Events.aspx |title=Events |publisher=aucklandchamber.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chamber also maintains a media presence predominantly through its Chief Executive Officer, Michael Barnett, who has commented on topics including Auckland Transport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10883389 |title=Leadership can unlock the roadblocks |publisher=nzherald.co.nz |date= 2013-05-14|accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water Charges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10878745 |title=Water charges cause ripples |publisher=nzherald.co.nz |date= 2013-04-21|accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Council Rates &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/small-business/8666382/Rate-increase-threatens-business |title=Rate increase threatens business |publisher=stuff.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Franz Bally''' (October 24, 1821, [[Schönenwerd]] – August 5, 1899) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] businessman who founded the [[Bally Shoe]] company in 1851.

Carl Franz Bally (Fig. 1) was the 11th of 14 children of Peter Bally (1783–1849) and Anna Maria Herzog. His grandfather, Franz Ulrich Bohli (1748–1810) immigrated as a young man from [[Vorarlberg]] in west part of [[Austria]] to [[Schönenwerd]] in the [[Canton of Solothurn]] in [[Switzerland]], working as a mason for a manufacturer of silk ribbons. Later, he established his own silk ribbon manufacture in that town, relying mostly on work outsourced to local weavers. His sons Peter and Niklaus continued and enlarged the firm producing also suspenders and elastic fabrics and building an extensive second facility in [[Säckingen]], ([[Germany]]). Carl Franz, one of the ten sons of Peter, entered the business at age 17 concentrating on the newest products. During a business trip to Paris he visited a shoe manufacturing plant and began to think about producing shoes, founding his own small facility in 1851. After initial difficulties the business began to flourish and in the early 1870s he established sales organizations in [[Buenos Aires]] ([[Argentina]]), [[Montevideo]], ([[Uruguay]]) and [[Paris]], ([[France]]). By 1880 Bally had transformed Schönenwerd from a sleepy farm village to an industrial center offering employment to hundreds of workers (Fig. 2) from the town  and surrounding towns in what developed into one of the world’s leading shoe manufacturing enterprises.

Carl Franz was a progressive liberal, pushing forward many new ideas in the town, now taken for granted. He and his wife opened a special education school for girls, a kindergarten, an old-age home and a public swimming facility at the bordering Aare river. He built homes for workers and converted a flood region of the Aare in town into a luscious, publicly accessible park. He fought battles to break the long established bond between school education and religion (Schönenwerd is the location of a small monastery originally built around 600 AD) and supported the establishment of improved schooling facilities for grade schools and a regional middle school. To fill the need for workers he opened small manufacturing facilities in several towns in the surrounding region. He also served as a lawmaker in various local and federal positions. Carl Franz and his wife Cecile Rychner (1823–1893) had two sons, Eduard and Arthur, who continued their father’s business under the name C. F. Bally Söhne. Around the turn of the century, the firm employed some 3200 workers and produced over two million pairs of shoes a year. Carl Franz Bally died in [[Basel]] in 1899.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1471">A '''condition precedent''' is an event or state of affairs that is required before something else will occur. In [[contract law]], a condition precedent is an event which must occur, unless its non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due, i.e., before any contractual duty exists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] § 224&lt;/ref&gt;

In estate and trust law, it is a provision in a will or trust that prevents the vesting of a gift or bequest until something occurs or fails to occur, e.g. the attainment of a certain age or the predecease of another person. For comparison, a [[condition subsequent]] brings a duty to an end whereas a condition precedent initiates a duty.

In computing, a [[while loop]] sets the truth of a statement as a condition precedent for the execution of a given subroutine or other code segment.  By contrast, a [[do while loop]] provides for the action's ongoing execution unless a given condition is determined to be false, ''i.e.'', provides for that action's execution subject to defeasance by the condition's falsity, which falsity (''i.e.'', the truth of the condition's negation) is set as a [[condition subsequent]].

Following the department's dissolution, it no longer has ministers responsible.&lt;ref name="cabinetoffice1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-innovation-skills#ministers |title=Department for Business, Innovation and Skills |publisher=www.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Permanent Secretary]] was [[Martin Donnelly (UK civil servant)|Sir Martin Donnelly]].

==Responsibilities==
Some policies apply to [[England]] alone due to [[devolution]], while others are not devolved and therefore apply to other nations of the [[United Kingdom]]. The department was responsible for [[United Kingdom Government|UK Government]] policy in the following areas:&lt;ref name="cabinetoffice1"/&gt;
* [[business]] regulation and support
* [[company law]]
* [[Competition (economics)|competition]]
* [[consumer affairs]]
* [[corporate governance]]
* [[employment relations]]
* [[export]] licensing
* [[further education]]
* [[higher education]]
* [[innovation]]
* [[insolvency]]
* [[intellectual property]]
* [[outer space]]
* [[post office|postal]] affairs
* regional and local [[economic development]]
* [[science]] and [[research]]
* [[skills]]
* [[trade]]
* [[training]]

[[File:-Possible Productions knotwork- by Steve Ball.svg|right|thumb|alt=A knotwork, a design often associated with Celtic knots. The outer design is a circle, surrounding what appears to be a triangle surrounded by a Celtic knot at first glance. Closer inspection of the triangle reveals that it is in fact an organic part of the inner knot, which seems to have two continuous segments linked by knots. At first glance, the knotwork appears to be symmetric; closer inspection reveals that the right-hand knots seem to be the reverse of the left-hand knots and there are small differences among the "twin knots"; the right and left hands of the design have variations, much as our right and left hands have subtle distinctions. The design is not symmetric with respect to 120 degree rotations: The center of the pseudo-triangle is above the center of the surrounding circle, but visual balance is maintained by extra knots below the lower pseudo–line-segment. The background is crimson.|Discipline Global Mobile logo, whose copyright, per the company's philosophy regarding creative works, was maintained by its designer rather than the company.]]

'''Discipline Global Mobile''' ('''DGM''', or '''Discipline&amp;nbsp;GM''') is an [[independent record label]] founded in 1992 by [[Robert Fripp]] (best known as guitarist and main composer for the band [[King Crimson]]) and producer/online content developer [[David Singleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Wire|date=Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; DGM has released solo music by Fripp as well as work by various affiliated musicians and bands including King Crimson, The Vicar, the [[California Guitar Trio]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=About DGMLive|title=Statement at foot of homepage|url=http://www.dgmlive.com/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The label has offices in [[Salisbury]], [[England]], and [[Los Angeles]], [[California]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

DGM has aimed to be "a model of ethical business in an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed," according to Fripp.&lt;ref name="FrippInBruns"&gt;{{harvtxt|Fripp|1998|p=9}} according to {{harvtxt|Bruns|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its policy is that its artists retain all copyrights; consequently, even DGM's corporate logo is owned by its designer.&lt;ref name="Fripp98a"/&gt; The label was an early adopter of the digital download system. DGM's aims have been hailed as "exemplary", and the label has been credited with having expanded "the possibilities of experimental music" and having improved the environment for King Crimson.&lt;ref name="Martin269"/&gt;

The DGM label name is derived from the title of a 1981 King Crimson album (''[[Discipline (King Crimson album)|Discipline]]'') and from the name of Singleton’s previous recording business (The Mobile). The label logo also partly reflects the artwork for the ''Discipline'' album (featuring a new but similar knotwork commissioned from the artist Steve Ball).&lt;ref&gt;Discipline Global Mobile - Ball Diary 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and business aims==

[[File:Robert Fripp.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Robert&amp;nbsp;Fripp ergonomically plays electric&amp;nbsp;guitar while sitting in a posture developed through years of application of the Alexander Technique.|The founder of Discipline Global Mobile, [[Robert Fripp]] has called music "an industry founded  on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed".&lt;ref name="FrippInBruns"/&gt;]]

Having been a professional musician since the mid-'60s (and the guitarist for King Crimson since 1969), by the late 1980s [[Robert Fripp]] found himself in conflict with his longtime record label [[E.G.&amp;nbsp;Records]] and management company (E.G. Management) over royalties allegedly owed by E.G. to himself and to other band members. During this period, Fripp met and began working with producer and online developer [[David Singleton]], initially on a [[Guitar Craft]] tour in 1990 and subsequently on the production of two albums - the League of Crafty Guitarists' ''Show of Hands'' and the eponymous album for the Fripp-and-[[Toyah Willcox|Toyah]]-fronted group [[Sunday All Over the World]]. Fripp and Singleton's production partnership was sealed by work on two King Crimson boxed sets (1991's ''Frame by Frame'' and 1992's ''The Great Deceiver'') and continues to the present day under the name of TonProb.

After seven years, Fripp and E.G. reached a settlement&lt;ref name="Bambarger86"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvtxt|Bruford|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=sv&amp;id=R4iW0tsxLqQC&amp;dq=Bill+Bruford&amp;q=EG%2C%20Virgin%2C%20EMI%2C%20Fripp&amp;f=false#v=snippet&amp;q=EG%2C%20Virgin%2C%20EMI%2C%20Fripp&amp;f=false  142]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but the experience left Fripp determined to take control of his own work and financial affairs wherever possible. As part of this aim, he founded Discipline&amp;nbsp;Global&amp;nbsp;Mobile (DGM) as an independent music&amp;nbsp;label in 1992, as a fifty-fifty partnership with Singleton.&lt;ref name="FT2012"&gt;{{cite news|date=3 August 2012|time=7:27 pm|title=The day the music died: In a rare interview, prog&amp;nbsp;rock legend Robert&amp;nbsp;Fripp speaks about standing up to the music industry|first=Ludovic|last=Hunter-Tilney|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/f588e100-d7ee-11e1-9980-00144feabdc0.html#axzz22cThb6xb|newspaper=The Financial Times|ref=harv|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bambarger"&gt;,

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atton01"&gt;
{{harvtxt|Atton|2001|p=39}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The phrasing "Aims" (c.f.,"THE AIM" of a man with a plan) is characteristically Frippian, and so is used rather than "goals". --&gt;
DGM's [[mission statement]] consists of five "DGM business&amp;nbsp;aims", as follows:
* "The first aim of DGM is to help bring music into the world which would otherwise be unlikely to do so, or under conditions prejudicial to the music and / or musicians.",&lt;ref name="DGMAims"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dgmlive.com/about.htm |title=About DGM: DGM business aims |publisher=Discipline Global Mobile |ref=harv |access-date=25 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302061103/http://www.dgmlive.com/about.htm |archive-date=2 March 2012 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The second aim of DGM is to operate in the market place, while being free of the values of the market place."
* "The third aim of DGM is to help the artists and staff of DGM achieve what they wish for themselves."
* "The fourth aim of DGM is to find its audience."
* "The fifth aim of DGM is to be a model of ethical business in an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed."&lt;ref name="FrippInBruns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bambarger86" &gt;{{harvtxt|Bambarger|1998|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DGMAims"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atton04"&gt;{{harvtxt|Atton|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fZa_x8DEP_oC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22Discipline+Global+Mobile%22&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Discipline%20Global%20Mobile%22%2C%20copyright&amp;f=false Chapter&amp;nbsp;6 "Fan culture and the Internet: Musicians and fanzines", p.&amp;nbsp;153]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Paul Jones - 2010.jpg|left|thumb|alt=John Paul Jones plays bass guitar|Formerly the bass guitarist of Led Zeppelin, [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John&amp;nbsp;Paul Jones]] has recorded albums with DGM without signing a contract, stating that the relationship "is pure trust".&lt;ref name="Shepherd"/&gt;]]
These aims were called "exemplary" by Bill Martin, who wrote that "Fripp has done something very important for the possibilities of experimental music" in creating DGM, and that DGM "has played a major role in creating favorable conditions for" King Crimson.&lt;ref name="Martin269"&gt;{{harvtxt|Martin|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=APmUFlgm0R4C&amp;dq=Prog+Rock&amp;q=Discipline+Global+Mobile#v=snippet&amp;q=Discipline%20Global%20Mobile&amp;f=false 269]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since at least the early 1960s, the recording industry has required artists to sign&amp;nbsp;over [[copyright]]s and [[moral right (copyright)|moral right]]s to their cover&amp;nbsp;art, music, and lyrics. DGM rejects this practice, and since its 1992 founding has maintained its policy that its artists retain the copyrights and the moral&amp;nbsp;rights to their works,&lt;ref name="Bambarger86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atton04"/&gt; be those works musical or visual art.&lt;ref name="Atton01"/&gt;  Fripp wrote, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The phonographic copyright in these performances is operated by Discipline Global Mobile on behalf of the artists, with whom it resides, contrary to common practice in the record industry. Discipline accepts no reason for artists to assign the copyright interests in their work to either record company or management by virtue of a 'common practice' which was always questionable, often improper, and is now indefensible."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kozar|2012|loc=[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/150412-robert-fripp-an-appreciation/P1 "Fripp's aim was to move his music in new directions that others did not always understand", p.&amp;nbsp;2]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This extends even to DGM's [[Celtic knot|knotwork]] corporate logo, the copyright of which is owned not by the company, but by its designer,&lt;ref name="Fripp98a" &gt;{{harvtxt|Fripp|1998a|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steve&amp;nbsp;Ball.&lt;ref name="BallDiary" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.steveball.com/words/archive/2001/2001-10-01.htm#saturday |first=Steve |last=Ball |title=Saturday September 29 |department=Steve Ball diary |date=1 October 2001 |website=Steve Ball |ref=harv  |access-date=25 March 2012}}&lt;p&gt;{{harvtxt|Ball|2001}} cites as the original inspiration for the first cover for ''Discipline''  a design by {{harvtxt|Bain|1973|loc=[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Celtic-Art-Methods-Construction-Instruction/dp/0486229238/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332253259&amp;sr=1-1#reader_0486229238 "Pictish knotwork borders from Gospels of Lindifarme and Book of Kells", p.&amp;nbsp;40]}}: {{cite book|first=George|last=Bain|authorlink=George Bain (artist)|title=Celtic&amp;nbsp;art: The methods of construction |year=1973|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|location=Mineola, New&amp;nbsp;York|isbn=0-486-22923-8|origyear=1951|edition=Reprint of Constable&amp;nbsp;Press|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ball" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.steveball.com/words/presskit/#history |first=Steve |last=Ball |title=Steve Ball extended history |department=Steve Ball Roadshow |website=Steve Ball |ref=harv |date=21 May 2009 |access-date=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fripp wrote, "Steve Ball is ... designer of the [League of Crafty Guitarists] &amp; Discipline knotworks (among others &amp;&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;which he holds the copyright)." {{cite book|first=Robert|last=Fripp|title=Robert&amp;nbsp;Fripp's diary|chapter=Sunday, 22nd August 1999|date=August 1999|url=http://www.dgmlive.com|publisher=Discipline Global Mobile|ref=harv|accessdate=25 March 2012|authorlink=Robert Fripp}}

==Mail-order and on-line services==

According to a 1998 profile in ''Billboard'' magazine, Discipline Global Mobile had seven staff members in Salisbury, England, and three in Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="Bambarger"/&gt; DGM "is actually housed in a dull pebbledash building in a village near Salisbury, south-west England".&lt;ref name="FT2012"/&gt;

Its label&amp;nbsp;manager reported that the country with the largest market was Japan, where mail-orders accounted for only&amp;nbsp;10% of sales, but&amp;nbsp;50% of profits. In 1998, DGM was distributed in Japan by [[Pony Canyon]]; in the United Kingdom by [[Pinnacle Records|Pinnacle]];&lt;ref name="Bambarger"/&gt;  and in the United States by [[Rykodisc]].&lt;ref name="Bambarger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spellman"/&gt; Sound samples have been offered in addition to DGM's mail-order services.&lt;ref name="Bambarger"/&gt; Free downloads from DGM have strengthened the relations between artists and fans.&lt;ref name="Atton04"/&gt;

In 2012, DGM's site had the following introduction: "The aim of DGM is to connect music, musician and audience in  a way that supports the power of music, the integrity of the musician  and the needs of the audience. DGM&amp;nbsp;Live offers music  for download with photographs, diary&amp;nbsp;archives and audience&amp;nbsp;commentary for browsing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgmlive.com|title=Welcome to DGM&amp;nbsp;Live|publisher=Discipline Global Mobile|ref=harv|accessdate=25 March 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; DGM's successful transition to an age of digital distribution was called "unique" among music labels in 2009; this success was credited to its provision of legal, high-quality recordings of concerts, which effectively [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the [[Fence (criminal)|distribution-networks]] for [[Bootleg recording|unlicensed&amp;nbsp;recordings ("bootlegs")]] of concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous|first=''Belfast Telegraph''|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-20648653.html|title=Jam and the joys of music&amp;nbsp;distribution in today's world|newspaper=Belfast&amp;nbsp;Telegraph|publisher=Independent News and Media PLC|date=18 August 2009|accessdate=14 April 2012|ref=harv|id={{subscription required}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DGM publishes on-line diaries by Robert&amp;nbsp;Fripp, David Singleton and The Vicar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DGM Diaries|url=http://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A moderated forum allows fans to ask questions or to leave comments. Together, the diaries and the fan&amp;nbsp;forum display delayed&amp;nbsp;dialogs in which the artists and fans discuss diary-entries and forum-postings. Fripp's public writing of his diary has challenged his readers to become more active listeners and intelligent participants in performances of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Atton|2001|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with Grooveshark===

Fripp's diaries were internationally discussed following his publication of documents from a dispute with [[Grooveshark]], an on-line distributor of music. Fripp and Singleton complained that Grooveshark had been continuing to distribute his music, even after repeated [[notice and take down|takedown notice]]s and other complaints. Their correspondence with Grooveshark was published by ''Digital Music News''&lt;ref name="NYT14Dec11"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grooveshark lawsuit reveals details of Universal Music Group's allegations|first=Glenn|last=Peoples|date=21 November 2011|newspaper=Billboard.biz|publisher=Billboard.com|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/grooveshark-lawsuit-reveals-details-of-universal-1005549582.story|ref=harv|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DMN"&gt;{{cite journal|title=King&amp;nbsp;Crimson can't get their music off&amp;nbsp;of Grooveshark, so they cc'd ''Digital&amp;nbsp;Music&amp;nbsp;News''..|date=13 October 2011|ref=harv|url=http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/stories/101311cc|first=Paul ("paul")|last=Resnikoff|journal=[[Digital Music News]]|accessdate=30 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123003659/http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/stories/101311cc|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his DGM diary.&lt;ref name="Fripp" &gt;{{cite web|title=Robert&amp;nbsp;Fripp's diaries|url=http://www.dgmlive.com|ref=harv|date=12 August – 20 October 2011|publisher=Discipline Global Mobile, DMG Live!|first=Robert|last=Fripp|authorlink=Robert Fripp|accessdate=30 May 2012}}:

[[File:NIGU_Strain_tower.JPG|thumb|Electric power is transmitted on [[Overhead power line|overhead lines]] like these, and also on underground [[high-voltage cable]]s]]

The '''electric power industry''' covers the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]], [[electric power distribution|distribution]] and [[electricity retailing|sale]] of [[electric power]] to the general public and industry. The commercial distribution of electric power started in 1882 when electricity was produced for [[electric lighting]]. In the 1880s and 1890s, growing economic and safety concerns lead to the regulation of the industry. Once an expensive novelty limited to the most densely populated areas, reliable and economical electric power has become an essential aspect for normal operation of all elements of developed economies.

By the middle of the 20th century, electricity was seen as a "[[natural monopoly]]", only efficient if a restricted number of organizations participated in the market; in some areas, vertically-integrated companies provide all stages from generation to retail, and only governmental supervision regulated the rate of return and cost structure.

Since the 1990s, many regions have opened up the generation and distribution of electric power to provide a more competitive [[electricity market]]. While such markets can be abusively [[market manipulation|manipulated]] with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since [[return on investment|returns on investment]] are not as easy to find.

&lt;!--==Overview==--&gt;

==History==
[[File:Onderstation 110 kV Bolsward 01.JPG|thumb|right|Bolsward Substation, the Netherlands]]
[[File:Romanian electric power transmission lines.jpg|thumb|right|Transmission lines in [[Romania]] of which the nearest is a Phase Transposition Tower]]
Although electricity had been known to be produced as a result of the chemical reactions that take place in an [[electrolytic cell]] since [[Alessandro Volta]] developed the [[voltaic pile]] in 1800, its production by this means was, and still is, expensive. In 1831, [[Michael Faraday]] devised a machine that generated electricity from rotary motion, but it took almost 50 years for the technology to reach a commercially viable stage. In 1878, in the [[United States]], [[Thomas Edison]] developed and sold a commercially viable replacement for gas lighting and heating using locally generated and distributed [[direct current]] electricity.

The world's first public electricity supply was provided in late 1881, when the streets of the [[Surrey]] town of [[Godalming]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] were lit with electric light. This system was powered from a water wheel on the [[River Wey]], which drove a Siemens [[alternator]] that supplied a number of [[arc lamps]] within the town. This supply scheme also provided electricity to a number of shops and premises to light 34 incandescent Swan light bulbs.

Additionally, Robert Hammond, in December 1881, demonstrated the new electric light in the [[Sussex]] town of [[Brighton]] in the UK for a trial period. The ensuing success of this installation enabled Hammond to put this venture on both a commercial and legal footing, as a number of shop owners wanted to use the new electric light. Thus the Hammond Electricity Supply Co. was launched. Whilst the Godalming and Holborn Viaduct Schemes closed after a few years the Brighton Scheme continued on, and supply was in 1887 made available for 24 hours per day.

In early 1882, Edison opened the world’s first steam-powered electricity generating station at [[Holborn Viaduct]] in [[London]], where he had entered into an agreement with the City Corporation for a period of three months to provide street lighting. In time he had supplied a number of local consumers with electric light. The method of supply was direct current (DC).

It was later on in the year in September 1882 that Edison opened the [[Pearl Street Power Station]] in [[New York City]] and again it was a DC supply. It was for this reason that the generation was close to or on the consumer's premises as Edison had no means of voltage conversion. The voltage chosen for any electrical system is a compromise. For a given amount of power transmitted, increasing the [[voltage]] reduces the [[current (electricity)|current]] and therefore reduces the required wire thickness. Unfortunately it also increases the [[electric shock|danger from direct contact]] and increases the required [[Electrical insulation|insulation]] thickness. Furthermore, some load types were difficult or impossible to make work with higher voltages. The overall effect was that Edison's system required power stations to be within a mile of the consumers. While this could work in city centres, it would be unable to economically supply suburbs with power.&lt;ref name=shock&gt;[[Shock and Awe: The Story of Electricity]] - 2. The Age of Invention&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid to late 1880s saw the introduction of [[alternating current]] (AC) systems in Europe and the U.S. AC power had an advantage in that [[transformer]]s, installed at [[power station]]s, could be used to raise the voltage from the generators, and transformers at local [[Electrical substation|substations]] could reduce voltage to supply loads. Increasing the voltage reduced the current in the transmission and distribution lines and hence the size of conductors and distribution losses. This made it more economical to distribute power over long distances. Generators (such as [[hydroelectric]] sites) could be located far from the loads. AC and DC competed for a while, during a period called the [[War of Currents]]. The DC system was able to claim slightly greater safety, but this difference was not great enough to overwhelm the enormous technical and economic advantages of alternating current which eventually won out.&lt;ref name=shock/&gt;

[[File:Pylône haute tension.JPG|thumb|upright|left|High tension line in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada]]
The AC power system used today developed rapidly, backed by industrialists such as [[George Westinghouse]] with [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]], [[Galileo Ferraris]], [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]], [[Lucien Gaulard]], John Dixon Gibbs, [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens]], [[William Stanley, Jr.]], [[Nikola Tesla]], and others contributed to this field.

While [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) is increasingly being used to transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances or to connect adjacent [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]] power systems, the bulk of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing takes place using alternating current.

==Market reform==
The business model behind the electric utility has changed over the years playing a vital role in shaping the electricity industry into what it is today; from generation, transmission, distribution, to the final local retailing. This has occurred prominently since the reform of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales in 1990. In some countries, wholesale electricity markets operate, with [[electricity generation|generators]] and [[electricity retailing|retailers]] trading electricity in a similar manner to [[share (finance)|share]]s and [[currency]]. As [[deregulation]] continues further, utilities are driven to sell their [[asset]]s as the energy market follows in line with the gas market in use of the [[futures market|futures]] and [[spot market]]s and other financial arrangements. Even [[globalization]] with foreign purchases are taking place. One such purchase was when the [[United Kingdom|UK’s]] [[National Grid plc|National Grid]], the largest private electric utility in the world, bought [[New England]]’s electric system for $3.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/35-27154.htm SEC filing dated March 15, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 1997, seven of the 12 Regional Electric Companies (RECs) in England and Wales were bought by U.S. energy companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privatizationbarometer.com/PUB/RD/1/9/3/ElectricityChronology.pdf "Electricity companies in the United Kingdom - a brief chronology," Electricity Association, 30 June 2003 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Domestically, local electric and gas firms have merged operations as they saw the advantages of joint affiliation, especially with the reduced cost of joint-metering. Technological advances will take place in the competitive wholesale electric markets, such examples already being utilized include fuel cells used in [[space flight]]; aeroderivative [[gas turbine]]s used in [[jet aircraft]]; solar engineering and [[photovoltaic]] systems; off-shore wind farms; and the communication advances spawned by the digital world, particularly with microprocessing which aids in monitoring and dispatching.&lt;ref name="Distributed Generation"&gt;Borberly, A. and Kreider, J. F. (2001). Distributed Generation: The Power Paradigm for the New Millennium. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL. 400 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity is expected to see growing [[energy demand|demand]] in the future. The [[Information Revolution]] is highly reliant on electric power. Other growth areas include emerging new electricity-exclusive technologies, developments in space conditioning, [[industrial process]]es, and [[transportation]] (for example  [[hybrid vehicle]]s, [[locomotive]]s).&lt;ref name="Distributed Generation"/&gt;

== Organization ==
The electric power industry is commonly split up into four processes. These are [[electricity generation]] such as a [[power station]], [[electric power transmission]], [[electricity distribution]] and [[electricity retailing]]. In many countries, electric power companies own the whole infrastructure from generating stations to transmission and distribution infrastructure. For this reason, electric power is viewed as a [[natural monopoly]]. The industry is generally heavily [[regulation|regulated]], often with [[price control]]s and is frequently [[government-owned corporation|government-owned and operated]]. However, the modern trend has been growing deregulation in at least the latter two processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | url = https://www.en-powered.com/blog/the-bumpy-road-to-energy-deregulation  | title = The Bumpy Road to Energy Deregulation
  | publisher = EnPowered  | date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature and state of market reform of the [[electricity market]] often determines whether electric companies are able to be involved in just some of these processes without having to own the entire infrastructure, or citizens choose which components of infrastructure to patronise. In countries where electricity provision is deregulated, end-users of electricity may opt for more costly [[green electricity]].

==Generation==
[[File:Greater Cape Town 12.02.2007 16-41-31.2007 16-41-33.JPG|thumb|The [[Athlone Power Station]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]]]
{{Main|Electricity generation|Energy development}}
All forms of electricity generation have positive and negative aspects. [[Technology]] will probably eventually declare the most preferred forms, but in a [[market economy]], the options with less overall costs generally will be chosen above other sources. It is not clear yet which form can best meet the necessary energy demands or which process can best solve the demand for electricity.  There are indications that [[renewable energy]] and [[distributed generation]] are becoming more viable in economic terms.  A diverse mix of generation sources reduces the risks of electricity price spikes.

== World electricity industries ==
{{see also|List of electricity sectors}}
The organization of the electrical sector of a country or region varies depending on the economic system of the country.  In some places, all electric power generation, transmission and distribution is provided by a government controlled organization.  Other regions have private or investor-owned utility companies, city or municipally owned companies, [[Utility cooperative|cooperative]] companies owned by their own customers, or combinations. Generation, transmission and distribution may be offered by a single company, or different organizations may provide each of these portions of the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3913">'''Etsuro Nakamichi''' (died November 10, 1982) was a [[Japan]]ese engineer and founder of [[Nakamichi|Nakamichi Corporation]], a high-end [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] [[electronics]] company based in [[Tokyo]] in [[Japan]]. The company is most famous for its very high quality sounding cassette decks.

==Nakamichi's Life==

Etsuro Nakamichi founded Nakamichi Research in 1948. The brother of [[Niro Nakamichi]], he was an acoustic engineering officer in the [[Japan]]ese Navy doing sonar research.  After the war, he started Nakamichi Research by researching in electromagnetism, magnetic recording, acoustics and communications.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

The company he founded initially designed and developed portable radios, tone arms, speakers and communications equipment.  With the development of magnetic tape in 1951, Nakamichi felt his company could develop and refine the technology of recording heads. Within a few years his company developed an open-reel tape recorder, and in 1957 the Japanese public was introduced to an open reel recorder under the [[FIDELA]] brand name.

The company he founded subsequently went on to develop some of the world's best [[cassette deck]]s, including the world's first 3-head cassette deck. At one point in the mid 1960s the company manufactured tape decks for a number of foreign companies including [[Ampex]], [[Harman Kardon]] and [[Motorola]]. His company was also the first to license [[Dolby noise reduction system|Dolby-B Noise Reduction]] from [[Dolby|Dolby Laboratories]] in 1969 as well as [[High&amp;thinsp;Com]] and [[High-Com II]] from [[Telefunken]] in 1977&lt;!-- 1977-06-04 --&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schroeder"/&gt;

==Etsuro Nakamichi Foundation==

Shortly after Etsuro's passing, a foundation was made in his name.
The Foundation was dedicated to the promotion and encouragement of baroque and other fine forms of classical music, in accordance with Etsuro's will.

==Takeshi Nakamichi==

Etsuro's only son Takeshi Nakamichi joined Nakamichi Corporation in April 1972.  Takeshi is currently the President / Representative Director of Nakamichi Corporation.

==Niro Nakamichi==

After Etsuro Nakamichi founded [[Nakamichi]], his brother Niro joined and the two brothers worked to develop the company.
In 2001, Niro Nakamichi, designer of many of the historic tape decks, started a new company, Mechanical Research Corporation, which introduced ultra high end audio amplifiers, preamplifiers, and an integrated amplifier, called "engines". The products featured innovative designs and addressed issues of mechanical isolation, as well as presenting a unique appearance. Soon thereafter, however, the "engine" products were no longer promoted and a line of home theater products was introduced. The company was renamed Niro Corporation.

EASME was founded in 2003 as the Intelligent Energy Executive Agency (IEEA) and was renamed the European Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (EACI) in 2007, finally becoming EASME in 2014. It is responsible for managing specific programmes in the fields of [[energy]], the [[Natural environment|environment]], and [[business]] support. Its goal is to promote [[Sustainability|sustainable]] development while improving the competitiveness of [[Europe|European]] industries. 
While the Agency has its own [[legal identity]], it reports to several [[Directorate-General|Directorates-General]] of the European Commission, which remain responsible for programming and evaluation of the programmes.

==Organisation==

The Agency was created in 2003 to implement the [http://ec.europa.eu/energy/intelligent/index_en.html Intelligent Energy – Europe] (IEE) programme, which seeks to foster market conditions for the development of new energy technology &lt;ref&gt;Buchan, David. ''Energy and Climate Change: Europe at the Crossroads''. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; and is overseen by the European Commission's [[Directorate-General for Energy (European Commission)|Energy Directorate-General]]. IEEA was the first Executive Agency to be established.

In 2007, its mandate was extended to include the Commission's 2007-2013 [http://ec.europa.eu/cip/index_en.htm Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme 2007-2013] (CIP) and the [http://ec.europa.eu/transport/marcopolo/index_en.htm Marco Polo Programme] 2007-2013. It was also renamed EACI. In practice, this meant that the bulk of the Agency's work was split into three programmes from other DGs. It continued working on IEE. The agency then also became involved in the operations of the Eco-Innovation programme, which is overseen by DG Energy and provides assistance to pre-market environmental products. It also handled parts of the Marco Polo programme, which works to shift road haulage to rail and water transport, and was managed by DG Mobility and Transport.

In 2014, the agency changed its name to EASME, and it became responsible for other programmes in addition to IEE and Eco-Innovation.  It currently handles the operations of parts of [[Horizon 2020]], the EU Research and Innovation programme. EASME is also responsible for the majority of COSME, the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. It also operates part of LIFE, a financial instrument to support conservation and environmental actions in the EU. Finally, EASME will be involved in the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, which finances the EU's maritime and fishing policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eureporter.co/frontpage/2013/12/29/easme-executive-agency-for-smes/ "EASME: Executive Agency for SMEs: EU Reporter"], EU Reporter, 29 December 2013. Retrieved on February 5 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

EASME is a temporary agency, initially established for a period beginning on 1 January 2004 and ending on 31 December 2008. This period has been extended to 2024.

==EU Sustainable Energy Week (EUSEW)==

EASME works with the Energy Directorate-General to organise an annual event, the EU Sustainable Energy Week (EUSEW), which aims to bolster the development of renewables and greater energy efficiency through knowledge-sharing and the showcase of new ideas. EUSEW was first launched in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eusew.eu/ European Union - Sustainable Energy Week - HOME], Retrieved on February 5 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agency also helps give visibility to separate events through its Energy Days. These are organised by independent actors, and promoted by EASME.

A '''fraudulent conveyance''', or '''fraudulent transfer''', is an attempt to avoid debt by transferring money to another person or company. It is generally a civil, not a criminal matter, meaning that one cannot go to jail for it&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simkovic|first=Michael|date=2016-05-05|editor-last=Adler|editor-first=Barry|title=Making Fraudulent Transfer Law More Predictable|ssrn=2775920|series=Handbook on Bankruptcy|location=|publisher=Edward Elgar}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but in some jurisdictions there is potential for criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=Kevin|last2=Roy|first2=Julian|title=Fraud in the Canadian courts: An unwarranted expansion of the scope of the criminal sanction|journal=Canadian Business Law Journal|date=1998|volume=30|page=210|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/canadbus30&amp;div=18&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally treated as a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] cause of action that arises in [[debtor]]/[[creditor]] relations, particularly with reference to insolvent debtors.  The cause of action is typically brought by creditors or by [[bankruptcy]] [[trustees]]. 

==Overview==

A transfer will be fraudulent if made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor. Thus, if a transfer is made with the specific intent to avoid satisfying a specific liability, then actual intent is present. However, when a debtor prefers to pay one creditor instead of another, that is not a fraudulent transfer.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

There are two types of fraudulent transfer—''actual fraud'' and ''constructive fraud''. ''Actual fraud'' typically involves a debtor who as part of an [[asset protection|asset protection scheme]] donates his [[asset]]s, usually to an "insider", and leaves himself nothing to pay his creditors. ''Constructive fraud'' does not relate to fraudulent intent, but rather to the underlying economics of the transaction, if it took place for less than reasonably equivalent value at a time when the debtor was in a distressed financial condition. It is important to note that the actual distinction between the two different types of fraud is what the intentions of the debtor were. For example, where the debtor has simply been more generous than they should have or, in business transactions, the business should have ceased trading earlier to preserve capital (see generally, ''[[wrongful trading]]''). In a successful lawsuit, the [[plaintiff]] is entitled to recover the [[property]] transferred or its value from the transferee who has received a gift of the debtor's assets. Subsequent transferees may also be targeted, although they generally have stronger defenses than immediate transferees.&lt;ref name="LBO"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1632084 Leveraged Buyout Bankruptcies, the Problem of Hindsight Bias, and the Credit Default Swap Solution] Columbia Business Law Review, Vol. 2011, No. 1, p. 118, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Although fraudulent transfer law originally evolved in the context of a relatively simple agrarian economy, it is now widely used to challenge complex modern financial transactions such as [[leveraged buyouts]].&lt;ref name="LBO"/&gt;

Fraudulent transfer liability will often turn on the financial condition of the debtor at a particular point in the past. This analysis has historically required "dueling" expert testimony from both plaintiffs and defendants, which often led to an expensive process and inconsistent and unpredictable results.&lt;ref name=LBO/&gt; Courts and scholars have recently developed market-based approaches to try to make this analysis simpler, more consistent across cases, and more predictable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=LBO /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amicus"&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1632084 Amicus Brief, In re Lyondell Chemical Company bankruptcy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Badges of fraud===

Evidence of actual intent is rarely available to a creditor for it would require proof of someone’s inner thoughts. Because of that, creditors often have to rely on circumstantial evidence of fraud. To prove actual intent, the courts have developed “badges of fraud,” which, while not conclusive, are considered by the courts as circumstantial evidence of fraud:{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkland.com/siteFiles/kirkexp/publications/2402/Document1/Friedland_Trustees_Power.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*Becoming insolvent because of the transfer;
*Lack or inadequacy of consideration;
*Family, or insider relationship among parties;
*The retention of possession, benefits or use of property in question;
*The existence of the threat of litigation;
*The financial situation of the debtor at the time of transfer or after transfer;
*The existence or a cumulative effect of a series of transactions after the onset of debtor’s financial difficulties;
*The general chronology of events;
*The secrecy of the transaction in question; and
*Deviation from the usual method or course of business.

== Individual jurisdictions ==

===Australia===
Under [[Australian law]], if a transaction is entered into by a company which subsequently goes into liquidation, and the transaction was entered into by the company for the purpose of defeating, delaying or interfering with the rights of creditors during the 10 years prior to the relation back day, the courts may set it aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588fe.html|title=Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), section 588FE(5).|publisher=AUSTLII|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relation-back day is defined as either the day upon which the application for the company's winding-up was filed, or the date of the commencement of liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s9.html|title=Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), section 9.|publisher=AUSTLII|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In [[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American]] law, the doctrine of Fraudulent Conveyance traces its origins back to ''[[Twyne's Case]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1601) 3 Coke 80; 76 E.R. 809&lt;/ref&gt; in which an English farmer attempted to defraud his creditors by selling his sheep to a man named Twyne, while remaining in possession of the sheep, marking and shearing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Story|first1=William W.|title=A Treatise On The Law Of Contracts|date=1874|publisher=Little, Brown, And Company|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=1584776188|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1uReYUl-EwEC|accessdate=10 September 2017}} Fraud Upon Third Persons, Part 4, Sec 659.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[United States]], fraudulent conveyances or transfers&lt;ref&gt;The term ''fraudulent conveyance'' is included within the more general term ''fraudulent transfer'', as a ''conveyance'' is more descriptive of the transfer of title to real property. ''Fraudulent transfer'', however, includes all types of property and in the U.S., both are generally all governed by the same law. Therefore, the ''transfer'' will be used for the remainder of this section.&lt;/ref&gt; are governed by two sets of laws that are generally consistent. The first is the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act&lt;ref&gt;Promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) in 1984&lt;/ref&gt; ("UFTA") that has been adopted by all but a handful of the states.&lt;ref&gt;As of June, 2005, 43 states and the District of Columbia had adopted it. See NCCUSL website, [http://www.nccusl.org NCCUSL.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225032825/http://www.nccusl.org/ |date=2011-02-25 }} A complete copy can be found there or at [[South Texas College of Law]], [http://www.stcl.edu/rosin/ufta84.pdf STCL.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The second is found in the federal Bankruptcy Code.&lt;ref&gt;11 USC § 548. Much of the language of this section was adopted from the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, which is the predecessor of the UFTA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UFTA and the Bankruptcy Code both provide that a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor if the debtor made the transfer with the "actual intention to hinder, delay or defraud" any creditor of the debtor.

There are two kinds of fraudulent transfer. The archetypal example is the intentional fraudulent transfer. This is a transfer of property made by a debtor with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay his or her creditors.&lt;ref&gt;11 USC § 548(1); UFTA § 4(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The second is a constructive fraudulent transfer. Generally, this occurs when a debtor transfers property without receiving "reasonably equivalent value" in exchange for the transfer if the debtor is [[insolvent]]&lt;ref&gt;Under the Bankruptcy Code, insolvency exists when the sum of the debtor's debts exceeds the fair value of the debtor's property, with some exceptions. It is a balance sheet test. 11 USC § 101(32)&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of the transfer or becomes insolvent or is left with unreasonably small capital to continue in business as a result of the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;11 USC § 548(2); UFTA § 4(a)(2).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the intentional fraudulent transfer, no intention to defraud is necessary.

The Bankruptcy Code authorizes a bankruptcy trustee to recover the property transferred fraudulently&lt;ref&gt;This is done through the mechanism of avoidance of the transfer. 11 USC § 548.&lt;/ref&gt; for the benefit of all of the creditors of the debtor&lt;ref&gt;11 USC § 551&lt;/ref&gt; if the transfer took place within the relevant time frame.&lt;ref&gt;Within two years prior to the filing of bankruptcy - 11 USC § 548(a)&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer may also be recovered by a bankruptcy trustee under the UFTA too, if the state in which the transfer took place has adopted it and the transfer took place within its relevant time period.&lt;ref&gt;11 USC § 544(b) allows trustees to employ applicable state law to recover fraudulent transfers. The time period under the UFTA is in most cases four years before action is brought to recover. - UFTA § 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Creditors may also pursue remedies under the UFTA without the necessity of a bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;UFTA § 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Because this second type of transfer does not necessarily involve any actual wrongdoing, it is a common trap into which honest, but unwary debtors fall when filing a bankruptcy petition without an attorney. Particularly devastating and not uncommon is the situation in which an adult child takes title to the parents' home as a self-help [[probate]] measure (in order to avoid any confusion about who owns the home when the parents die and to avoid losing the home to a perceived threat from the state). Later, when the parents file a bankruptcy [[petition]] without recognizing the problem, they are unable to exempt the home from administration by the [[trustee]]. Unless they are able to pay the trustee an amount equal to the greater of the equity in the home or the sum of their debts (either directly to the Chapter 7 trustee or in payments to a Chapter 13 trustee), the trustee will sell their home to pay the creditors. In many cases, the parents would have been able to exempt the home and carry it safely through a bankruptcy if they had retained title or had recovered title before filing.

Even ''[[good faith]] purchasers'' of property who are the recipients of fraudulent transfers are only partially protected by the law in the U.S. Under the Bankruptcy Code, they get to keep the transfer to the extent of the value they gave for it, which means that they may lose much of the benefit of their bargain, even though they have no knowledge that the transfer to them is fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''Gill v. Maddalena'', 176 B.R. 551, 555, 558 (Bankr.C.D.Cal. 1994) (citing 11 USC § 548(c))&lt;/ref&gt;

Often fraudulent transfers occur in connection with [[leveraged buyouts]] (LBOs), where the [[management]]/owners of a failing [[corporation]] will cause the corporation to borrow on its assets and use the loan proceeds to purchase the management/owner's stock at highly inflated prices. The creditors of the corporation will then often have little or no unencumbered assets left upon which to collect their debts. LBOs can be either intentional or constructive fraudulent transfers, or both, depending on how obviously the corporation is financially impaired when the transaction is completed.&lt;ref name=LBO /&gt;

Although not all LBOs are fraudulent transfers, a red flag is raised when, after an LBO, the company then cannot pay its creditors.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Murphy v. Meritor Savings Bank'', 126 B.R. 370, 393, 413 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1991), in which an LBO left the corporation with insufficient cash to operate for longer than 10 days.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraudulent transfer liability will often turn on the financial condition of the debtor at a particular point in the past. This analysis has historically required "dueling" expert testimony from both plaintiffs and defendants, which often led to an expensive process and inconsistent and unpredictable results.&lt;ref name=LBO/&gt; U.S. courts and scholars have recently developed market-based approaches to try to streamline the analysis of constructive fraud, and judges are increasingly focusing on these market based measures.&lt;ref name=LBO /&gt;&lt;ref name=Amicus /&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{main article|Insolvency law of Switzerland}}
Under [[Switzerland|Swiss]] law, creditors who hold a certificate of unpaid debts against the debtor, or creditors in a bankruptcy, may file suit against [[Third party (law)|third parties]] who have benefited from [[unfair preference]]s or fraudulent transfers by the debtor prior to a seizure of assets or a [[bankruptcy]].

===South Korea===
Fraudulent conveyance or also known as action revocatoire or Pauline action (채권자취소권) is a right to preserve the debtor's property for all creditors by canceling an action by the debtor which reduces the debtor's property with a knowledge that the action harms the rights of the creditor. To exercise this right, the creditor must have a right against the debtor which is monetary and not unique and personal in nature. For instance, the right to demand to clear of the land of the building or the right to delivery the land involves land and unique and therefore not subject to Pauline action(Korean Supreme Court Decision February 10, 1995, 94da2534).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="77851">The '''history of [[coal]] mining''' goes back thousands of years. It became important in the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today. Compared to [[wood fuel]]s, coal yields a higher amount of energy per mass and can often be obtained in areas where wood is not readily available. Though it was used historically as a domestic fuel, coal is now used mostly in industry, especially in [[smelting]] and [[alloy]] production as well as [[electricity generation]]. Large-scale [[coal mining]] developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]], and coal provided the main source of [[primary energy]] for industry and transportation in industrial areas from the 18th century to the 1950s. Coal remains an important energy source because of its low cost and abundance compared to other fuels, particularly for electricity generation.&lt;ref name="Freese. 2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Freese|title=Coal: A Human History|url=https://www.amazon.com/Coal-Human-History-Barbara-Freese/dp/0142000981/|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=137|isbn=9780142000984}}(stating that, "[c]oal consumption doubled every decade between 1850 and 1890" and that by turn of the century, "coal was the unrivaled foundation of U.S. Power," providing "71 percent of the nation's energy."&lt;/ref&gt; Coal is also mined today on a large scale by [[open pit]] methods wherever the coal [[stratum|strata]] strike the surface or are relatively shallow. Britain developed the main techniques of underground coal mining from the late 18th century onward, with further progress being driven by 19th century and early 20th century progress.&lt;ref name="Freese. 2004"/&gt; However, oil and gas were increasingly used as alternatives from the 1860s onward.

By the late 20th century, coal was, for the most part, replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by [[petroleum|oil]], [[natural gas]] or electricity produced from oil, gas, [[nuclear power]] or [[renewable energy]] sources. By 2010, coal produced over a fourth of the world's energy, and by 2050 it is expected to produce about a third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Speight|title=An Introduction to Petroleum Technology, Economics, and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COUkeS1TDLUC&amp;pg=PT260|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=260–61|isbn=9781118192542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1890, coal mining has also been a political and social issue. Coal miners' labour and [[trade union]]s became powerful in many countries in the 20th century, and often, the miners were leaders of the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] or [[Socialist]] movements (as in Britain, Germany, Poland, Japan, Chile, Canada and the U.S.)&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Eley, ''Forging Democracy: The History of the Left in Europe, 1850-2000'' (2002); Frederic Meyers, ''European Coal Mining Unions: structure and function'' (1961) P. 86; Kazuo and Gordon (1997) p 48; [[Hajo Holborn]], ''History of Modern Germany'' (1959) p. 521; David Frank, ''J.

==Early history==

Early coal extraction was small-scale, the coal lying either on the surface, or very close to it. Typical methods for extraction included [[drift mining]] and [[bell pit]]s. As well as drift mines, small scale [[shaft mining]] was used. This took the form of a bell pit, the extraction working outward from a central shaft, or a technique called [[room and pillar]] in which 'rooms' of coal were extracted with pillars left to support the roofs. Both of these techniques however left considerable amount of usable coal behind.

Archeological evidence in China indicates surface mining of coal and household usage after approximately 3490 BC.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=John Dodson|author2=Xiaoqiang|author3=Nan Sun|author4=Pia Atahan|author5=Xinying Zhou|author6=Hanbin Liu|author7=Keliang Zhao|author8=Songmei Hu|author9=Zemeng Yang|title=Use of coal in the Bronze Age in China|journal=The Holocene|date=March 3, 2014|volume=0959683614523155|doi=10.1177/0959683614523155|url=http://hol.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/03/03/0959683614523155|accessdate=11 April 2014|issue=5|pages=525–530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest reference to the use of coal in [[metalworking]] is found in the geological treatise ''On stones'' (Lap. 16) by the Greek scientist [[Theophrastus]] (c. 371–287 BC):

{{quote|Among the materials that are dug because they are useful, those known as coals are made of earth, and, once set on fire, they burn like [[charcoal]]. They are found in [[Liguria]]... and in [[Elis]] as one approaches [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] by the mountain road; and they are used by those who work in metals.&lt;ref&gt;Mattusch, Carol (2008): "Metalworking and Tools", in: [[John Peter Oleson|Oleson, John Peter]] (ed.): ''The Oxford Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-518731-1}}, pp. 418–38 (432).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The earliest known use of coal in the [[Americas]] was by the [[Aztec]]s who used coal for fuel and [[jet (lignite)|jet]] (a type of [[lignite]]) for ornaments.&lt;ref name="Freese. 2004"/&gt;

In [[Roman Britain]], the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] were exploiting all major coalfields (save those of [[North Staffordshire|North]] and [[South Staffordshire]]) by the late 2nd century AD.&lt;ref name = "Smith 1997, 322–324"&gt;Smith, A. H. V. (1997): "Provenance of Coals from Roman Sites in England and Wales", ''[[Britannia (journal)|Britannia]]'', Vol. 28, pp. 297–324 (322–4).&lt;/ref&gt; While much of its use remained local, a lively trade developed along the [[North Sea]] coast supplying coal to [[Yorkshire]] and [[London]].&lt;ref name="Smith 1997, 322–324"/&gt; This also extended to the continental [[Rhineland]], where [[bituminous coal]] was already used for the smelting of [[iron ore]].&lt;ref name="Smith 1997, 322–324"/&gt; It was used in hypocausts to heat [[Thermae|public baths]], the baths in military forts, and the villas of wealthy individuals. Excavation has revealed coal stores at many forts along [[Hadrian's Wall]] as well as the remains of a [[smelting]] industry at forts such as [[Longovicium]] nearby.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

After the Romans left Britain, in AD 410, there are few records of coal being used in the country until the end of the 12th century. One that does occur is in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] for the year 852 when a rent including 12 loads of coal is mentioned.&lt;ref name=ASC852&gt;Giles, J. A. (trans) [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle_(Giles) The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle], London, G Bell &amp; Sons 1914.  "At this time Ceolred, abbat of Medeshamstede and the monks let to Wulfred the land of Sempringham, ... and each year [he] should deliver into the minster sixty loads of wood, and twelve of coal and six of faggots, and two tuns full of pure ale, and two beasts fit for slaughter, and six hundred loaves, and ten measures of Welsh ale, and each year a horse, and thirty shillings, and one day's entertainment."&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1183 a smith was given land for his work, and was required to "raise his own coal"&lt;ref name=Yeats1871&gt;{{ Citation | last = Yeats | first = John, LLD | title = The technical history of commerce | date = 1871 | publisher = Cassell, Petter and Galpin | place = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|171–2}}  Shortly after the signing of the [[Magna Carta]], in 1215, coal began to be traded in areas of Scotland and the north-east England, where the [[carboniferous]] strata were exposed on the sea shore, and thus became known as "sea coal". This commodity, however, was not suitable for use in the type of domestic hearths then in use, and was mainly used by artisans for [[Calcium oxide|lime burning]], metal working and smelting. As early as 1228, sea coal from the north-east was being taken to London.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882"&gt;Galloway (1882).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |5}} During the 13th century, the trading of coal increased across Britain and by the end of the century most of the coalfields in England, Scotland and Wales were being worked on a small scale.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |8}} As the use of coal amongst the artisans became more widespread, it became clear that coal smoke was detrimental to health and the increasing pollution in London led to much unrest and agitation. As a result of this, a Royal proclamation was issued in 1306 prohibiting artificers of London from using sea coal in their furnaces and commanding them to return to the traditional fuels of wood and charcoal.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |10}} During the first half of the 14th century coal began to be used for domestic heating in coal producing areas of Britain, as improvements were made in the design of domestic hearths.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |13}} [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] was the first king to take an interest in the coal trade of the north east, issuing a number of writs to regulate the trade and allowing the export of coal to [[Calais]].&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |15}} The demand for coal steadily increased in Britain during the 15th century, but it was still mainly being used in the mining districts, in coastal towns or being exported to continental Europe.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |19}} However, by the middle of the 16th century supplies of wood were beginning to fail in Britain and the use of coal as a domestic fuel rapidly expanded.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |22}}

In 1575, Sir [[George Bruce of Carnock]] of [[Culross]], [[Scotland]], opened the first coal mine to extract coal from a "moat pit" under the sea on the [[Firth of Forth]]. He constructed an artificial loading island into which he sank a 40&amp;nbsp;ft shaft that connected to another two shafts for drainage and improved ventilation. The technology was far in advance of any coal mining method in the late medieval period and was considered one of the industrial wonders of the age.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | series = The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature | title = From Columba to the Union (Until 10707) | first = Ian | last = Brown}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century a number of advances in mining techniques were made, such the use of [[Boring (earth)|test boring]] to find suitable deposits and [[chain pump]]s, driven by [[water wheel]]s, to drain the collieries.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |57–9}}

North American coal deposits were first discovered by French explorers and fur traders along the shores of Grand Lake in central New Brunswick, Canada in the 1600s. Coal seams were exposed where rivers flowed into the lake and was dug by hand off the surface and from tunnels dug into the seam. About 1631 the French made their fur trading post at the mouth of the Saint John River their main post in Acadia and started construction of a new fort. The main residence at the fort was designed with two 11 foot wide fireplaces which were stocked with wood and coal from up river. As early as 1643, the French were sending coal and other supplies to the British colony at Boston.

==Industrial Revolution==
The [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the 18th century, and later spread to continental [[Europe]], [[North America]], and [[Japan]], was based on the availability of coal to power [[steam engine]]s. International trade expanded exponentially when coal-fed steam engines were built for the [[railway]]s and [[steamship]]s during the [[Victorian era]]. Coal was cheaper and much more efficient than [[wood fuel]] in most steam engines. As central and [[Northern England]] contains an abundance of coal, many mines were situated in these areas as well as the [[South Wales coalfield]] and [[Scotland]]. The small-scale techniques were unsuited to the increasing demand, with extraction moving away from surface extraction to deep [[shaft mining]] as the Industrial Revolution progressed.&lt;ref&gt;Flinn and Stoker (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[steamship]]s traveled overseas from the industrialized countries of Europe their need for coal served as trigger for coal mining to start at various locations across the globe. An example of this is the [[Coal mining in Chile|coal mining in Zona Centro Sur]], Chile, that began as a response to the arrival of steamships to [[Talcahuano]].&lt;ref name=VivaBrito&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vivallos Espinoza |first=Carlos |last2=Brito Peña |first2=Alejandra |date=2010 |title=Inmigración y sectores populares en las minas de carbón de Lota y Coronel (Chile 1850-1900)|trans-title=Immigration and popular sectors in the coal mines of Lota and Coronel (Chile 1850-1900) |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-04622010000100005&amp;script=sci_arttext |journal=[[Atenea]] |volume=501 |issue= |pages=73–94 |doi= |access-date=|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Britain==
[[File:British.coalfields.19th.century.jpg|thumb|British coalfields in the nineteenth century.]]

===Pre 1900===
Although some deep mining took place as early as the 1500s (in [[North East England]], and along the [[Firth of Forth]] coast)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Papers on Mining in Scotland, 18th and 19th centuries|publisher =Archives Hub|url =http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02092505.html|accessdate =2008-10-17|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://archive.is/20120801191243/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02092505.html|archivedate =2012-08-01|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Culross |publisher=BBC| url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/europe/trails_europe_culross.shtml | accessdate = 2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; deep shaft mining in the UK began to develop extensively in the late 18th century, with rapid expansion throughout the 19th century and early 20th century when the industry peaked. The location of the [[coalfield]]s helped to make the prosperity of [[Lancashire]], of [[Yorkshire]], and of [[South Wales]]. The Yorkshire pits which supplied [[Sheffield]] were only about 300 feet deep. [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] were the leading coal producers and they were the sites of the first deep pits. In much of Britain coal was worked from [[drift mine]]s, or scraped off when it outcropped on the surface. Small groups of part-time miners used shovels and primitive equipment.

Scottish miners had been bonded to their "maisters" by a 1606 Act "Anent Coalyers and Salters". A [[Colliers and Salters (Scotland) Act 1775]], recognised this to be "a state of slavery and bondage" and formally abolished it; this was made effective by a further law in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Erskine May on Slavery in Britain (Vol. III, Chapter XI) | url =http://www.pdavis.nl/ErskineMay.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Barrowman, Mining Engineer |title =Slavery In The Coal-Mines Of Scotland |date= 14 September 1897 |publisher=Scottish Mining Website | url =http://www.scottishmining.co.uk/429.html | accessdate = 2017-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1800 a great deal of coal was left in places as extraction was still primitive. As a result, in the deep [[Tyneside]] pits (300 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft deep) only about 40 percent of the coal could be extracted. The use of wooden pit props to support the roof was an innovation first introduced about 1800. The critical factor was circulation of air and control of dangerous explosive gases. At first fires were burned at the bottom of the "upcast" shaft to create air currents and circulate air, but replaced by fans driven by steam engines. Protection for miners came with the invention of the [[Davy lamp]] and [[Geordie lamp]], where any [[firedamp]] (or [[methane]]) burnt harmlessly within the lamp. It was achieved by restricting the ingress of air with either metal gauze or fine tubes, but the illumination from such lamps was very poor. Great efforts were made to develop better safe lamps, such as the Mueseler produced in the Belgian pits near [[Liège]].

Coal was so abundant in Britain that the supply could be stepped up to meet the rapidly rising demand. In 1700 the annual output of coal was just under 3 million tons. Between 1770 and 1780 the annual output of coal was some 6¼ million [[long ton]]s (or about the output of a week and a half in the 20th century). After 1790 output soared, reaching 16 million long tons by 1815 at the height of the [[Napoleonic War]]. By 1830 this had risen to over 30 million tons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=A Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave|pages=109–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miners, less affected by imported labour or machines than were the [[cotton mill]] workers, had begun to form [[trade union]]s and fight their grim battle for wages against the coal owners and royalty-lessees.&lt;ref&gt;J. Steven Watson; ''The Reign of George III, 1760-1815.'' 1960. p, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of women and children (at a fraction of the cost of men) was common until abolished in an Act of August 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Townhill: Dunfermline Coaltown, by William D. Henderson&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Wales, the miners showed a high degree of solidarity. They lived in isolated villages where the miners comprised the great majority of workers. There was a high degree of equality in life style; combined with an evangelical religious style based on Methodism this led to an ideology of egalitarianism. They forged a "community of solidarity" - under the leadership of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|Miners Federation]]. The union supported first the Liberal Party, then after 1918 Labour, with some Communist Party activism at the fringes.&lt;ref name="Stefan Llafur Berger 2001 pp 5-40"&gt;Stefan Llafur Berger, "Working-Class Culture and the Labour Movement in the South Wales and the Ruhr Coalfields, 1850-2000: A Comparison," ''Journal of Welsh Labour History/Cylchgrawn Hanes Llafur Cymru'' (2001) 8#2 pp 5-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-1900===
The need to maintain coal supplies (a primary energy source) had figured in both [[world war]]s.&lt;ref name="Fine 1990"&gt;Fine (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; As well as energy supply, coal became a very political issue, due to conditions under which colliers worked and the way they were treated by colliery owners. Much of the 'old [[Left-wing politics|Left]]' of British politics can trace its origins to coal-mining areas, with the main labour union being the [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain]], founded in 1888. The MFGB claimed 600,000 members in 1908. (The MFGB later became the more centralised [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]]).

Although other factors were involved, one cause of the [[UK General Strike of 1926]] was concerns colliers had over very dangerous working conditions, reduced pay and longer shifts.

Technological development throughout the 19th and 20th centuries helped both to improve the safety of colliers and the productive capacity of collieries they worked. In the late 20th century, improved integration of coal extraction with bulk industries such as electrical generation helped coal maintain its position despite the emergence of alternative energies supplies such as oil, natural gas and, from the late 1950s, [[nuclear power]] used for electricity. More recently coal has faced competition from renewable energy sources and bio-fuels.

Most of the coal mines in Britain were purchased by the government in 1947 and put under the control of the [[National Coal Board]], with only the smaller mines left in private ownership. The NUM had campaigned for nationalisation for decades and, once it was achieved, sought to work with the NCB in managing the industry and discouraged strikes. Under the chairmanship of [[Alf Robens]], pit closures became widespread as coal's place in energy generation declined. The NUM leadership continued to resist calls for strike action, but an [[UK miners' strike (1969)|unofficial strike began in 1969]] after a conference pledge on the hours of surface-workers was not acted upon. This was a watershed moment that led to increased spending on the coal industry and a much slower rate of pit closures, as well as the election of more militant officials to the NUM leadership. Under the government of Ted Heath, an [[UK miners' strike (1972)|official strike in 1972]] won increased wages after the Wilberforce Commission. Less than two years later, Heath called a general election over another official strike, called after an overtime ban had led to a [[Three Day Week]] in Britain, and lost the election to the Labour Party. The wage demands were then met and spending on the industry continued to increase, including the establishment of the new [[Selby Coalfield]].

By the early 1980s, many pits were almost 100 years' old and were considered uneconomic&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Thatcher, quoted in B. Fine, The coal question: political economy and industrial change from the Nineteenth Century to the present day&lt;/ref&gt; to work at then current wage rates compared to cheap [[North Sea oil]] and gas, and in comparison to subsidy levels in [[Europe]]. [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|The Miners' Strike of 1984]] failed to stop the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government's plans under [[Margaret Thatcher]] to shrink the industry, and a break-away [[Union of Democratic Mineworkers]] was founded by miners, mostly in the Midlands, who felt that the NUM had broken its own democratic rules in calling the strike. The [[National Coal Board]] (by then [[British Coal]]), was privatised by selling off a large number of pits to private concerns through the mid-1990s. Because of exhausted seams, high prices and cheap imports, the mining industry disappeared almost completely, despite the militant protests of some miners.&lt;ref name="Fine 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Curtis, "A Tradition of Radicalism: The Politics of the South Wales Miners, 1964-1985," ''Labour History Review'' (2011) 76#1 pp 34-50&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, the [[South Wales Valleys]] last deep pit mine, [[Tower Colliery]] in Hirwaun, [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]] closed with the loss of 120 jobs. The coal was exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7200432.stm BBC ''Coal mine closes with celebration'' 25 January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2015 coal was still mined at [[Hatfield Colliery|Hatfield]], [[Kellingley Colliery|Kellingley]] and [[Thoresby Colliery|Thoresby]] Collieries, and is extracted at several very large opencast pits in South Wales, Scotland and elsewhere. Kellingley Colliery was the last deep coal mine in operation in the UK and its last coaling shift was on 18 December 2015 when coaling operations ceased with the loss of 450 jobs bringing deep coal mining in the UK to an end in its entirety, a skeleton team of men will remain to service the colliery until it is finally dismantled.

Coal mining was never a major industry in Ireland, apart from a spell in the mid-19th century when east Tyrone collieries were at their peak. [[Deerpark Mines]] was the largest opencast site. In 1919 it got rail connections and reached peak production in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Alan McCutcheon|title=The Industrial Archaeology of Northern Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypR3QWtmBRoC&amp;pg=PA108-IA27|year=1984|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson U.P.|page=108|isbn=9780838631256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{Main|History of coal mining in the United States}}

[[Anthracite]] (or "hard" coal), clean and smokeless, became the preferred fuel in cities, replacing wood by about 1850. [[Bituminous coal|Bituminous]] (or "soft coal") mining came later. In the mid-century [[Pittsburgh]] was the principal market. After 1850 soft coal, which is cheaper but dirtier, came into demand for railway locomotives and stationary [[steam engine]]s, and was used to make [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for [[steel]] after 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Binder (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

Total coal output soared until 1918; before 1890, it doubled every ten years, going from 8.4 million short tons in 1850 to 40 million in 1870, 270 million in 1900, and peaking at 680 million short tons in 1918. New soft coal fields opened in [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]], as well as [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Alabama]]. The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s lowered the demand to 360 million short tons in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce C. Netschert and Sam H. Schurr, ''Energy in the American Economy, 1850-1975: An Economic Study of Its History and Prospects.'' pp 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[John L. Lewis]], the United Mine Workers (UMW) became the dominant force in the coal fields in the 1930s and 1940s, producing high wages and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky and Van Tine (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914 at the peak there were 180,000 anthracite miners; by 1970 only 6,000 remained. At the same time [[steam engine]]s were phased out in railways and factories, and [[bituminous coal]] was used primarily for the generation of [[electricity]]. Employment in bituminous peaked at 705,000 men in 1923, falling to 140,000 by 1970 and 70,000 in 2003. UMW membership among active miners fell from 160,000 in 1980 to only 16,000 in 2005, as coal mining became more mechanized and non-union miners predominated in the new coal fields.

In the 1960s a series of mergers saw coal production shift from small, independent coal companies to large, more diversified firms. Several oil companies and electricity producers acquired coal companies or leased Federal coal reserves in the west of the United States. Concerns that competition in the coal industry could decline as a result of these changes were heightened by a sharp rise in coal prices in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Coal prices fell in the 1980s, partly in response to oil price movements, but primarily in response to the large increase in supply worldwide which was brought about by the earlier price surge. During this period, the industry in the U.S. was characterized by a move towards low-sulfur coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/retail.aspx?indid=108&amp;chid=7 "Coal Mining Industry Report"] IBISWorld, 2009''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Wyoming became the largest coal producing state. It uses strip mining exclusively. Wyoming's coal reserves total about 69.3 billion tons, or 14.2% of the U.S. coal reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Manuel Lujan|author2=Harry M. Snyder|title=Surface Coal Mining Reclamation: 15 Years of Progress, 1977-1992, Statistical Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9skUgCfSEkC&amp;pg=PA68|year=1992|publisher=DIANE |page=68|isbn=9780788142154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, competition was intense in the US coal mining industry with some U.S. mines approaching the end of their useful life ([[mine closure]]).{{citation needed|date = August 2013}} Other coal-producing countries also stepped up production to win a share of traditional US export markets. Coal is used primarily to generate electricity, but the rapid drop in natural gas prices after 2008 created severe competition.

==Australia==
In 1984 Australia surpassed the US as the world's largest coal exporter. One-third of Australia's coal exports were shipped from the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, where coal mining and transport had begun nearly two centuries earlier. Coal River was the first name given by British settlers to the Hunter River after coal was found there in 1795. In 1804 the Sydney-based administration established a permanent convict settlement near the mouth of the Hunter River to mine and load the coal, predetermining the town's future as a coal port by naming it Newcastle. Today, Newcastle, NSW, is the largest coal port in the world.
Now the state of Queensland is Australia's top coal producer, with its Bowen Basin the main source of black coal, and plans by miners such as [[Gina Rinehart]] to open up the Galilee and Surat Basins to coal mining.

==Canada==
Canadian coal mining started in New Brunswick and also occurred in Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. The United States has been a major supplier for the industrial regions of [[Ontario]]. By 2000 about 19% of Canada's energy was supplied by coal, much of it imported from the U.S while Eastern Canadian ports import considerable coal from [[Venezuela]].

===New Brunswick===

The first coal mining in North America began in New Brunswick, Canada in the early 1600s. Coal was found by French explorers and fur traders along the shores of Grand Lake where rivers and erosion had exposed the coal. Small amounts of coal were dug from surface deposits and tunnels dug into the coal seams, and this coal supplied Fort Saint Marie, built by the French about 1632 at the mouth of the Saint John River. The French sold coal to the British colony at Boston as early as 1639. Due to this earliest export of coal in North America, Grand Lake has been recognized as a Canadian Historic Site . Coal mining expanded after the British took control of the area in the mid 1700s and encouraged permanent settlements in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario by British Loyalists. Beginning in 1765, over 11,000 Loyalists settled in N.B., most along the lower 100 miles of the Saint John River and around Grand Lake. Approximately 200,000 tons of coal were dug at Grand Lake between 1639 and 1887 using surface collection, vertical shafts and the room and pillar system. By 1920, the use of draglines and other modern equipment made strip mining possible and the privately owned Grand Lake area mines produced over 200,000 tons per year. Most of this coal was used by the railroad and large businesses. By 1936, a coal burning electric power generating plant at Newcastle Creek was operating with two 33,000 volt lines going to Fredericton and one 66,000 volt line going to Marysville. By 1950, coal production at Grand Lake often reached 1 million tons per year. In 1969, all the privately owned Grand Lake area coal companies and approximately 1,000 employees were consolidated into one provincial government controlled company named N.B. Coal Ltd.. In 2009, the increasing availability of oil and environmental concerns with coal use caused the closing of the Grand Lake coal mines and New Brunswick's coal mining industry.

=== Nova Scotia===
[[File:Stellarton FoordSeam 077.JPG|thumb|left|Foord Coal Seam, [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia|Stellarton]]]]
The first coal mining in Nova Scotia began in the 18th century with small hand-dug mines close to the sea at [[Joggins, Nova Scotia]] and in the [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] area of [[Cape Breton Island]]. Large scale coal mining began in the late 1830s when the General Mining Association (GMA), a group of English mining investors, obtained a coal mining monopoly in Nova Scotia. They imported the latest in mining technology including steam water pumps and railways to develop large mines in the [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia|Stellarton]] area of [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia]], including the Foord Pit which by 1866 was the deepest coal mine in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/about/museumsite.aspx |title="History of the Site", ''Nova Scotia Museum of Industry'' |access-date=2011-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317051008/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/about/museumsite.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining also developed in [[Springhill, Nova Scotia|Springhill]] and [[Joggins]] in [[Cumberland County, Nova Scotia]]. After the GMA monopoly expired, the largest and longest lasting mines developed at [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]] in [[Nova Scotia]]. Nova Scotia was the major supplier of Canadian coal until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/novascotiaindustry/coalmining/default.aspx |title="Coal Mining", ''Nova Scotia Museum of Industry'' |access-date=2011-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318064424/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/novascotiaindustry/coalmining/default.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak in 1949 25,000 miners dug 17 million metric tons of coal from Nova Scotian mines. The miners, who lived in company towns, became politically active in [[left-wing politics]] during labour struggles for safety and fair wages. [[Westray Mine]] near Stellarton closed in 1992 after an explosion killed 26 miners. All the subsurface mines were closed by 2001, although some open pit coal mining continues near Stellarton. The [[Nova Scotia Museum of Industry]] at Stellarton explores the history of mining in the province from its location on the site of the Foord Pit.

===Alberta===
Coal was easy to find in what is now [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]], Canada. The [[Atlas Coal Mine]] National Historic Site has turned this coalfield into a museum. This museum interprets how the [[Blackfoot]] and [[Cree]] knew about the "black rock that burned." After many explorers reported coal in the area, a handful of ranchers and homesteaders dug out the coal for their homes. [[Sam Drumheller]] started the coal rush in this area when he bought the land from a local rancher, which he then sold to the [[Canadian National Railway]]. Sam Drumheller also registered a coal mine. However, before his mine opened [[Jesse Gouge]] and [[Garnet Coyle]] beat him to it by opening the [[Newcastle Mine]]. Once the railway was built thousands of people came to mine this area.

By the end of 1912, there were nine working coal mines, in [[Newcastle, Alberta|Newcastle]], Drumheller, [[Midland, Alberta|Midland]], [[Rosedale, Alberta|Rosedale]], and [[Wayne, Alberta|Wayne]]. In years to follow more mines sprang up: [[Nacmine, Alberta|Nacmine]], [[Cambria, Alberta|Cambria]], Willow Creek, Lehigh, and [[East Coulee, Alberta|East Coulee]]. The timing of the Drumheller mine industry was "lucky" according to the Atlas National Historical Site, in that the [[United Mine Workers]] union had recently won the right for better working conditions. As a result of union action, child labour laws were passed to prevent boys under 14 years old working underground.&lt;ref&gt;Robert McIntosh, ''Boys in the pits: Child labour in coal mines'' (McGill-Queen's Press-MQUP, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Miners' camps in this area were called "hell's holes" because miners lived in tents and shacks. These camps were filled with drinking, gambling and watching fistfights as forms of recreation. With time, living conditions improved: little houses took the place of the tents, and more women joined the men and started families. With new activities such as hockey, baseball and theatre the camps were no longer "hell's holes" but became "the wonder town of the west."

Between 1911 and 1979, 139 mines were registered in the [[Drumheller Valley]], of which only 34 were productive for many years. The beginning of the end for the Drumheller mining industry was the discovery of oil at [[Leduc No. 1]] in 1947, after which [[natural gas]] became the predominant fuel for heating homes in western Canada. As the demand for coal dropped, mines closed and communities suffered. Some communities, Willow Creek for example, completely vanished while others went from boomtowns to ghost towns.

Atlas #4 Mine shipped its last load of coal in 1979, after which the Atlas Coal Mine National Historic Site has preserved the last of the Drumheller mines. Also nearby, [[East Coulee School Museum]] interprets the life of families in mine towns for its visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlascoalmine.ab.ca/] "Atlas Coal Mine National Historical Site"&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
[[Image:Courrières 1906 LeJ.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' the 1906 Courrières mine disaster in France]]

Pierre-Francois Tubeuf laid the foundations of the modern industry in France, starting in 1770 in Languedoc.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynne Lewis, ''The Advent of Modern Capitalism in France, 1770-1840: The Contribution of Pierre-François Tubeuf'' (1993) [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198228950.003.0002 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Labor unions emerged with an emphasis on the safety issue in the late 19th century. In 1885, there were 175 injuries per thousand workers per year. Deaths were low in most years 2 per 1000 workers), but major disaster was always a threat. 1099 men died in the [[Courrières mine disaster]] of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen J.

Unions gain strength by setting up a system of worker elected mine-safety delegates. The national government encouraged the mine safety movement as a means of limiting strife in the sometimes turbulent coal fields.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Reid, "The role of mine safety in the development of working-class consciousness and organization: The case of the Aubin Coal Basin, 1867-1914."

''Journal of Social History'' 2.1 (1968): 25-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany seized control of some mining districts in the First World War, leaving them devastated.

==Germany==
[[File:CoalDNLBF.png|thumb|Historical coalfields of Western Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Northern France]]
The first important mines appeared in the 1750s, in the valleys of the rivers Ruhr, Inde and Wurm where coal seams outcropped and horizontal adit mining was possible. In 1782 the [[Krupp]] family began operations near [[Essen]]. After 1815 entrepreneurs in the [[Ruhr Area]], which then became part of [[Prussia]] took advantage of the tariff zone ([[Zollverein]]) to open new mines and associated [[iron]] smelters. New railways were built by British engineers around 1850. Numerous small industrial centres sprang up, focused on [[ironworks]], using local coal. The iron and [[steel]] works typically bought mines, and erected [[coking]] ovens to supply their own requirements in [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] and gas. These integrated coal-iron firms ("Huettenzechen") became numerous after 1854; after 1900 they became mixed firms called "Konzern."

The average output of a mine in 1850 was about 8,500 short tons; its employment about 64. By 1900, the average mine's output had risen to 280,000 and the employment to about 1,400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=Why was Britain first? The Industrial revolution in global context|url=https://www.academia.edu/1940258/Why_was_Britain_first_The_industrial_revolution_in_global_context|work=Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total [[Ruhr]] coal output rose from 2.0 million short tons in 1850 to 22 in 1880, 60 in 1900, and 114 in 1913, on the verge of war. In 1932 output was down to 73 million short tons, growing to 130 in 1940. Output peaked in 1957 (at 123 million), declining to 78 million short tons in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Pounds (1952)&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2010 five coal mines were producing in Germany.

The miners in the Ruhr region were divided by ethnicity (with Germans and Poles) and religion (Protestants and Catholics). Mobility in and out of the mining camps to nearby industrial areas was high. The miners split into several unions, with an affiliation to a political party. As a result, the socialist union (affiliated with the Social Democratic Party) competed with Catholic and Communist unions until 1933, when the Nazis took over all of them. After 1945 the socialists came to the fore.&lt;ref name="Stefan Llafur Berger 2001 pp 5-40"/&gt;

==Belgium==
By 1830 when iron and later steel became important in [[Wallonia]] the [[Belgian]] coal industry had long been established, and used [[steam engine]]s for pumping. The Belgian coalfield lay near the navigable [[River Meuse]], so coal was shipped downstream to the ports and cities of the [[Rhine]]-Meuse-[[Scheldt]] [[river delta|delta]]. The opening of the [[Saint-Quentin Canal]] in 1810 allowed coal to go by barge to [[Paris]]. The Belgian coalfield outcrops over most of its area, and the highly folded nature of the coal seams, part of the geological [[Rhenohercynian Zone]], meant that surface occurrences of the coal were very abundant. Deep mines were not required at first, so a large number of small operations sprang up. There was a complex legal system for concessions, and often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper, thanks to the good pumping system. In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was {{convert|220|m|ft|sp=us}}. By 1856, the average depth in the [[Borinage]] was {{convert|361|m|ft|sp=us}}, and in 1866, {{convert|437|m|ft|sp=us}} and some pits had reached down {{convert|700|to|900|m|ft|-2|sp=us}}; one was {{convert|1065|m|ft|sp=us}} deep, probably the deepest coal mine in [[Europe]] at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high coal miner fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted, and the steel industry was importing some coal from the [[Ruhr]].&lt;ref&gt;Parker and Pounds (1957)&lt;/ref&gt; André Dumont's discovery in 1900 of coal in the [[Campine]] basin, in the Belgian Province Limburg, prompted entrepreneurs from Liège to open coal mines, mainly producing coal for the steel industry. An announced reorganisation of the Belgian coal mines in 1965 resulted in strikes and a revolt which led to the death of two coal miners in 1966 at the Zwartberg mine. Coal was mined in the Liège basin until 1980, in the Southern Wallonian basin until 1984, and in the Campine basin until 1992.

==Poland==
The first permanent coal mine in Poland was established in [[Szczakowa]] near [[Jaworzno]] in 1767. In 19th century development of iron, copper and lead mining and processing in southern Poland (notably in the [[Old-Polish Industrial Region]] and later in the region of [[Silesia]]) led to a quick development of coal mining. Among the most prominent deposits are those located in what are now the [[Upper Silesian Industrial Region]] and [[Rybnik Coal Area]] (formerly part of [[Prussia]]) and the [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]] on the Russian side of the border.

In modern times coal is still considered a strategic resource for Poland's economy, as it covers roughly 65% of energetic needs. Before and after [[World War II]] Poland has been one of the major coal producers worldwide, usually listed among the five largest. However, after 1989 the coal production is in decline, with the overall production for 1994 reaching 132 million metric tons, 112 million metric tons in 1999 and 104 million metric tons in 2002.

==Russia==
From the 1860s large deposits in the Don Basin ("Donbas") in southern Russia supplied 87% of Russia's coal. It was used by railways and the iron and steel industry. After 1900 smaller deposits near Dombrovo, Zabaikal and Cheremkhovo in Siberia were opened. Small older mines south of Moscow also operated. Coal production was controlled by inefficient Russo-British syndicates, and there were shortages of workers, so the companies set up welfare systems for them. Their smallish output and the weak Russian railway system centered on the Ekaterininskaia (Krivoi Rog) Railway held back the growth of Russian heavy industry.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Solovyova, "The Railway System in the Mining Area of Southern Russia in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries," ''Journal of Transport History'' (1984) 5#1 pp 66-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan P. MaCaffray, "Origins of Labor Policy in the Russian Coal and Steel Industry, 1874-1900," ''Journal of Economic History'' (1987) 47#4 pp 951-67 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2122039 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John P. McKay, ''Pioneers for Profit: Foreign Entrepreneurship and Russian Industrialization,  1885-1913'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Second World War the loss of 60% of the mining areas to German invaders forced the rapid expansion of mines in the Urals, as well as greater use of mines in the Kuznetsk Basin in Siberia. In 1939 the Urals produced only half the fuel needed by local industry. During the war the mines were expanded and over 700 factories were evacuated from the west, greatly increasing the demand for Ural coal. Prisoners from the Gulag were sent to the mines; up to a third of the workers were women. The miners were given much higher rations of food. Output doubled and the share of the region in the total national coal production rose from 8% to 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Scott Dunn|title=The Soviet Economy and the Red Army, 1930-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dcAgT_2uiYgC&amp;pg=PA38|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood |page=38|isbn=9780275948931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989-91 militant coal miners in Russia and Ukraine were the mainstay of the revolutionary forced which finally overthrew the Communist system in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Burawoy and Pavel Michael, "Russian Miners Bow to the Angel of History," ''Antipode'' (Jan 1995) 27#2 pp 115-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the Donets Basin is the major coal-mining district in eastern Ukraine and adjacent portions of Russia. Production during 2009 was 68.7 million tons in the Ukrainian and 4.9million tons in the Russian part of the basin, but coal gas is a major hazard.&lt;ref&gt;R.F. Sachsenhofer et al.

==India==

Commercial exploitation began in 1774, John Sumner and [[Suetonius Grant Heatly]] of the [[East India Company]] setting up operations in the [[Raniganj Coalfield]] along the Western bank of river [[Damodar River|Damodar]]. Due to a lack of demand growth was sluggish until 1853, with the introduction of steam locomotives to the fast-expanding rail system.

As late as 1895, India imported large quantities of coal from Britain, but as domestic production increased and was found to be suitable for locomotives and ships, demand for coal imports declined dramatically. India's export of coal increased, especially to Burma, Ceylon, and the Malay states.&lt;ref&gt;A.B. Ghosh, "India's Foreign Trade in Coal Before Independence: A Note," ''Indian Economic and Social History Review'' (Oct 1969) 6#4 pp 431-437&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900 production had risen to an annual average of 1 million [[tonne]] (mt) and India was producing 6.12 mts. per year by 1900{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and 18 mts per year by 1920.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Temporary wartime demand (1914-1918) was followed by a slump in the 1930s. The production reached a level of 29 mts. by 1942 and 30 mts. by 1946.

After India became independent, the new government stressed the rapid growth of heavy industry. The National Coal Development Corporation was founded in 1956 (as a Government of India) undertaking. The founding of this body was major step in the development of an indigenous Indian coal sector. Especially important was the development of the vast [[Dhanbad]] coal-mining complex with such major operations as Tata Steel, BCCL, ECL and IISCO (Indian Iron And Steel Company), as well as the Indian School of Mines to train engineers, geologists and managers.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Commander, "Industrialization and Sectoral Imbalance: Coal Mining and the Theory of Dualism in Colonial and Independent India," ''Journal of Peasant Studies'' (1981) 9#1 pp 86-96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==

In the 21st century, Indonesia has expanded its coal mining and by 2011 ranked #5 globally in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael S. Hamilton|title=Mining Environmental Policy: Comparing Indonesia and the USA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjx4paALjRsC|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754644934}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011 Kazakhstan ranks in the top ten in terms of coal production and reserves. Lignite ("brown coal") remains important with Germany, China and Russia the largest producers.&lt;ref&gt;World Coal Association, ''Coal Facts 2012'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disasters==
{{main|Mining disasters}}
[[File:Senghenydd pit disaster 1.jpg|thumb|Removing bodies from the pit at Senghenydd, 1913]]
[[File:Courrières 1906 LeJ.jpg|thumb|The Courrières mine disaster in France in 1906]]
Mining has always been especially dangerous, because of explosions, roof cave-ins, and the difficulty of underground rescue. The worst single disaster in British coal mining history was at [[Senghenydd Colliery Disaster|Senghenydd]] in the [[South Wales coalfield]]. On the morning of 14 October 1913 an explosion and subsequent fire killed 436 men and boys. Only 72 bodies were recovered. It followed a series of many extensive [[Mining accident]]s in the late 19th century, such as [[The Oaks explosion]] of 1866 and the [[Hartley Colliery Disaster]] of 1862. Most of the explosions were caused by [[firedamp]] ignitions followed by coal dust explosions. At Hartley there was no explosion, but the miners entombed when the single shaft was blocked by a broken cast iron beam from the haulage engine.
Deaths were mainly caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, known as [[afterdamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Mason | first = T. | first2 = Peter | last2 = Atkinson | title = The Hartley Pit Disaster | work = The Science and Art of Mining | publisher = Durham Mining Museum | year = 1911 | url = http://www.dmm.org.uk/archives/a_hart01.htm | accessdate = 3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Courrières mine disaster]], Europe's worst mining accident, caused the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on 10 March 1906. The [[Benxihu Colliery]] accident in China on April 26, 1942, killed 1,549 miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Marcel Barrois | publisher=Le Monde | date=March 10, 2006 | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3226,36-749532,0.html|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as disasters directly affecting mines, there have been disasters attributable to the impact of mining on the surrounding landscapes and communities. The [[Aberfan disaster]] in 1966 buried a school in South Wales when a huge slag heap collapsed, killing 116 children and 28 adults.

'''Information technology''' ('''ΙΤ''') '''outsourcing''' is a company's [[outsourcing]] of computer or Internet related work, such as [[Computer programming|programming]], to other companies.  It is used in reference to [[business process outsourcing]] or BPO, which is the outsourcing of the work that does not require much of technical skills.

== IT outsourcing drivers ==
IT outsourcing refers to outsourcing all or parts of IT functions to an external party. Information technology outsourcing is a subset of business process outsourcing (BPO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467089504000466 | doi=10.1016/j.accinf.2004.04.006 | volume=5 | title=IS/IT outsourcing practices of small- and medium-sized manufacturers | journal=International Journal of Accounting Information Systems | pages=429–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reasons for IT outsourcing include lack of resources and cost reduction. This is especially significant for applying technical certifications and building disaster recovery sites.&lt;ref&gt;IT Support &amp; IT Outsourcing, https://milliontech.com/it-support/&lt;/ref&gt; IT outsourcing is sometimes called IT enabled services (ITES) outsourcing.&lt;ref&gt;ITES: Business Models, http://www.slideshare.net/amitanshu/ites-business-models&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overseas ITO ==

=== Asia ===
The typical destinations of overseas IT outsourcing are India &lt;ref&gt;Outsourcing Opportunities in India , https://arcgate.com/ai-training-data-outsourcing&lt;/ref&gt; and Philippines for the American and European companies and China and [[Vietnam]] for the Japanese companies.

A combination of high overhead in the [[United States]] and strong cultural ties between the domestic and Asian information technology industries have led many companies to outsource labor-intensive software programming to Asia and Eastern Europe.

Although Eastern Europe has created a lot of competition for India in recent years, India has always been a major player in information technology (IT); they even make their own supercomputers for predicting monsoons. It wasn't until the [[Y2K bug]] emerged that the need for legions of cheap programmers really arose, however, and American companies began to see the potential for outsourcing overseas. After Y2K the IT service industry exploded, with American companies outsourcing everything from data entry to customer service to India and other Asian countries.

Despite its distinct advantages for companies looking to outsource their IT services, India's volatile political climate and rampant corruption present problems. Some of the 185 Fortune 500 companies that outsource software to Asia are choosing places like Vietnam or China with more predictable politics and less corruption. The Vietnamese government has succeeded in retaining a low cost, lower risk market, while significantly improving income, per capita. A series of educational measures and incentives have also been applied to promote the technology sector. In addition, Vietnam is exceptionally attractive due to competitively low salary of the technically skilled workforce.”While not the cheapest outsourcing destination, Vietnam is still very competitive when compared to other global locations, especially, as wage rises in India and China. This is what contributed to it surging up the rankings, to take first place in 2015,” commented Richard Middleton, Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s head of occupier services for Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa,.&lt;ref&gt;VIETNAM TOPS C&amp;W GLOBAL OUTSOURCING LOCATION INDEX FOR FIRST TIME, http://www.cushmanwakefield.de/en-gb/news/2015/03/business-process-outsourcing/&lt;/ref&gt;

Thailand was ranked as the 6th best IT outsourcing country in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;IT Offshore Outsourcing Opportunities in Thailand, https://iglu.net/it-offshore-outsourcing-opportunities-in-thailand/&lt;/ref&gt; It benefits from a combination of low costs and good infrastructure. Thailand could be ranked higher with improved English language ability among skilled workers.

Other (mainly American) companies that outsource their customer service are finding that their customers prefer the Americanized English of the Philippines to the British English that predominates in India, though all of these countries have their drawbacks, from censored Internet lines in China and Vietnam to Muslim militancy in the Philippines.

Despite the hiccups the IT service industry continues to grow as the software industry becomes more competitive and U.S. companies try to reduce overhead. The Asian IT service market is still in its infancy, but in 2008 industry think tank Nasscom-McKinsey predicted a $17 billion IT service industry in India alone.&lt;ref&gt;Global Sourcing of Business and IT Services, https://books.google.com/books?id=_IHStt6MRukC&amp;lpg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America ===
Countries like United States and Canada usually seek [[Nearshoring|nearshore outsourcing]] in Latin American countries like [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Panama]], and others because of a closer cultural match and timezone.

=== Eastern Europe ===
In recent years Eastern Europe has also become a common ITO destination.&lt;ref&gt;Tagliabue, John. "Eastern Europe Becomes a Center for Outsourcing" New York Times , April 19, 2007. https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/business/worldbusiness/19prague.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; ITO to Eastern Europe allows Western European and North American companies to [[Nearshoring|nearshore]], remote [[Insourcing|insource]], and in general benefit from timezone and cultural proximity. Countries like [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] are common destinations for ITO within Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ukrainian Hi-Tech Initiative. Dec. 3rd, 2010. http://hi-tech.org.ua/intetics-sponsors-research-2010/&lt;/ref&gt;

Outsourcing IT to Eastern Europe has been on the rise because of the low-cost but highly skilled labor available in this region, as well as its geographical and cultural proximity. At first, many companies chose to outsource to more traditional Asian destinations. However, as software development and security needs grew, along with a preference for geographically closer partners, Eastern Europe became a more common destination for ITO.&lt;ref&gt;Hoch, Detlev et al. McKinsey Quarterly, Dec 2006. "The overlooked potential for outsourcing in Eastern Europe" http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/The_overlooked_potential_for_outsourcing_in_Eastern_Europe_1884&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the number of IT professionals working for an ITO company in the Central-East European Region (not including Russia), reached 95,000; this number represents a 9% growth for countries like Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Kathleen. "Why more businesses are nearshoring in Eastern Europe" Computer Weekly, July 2011. http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Why-more-businesses-are-nearshoring-in-Eastern-Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States of America ===
Although many associate outsourcing of the IT industry to be leaving America, the United States does receive a wide variety of outsourcing work from other countries. A 2009 study on [[oDesk]] employment&lt;ref&gt;By Wadhwa, Vivek. "Outsourcing Benefits U.S. Workers, Too" Bloomberg Business Week , August 2, 2009. http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jul2009/tc20090731_382752.htm&lt;/ref&gt; had the United States ranked #3 in countries that received outsourced work. This is credited to the enhancements in cloud computing, and the high evaluation marks that United States located workers have and continue to receive. The adverse effect that the American economy has brought to the American worker, has also increased the demand for seeking employment in other countries. Prior to 2008, the need was not that high, as the average American worker was able to find work within the 50 domestic states.

== Basic concept  ==
Many major firms throughout the world have begun to internationalize their [[capital structure]] by raising funds from foreign as well as domestic source. As a result, these corporations are becoming multinational not only in the scope of their business activities but also in their capital structure.&lt;ref name="IFM"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheol S.|first1=Eun|last2=Bruce G.|first2=Resnick|title=International Financial Management, 6th Edition|date=2013|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., China Machine Press |location=Beijing, China|page=429|isbn=9787111408543}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This trend reflects not only a conscious effort on the part of firms to lower the [[cost of capital]] by international sourcing of funds but also the ongoing liberalization and deregulation of international financial markets that make them accessible for many firms.&lt;ref name="IFM"/&gt;

== Prospect  ==
If international financial markets were completely integrated, it would not matter whether firms raised [[Capital (economics)|capital]] from domestic or foreign sources because the cost of capital would be similar across countries. If, on the other hand, these markets are less than fully integrated, firms may be able to create value for their shareholders by issuing securities in foreign as well as domestic markets.&lt;ref name="IFM"/&gt;

== Influence factors  ==
As discussed in different theories, cross-listing of a firm's shares on foreign stock exchanges is one way a firm operating in segmented capital market can lessen the negative effects of segmentation and also internationalize the firm's [[capital structure]].&lt;ref name="IFM"/&gt;

== Examples  ==
For example, IBM, Honda Motor, and British Petroleum are simultaneously listed and traded on the New York, London, and Tokyo stock exchanges. By internationalizing its corporate ownership structure, a firm can generally increase its share price and lower its [[cost of capital]].&lt;ref name="IFM"/&gt;

He serves as the [[Shadow Cabinet]] Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, and since September 2018 is Interim Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party while its leader is on maternity leave.

==Early life and education==
Carlaw was brought up in [[Newton Mearns]] and lived in [[Crookfur]] and [[Giffnock]]. He was educated at [[Glasgow Academy]]. He is married and has two sons. 

Carlaw worked for 25 years as a car salesman. He was joint head of FirstFord car dealership in the west of Scotland until it was placed into [[receivership]] in November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kristy Dorsey |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/receivers-at-firstford-as-takeover-talks-fail-1.134955 |title=Receivers at Firstford as takeover talks fail |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=2 November 2002 |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a director of Wylies (Automotive Services) until it went into [[Administration (law)|administration]] in February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/mystery-of-lost-paintings-at-collapsed-firm-carlaw-was-director-of-car-hire-company-1.105908 |title=Mystery of lost paintings at collapsed firm Carlaw was director of car hire company |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=10 October 2003 |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Carlaw joined the East Renfrewshire Conservatives in 1978. He was the Conservative candidate in the [[Glasgow Queen's Park by-election, 1982|1982 Queen's Park by-election]], and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] in [[Glasgow Pollok (UK Parliament constituency)|Pollok]]. He was Chairman of the [[Scottish Young Conservatives]] from 1984 to 1986, Chairman of Eastwood Conservatives from 1988 to 1992, and was Deputy Chairman of the [[Scottish Conservatives]] from 1992 to 1998. He was reappointed Deputy Chairman of the Scottish Conservatives in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20050612/ai_n14680004 Tory who told racist jokes appointed deputy chairman of Scottish Tories], Paul Hutcheon, ''[[The Sunday Herald]]''. 12 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He was unsuccessful as a candidate for [[Eastwood (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Eastwood]] in the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2003|2003]], [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007]], and [[Scottish Parliament election, 2011|2011 Scottish Parliament election]]s. He was however elected on the party list under Scotland's [[additional member system]] in 2007 and 2011 representing the [[West of Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|West of Scotland]] region. In 2016 he became the MSP for Eastwood after defeating the incumbent [[Ken Macintosh]]. He sits on the European and External Relations Committee of the Scottish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership - European and External Relations Committee|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/CurrentCommittees/european-committee.aspx|website=Scottish Parliament|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Carlaw stood as a candidate in the [[Scottish Conservative Party leadership election, 2011|leadership election]] brought on by [[Annabel Goldie|Annabel Goldie's]] resignation. During the campaign, he was hospitalised with [[appendicitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15496090 |title=BBC News - Tory leadership contender Jackson Carlaw is taken ill |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlaw finished third behind [[Ruth Davidson]] and [[Murdo Fraser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Black |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15580663 |title=BBC News - Ruth Davidson elected new Scottish Conservative leader |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=4 November 2011 |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson is the Deputy Leader for Scottish Conservatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15671037|title=BBC News - New leader Ruth Davidson announces front bench team|last=|first=|date=10 November 2011|website=|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been appointed by Ruth Davison in 2011, and had been Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport for almost nine years. He was re-appointed as of 28th June 2017 as Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Europe and External Affairs. 

He serves as interim leader of the party while the leader, Ruth Davidson, is on maternity leave from September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/16881694.interview-scottish-tory-deputy-leader-jackson-carlaw-on-filling-ruth-davidsons-shoes/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.scot/msps/currentmsps/99548.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2016, he was elected Convener of the Israeli Cross Party Group "Building Bridges with Israel", the establishment of which he pledged to help in his 2016 Scottish Parliament Campaign. In February 2017 Carlaw was appointed Deputy Convener of the Cross Party Group on End-of-life Choices.

== Parliamentary Issues ==
'''Council Tax rates''' 

Carlaw spoke out firmly against the SNP's changes to Council Tax in November 2016, defending his constituency with the belief that the proposed changes would effectively put over 50% of property in East Renfrewshire in the top two council tax bands. Commenting against the decision he maintained that "the rise would unfairly hit working families and the elderly" and "will hit Eastwood residents hard". 

'''Planning (Scotland) Bill'''

Carlaw dismissed the initial stages of the June 2018 bill to reform local council planning by the SNP as a 'power grab'. The proposed legislation, which provisioned for the monitoring and training of local councillors in relation to planning, was argued as one which contains 'too much centralisation' and has been opposed by Carlaw in parliamentary debate, who claims the added power such a bill would give Holyrood would be "a dangerous trend to set". 

'''Second Independence Referendum'''

Following attempts from the SNP to incite a second independence referendum for Scotland in March 2017, Carlaw spoke out against the attempt to 'impose a further unwanted referendum on an unwilling Scotland'. His speech, in parliament, pledged on behalf of the Scottish conservatives, that they would not allow for a second independence referendum until Brexit negotiations were complete and the Scottish public showed clear support for such a referendum. He further organised events within the constituency to reinforce this defence of the original referendum among his constituents. 

== Constituency Issues ==
'''Privatisation of Bonnyton House'''

Strongly opposing the sale and privatisation of the only public residential care home in East Renfrewshire in December 2016. Carlaw described it as a 'betrayal' to the families and residents within his constituency who relied on the care home by a council 'unwilling to properly look at any options other than privatisation.'

'''Parking Changes in East Renfrewshire'''

In a press release reacting to proposed changes to parking regulations by the Eastwood council in November 2016 , Carlaw spoke in favour of protecting local businesses from the potentially negative effects of the changes, suggesting several amendments to ensure the changes were 'substantially rethought to protect local businesses'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7827">Sir '''James Drax''' (d. 1662) was a [[Barbados]] plantation owner who accumulated extraordinary wealth as a pioneer of the sugar trade in the English colonies. The Caribbean sugar plantations established by James Drax and those who followed his example would be at the epicenter of the growing British and French empires, helping to fuel economic growth and imperial expansion.

== Early Life and migration ==

James Drax was the son of William Drax, a gentleman of the village of Finham, in the parish of Stoneleigh, Warwickshire.&lt;ref&gt;George W. Marshall, ed., ''La Neve’s Pedigrees of the Knights Made by King Charles II., King James II, King William III. and Queen Mary, King William Alone, and Queen Anne,'' Publications of the Harleian Society, 8 (1873), 76-77; John Mathews and George F. Mathews, eds., ''Abstract of the Probate Acts in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury,'' Year Books of Probates, Vol. 1, Part 2 (London, 1902), 145.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1620s, James Drax became one of the earliest English migrants to the island of Barbados: he and his companions arrived and lived for a time in a cave, hunting for provisions, and clearing land for the planting of tobacco, which soon became the staple crop of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome S. Handler, “Father Antoine Biet’s Visit to Barbados in 1654,” ''Journal of the Barbados Museum and Historical Society,'' 32 (1967), 69&lt;/ref&gt;  Drax later claimed that he had arrived with a stock of no more than £300, and that he intended to stay on the island until he had parlayed that initial investment into a landed fortune worth £10,000 a year back home.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ligon, ''A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados'' (1657), 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Sugar planter ==

By the late 1630s, Drax had accumulated a substantial portion of land on Barbados, together with his brother William Drax.  Owing to a slump in tobacco prices, the late 1630s saw considerable economic difficulty in England’s fledgling colonies in the Caribbean, and colonists began to turn to other crops.  According to tradition, Drax was one of the pioneers of the introduction of sugar to the island, and was reportedly the first planter successfully to cultivate sugar cane on a large scale.  Drax allegedly relied heavily on Dutch expertise, learning the craft of sugar production and refinement from a Dutch settler, and then importing equipment from Holland.&lt;ref&gt;P.F. Campbell, ''Some Early Barbadian History'' (St. Michael, 1993), 239, 248; Thomas Dalby, ''An Historical Account of the Rise and Growth of the West-India Colonies'' (1690), 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;  While these reports were recorded much later, and while the contribution of the Dutch is disputed, it is likely that at least some of the capital and techniques of production deployed in the early Barbados sugar trade came from the Dutch, who in turn had acquired their know-how and experience in the trade from Portuguese Brazil (which had been partially seized by the Netherlands in 1630).  Sources indicate that the early experiments of Drax and others Barbados settlers began c. 1640, and there was certainly sugar arriving in London from the island by 1643.  Barbados quickly became a major supplier for Europe, and by the mid-1650s, sugar production had largely supplanted tobacco and all other crops as the dominant economic activity of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Dale Gragg, ''Englishmen Transplanted: The English Colonization of Barbados, 1627-1660'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), 99-112.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Slavery ==

Concurrent with the rise of sugar came large-scale and intensive exploitation of slave labor, and here too Drax was a notorious pioneer.  Prior to 1640, the primary source of labor in Barbados had been European indentured servants.  Although there were African slaves in Barbados before this point, it was only after 1640, and frequently in tandem with the cultivation of sugar, that slave labor began to supplant indentured servitude as the chief mode of production.  Drax was deeply involved in this transition, acquiring 22 slaves in early 1642, just as he was getting involved in sugar.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''Some Early Barbadian History,'' 99.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1644, he purchased another 34 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Bridenbaugh and Roberta Bridenbaugh, ''No Peace Beyond the Line: The English in the Caribbean, 1624-1690'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1972), 78.&lt;/ref&gt;   By the early 1650s, his huge estate was manned by some 200 slaves of African descent.&lt;ref&gt;Handler, ''Biet's Visit,'' 69&lt;/ref&gt;   The model of intensive slave labor, organized into work gangs, and disciplined through ubiquitous violence, also quickly spread through the Caribbean, going hand-in-hand with sugar production.

== Fortune and knighthood ==

Drax profited spectacularly from his sugar enterprise, allowing him to live “like a prince.”&lt;ref&gt;Ligon, ''Barbados,'' 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  With wealth and power came political controversy.  He emerged during the 1640s as a key supporter of parliament during the civil war raging in England, and became a colonel in the island’s militia.  As a result, when a royalist faction seized control of Barbados in 1650, James and William Drax were exiled from the island, along with other prominent parliamentarians.  They returned to London, where they lobbied the House of Commons to send an expedition to retake the island.  In 1651, Drax sailed in the fleet designed to re-conquer Barbados, and he was part of the team that went ashore to negotiate the surrender of the island.&lt;ref&gt;N. Darnell Davis, ''The Cavaliers and Roundheads of Barbados, 1650-1652'' (Georgetown: Argosy, 1887), 145-149, 178, 190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Restored to his estates and power, Drax once again took up a leading role in the governance of the colony.  It is thought that [[Drax Hall Estate|Drax Hall]], the impressive seventeenth-century manor house in St. George parish Barbados, was built by him and his brother during the 1650s.  He also played a role as patron of explorers of the North American coast, including [[Robert Sandford (explorer)|Robert Sandford]].&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Sarah, "Power in the English Caribbean: the Proprietorship of Lord Willoughby of Parham" in Roper, LH and Van Ruymbeke, B. “Constructing Early Modern Empires: Proprietary Ventures in the Atlantic World, 1500-1750, Leiden: Brill 2007 p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; In 1658, Drax was rewarded for his loyalty with a knighthood from the Lord Protector, [[Oliver Cromwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Noble, ''Memoirs of the Protectoral-House of Cromwell,'' 2 vols. (3d ed., London: Robinson, 1787), 1: 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to England and death ==

By this point, Drax had returned to England, where he acquired a series of estates, pursuing his original ambition of setting himself up as a landed magnate at home, while continuing to profit from his vast properties in Barbados.  He survived the transition of the Restoration, but died in early 1662, and was buried in the parish of St. John Zachary, London.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Allen, ''A New History of London, Westminster and the Borough of Southwark,'' (London, 1839), vol. 3, 57; Will of Sir James Drax of the Parish of St John Zachary in London Knight, dated 15 Apr 1659, proved 14 Mar 1661[/2], Prerogative Court of Canterbury 35 Laud.&lt;/ref&gt;  After his death, his son Henry continued to own and manage the family estate in Barbados.&lt;ref&gt;"Henry Drax's Instructions on the Management of a Seventeenth-Century Barbadian Sugar Plantation," ''William and Mary Quarterly,'' Third Series, 66 (2009), 565-604 &lt;/ref&gt;  T

Hashemi]&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Iran]]ian-born trader in arms and other commodities convicted of fraud in the UK in 1999. Hashemi had a 9-year relationship with the UK's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6), beginning soon after his arrival in the UK in 1984. Hashemi and his brother [[Cyrus Hashemi]] played a role in the 1980 [[October Surprise conspiracy theory|October Surprise affair]] (Jamshid later testified to the [[House October Surprise Task Force]] in 1992) and in the mid-1980s [[Iran-Contra affair]].

==Career==
Hashemi and his brother [[Cyrus Hashemi]] supported the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], and Jamshid was appointed to oversee the national radio network, where he worked with [[Mehdi Karroubi]]'s brother Hassan.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In late 1979 Jamshid flew to London at his brother's invitation, where he met [[John Shaheen]]. Shaheen procured a multiple-entry US visa for Jamshid within a day, and Jamshid flew to the US on 1 January 1980.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Hashemi and his brother [[Cyrus Hashemi]] went on to play a role in the 1980 [[October Surprise conspiracy theory|October Surprise affair]] (Jamshid later testified to the [[House October Surprise Task Force]] in 1992) and in the [[Iran-Contra affair]]. 

Upon arriving in the US after the Revolution, Hashemi set up RRC Co Inc in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], which Hashemi described in an affidavit as "an import-export company ... (which) originally dealt in commodities such as rice and sugar, construction machinery parts and Oriental rugs". Towards the end of 1980 Hashemi was approached by a contact on behalf of the Iranian Air Force in regards to acquiring aircraft spare parts. The company shipped millions of dollars' worth of spare parts and related goods to Iran, with billing handled via a London office. RRC's operations ceased in late 1981 over a dispute between partners regarding allocation of profits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth R. Timmerman]] (1988), ''Fanning the Flames: Guns, Greed &amp; Geopolitics in the Gulf War'', [http://www.iran.org/tib/krt/fanning_ch6.htm CHAPTER 6: OPEN FOR BUSINESS]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1984 the Hashemis were tipped off by the CIA that the FBI was in pursuit of them for arms deals violating the Iran arms embargo; both settled in Britain, with Cyrus dying of a rare leukemia in 1986.

Soon after his move to the UK in 1984, Jamshid Hashemi developed a relationship with the UK's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) which would last nine years. Hashemi broke off the relationship in 1993 after the UK Government refused to issue him a British passport.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;Richard Norton-Taylor and William Raynor, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 February 1999, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/06/iran Jailed 'go-between' on UK-Iran arms deals is freed to keep MI6 secrets out of court]&lt;/ref&gt; At one time Hashemi gave the UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] "£55,000 after meeting Margaret Thatcher at the home of the then foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe."&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Hashemi deals that MI6 approved of included the supply of £350 million worth of [[Silkworm (missile)|Silkworm missiles]] from China to Iran in 1987 (the agency had supported this by sending an agent to China in 1985 to help arrange the deal) and the [[Portugal and the Iran–Iraq War|transfer of Portuguese 155mm ammunition]].&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

In July 1997 Hashemi was arrested in Dublin whilst travelling to the US for a second [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|triple heart bypass]]. He was released in February 1999, having pleaded guilty to three fraud charges and one of using a false passport, while four charges were dropped to avoid UK security matters being aired in open court.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; At the time of his release ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that "A source close to the case yesterday described MI6 as lucky."&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; The judge in the case described Hashemi as a "ruthless international conman", with the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] accusing Hashemi of setting up companies to defraud suppliers of at least £3m using non-existent commodity deals with Iran. The judge also noted that the three-year sentence would have been longer had Hashemi not had a record of supplying "valuable information" to MI6, as attested in court by Hashemi's anonymous case officers.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Hashemi's victims included the US trading firm Octagon, which at the time of the 1994 deal was listed on the [[NASDAQ]].&lt;ref name=Hilzenrath&gt;David S.

'''Julius Meinl V''' (born 9 July 1959) is a British businessman, resident in [[Prague]] [[Czech Republic]] (since end of August 2013). He heads a substantial family business which was originally built upon the production and retailing of food products, and which was founded by his great-great-grandfather, [[Julius Meinl I]], in Vienna in 1862.

==Early life==
Julius Meinl V was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] to a wealthy family. To prepare him to join the family business, he was educated at the ''[[Hochschule St. Gallen für Wirtschafts-, Rechts- und Sozialwissenschaften|Ecole des Hautes Etudes Economiques, Juridiques et Sociales]]'', [[St Gallen]], one of the world's leading business schools.  He then gained experience in London with Swiss Bank Corporation and later in the United States with Brown Brothers Harriman, America's oldest and largest private bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/7908472/Banker-Julius-Meinl-V-loses-legal-action-to-magazine-that-portrayed-him-as-Hitler.html|title=Banker Julius Meinl V loses legal action to magazine that 'portrayed him as Hitler'|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=24 July 2010|accessdate=26 January 2011|first=Andrew|last=Alderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/opinion/joshua-rozenberg/julius-meinl-s-predicament-should-disturb-common-law-jurisdictions|title=Meinl affair casts shadow over common law jurisdictions|publisher=[[The Law Society Gazette]]|date=18 June 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011|first=Joshua|last=Rozenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, Meinl V went to school in Austria, before finishing a degree in banking in [[Switzerland]] at the [[University of St. Gallen]].&lt;ref name=tdt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/5334863/Julius-Meinl-I-am-the-most-hated-man-in-Austria-but-I-am-fighting-back.html|title=Julius Meinl: I am the most hated man in Austria but I am fighting back|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 May 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011|first=Andrew|last=Alderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family (and family business) history==
The '''[[Julius Meinl]]''' name is synonymous with the family business, and the brand is one of the most well known and prestigious in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vienna-life.com/news/news/94-Meinl_Muddle|title=Meinl Muddle|publisher=Vienna Life|date=10 June 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011|first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family fortunes were built initially upon the manufacture and sale of quality ground coffee.  From this beginning the company grew steadily and successfully, retailing an increasingly wide variety of foods.  Over time it become the upmarket grocery multiple, with outlets throughout Austria and in many other Central and Eastern European countries.  It also became one of Austria's largest companies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In 1938, Meinl V's grandfather Julius Meinl III (1903–1991) was forced to leave Austria along with his [[Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14120267|title=A Viennese grind|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011|first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; wife and their son Meinl IV, while the rest of the Meinl family remained in Austria. Meinl V's mother's family also fled Austria, just managing to escape in 1940. Meinl III took his family to Britain. For this "act of treachery" the [[German government]] revoked the citizenship of the Meinl family, denouncing them as "enemies of the [[Nazi Germany|Reich]]". Meinl family became [[naturalization|naturalised]] British citizens in 1946.

During the course of [[World War II]], Meinl III was in close contact with the authorities in Britain, providing advice and assistance on the manner in which the [[Naziism|Nazi Party]] had extended its influence on Central Europe through the infiltration of the management of large retail organisations. After the war, Julius Meinl III assisted the Central Commission for Germany and Austria in the process of [[denazification]] of Austria. Meinl's contribution involved the identification of significant Nazi sympathisers who were occupying positions of authority in Austria and who had remained undetected.  This work merely added to the growing list of those within Austria with a distaste for the name, Meinl.

Nevertheless, the family returned to Austria to begin the task of rebuilding the family business, which they did with considerable success, expanding the range of its retail operations throughout central Europe.  It also ventured into banking, building a simple savings business into a small private bank.

==Career==
After graduating from university in banking, he spent two years in London with [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] and a further two years in New York at [[Brown Brothers Harriman]], New York; America's oldest and largest private bank.&lt;ref name=tdt/&gt;

In 1983, at the age of 24, Meinl V assumed the reins of the '''Meinl Bank'''.&lt;ref name=tdt/&gt; In the early 1990s, [[Julius Meinl AG]] reestablished food-retail operations in [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Poland]], where it had historically already been present. In 1998/99, the company implemented the divestiture of the food-retailing assets of Julius Meinl AG in Austria and Hungary, following which the group's activities became focused primarily on banking and finance operations. At this time, the activities of Meinl Bank were expanded, covering private and institutional asset management, private banking, and fund management. Meinl Bank became one of the leading Austrian private merchant and investment banks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In 2000, a subsidiary named '''Meinl Capital Markets''' was opened in London to provide broking services specialising in hedge funds and exchange traded funds. However, this operation was closed down in 2001. Also in 2001, the subsidiary '''Meinl Capital Advisors AG''' was founded to provide [[corporate finance]] and [[investment banking]] advisory services to governments and private clients.

In 1998, a Central European and Eastern European real-estate company was launched.  It was introduced on the [[Vienna Stock Exchange]] in 2002 under the name '''Meinl European Land'''. In 2007, '''Meinl Airports International''' and '''Meinl International Power''', specialised airport and energy investment funds, were additionally listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange.  The Group's main area of activity is Central and Eastern Europe. Meinl V was not a director of any of the three funds. Also in 2007, after a controversial repurchase of certificates by Meinl European Land, the name "Meinl" appeared in the Austrian media on a negative basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/325977/index.do Börse: FMA prüft Meinl European Land], DiePresse.com, 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January 2014 Julius Meinl was elected new President of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress (EAJC), a sub-organization of the World Jewish Congress (WJC) in Jerusalem. For Meinl the main priority in this function is to fight against anti-semitism. In his function as President of the EAJC Meinl is also a member of the Steering Committee of the JWC. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/religion/1563973/Eurasischjudischer-Kongress_Meinl-neuer-Praesident Eurasisch-jüdischer Kongress: Meinl neuer Präsident], Die Presse, 17 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wirtschaftsblatt.at/home/nachrichten/oesterreich/1563971/Julius-Meinl-ist-neuer-EAJCPraesident Julius Meinl ist neuer EAJC-Präsident], WirtschaftsBlatt, 3 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/leaders?tab=4 Steering Committee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303174125/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/leaders?tab=4 |date=3 March 2014 }}, World Jewish Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal matters==
In 2008, an investigation was commenced in Austria into the collapse in value of shares in Meinl European Land Limited.  The same year, a parallel investigation was commenced in Jersey, in the Channel Islands, Meinl European Land being a Jersey company.
On 1 April 2009, a judge ordered Meinl V to be arrested following an interrogation by Vienna prosecutors.  Meinl, who was at that time suspected of involvement in yet-to-be defined wrongdoing, was required to post bail of 100 million euros, because the judge considered him a flight risk due to his holding a British passport.  Meinl remains uncharged with any offence.

In February 2012, the Jersey Financial Services Commission announced that it had closed its investigation into the affairs of Meinl European Land, having found no evidence of wrongdoing.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseyfsc.org/the_commission/general_information/press_releases/release279.asp], "Jersey Financial Services Commission", 7 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/?id=1237228961558 "100 Millionen für die Freiheit von Julius"], ''Der Standard'', 2 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orf.at/090402-36837/index.html "Keine ausreichende Garantie"], ORF.at&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/managementIssues/idUSL261986720090402 "Banker Julius Meinl arrested in Vienna over fraud"], Reuters.com, 2 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Vienna, most of the record deposit – 90 million euros – was refunded in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krone.at/Oesterreich/Julius_Meinl_erhaelt_90_Millionen_Euro_Kaution_zurueck-MEL-Affaere-Story-355278 Meinl erhält 90 Millionen Euro Kaution zurück], krone.at, 19 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of Meinl Bank, the only logical conclusion after this step is to close the criminal proceedings against Meinl. .&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20130319_OTS0185/meinl-bank-meinl-kaution-wird-zum-groessten-teil-rueckerstattet Meinl Kaution wird zum größten Teil rückerstattet], APA OTS announcement of Meinl Bank, 19 March 2013''&lt;/ref&gt; The previous investigations have lasted for more than five years until now (May 2013) and are still without any result. In the course of the proceedings documents were seized by means of police raids, and according to an article in the daily newspaper Die Presse those documents are an absolute mess that was allegedly inflicted by a surveyor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/kordiconomy/1348175/Julius-Meinl-und-die-grosse-Konfusion? Meinl und die große Konfusion], diepresse.com, 22 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2014 Meinl and four other elements of Meinl Bank were charged with dishonesty in relation to a 212 million euro dividend paid out by his private bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.at/20150101/julius-meinl-faces-dishonesty-charges "Julius Meinl V faces dishonesty charges"], "The Local Austria", 1 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; All five defendants, including Julius Meinl, have raised objections to the indictment in due time. In these objections the defendants pointed out that they behaved lawfully and strongly criticized the state prosecutor of Vienna as well as the indictment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/4647823/Causa-Meinl_Staatsanwaltschaft-riskiert-sich-zu-blamieren?from=suche.intern.portal "Causa Meinl: "Staatsanwaltschaft riskiert, sich zu blamieren""], "DiePresse.com", 26 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orf.at//stories/2262743/ "Meinl Bank: Einsprüche gegen Sonderdividenden-Anklage"], "ORF.at", 26 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.format.at/newsticker/meinl-bank-fuenf-einsprueche-sonderdividenden-anklage-5437798 "Meinl Bank - Fünf Einsprüche gegen Sonderdividenden-Anklage"], "Format.at", 26 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; As announced on April 17, 2015, the Vienna Higher Regional Court (OLG Wien) upheld the oppositions and rejected the charges against Julius Meinl and other defendants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/2000014475419/Staatsanwaltschaft-scheitert-mit-Meinl-Anklage "Staatsanwaltschaft scheitert mit Anklage gegen Meinl"], "DerStandard.at", 17.

=== Personal life ===
Julius Meinl V is married to Dr. Ariane Meinl since 2012;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oe24.at/leute/oesterreich/Julius-Meinl-Neue-Kunst-Firma-mit-Neo-Ehefrau/200139855&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Meinl has a son, [[Julius VI]] who's married Norwegian-born Olivia Holten - Stolt Nielsen on 2016, 1 July.

==Biography==
Kevork Hovnanian was born in [[Kirkuk]], present-day [[Iraq]], in 1923. He was the oldest of four sons born to Stepan K. Hovnanian, a refugee from [[Armenia]] who had settled in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt; Stepan Hovnanian operated a [[construction]] business in Kirkuk which held contracts with [[oil companies]] in the region.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

===Career===
Hovnanian took over the family's construction business after his father became ill.  The company eventually employed more than 12,000 people in Iraq.&lt;ref name=app/&gt; However, Hovnanian fled to the [[United States]] in the aftermath of the 1958 [[14 July Revolution|Iraqi Revolution]], which overthrew the [[monarchy]] of [[Faisal II of Iraq]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt; Most of his family also moved to the United States.

In 1959, Kevork and his three brothers - [[Hirair Hovnanian]], [[Jirair Hovnanian]] and [[Vahak Hovnanian]] - each contributed $1,000 dollars, in addition to $20,000 which they borrowed from Peter S. Vosbikian (d.1971), to found [[Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc.]] in a trailer in [[Toms River, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|first=Barry |last=Meier |title=Kevork S.

Hovnanian Enterprises had built and sold more than 30,000 homes and condos by 1989.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; An additional 200,000 residences were sold between 1989 and 2009, as the company expanded its construction to include [[Luxury real estate|luxury]] homes, mid-priced homes and [[retirement communities]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; It remains one the United States' largest builders of "active adult homes", which are sold under the name of Four Seasons communities.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

Hovnanian family.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

Hovnanian donated a [[townhouse]] in New York City for use as the official Armenian Mission to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt; Hovnanian also constructed homes for [[earthquake]] victims in Armenia.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

In 1986, Hovnanian constructed the St. Stepanos Armenian Church in the [[Elberon, New Jersey|Elberon]] section of [[Long Branch, New Jersey|Long Branch]] in honor of his mother.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The construction of the church fulfuilled a promise he had made to himself when he fled Iraq in the late-1950s.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

{{Conflict of laws}}
The '''''lex loci arbitri''''' is the [[Latin]] term for "law of the place where [[arbitration]] is to take place" in the [[conflict of laws]]. Conflict is the branch of [[public law]] regulating all [[lawsuit]]s involving a "foreign" law element where a difference in result will occur depending on which laws are applied.

==Explanation==
When a case comes before a [[court]] and all the main features of the case are local, the court will apply the ''[[lex fori]]'', the prevailing municipal [[law]], to decide the case. But if there are "foreign" elements to the case, the forum court may be obliged under the conflict of laws system to consider:
*whether the forum court has [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case (see the problem of [[forum shopping]]);
*it must then [[characterisation (conflict)|characterise]] the issues, i.e. allocate the factual basis of the case to its relevant legal classes; and
*then apply the [[choice of law]] rules to decide which law is to be applied to each class.
The ''lex loci arbitri'' is an element in the choice of law rules applied to cases testing the validity of a [[contract (conflict)|contract]]. As an aspect of the [[public policy (law)|public policy]] of [[freedom of contract]], the [[party (law)|parties]] to an agreement are free to include a [[forum selection clause]] and/or a [[choice of law clause]] and, unless there is a lack of [[bona fides]], these clauses will be considered valid. If there is no express selection of a [[proper law]], the courts will usually take the nomination of a forum as a "connecting factor", i.e. a fact that links a case to a specific geographical location. For these purposes, one of the "forums" that may be selected is arbitration. Hence, the fact that the parties have chosen a [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]] as the place of arbitration is an indication that parties may have intended the local law to apply. This indication will be weighed alongside other connecting factors. The state that has the largest number of connecting factors will be the ''[[lex causae]]'' applied to resolve the dispute between the parties. If there is a tie, the connecting factors which relate to performance will be given a greater weighting.

A '''management contract''' is an arrangement under which operational control of an [[Business|enterprise]] is vested by contract in a separate enterprise that performs the necessary managerial functions in return for a fee. Management contracts involve not just selling a method of doing things (as with [[franchising]] or [[licensing (strategic alliance)|licensing]]) but involve actually doing them. A management contract can involve a wide range of functions, such as technical operation and of a production facility, management of personnel, accounting, marketing services and training.

In Asia, many hotels operate under management contract arrangements, as they can more easily obtain [[economies of scale]], a global reservation systems, brand recognition etc. It is not unusual for contracts to be signed for 30 years, and having a fee as high as 3.5% of total revenues and 6-10% of gross operating profit.  
Management contracts have been used to a wide extent in the airline industry, and when foreign government action restricts other entry methods. Management contracts are often formed where there is a lack of local skills to run a project. It is an alternative to [[foreign direct investment]] as it does not involve as high risk and can yield higher returns for the company.
The first recorded management contract was initiated by [[Qantas]] and Duncan Upton in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaccm.com&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2013}}

==Difference between management contract and franchising  ==

In business management, franchising is a contractual relationship between franchiser (owner of the company) and franchisee (buyer of a brand name). The franchiser allows the franchisee to use its trademark along with certain business systems and processes in exchange for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=franchising|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/franchising.html|website=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/franchising.html|accessdate=29 October 2014|ref=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/franchising.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business students usually get confused between the concepts of management contracts and franchising. Although they have much in common, such as they both earn by selling intangibles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lacoma|first1=Tyler|title=Differences Between an Operating Agreement &amp; a Franchise Agreement|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/differences-between-operating-agreement-franchise-agreement-25768.html|website=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/differences-between-operating-agreement-franchise-agreement-25768.html|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are both affiliated with another company, but where a management contract acts as a framework and provides formation and structure to the company and its members, franchisee remains an independent businessman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhou|first1=Zongqing|title=The Differences between Franchising and Management Contract|url=http://purple.niagara.edu/zhou/franchise.htm|website=http://purple.niagara.edu/zhou/franchise.htm|publisher=College of Hospitality and Tourism Management|accessdate=29 October 2014|ref=http://purple.niagara.edu/zhou/franchise.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and Disadvantages of Management Contracts ==
A businessman who owns several companies, cannot distribute his attention amongst every minute detail of  his companies. He needs some expert assistance with his work so he can concentrate on more broader aspects. This assistance can be provided by the contract management companies. On hiring such companies, the owner will have more time to concentrate on the expansion of the business rather than day-to-day working of the companies. The businessman can distribute some of his basic responsibilities to these management companies such as recruitment, deployment and retention.

There are several companies who cannot reach the peak of success due to lack of expertise in one field or another. Such companies should hire contract management teams. This way they would not just be hiring an experienced employee but an entire team of efficient and experienced employees in technical fields of management, accountancy, marketing etc.

Management contracts gives businessman an assurance of the continuity of his business. This can be illustrated through an example. A manager or any employee may terminate his job, leaving the business a hole in its team for the smooth functioning of the operations. A contract management company can easily change few employees without stirring the constancy of the business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ray|first1=Linda|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Management Contracts|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/advantages-disadvantages-management-contracts-18886.html|website=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/advantages-disadvantages-management-contracts-18886.html|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through management contracts, a businessman can venture international business opportunities without taking a huge risk of putting his own physical assets at stake. For example, the Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited of Britain retains general airport management skills. In the EEUU Heathrow serves the Indianapolis Airport under a 10 years management contract. It also provides retail management at the air mall in the Pittsburgh Airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/partners-and-suppliers|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government uses management contracts for the progress and development of the skill of the local managers and workers. They also accolade management contract companies to upgrade and operate public utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamenta's of international business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering into a management contracts might lead to difficulties and problems for the business owners. By entering into such agreements businesses are risking their privacy. When a businessman handover his company’s management to a third party, he may enter into confidential disputes. These contracts makes the business expose to ethical breaches, fraud and public exposer. The information of the other contracts made by the business is also available to the management contract companies. Since there responsibilities ranges from price negotiation to stock control they have full information about the vendors. Management responsibilities includes record of all employees, their personal information and payments procedures. Management contract companies have the information of the business finance also. This puts the business in a vulnerable position.

Hiring an outside contractor makes it difficult for the business to foresee the number of conflicts that can occur. For example, businessman hires a contract management company for the operations of the company. The management company may in turn take on the management of the supplier’s company too. This can lead to several compromises in the discounts, price negotiations and suppliers way of working. There can be even more conflicts even the same management company handles the management of several competitors at same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ray|first1=Linda|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Management Contracts|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/advantages-disadvantages-management-contracts-18886.html|website=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/advantages-disadvantages-management-contracts-18886.html|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International management can be very risky for the management companies. If a country is going through a political or social turmoil, the manager’s life is put at risk to carry on the business in such a situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{POV check|date=October 2012}}
'''Merab Ratishvili''' (born May 16, 1959) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] businessman, political scientist and author who has been imprisoned in Georgia since 15 July 2008 for his political activities and opposition to the [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] government.

Merab Ratishvili was born in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], and educated in Moscow. He is a former Chair of the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation, as referenced on the back cover of the English versions of his novels "Juga" and "Iliadi".

On 26 October 2007 Merab Ratishvili was arrested in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia and on 15 July 2008 sentenced to 9 years imprisonment, charged with the possession and use of drugs.

Both Georgian and international [[human rights]] organisations reported that in their opinion Ratishvili had been arrested because of his support for the political opposition to Mikheil Saakashvili, then President of Georgia.

Merab Ratishvili always maintained his innocence, and his case was submitted to the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;European Court of Human Rights accepts Ratishvili’s claim against Georgia. http://www.georgiatimes.info/en/news/16429.html Georgian Times, 13 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 report by the then Public Defender of Human Rights in Georgia [[Sozar Subari]] Merab Ratishvili was identified as a political prisoner.
 
A 2011 report by the Georgian Young Lawyers Association highlighted Merab Ratishvili’s case and concluded that “the preliminary investigation and court review were conducted with both material and procedural violations, meaning that the verdict delivered in Ratishvili’s case is unlawful.”.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Analysis Of Cases of Criminal and Administrative Offences with Alleged Political Motive {{cite web |url=http://www.gyla.ge/attachments/964_savaraudod%20politikuri%20motivaciis%20saqmeebi_Full_ENG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110731010644/http://gyla.ge/attachments/964_savaraudod%20politikuri%20motivaciis%20saqmeebi_Full_ENG.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-31 |df= }} Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association, Tbilisi, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2009 report the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (FIDH), stated, ''“The FIDH fact-finding mission is convinced that Merab Ratishvili is the victim of a purely fabricated, politically motivated case”''.&lt;ref&gt;After the rose, the thorns: political prisoners in post-revolutionary Georgia. http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/PolPrisGeorgia.pdf International Federation for Human Rights, Paris, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, [[Thomas Hammarberg]], Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, visited Merab Ratishvili in [[Rustavi]] prison No.6 as part of a visit to Georgia to report on the administration of justice and level of protection of human rights in the justice system of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Administration of justice and protection of human rights in the justice system in Georgia https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1809789 Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 30 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012 Ratishvili was one of the first prisoners released by the new Georgian government, which acknowledged he was a political prisoner.

Ratishvili used his time in prison to become a novelist. His first two novels, "Juga" and "Iliadi", have been translated into Russian, English and French. Other works, including another novel, "White Lama", are available in Georgian. A ful list is available from the Kaligrami publishing house in Tbilisi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7554">[[Image:Dioscorea mexicana.jpg|right|200px|thumb| Root of barbasco ''[[Dioscorea mexicana]]'']]
The '''Mexican barbasco trade''' was the trade of the [[diosgenin]]-rich [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] species ''[[Dioscorea mexicana]]'', ''[[Dioscorea floribunda]]'' and ''[[Dioscorea composita]]'' which emerged in Mexico in the 1950s as part of the [[Marker degradation#Mexican steroid industry|Mexican steroid industry]]. The trade consisted in Mexican [[Peasant|campesinos]] harvesting the root in the jungle, selling it to middlemen who brought it to processing plants where the root was fermented and the diosgenin extracted and sold to pharmaceutical companies such as [[Syntex]] who used it to produce [[synthetic hormones]].

==History==

===Scientific discovery of medicinal properties===
The trade started when [[Russell Earl Marker|Russell Marker]], a chemist looking for a plant source from which to extract [[diosgenin]] and [[saponin]], traveled to [[Veracruz]] looking for the yam ''Dioscorea mexicana'' which he suspected might be suitable. He hired two Mexican campesinos to bring him exemplars of the [[tuber]]. When he discovered that the root was indeed a significant source of diosgenin he established Syntex, the first Mexican fine chemical company dedicated to producing [[semisynthetic]] hormones from Barbasco. Before this development, natural hormones were extracted from animal sources, such as urine from pregnant mares or women, or from bull testes; prices were consequently very high. With the development of the process of [[Marker degradation]] which allowed the production of hormones from vegetable [[saponin]] sources, Marker began a search for a plant [[steroid]] of the sapogenin class with a ring structure more like [[progesterone]]. With the discovery of the chemical properties of the barbasco root, world market prices for steroids and other synthetic hormones plummeted – making them feasible for large scale production of medicines for common ailments such as [[arthritis]] or [[Addison's disease]], and eventually as the basis for the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Soto Laveaga, "Uncommon trajectories: steroid hormones, Mexican peasants, and the search for a wild yam" ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'' Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences volume 36 (4) 2005 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nina Hinke. 2008. EL BARBASCO. Ciencias, enero-marzo, número 089. Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Distrito Federal, México. [http://www.journals.unam.mx/index.php/cns/article/download/12134/11456] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The development of the industry===
This development sparked a barbasco extraction industry centered on the barbasco-rich areas of southeastern Mexico, in Northern [[Oaxaca]], Southern [[Veracruz]] and [[Puebla]] states. Especially the area called [[Chinantla]] in Northern Oaxaca, around the cities of [[Tuxtepec]] and [[San Juan Bautista Valle Nacional|Valle Nacional]]. The root was extracted in the wild by ''barbasqueros'', often poor [[Indigenous people of Mexico|Indigenous]] [[Chinantecs]], who ventured into the jungle to dig out the tuber with digging sticks or with their bare hands. Before becoming used industrially, the tuber was used by [[Chinantec]] healers in northern [[Oaxaca]] as an [[abortifacient]] and in cures for aching joints. It was also used by Chinantecs as a poison for fishing in the [[Papaloapan river]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Soto Laveaga, Gabriela|year=2009|title=Jungle Laboratories: Mexican peasants, National Projects and the Making of the Pill|publisher=Duke University|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1970s 125,000 Mexican peasants depended on the barbasco trade for their livelihood, and ten tons of Barbasco per week were extracted from the wild.&lt;ref name="Soto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Soto Laveaga, Gabriela|year=2009|title=Jungle Laboratories: Mexican peasants, National Projects and the Making of the Pill |publisher=Duke University |pages=37|isbn=9780822346050 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRvzw39OccwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quickly a system of middlemen appeared, as those who had enough means to pay ''barbasqueros'', started buying large quantities, often using a system of [[debt peonage]]. They would start by giving the ''barbasquero'' a loan which he or she would then have to pay off with barbasco. These middlemen would eventually establish ''acopios'', recollection and distribution centrals where large quantities of barbasco are gathered and shipped on to the ''beneficios'', the processing plants.&lt;ref name="Sotowholebook"/&gt;

===The production process===
At the processing plants the tuber is inspected, washed and chopped up, and mixed with water to produce a thick paste. The paste is then put into fermentation vats where it remains several days, after which it is taken out and sun dried on a concrete floor where it is turned by workers using rakes. In the process of drying the paste crystallizes into diosgenin granules, also called flour. The flour is then bagged and sent to laboratories where the diosgenin content is measured and the price is calculated based on the diosgenin percentage, which varies from 4–6%.&lt;ref name="Sotowholebook"/&gt;

Knowledge of the uses and purposes of the barbasco tuber was highly stratified and barbasqueros often did not know the true purpose of the root they were gathering: they were frequently told that it was used for soap.&lt;ref name="Sotowholebook"&gt;{{cite book|author=Soto Laveaga, Gabriela|year=2009|title=Jungle Laboratories: Mexican peasants, National Projects and the Making of the Pill |publisher=Duke University |pages=|isbn=9780822346050 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRvzw39OccwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acopio owners knew more about the process and eventually invented ways of improving the diosgenin concentration in roots collected by adding different solvents to the tubers before shipping them to the beneficios.

===End of the ''barbasco'' era===
In the late 1970s, populist President [[Luis Echeverría]] sought to organize and nationalize the barbasco trade in order to derive more benefit to the barbasqueros and to the Mexican state. He established the organization PROQUIVEMEX (Productos Químicos Vegetales de México). However, at this point Mexico had lost its status as a world leader of the synthetic hormone market and the barbasco trade was declining, just as the root was becoming depleted in the wild.&lt;ref name="Sotowholebook"/&gt;

Also during the 1970s it became possible to produce steroids from soy [[phytosterols]], including [[Progesterone#Laboratory|progesterone]]. This meant that barbasco was no longer necessary as a base product, and international reliance on Mexican yam stopped. Today only a few communities in Northern Oaxaca continue to produce barbasco, and the few existing beneficios process only a few tons per year. In 1999  65% of families in the municipio of [[Santiago Jocotepec]] depended on barbasco production, whereas in the municipios of [[San Juan Lalana]] it was 29.2%, in [[San Felipe Usila]] 28.3 and in [[San Lucas Ojitlan]] 24.4%.&lt;ref&gt;De Teresa, Ana Paula. 1999.

==Early life==

Walrath graduated from the [[University of Richmond]] in 1997, with a BA in English. Following college, he began promoting athletic shoes at various sporting events. An interest in [[Physical fitness|fitness]] later led him to two jobs as a [[personal trainer]] and fitness program manager. In 1999, Walrath changed his career path and started selling online advertising at DoubleClick, despite his lack of tech experience. “The only qualification I had was some sales skills,” Walrath said.&lt;ref name=richmond&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.richmond.edu/winter08/feature_2/index.html|title=English major Michael Walrath, ’97, sells his fledgling Internet company to Yahoo for $720 million|date=December 2008|accessdate=September 5, 2012|work=Richmond: The Alumni Magazine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417173911/http://magazine.richmond.edu/winter08/feature_2/index.html|archivedate=April 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Walrath began at [[DoubleClick]] in 1999, right before the dot-com bubble collapsed. DoubleClick laid off 20 percent of its staff, but Walrath stayed with the company and progressed to director of direct marketing, then to senior vice president of strategy and development of what became MaxWorldwide. In 2001, he created DoubleClick Direct, the company's direct marketing offer.&lt;ref name=richmond/&gt;

In January 2003, he launched [[Right Media]], one of the earliest digital advertising exchange marketplaces, with the vision of being more open and transparent. Right Media allows web publishers to join advertising networks that display ads from the highest bidding network per impression in their ad space in real bidding time. Right Media showed a 2,539% growth in three years, from $1.3 million in revenue in 2003 to $34.8 million in 2006.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch"/&gt; Inc. magazine ranked Right Media as 43rd on the list of fastest-growing private companies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/inc5000/profile/right-media|title=Inc 500 - Right Media|date=June 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2012|work=Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Walrath sold Right Media to Yahoo for $850 million and became Senior Vice President of advertising strategy at Yahoo until 2009.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/11/16/right-media-founder-to-leave-yahoo|title=Right Media Founder to Leave Yahoo|date=November 16, 2009|accessdate=September 5, 2012|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walrath left Yahoo in 2009 to focus on his passion for small, innovative companies.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; He co-founded early stage investment firm, WGI Group, with brothers Noah and Jonah Goodhart, who were founding investors in Right Media. Walrath began to invest and fund various startup companies, offering CEO mentoring and up to $500,000 for early stage investments. WGI Group has invested in more than 13 companies since 2007, including [[Taboola]], [[Optimal, Inc.]] and [[Yext]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/wgi-group|title=WGI Group-Crunch Base|date=November 2013|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the biggest being Yext, where Walrath serves as board chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/18/walrath-yext-chairman/|title=Right Media Founder Michael Walrath Becomes Chairman of Yext|date=March 18, 2011|accessdate=September 5, 2012|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walrath also co-founded and is chairman of moat.com, which counts some 15,000 clients, including AOL and Forbes.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt;

In 2008, Walrath co-founded production company, Atlas Films, along with his wife, Michelle Walrath, and Stephanie Soechtig.

For their upcoming documentary, The Big Picture, Atlas, in partnership with Katie Couric, exposes the root causes of childhood obesity. The film is still in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlasfilms.com/thebigpicture|title=The Big Picture|date=January 2008|accessdate=September 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907132819/http://atlasfilms.com/thebigpicture|archivedate=September 7, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oton Vinski''' (born '''Otto Weiss'''; [[Osijek]], 20 March 1877 – 1942, [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]) was an influential [[Croatia]]n [[banker]] who was killed during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].

Vinski was born in [[Osijek]] on 20 March 1877, as Otto Weiss, to a [[Jew]]ish family of Franjo and Berta Weiss. Vinski was married to Štefanija ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Alexander) Vinski, of the notable [[Zagreb]] Jewish family, [[Alexander family|Alexander]]. Together they had two sons: [[Zdenko Vinski|Zdenko]] and Ivo. In 1918, Vinski changed his name and surname. He was employed as a [[wikt:procurator|procurator]] and [[Chief executive officer|chief executive]] of the "Croatian Discount Bank" in [[Zagreb]]. During [[World War II]], Vinski was arrested and deported to [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] together with his mother in law Ilka Alexander, where they were both killed in 1942. When his wife returned home, nobody was left. By mere chance Vinski's wife and sons have survived the Holocaust. His wife died in Zagreb 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} B.M.; HR-DAZG-1154 Obitelj Vinski; Državni arhiv u Zagrebu; 30 Listopad 2008, Zagreb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ivo Goldstein|2005|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, the Merchants Bank of Halifax was founded in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], as a commercial bank that financed the fishing and timber industries and the European and Caribbean import/export businesses.&lt;ref name="rbcinsurance"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.insurancehotline.com/rbcinsurance/| title=RBC Insurance History| date=2016| accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1869 the Merchants' Bank was officially incorporated and received its federal charter in the same year.&lt;ref name="Pound 2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |date=30 September 2004 |isbn=978-1550411713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1870s and 1880s, the bank expanded into the other [[Maritimes|Maritime Provinces]]. When both the Newfoundland Commercial Bank and Union Bank of Newfoundland collapsed on 10 December 1894, the Merchants Bank expanded to Newfoundland on 31 January 1895.&lt;ref name="Pound 2005" /&gt;

As the bank grew, executives changed its name to reflect its growth and western expansion.&lt;ref name="rbcinsurance" /&gt; In 1901, the Merchants Bank of Halifax changed its name to the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). The centre of the Canadian financial industry had moved from [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] to [[Montreal]], so the Merchants Bank relocated its head office there. In 1910, RBC merged with the [[Union Bank of Halifax]]. In the same year it built a bank branch in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]—designed by Carrère and Hastings, in beaux-arts classicism proclaiming the financial dominance of Winnipeg in the prairies.&lt;ref name="kalman"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| first1=Harold D.| last1=Kalman| first2=Sharon| last2=Vattay| url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/bank-architecture/| title=Bank Architecture| encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |date=16 December 2013 |publisher=Historica Foundation |location=Toronto |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve its position in [[Ontario]], RBC merged with Traders Bank of Canada in 1912 and in 1917 RBC merged with [[Quebec Bank]], which was founded in 1818 and chartered in 1822 in [[Quebec City]].

RBC's presence in [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] was strengthened through a 1918 merger with Northern Crown Bank, which was the result of the merger in 1908 between Northern Bank (established in 1905 in [[Winnipeg]]) and Crown Bank of Canada (1904), based in [[Ontario]]. RBC's presence in the [[Prairie Provinces]] grew again with the 1925 merger with the Union Bank of Canada, which had begun in Quebec City in 1865 as the Union Bank of Lower Canada, but changed its name in 1886. The Union Bank of Canada had moved its headquarters to Winnipeg in 1912, and had built a strong presence in the Prairies and opened the first bank in the [[Northwest Territories]] at [[Fort Smith, Northwest Territories|Fort Smith]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=bp4xWM7K-FYC&amp;pg=PA434&amp;lpg=PA434&amp;dq=first+bank+fort+smith+nwt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1RA8sV46Mz&amp;sig=NDCyLnqlT1Nc6ylY_Tl6a6S9aDQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj88Pz_1JLdAhVC8IMKHYMRClIQ6AEwDHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20bank%20fort%20smith%20nwt&amp;f=false As Long as this Land Shall Last: A History of Treaty 8 and Treaty 11, 1870-1939]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbc.com/history/quicktofrontier/union_bank_can-detail.html Union Bank of Canada, Fort Smith, North West Territories, 1921]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, RBC merged with Crown Savings and Loan Co. merged with Industrial Mortgage &amp; Trust Co.&lt;ref name="session"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ontario Sessional Papers |author=Nineteenth Legislature |url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/ser/23347//v070-1936-192.pdf| year=1936 |ol=23742693M |page=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RBC installed its first computer in 1961, the first in Canadian banking.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In the 1960s, RBC Insurance was created.&lt;ref name="rbcinsurance" /&gt; In 1968, it merged with Ontario Loan and Debenture Company (formerly Ontario Savings and Investment Society).&lt;ref name="dcb"&gt;{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/jeffery_joseph_12E.html |title=Jeffery, Joseph |first=Daniel J. |last=Brock |volume=12 |accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, RBC merged with [[Royal Trust (Canada)|Royal Trust]].

In 2013, RBC completed the acquisition of the Canadian subsidiary of [[Ally Financial]].&lt;ref name=ally&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2012/10/23/td-target-royal-bank-ally.html| title=Royal Bank buys online savings bank Ally for $3.8B| work=[[CBC News]]| date=October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank's symbol is a golden [[lion]] clutching a globe, on a blue background. An older version depicted a crown above the globe and the lion faced to the left. The change coincided with an expansion in United States markets. Over the years, the lion's mane has also become less detailed and more stylized, and the tongue was shortened.&lt;ref name=logo&gt;{{cite press release| title=Royal Bank of Canada Updates Brand Name and Logo| url=http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/brand.html| date=20 August 2001| publisher=Royal Bank of Canada| accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of Royal Bank's top executive has changed several times. Initially it was styled as ''President''.

Taylor was chairman and CEO from 1986 to 1994, and he was succeeded by [[John Cleghorn]] in that capacity from 1994 to 2001. Dave McKay is currently the ''President and chief executive officer''.

==Controversies==

===Merger===
In 1998, the Royal Bank of Canada proposed to merge with the [[Bank of Montreal]], at the same time as the [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] proposed to merge with the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]]. Both mergers were examined by the [[Competition Bureau]] of Canada, and ultimately rejected by [[Paul Martin]], at the time the [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Finance Minister]] of Canada, and future [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]].

===Discrimination===
On January 15, 2007, [[CBC Radio]] reported RBC is "refusing" people of certain nationalities to open [[U.S. dollar]] accounts with the bank.&lt;ref name="CBC 2007-01-16"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/us-banking-regulators-carry-a-big-stick/article677687/ |title=U.S. banking regulators carry a big stick |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=19 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian citizens with [[dual citizenship]] in Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea or Sudan (mostly countries with U.S. sanctions) are affected. The [[U.S. Treasury Department]] restricts certain foreign nationals from using the U.S. dollar payment system to limit [[terrorism]] and [[money laundering]] after the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]]. RBC replied that compliance with such laws does not represent an endorsement by the bank and on January 17, clarified its position on the application of the U.S. laws, specifying that "with some exceptions" it does open accounts for dual citizens of the sanctioned countries.&lt;ref name="Radio-Canada 2007-01-17"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/20070117us.html |title=RBC issues clarification on U.S. dollar accounts |accessdate=2017-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120130224/http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/20070117us.html |date=17 January 2007 |publisher=Royal Bank of Canada  
|archivedate=2007-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been reports that the bank has closed the accounts of some [[Iranian-Canadian]] citizens.&lt;ref name=salam&gt;{{cite news| title=Discussions on closed bank accounts between Royal Bank of Canada and Iranian groups| url=http://salamtoronto.ca/?p=17571| work=Salam Toronto| date=3 July 2013| accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
Environmental groups have criticized RBC's financing of [[oil sands]] [[bitumen]] extraction and expansion, cumulatively issuing "more than $2.3 billion in loans and financing more than $6.9 billion in [corporate] debt between 2003 and 2007 for 13 companies including: [[EnCana]], [[Husky Energy]], [[OPTI Canada]], [[Delphi Energy]], [[Canadian Oil Sands Trust]], [[Northwest Upgrading]], [[Suncor]], [[Total S.A.|Total]], [[Connacher Oil and Gas]], [[InterPipeline]] and [[Enbridge]]."  Some environmental groups believe oil sands extraction has a detrimental effect on the northern Alberta environment.&lt;ref name="FinancialPost 2010-10-14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.financialpost.com/2010/10/14/u-s-foundations-against-the-oil-sands/ |title=U.S. foundations against the oil sands| accessdate=August 5, 2014 |date=14 October 2010 |work=Financial Post |last=Krause |first=Vivian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720221021/http://opinion.financialpost.com/2010/10/14/u-s-foundations-against-the-oil-sands/ |archivedate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 Ottawa branch firebombing===
An RBC branch in [[The Glebe]] neighbourhood of [[Ottawa]] was firebombed in May 2010. The party responsible later identified themselves on [[Indymedia]] and threatened to make their presence at the upcoming [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], as RBC was one of its key sponsors, as well as at the [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit]].&lt;ref name=taylor-jackson&gt;{{cite news| title= Police chief vows to nab 'domestic terrorists'| url=http://www.ottawasun.com/news/ottawa/2010/05/19/14010756.html| last1=Taylor| first1=Scott| last2=Jackson| first2=Kenneth| work=[[Ottawa Sun]]| date=19 May 2010| accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary foreign workers and Canadian layoffs===
{{main|Temporary foreign worker program in Canada}}
{{See also|Amanda Lang RBC controversy}}
In April 2013, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] reported that the Royal Bank of Canada was indirectly hiring [[Temporary resident (Canada)|temporary foreign worker]]s to replace 45 Canadian [[Information Technology]] workers.&lt;ref name=tomlinson&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2013/04/05/bc-rbc-foreign-workers.html| title=RBC replaces Canadian staff with foreign workers| work=CBC News| first=Kathy| last=Tomlinson| date=6 April 2013| accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBC reported on May 7, 2013, that during [[question period]] the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|NDP]] leveled accusations against the government and then Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], to which he responded that the government has been working on problems with the Temporary Foreign Worker Program for more than a year.&lt;ref name=harper&gt;{{cite news| title=Harper says foreign worker program is being fixed| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2013/05/07/pol-cp-temporary-foreign-workers.html?cmp=rss| work=CBC News| date=7 May 2013| accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Jacques Street''' (officially in {{lang-fr|'''rue Saint-Jacques'''}}), or '''St. James Street''', is a major street in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].

The street is commonly known by two [[street name|names]], "St. James Street" in [[English language|English]] (after [[St. James's]], [[London]]) and ''rue Saint-Jacques'' in [[French language|French]]. Both names are used in English and French, although Saint-Jacques is the most common for geographical reference. St. James Street is usually used in reference to the street's historic importance as a financial district.

==History==
[[File:DollierRuesMontreal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Montreal]] map drawn by [[François Dollier de Casson]] in 1672]]
A main thoroughfare passing through [[Old Montreal]], the street was first opened in 1672. The portion between McGill Street and place Saint Henri was originally called Bonaventure Street (''rue Saint-Bonaventure''). This name has passed down to [[Place Bonaventure]], [[Quebec Autoroute 10|Bonaventure Expressway]], and [[Bonaventure (Montreal Metro)|Bonaventure Metro station]], despite the disappearance of their original referents.

In the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, St. James Street was the centre of Montreal's financial district and where several major English insurance, banking, and trust companies built their Canadian head offices. Prior to [[World War I]], Canadian, provincial, and major municipal governments along with important industries such as the [[railway]]s, [[public utility]] and [[canal]] companies obtained most of their capital financing in the [[United Kingdom]] or the [[United States]]. At the end of the War, St. James Street grew rapidly and although by the 1920s there were [[stock exchange]]s in  [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Calgary]] and [[Vancouver]], St. James Street's [[brokerage firm|stock brokerage houses]] and the [[Montreal Stock Exchange]] were the most important in all of Canada. At the time of its construction in 1928, the [[Royal Bank of Canada]]'s [[Old Royal Bank Building, Montreal|new headquarters at 360 St. James Street]]  was the tallest building in the [[British Empire]]. The St James St. area was also the [[Bank of Montreal Head Office, Montreal|head office of the Bank of Montreal]], and the informal head office of the [[Bank of Nova Scotia]].  It was also home to the major brokerage houses such as [[Nesbitt, Thomson and Company]], [[Pitfield, MacKay, Ross]], [[Royal Securities Corporation]] and others.

Some companies, past and present, located on St. James Street are:

* 50 : [[Ottawa Hotel, Montreal]]

* 393 : Crown Trust Co.
* 437 : [[Eastern Townships Bank]] then the Commercial Union Assurance Co. and the [[Bank of Nova Scotia]]

East of [[Place d'Armes]] square, the street was home to two French-Canadian financial institutions, the [[Banque Canadienne Nationale]] and the [[Banque du Peuple]], long gone now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape15/eng/15text5a.htm Old Montreal Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
A steady erosion of its status as Canada's financial centre began with the opening of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959, followed by the political uncertainty as a result of the election of the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|separatist]] [[Parti Québécois]] provincial government in 1976, all served as a catalyst for financial institutions to locate elsewhere. A number chose to gradually move their official head offices to [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], while others shifted all future expansion to Toronto or other major Canadian centres. As a result, the St. James Street financial district has all but disappeared.

===Recent history===
[[File:Montreal - Sud-Ouest - Rue Saint-Jacques.jpg|thumb|right|Saint Jacques Street in [[Little Burgundy]]]]
During the 1990s, the [[Montreal Expos]] baseball club unveiled plans to build a new stadium in downtown Montreal, right off St. Jacques Street, just south of the [[Bell Centre]]. When provincial funding for the new building fell through, the Expos did not continue with their plan and sold the property to developers. That stretch of Saint Jacques is now undergoing considerable [[gentrification]].

Today, the stretch of St. Jacques Street between McGill Street and [[Saint Laurent Boulevard]] is still notable mostly for its grand [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] buildings on the part of the street running through the Old Montreal district. These include [[Bank of Montreal]]'s domed [[Bank of Montreal Head Office, Montreal|Montreal Main Branch]], the former headquarters of [[Royal Bank of Canada]], the [[Canadian Bank of Commerce]], the [[Molson Bank]] and the [[Canada Life Financial Corporation|Canada Life Insurance Company]]. More modern buildings include the [[Montreal World Trade Centre]] and the [[Tour de la Bourse|Stock Exchange Tower]].

Farther west, St. Jacques Street runs through the residential neighbourhoods of [[Little Burgundy]], [[Saint-Henri]], [[Notre-Dame-de-Grâce]] and [[Lachine, Quebec|Lachine]]. [[Lionel-Groulx (Montreal Metro)|Lionel-Groulx]] and [[Place-Saint-Henri (Montreal Metro)|Place-Saint-Henri]] Metro stations are located on St. Jacques in the [[South West]] borough; to the west, it gives access to [[Quebec Autoroute 20|Autoroute 20]] in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, where it passes through a largely industrial and large-surface commercial district at the top of the [[Falaise Saint-Jacques]]. The [[McGill University Health Centre]] superhospital will front Saint-Jacques in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.

'''Shabtai Shikhman''' ({{Lang-he|שבתאי שיכמן}}, born 10 September 1915, died 9 January 1987) was an [[Israel]]i politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Herut]] and [[Gahal]] between 1959 and 1965.

==Biography==
Born in an area that became [[Poland]], Shikhman joined the [[Betar]] youth movement, and was commander of the branch in his home town. He joined the local branch of [[Hatzohar]], and served as the local branch's deputy chairman.

In 1935 he made [[aliyah]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]], where he served as secretary of HaOved HaLeumi until 1941. In 1949 he founded the Sela housing company and worked as its general manager.

In [[Israeli legislative election, 1959|1959]] he was elected to the Knesset on the Herut list. He was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1961|1961]], but lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1965|1965 elections]], shortly before which Herut had formed the Gahal alliance.

He died in 1987 at the age of 71.

'''Tancredo de Almeida Neves''' &lt;small&gt;[[Secular Franciscan Order|SFO]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPA-pt|tɐ̃ˈkɾedu dʒi aw'mejdɐ ˈnɛvis}}) (March 4, 1910 – April 21, 1985) was a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] [[politician]], lawyer, and entrepreneur. He served as [[Minister of Justice]] and [[Interior Minister]] from 1953 to 1954, Prime Minister from 1961 to 1962, [[Finance Minister]] in 1962, and as [[Governor of Minas Gerais]] from 1983 to 1984. He was elected [[President of Brazil]] in 1985, but died before he took office.

He began his political career with the [[Progressistas]] (PP) of [[Minas Gerais]], for whom he served as city councilman of São João del Rei from 1935 to 1937. He received the majority of votes and became President of the Municipal Legislature.&lt;ref name=acervo/&gt; He was elected state representative (1947–1950) and congressman (1951–1953) as a member of the [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945–65)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD). He took office in June 1953, acting as [[Minister of Justice]] and [[Minister of Internal Affairs]] until the suicide of President [[Getúlio Vargas]].&lt;ref name=acervo/&gt;

In 1954 Tancredo was elected [[Congress of Brazil|congressman]] and served for one year. From 1956 to 1958 he was director of Banco de Crédito Real de Minas Gerais and President of Carteira de Redescontos of [[Banco do Brasil]] from 1956 to 1958. From 1958 to 1960 he headed the Department of Finance of [[Minas Gerais]]. Tancredo Neves was nominated [[Prime Minister of Brazil]] after President [[Jânio Quadros]] resigned and the introduction of the Parliamentary Regime in 1961 and was re-elected congressman in 1963.

He was a leader of the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (MDB), a political party created on October 27, 1965 through the Institutional Act Number Two (AI-2) which abolished all existing parties and the institution of bi-partisanship. He was later re-elected congressman several times between 1963 and 1979. After the re-institution of a multiparty system Tancredo became a [[Senate of Brazil|senator]] as a member of the MDB in 1978 and founded the "Popular Party" (PP) with which he continued to serve until 1982. He joined the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB) the following year and was elected governor of [[Minas Gerais]] where he served from 1983 to 1984. During this period, there was great political turmoil in favour of the movement known as [[Diretas Já]], a civil action that mobilized the youth and proclaimed direct elections for president. But with the defeat of the "Dante de Oliveira amendment", mandated direct elections for president in 1984. Tancredo was chosen to represent the "Democratic Alliance", a coalition of opposition parties.

In 1984, Tancredo ran for president with the help of [[Ulysses Guimarães]]. He was elected [[President of Brazil]] on January 15, 1985 by the [[indirect voting]] of an [[electoral college]]. Tancredo fell gravely ill on the eve of his inauguration, March 14, 1985, and died 39 days afterwards. He died of [[diverticulitis]] and never assumed his position as president. While still ill, he was awarded the "Grand Cross of Value, Loyalty and Merit" by the "Military Order of the Tower and Spade" on March 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordens.presidencia.pt Ordens Honoríficas Portuguesas]&lt;/ref&gt; Although he died before taking his post as president his name has been included in the gallery of Brazilian presidents according to law 7.4653,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.senado.gov.br/legislacao/ListaPublicacoes.action?id=130145&amp;tipoDocumento=LEI&amp;tipoTexto=PUB Lei nº 7.465, de 21 de abril de 1986]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; passed on the first anniversary of his death. Tancredo was the last Mineiro (from the State of [[Minas Gerais]]) President to be elected in the 20th century (before [[Dilma Rousseff]] in 2010).

Neves was one of the most important Brazilian politicians in the 20th century and one of the major statesmen of Brazilian history. In July 2012 he was elected one of the “[[O Maior Brasileiro de Todos os Tempos|100 greatest Brazilians of all time]]” in a competition organized by [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão]] (SBT) and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbt.com.br/omaiorbrasileiro/candidatos O Maior Brasileiro de Todos os Tempos - Candidatos]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Tancredo Neves was born in [[São João del-Rei]], [[Minas Gerais]] and was of mostly [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]], but also [[Austrian Brazilian|Austrian]] descent&lt;ref&gt;KOIFMAN, Fábio. Presidentes do Brasil: De Deodoro a FHC.&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated in [[law]]. The Neves family name comes from an [[Azores|Azorean]] great-great-grandfather.&lt;ref name="geneall.net"&gt;http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=467915&lt;/ref&gt; Tancredo Neves was a descendant of [[Amador Bueno]], a noted [[Paulista (Sao Paulo)|paulista]] from the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial Brazilian era]].&lt;ref name="geneall.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=1052258&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents were Francisco de Paula Neves and Antonina de Almeida Neves. After completing studies in his hometown, he moved to Belo Horizonte and enrolled in Law School. He was a sympathizer of the "Liberal Alliance" that had brought [[Getúlio Vargas]] to power with the outbreak of the 1930 Revolution.

Tancredo studied at [[Colégio Santo Antônio]], a [[Franciscan]] school, concluding his studies in humanities in 1927. In 1928 he began studies at the [[Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais]] where he obtained a bachelor's degree in Law, in 1932 and was a public prosecutor in 1933.&lt;ref name=acervo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acervo.estadao.com.br/noticias/personalidades,tancredo-neves,538,0.htm|title=Tancredo Neves|publisher=Acervo Estadão|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his political career as a member of the [[City council|legislative chamber]] of his hometown in 1934, and was elected in 1947 to the Minas Gerais state legislature. Three years later he became a representative of his state in the [[National Congress of Brazil|Brazilian Chamber of Deputies]]. In 1953 he was appointed Minister of Justice by President [[Getúlio Vargas]]. Neves served in that post until Vargas committed suicide in 1954. In 1960, Neves ran unsuccessfully for governor of Minas Gerais.

Tancredo was married to Risoleta Guimarães Tolentino and they had three children. He received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Coimbra]], and was called “Doctor Tancredo” by his close colleagues. He is the grandfather of [[Aécio Neves]], who was Minas Gerais’ governor between 2003 and 2010 and is currently{{when|date=February 2018}} a senator.

==Politician, Mineiro-style==
During the Old Republic, Tancredo opposed [[Artur Bernardes]], president of Brazil. He was launched into politics through the municipal political leader Augusto Viegas, to whom he remained grateful. In 1984, when asked about the political parties he belonged to by the newspaper ''Pasquim'', he explained that he had chosen his parties, like everyone from Minas Gerais did, according to municipal issues.

He joined the [[Progressive Party (Brazil)|Progressive Party]] (PP) of Minas Gerais, party which was formed by members of the “Mineiro Republican Party”, who supported the Revolution in 1930. Later, when the “Progressive Party” was extinct, he joined the “Mineiro Nationalist Party”.

Tancredo was not able to finance his candidacy as state representative in 1934, but he was elected São João del Rei's city councilman in 1935 and president of the City Council when he became the mayor. After the closure of the municipalities and the institution of the “New State” on November 10, 1937, Tancredo was the President of São João del Rei's Board of Councilmen.

After concluding his term of office as city councilman, Tancredo returned to advocacy and was an attorney for his city's railway union. He was also an entrepreneur in the textile sector for some time. According to the newspaper ''Pasquim'', Governor Benedito Valadares invited him to become chief of police in [[Belo Horizonte]], but declined, saying he would not serve dictatorships.

Feeling pressured by the international conjuncture dictated by the imminent victory of the allies during World War II, and susceptible to internal pressure and contestation, President Getúlio Vargas cranked up a stratagem to liberate the ‘New State”. With that, the political framework that had been erected under auspicious democrats saw a new political college emerge.

On April 8, 1945, the [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) was created in Minas Gerais and was controlled by Benedito Valadares, who had been nominated as federal intervener of Minas Gerais on December 15, 1933. He governed until Getúlio Vargas was deposed on October 29, 1945. His fall opened way to the elections for president of the republic and for members of the [[Brazilian Constituent Assembly (1988)|National Constituent Assembly]] on December 2 of the same year. The Assembly proclaimed the new Constitution on September 18, 1946. Once the Constitution was in force, there were elections for state governor and members of the National Congress and state legislature in January, 1947.

Tancredo Neves was elected Minas Gerais' state representative by Benedito Valadare's PSD, and was designated as one of the spokesmen of the state Constitution of Minas Gerais. Once his work with the Constituent Assembly was over, he assumed leadership of the [[Social Democratic Party]] workbench and led the opposition to Milton Campos' government. Milton Campos was part of the [[National Democratic Union (Brazil)|National Democratic Union]] (UDN), which had reached the "Liberty Palace" after a split in the PSD of Minas Gerais. Due to a fire in the building of the old "Legislative Assembly of Minas Gerais", very few documents of that Constituent Assembly were left intact.

He was elected congressman in 1950, and [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] was elected Governor of Minas Gerais, defeating situationist {{ILL|Gabriel Passos|pt}}. In 1953, Juscelino and Getúlio agreed to appoint Tancredo Neves minister of justice of Minas Gerais, a post which had to be filled by a delegate of the PSD of Minas Gerais. Tancredo left the parliamentary seat and began to serve as Minister of Justice on June 26, 1953. During his office, two laws were sanctioned, the "Press Law," Law 2.083 in 1953 and Law 2.252 on [[statutory rape]].

As Minister of Justice during Getúlio Vargas' administration, Tancredo offered to take on the Cabinet of War, which was responsible for arresting rebel military and to head the democratic resistance.&lt;ref name=jb&gt;{{cite web |title=Tancredo: o estadista que fez o país chorar |url=http://www.jb.com.br/pais/noticias/2010/03/03/tancredo-o-estadista-que-fez-o-pais-chorar/|publisher=Jornal do Brasil |accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Minister of Justice, he opened investigations into several cases of torture and exploitation of minors. He closed the "Service of Assistance to Minors" (SAM) after journalist Villas-Boas Corrêa's denunciation. He visited the location with the journalist in the middle of the night. He ordered that the doors be broken open, and they found inside the place dirty beds and girls who were "piled up as rags" and had injuries. Without hesitation, the very next day, Tancredo ordered the place to be closed for investigations and renovation.&lt;ref name=jb/&gt;

He resigned as minister after Getúlio Vargas' suicide on August 24, 1954, twenty days after the assault against journalist [[Carlos Lacerda]]. The incident resulted in the death of Major Rubens Florentino Vaz of the Brazilian Air Force, and generated a great political crisis. Café Filho then took office as President.&lt;ref name=jb/&gt;

According to the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, Tancredo would have received a copy of Getúlio's Testament-letter, which would be revealed at the time of his death. But, Leonel Brizola's version of the story is different, according to him, it was João Goulart who received it and who read it at Getúlio Vargas' funeral in [[São_Borja,_Rio_Grande_do_Sul|São Borja]]. Tancredo was giften a Parker-21 fountain pen by Getúlio, since then been passed down to his grandson, Aécio Neves, former Governor of Minas Gerais.&lt;ref name=jb/&gt;

Journalist Pedro Jorge de Castro narrated in his book ''Carlos Castelo Branco – Brazil's Journalist'', the episode about the fountain pen, saying that once the meeting with the ministers was over, Getúlio went up to his apartment at the "Catete Palace" and then turned to bid good-bye to Minister of Justice, Tancredo Neves, and gave him the gold Parker-21 pen, and said before taking his life: "To the sure friend, in unsure times."

Benedito Valadares, Juscelino Kubitschek and Getúlio Vargas were Tancredo's main mentors in politics. Tancredo remained loyal to Getúlio's memory, opposing [[João Café Filho]]'s administration, and was one the people who articulated Juscelino Kubitschek's candidacy as president, in the 1955 elections. Because he had not left his post in Getúlio's ministry, Tancredo did not run for re-election as congressman in October, 1954. He was nominated President of "Credit Bank of Minas Gerais" by Governor Clóvis Salgado da Gama.&lt;ref&gt;Substituto legal de Juscelino Kubitschek quando este renunciou, em 31 de janeiro de 1955, ao cargo de governador para concorrer à Presidência. JK foi eleito presidente em 3 de outubro de 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 Juscelino Kubitschek nominated Tancredo for "carteira de redesconto" (a board of directors) at "Bank of Brazil," which he was a part of until 1958, when he was nominated secretary of Treasury under Bias Fortes' administration. Taking the post as Secretary of Finance, which he served until 1960, fact that stopped Tancredo from running the legislative elections in 1958. He then left the post in order to run for governor of Minas Gerais, but was defeated by [[José de Magalhães Pinto]] of the "National Democratic Union."

==Prime Minister==
[[File:Presidente João Goulart na posse de Tancredo Neves como Primeiro-Ministro.tif|thumb|President João Goulart at the inauguration of Tancredo Neves as Prime Minister, 1961. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]
On August 25, 1961, Tancredo pronounced the installation of [[parliamentarism]]; therefore, preventing [[João Goulart]] from assuming presidency under a [[Coup d'état|Military Coup]]. After more than a week of uncertainty, all the sectors directly involved in the crisis concluded that the solution to the dead-lock would have to be political and not military. So, with the developing negotiations, a constitutional amendment was presented, that would convert the presidencialist regime to a parliamentary one. This change greatly reduced the President's power, and was considered satisfactory by the military officers. Tancredo then travelled to [[Montevideo]] in order to obtain Goulart's agreement, and returned to Brasília on the 1st of September, having fulfilled his mission. The amendment was approved by Congress on the 2nd and opened way to Goulart's return, assuming the presidency on September 7.

On the following day, the new president sent a message to Congress (which was approved with 259 votes against 22), that designated Tancredo Neves as Prime-Minister.

The first parliamentary cabinet aimed to build a vast political structure, and which was able to regain dialogue among the main parties of the country was composed by Antônio de Oliveira Brito [[Minister of Education]], Armando Monteiro Filho [[Minister of Agriculture]] and [[Ulysses Guimarães]], Minister of Industry and Commerce from the PSD; Francisco Clementino de San Tiago Dantas [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and Estácio Souto Maior [[Minister of Health]] from the PTB; Virgílio Távora [[Minister of Transportation]] and Gabriel Passos [[Ministry of Mines and Energy (Brazil)|Minister of Mines and Energy]] from the [[National Democratic Union (Brazil)]]; [[André Franco Montoro]] [[Ministry of Labor and Employment (Brazil)|Minister of Labor and Social Security]] from the party Partido Democrata Cristão (PDC); Walter Moreira Sales [[Minister of Finance]]; General João de Segadas Viana, Minister of Warfare, Ângelo Nolasco de Almeida, Minister of Marine and Brigadier Clóvis Monteiro Travassos, Minister of Air force.

Tancredo temporarily occupied the seat of the [[Ministry of Justice]] from September 8 to October 13 while he waited for the [[Social Progressive Party]](PSP) which had former Governor of São Paulo, [[Adhemar Pereira de Barros]] as President, to indicate a name that would solidify his support to the cabinet and replace him. Ademar suggested Congressman from the state of Goiânia, Alfredo Nasser, who accepted and assumed post, replacing Tancredo.

The program presented by the Cabinet to the Chamber on September 28 which was approved on that same day, was relatively generic in the way its terms had been formulated. The presentation of such program had the goal of fulfilling a formality that was inseparable from the nature of the new regime, rather than to determine a government policy ''per se''. It defended the practice of periodical salary adjustments that were compatible with the expanding inflation indexes. The program complimented “Operation Pan-American” and pastoral pontifical Mater et Magistra. It approved the agrarian reform “as an essential first step towards the integration of countrymen into our economic life”. And it proclaimed to be identified with an open-door policy towards foreign capital. The new government also defended the existence of a law that would control the transfer of profits abroad, as long as it did not discouraged foreign investors, considered vital to the defrayment of the national economic development.

The first parliamentary cabinet was formed during a serious politico-military crisis, but was able to decrease the rivalries between the main political chains in the country. However, the peoples’ dissatisfaction continued to grow and their protests against high inflation and for larger salary adjustments, multiplied. The crisis that followed [[Jânio Quadros]] resignation had paralyzed the country for thirteen days, which only contributed to the increase of the economical crisis. The continuous dead-lock labor negotiations resulted in an explosion of successive strikes. Several of Petrobrás’ units were ceased for forty days while Mining and Energy Minister, Gabriel Passos faced difficulties inside his own administration in trying to promote the replacement of Petrobras’ president and director.
[[File:Tancredo de Almeida Neves, primeiro ministro..tif|left|thumb|Tancredo de Almeida Neves, Prime Minister, 1962. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil]]]]
According to Tancredo, the parliamentary cabinet considered the agrarian reform “an issue of absolute priority on the government’s agenda” and it helped the minister of Agriculture create the commission that was in charge of evaluating and apprizing the studies and proposals on the issue. In January, 1962, the government received an agrarian reform project from the senator of Minas Gerais’, Senator Milton Campos, from the UDN. And a month later, the Department of Agriculture presented its own project. On February 15 the government created the “Agrarian Reform National Council”, composed by Hélder Câmara (auxiliary Bishop of Rio de Janeiro), Pombpeu Acióli Borges, Paulo Schilling, and Edgar Teixeira Leite who was responsible for defining the property areas to be reformed. Meanwhile, social tension was increasing in the interior, especially in the Northeast region. The assassination of “Farmers League” President, João Pedro Teixeira (PB), started protest manifestations that were soon prohibited by Commander of the Army, General [[Artur da Costa e Silva]]. Tancredo Neves attributed the turmoil generated by the countrymen to the existence of “an archaic rural structure” and took the initiative to propose political measures aimed at solving the problem, such as the “Rural Union Plan” which was approved by the office council and largely expanded a contingent of sixteen million agricultural workers, including the illiterate.

During this period the escalation of the economic crisis was paired with the radicalization of the political struggles between currents that defended the so-called “base reforms” (constitutional, agrarian, urban, banking and tax reforms) and the conservative forces that opposed them, and accused the government of sponsoring social agitation. On May 1, 1962, Goulart gave a speech in [[Volta Redonda]], in [[Rio de Janeiro]], defending the urgency of reforms and the return of a presidencialist regime that would safeguard the actions of a strong and stable executive power. Therefore, the conservative sectors’ mistrust in the government's intentions grew. In this context, Tancredo Neves’ cabinet – that was characterized by a policy that was committed to obtaining a large national consensus – started to lose the reason for its existence. On June 6 the cabinet, including the prime-minister, resigned in mass. Its members were then able to run for parliamentary elections in October of the same year, and Tancredo was elected congressman in Minas Gerais. When Tancredo reported to Congress, he highlighted that the estimated deficit was around 200 billion cruzeiros (former currency), but the forecast increase of the public service salaries would elevate the amount to 330 billion.  During his term as congressman, Tancredo claimed to have had partial success in his goal of pacifying the national political mood.

Law 4.070 from June 15, 1962 that elevated [[Acre (state)|Acre]]'s territory to the category of State and Law 4.024 from December 20, 1961 which presented the first “Foundation and Guidelines of National Education” can be highlighted in the period of his office as prime-minister.

==Opposition to the Military Regime==
[[Image:Aecio Tancredo Neves.jpg|thumb|Aécio Neves giving a speech at the Chamber of Deputies in tribute to Tancredo Neves's 100th birthday.]]
Back at the House of Representatives, Tancredo maintained his support of [[João Goulart]]’s administration until he was deposed by the Military Coup in 1964. Tancredo was one of the few politicians who went to see João Goulart off at the [[Salgado Filho Airport]], in [[Porto Alegre]], when he left to [[Uruguay]] on [[exile]]. He was the only member of the Social Democratic Party who did not vote for General [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco]] during the presidential elections by the National Congress on April 11th, 1964. 
With the end of the existing multiparty system, [[José de Magalhães Pinto]] was invited to join the [[National Renewal Alliance Party]], also known as ARENA. He politely declined the invitation due to the presence of his adversaries from the UDN, especially [[José de Magalhães Pinto]] from the new situationist college.

Although Tancredo had been João Goulart’s prime-minister and friend, he did not have his political rights annulled during the Military Coup thanks to his influence on the military.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;COUTO, Ronaldo Costa,''História Indiscreta da ditadura e da abertura'',Editora Record, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a moderate objector of the Military Regime of 1964, Tancredo soon sought shelter in the  “Brazilian Democratic Movement” (DMB). He was re-elected congressman in 1966, 1970 and 1974. During his parliamentary performance, he tried hard to avoid conflicts with the military government, and was part of MDB's moderate wing. He did not object to dialogue with the situacionist forces. That showed a posture that was contrary to the one the MDB's “authentic” wing had. In 1978 he was elected senator in Minas Gerais.

Tancredo founded the “Popular Party” in 1980 and was elected as its president. He did that by gathering moderates from the MDB and the ARENA around him, including his old rival [[José de Magalhães Pinto]], during President João Goulart's administration which had recreated a multiparty system in 1979.

In 1980 Tancredo defended the incorporation of the Popular Party into the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB) when faced with difficulties created by the electoral rules that would be applied in the 1982 elections. As a result, he was chosen as national vice-president of PMDB, and on that same year, was elected Governor of [[Minas Gerais]] after a tough dispute with [[Democratic Social Party]] candidate, Eliseu Resende. His running mate and Vice Governor, [[Hélio Garcia]], gave him the support that was fundamental to his election.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;{{cite news|first=|last= |title=Hélio Garcia, ex-governador de Minas Gerais, morre em Belo Horizonte |url=http://g1.globo.com/minas-gerais/noticia/2016/06/helio-garcia-ex-governador-de-minas-gerais-morre-em-belo-horizonte.html |work=[[G1 (website)]] |date=2014-06-06 |accessdate=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garcia was very knowledgeable about the small counties in Minas Gerais, which Tancredo used to call “grotões”. His victory did not come easily due to electoral statutes of the time which forecast the “attached vote” obligating citizens to vote for mayor, city councilman and governor of the same party. That favored the PDS, since it was a strong party in the small counties of Minas Gerais.
During his inauguration ceremony as governor, he pronounced this phrase that became famous: “Mineiros, Minas Gerais’ first priority is its own freedom”.

He resigned the post as senator just a few days before assuming the [[Palácio da Liberdade]], and was substituted by Alfredo Campos. He then nominated Hélio Garcia for Mayor of [[Belo Horizonte]]. Tancredo maintained his conciliatory stance even when in executive office, which guaranteed a good standing with the Federal Government. He renounced his seat as state governor on August 14, 1984 in order to run for presidency, and turned the government of Minas Gerais over to Hélio Garcia.

=="Diretas Já" and the Electoral College==
[[Image:Tancredo Neves e Aécio Neves.jpg|250px|thumb|Tancredo Neves in [[Brasília]], 1984]]
On March 15, 1983, the elected governors took office, and debates around President João Figueiredo's succession began. During his address at the end of 1982, the President abdicated from coordinating debates around his succession, and put the issue in the hands of his party, the PDS. The lack of a consensus by the PDS in appointing a name demoted cracks in the governmental college. The college later appointed Mário Andreazza as [[Minister of Internal Affairs]], [[Marco Maciel]] as [[senator]], and [[Paulo Maluf]] as congressman, whom all brought a significant part of the PDS with them. Vice-president [[Aureliano Chaves]] immediately started having conflicts with President Figueiredo, and that only complicated the process of succession.

Talks towards Tancredo's candidacy as president began in 1983 when he received a visit led by [[José Fragelli]] who brought 15 senators from the PMDB with him. The group proposed his candidacy as president in the elections that were set by the Electoral College and scheduled for January 15, 1985.

In the beginning of that year, Fragelli organized a group of 14 senators, all of whom were willing to work for the presidential campaign, to visit Governor Tancredo Neves. It was Senator Fragelli himself, who after this meeting told Senator Pedro Simon that if the PMDB decided to be part of the Electoral College, their candidate would then be Tancredo Neves”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senado.gov.br/sf/senadores/presidentes/p_nova_rep_Jose_Fragelli.asp Biografia do Senador José Fragelli na Galeria dos Presidentes, no site do Senado Federal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other segments of the military regime opposition acted differently, and included the re-institution of direct presidential elections in their agenda. The opposition's first action took place in the county of [[Pernambuco]], led by Mozart de Abreu e Lima, on the same day that the Military Regime completed its 19th year, March 31, 1983. The manifestations that occurred in the [[Northeast of Brazil]] resulted from a manifesto by the ten opposition governors (nine from the PMDB and one from the PDT), which demanded the re-establishment of direct presidential elections.

The very next day, a commission supporting the [[Diretas Já]] was formed in the capital of [[São Paulo]] and gathered ten thousand people. They were frustrated with the rejection of the constitutional amendment from April 25, 1984, called Dantes de Oliveira. Many other commissions were formed between January and April, 1984 and were given the name “Direct-Now Campaign”.

In April, 1984 Tancredo Neves gathered with more than one million, five hundred thousand people in the Vale do Anhangabaú in support of the [[Diretas Já]] movement. Tancredo was the first one to give a speech and received a massive applause when he said: “The time has come for us to free our nation from this confusion that has overtaken the country in the past twenty years”. He then continued to defend the approval of Congress’ amendment, stating that “those members of the parliament who voted against the amendment would have to leave Congress since they no longer represented the people’s interests”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jblog.com.br/hojenahistoria.php?itemid=20637|title="Diretas Já" reúne 1 milhão 300 mil pessoas no Anhangabaú em São Paulo|publisher=Jornal do Brasil|accessdate=17 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305205530/http://www.jblog.com.br/hojenahistoria.php?itemid=20637|archive-date=5 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[José Sarney]], President of the PDS, was very aware of the risks surrounding such a large fragmentation inside his party, so he proposed to his affiliates, the realization of a pre-election that would determine the candidate to the presidency. His proposal was quickly repelled by the “malufistas” who interpreted it as a way to derail the leader's candidacy. This fact led Sarney to leave the PDS presidency and to abandon his party a few days afterwards. He was later followed by [[Jorge Bornhausen]], who also left the party.

Governors from the PMDB and [[Leonel Brizola]] from the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)]] PDT announced their support of Tancredo Neves as a candidate from the opposition in the elections of the Electoral College (that was composed of the National Congress and representatives from the [[Legislative Assemblies of Brazilian states|Legislative Assemblies]]). In contrast, [[Aureliano Chaves]] and [[Marco Maciel]] were removed from the dispute, which left [[Paulo Maluf]] and Mário Andreazza as candidates. However, Maluf's victory led his opponents to support Tancredo.

After an agreement was made between the PMDB and a dissident movement from the PDS called “Liberal Front”, it was established that Tancredo Neves would be the candidate for president, and that José Sarney (former [[National Renewal Alliance Party]] (ARENA) member and who had left the PDS to join the PMDB) would be the candidate for vice-president. The “Liberal Front” emerged in 1984 from a divergence in the PMDB, party which later became the “Liberal Front Party”, today's Democrats. This dissident movement was ignited in the PDS when Paulo Maluf, former governor of São Paulo, won the internal dispute inside the PDS against Minister of Home Affairs, Mário Andreazza. Maluf was then chosen by the PDS to be their candidate for President against Tancredo Neves, in the [[Electoral college]] on January 15, 1985.
Tancredo secretly wanted businessman [[Antônio Ermírio de Moraes]] to be vice-president. Ermírio de Moraes, born in a traditional family from [[Pernambuco]], was business leader in [[São Paulo]]. His father, José Ermírio de Moraes had been senator through the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labour Party]] (PTB) in Pernambuco and was a friend of [[Getúlio Vargas]]. His secret was revealed and the possibility of Antônio becoming vice-president was discarded in São Paulo.

The PMDB had minority seats in the [[Electoral college]], and for that reason, it needed to gain votes from the PDS to be able to elect a president.

At that time, the candidates for president and vice-president had to be from the same party, and party coalitions where not allowed. Sarney was able to affiliate himself to the PMDB because he had been senator through the [[National Renewal Alliance Party]] (ARENA) in 1978, party which had been extinct since then. Therefore, his change in parties was not considered by the existing electoral rules, as an infidelity worthy of losing a mandate, since Sarney was not leaving a party by which he had been elected. This was not the case with Marco Maciel, who could not change parties since he had been elected senator in Pernambuco through the PDS in 1982. Aureliano Chaves could not be a candidate for president through the PMDB, even though he had been elected vice-president through the ARENA in 1978, since he had been the President as a substitute for João Figueiredo, becoming therefore, ineligible for president. Aureliano was also ineligible for vice-president because at the time, re-election was not allowed.

Tancredo was cast as candidate for having approval by the military and for being considered a moderate. In the military arena, the support that former President Ernesto Geisel offered was very decisive. But, Tancredo's moderation was a target of criticism by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]] (PT), who did not accept the [[Electoral college]].

Tancredo also gained influence inside the [[Democratic Social Party]] PDS when meeting with governors of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] (all nine of them were elected by the PDS and were, in majority, politicians from a new generation that admired Tancredo) during the meetings with the Superintendency for the Development of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]].  Minas Gerais belonged to the SUDENE because its North region was part of the drought area known as “Drought Polygon”. Many of these governors moved to the “Liberal Front” that later became the [[Democrats (Brazil)|Liberal Front Party]] (PFL). Among Tancredo's admirers, was former Governor of Bahia, [[Antônio Carlos Magalhães]]. 
Antônio Carlos reacted to the statements made by Air force Minister, Délio Jardim de Matos, who said that whoever abandoned the PDS candidate was a traitor. In response, Antônio Carlos accused Délio Jardim of being such traitor. This was the first time that a minister form the military had been challenged during the Military Regime. From then on, the adherence to Tancredo only grew. The Baiano leader, Antônio Carlos, then added: “To betray the Revolution of 1964 is to support Maluf for president”.

In an interview with the newspaper Pequim in 1984, Tancredo described Maluf as follows: “Maluf symbolizes all of the negative things the Revolution did in the last twenty years”!

Even though they were indirect elections, Tancredo still did many rallies in public places. And, in a speech made during his campaign in the city of Vitória in November, 1984, he said: “To restore democracy is to restore the republic, it is to build a new republic, mission which I have received from the people and which will become reality by the power of not only a politician, but by of all the Brazilian citizens”.

The Military Regime ended in 1985 after João Figueiredo's administration was over. The expression “New Republic” became the way in which the period after 1985 became known in Brazilian politics.

The Tancredo-Sarney alliance was then made official and members of the opposition went on the road to defend their proposals in rallies that were as popular as the ones during the [[Diretas Já]] campaign.

Tancredo Neves who was being hailed as “a conciliation candidate”, was elected president by the Electoral College in 1985. He received 480 votes while Maluf received 180 votes and there were 26 abstentions. 
The majority of these abstentions came from parliamentarians from the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]] (PT). They disobeyed the guidance given by their party and were then removed from it for having voted in Tancredo Neves. Congressmen Aírton Soares, José Eudes and [[Bete Mendes]] were expelled from the PT.

When the results from the elections were announced on January 15, 1985, Tancredo said on a speech: “Let us not be dispersed. Let us remain united as we were on public squares, with the same emotion, the same dignity and the same decision. As Tiradentes, that hero crazed by hope, used to say almost 200 years ago, we can make this country a great nation. Let’s do that”!

His victory was received enthusiastically by the population, and is still considered today as one of the most complex and successful works of “political ingenuity” in the History of Brazilian politics.

Soon after, the Workers' Party PT and the [[Central Única dos Trabalhadores]] CUT started making opposition to Tancredo. On the February 11th, 1985 edition of the newspaper [[Jornal da Tarde]] there was a headline that read: “The CUT and the PT declared war against Tancredo”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At the end of 1984 the polls showed that Tancredo had won the majority of the Electoral College. Fearing a maneuver from João Figueiredo that would extend his mandate two more years, and would establish direct elections for his successor, Tancredo went live on TV and declared that Maluf would waive his candidacy. Maluf reacted by guaranteeing that he would not. And so, with Maluf firmly planted in the dispute, João Figueiredo and the PDS were unable to change the rules of the successor's game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tag/tancredo-neves/|title=Coluna do Ricardo Setti|publisher=Veja|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as Tancredo was elected, he made an international excursion where he met with several Heads of state in the attempt of gaining support for his office, which was being considered uncertain. He only agreed to have surgical operation after several Heads of state had arrived in Brasília for his inauguration. The meetings with Heads of state were a strategic move by Tancredo to make the process of re-democratization irreversible. Tancredo's maneuvers were so successful that they made even Ulysses Guimarães, (referred to as “Mr. Diretas”) abdicate his dispute in order to support him. Their political agreement had included Tancredo's future support of Ulysses in the next elections that would replace him and would be direct elections. This way, Ulysses Guimarães gave up his candidacy to Tancredo.

==Illness and death==
Tancredo had undertaken a very strenuous campaign agenda. He gathered the support of [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]] and state governors, and travelled abroad as the elected president. He had been suffering strong abdominal pain during the days preceding his inauguration. Advised by his doctors to seek treatment, he said: “You can do whatever you want with me… after I take office." Tancredo feared that the military from the so-called “hardliners” would refuse to give power to the vice-president. He decided to only announce his illness on the day of his inauguration, March 15, 1985 after the Heads of state who were supposed to be present, had arrived in [[Brasília]]. That would have made it harder for a political rupture to occur. His concern with the assurance of the inauguration was echoed by the phrase he had heard from Getúlio Vargas regarding the subject: “It is not enough to win elections in Brazil, it is necessary to take office!”

But his health did not hold up. He fell ill in Brasília at the “Dom Bosco Sanctuary” during the religious ceremony, with strong continuous [[abdominal pain]]. He was then rushed to the hospital in Brasília. After being admitted to the hospital, he told his cousin Francisco Dornelles-who had been appointed as [[Finance Minister]], that he would not have surgery if he didn’t have the guarantee that outgoing President [[João Figueiredo]] would induct [[José Sarney]]. Dornelles promised his cousin that Sarney would be inducted. According to information compiled by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, the maneuvers to bring Sarney to office were already under [[Ulysses Guimarães]] (President of the Chamber, PMDB-SP), and Leitão de Abreu's [[Chief of Staff of Brazil]] lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memoria.ebc.com.br/agenciabrasil/noticia/2009-04-21/tancredo-so-aceitou-operacao-apos-garantia-da-posse-de-sarney|title=Tancredo só aceitou operação após garantia da posse de Sarney|publisher=Agência Brasil|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official version said that Tancredo had had [[diverticulitis]]. But, later reports indicated that he had a benign but infected [[leiomyoma]]. The existence of a tumor was hidden by the doctors until the last minute, due to the possible impact that the word [[cancer]] would have during that age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gshow.globo.com/programas/mais-voce/v2011/MaisVoce/0,,MUL479145-10345,00.html|title=A verdade sobre a morte de Tancredo Neves|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istoe.com.br/reportagens/13047_O+FATOR+CANCER|title=O fator câncer|publisher=Istoé Independente|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/news/view/agonia_e_morte_de_tancredo_neves|title=Agonia e morte de Tancredo Neves|publisher=Observatório da Imprensa|accessdate=20 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305210055/http://www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/news/view/agonia_e_morte_de_tancredo_neves|archive-date=5 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://almanaque.folha.uol.com.br/brasil_21mar1985.htm|title=TANCREDO TEVE UM TUMOR BENIGNO; OPERADO DE NOVO, ESTADO É GRAVE|publisher=Folha da Manhã|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opovo.com.br/app/acervo/entrevistas/2012/11/02/noticiasentrevistas,2942680/entrevista-de-tancredo-neves.shtml|title=Entrevista de Tancredo Neves|publisher=Acervo|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, newly sworn in Vice President [[José Sarney]] assumed presidential powers and duties as [[acting president]] before the National Congress while Tancredo recovered. He read the statement that Tancredo had written for his inauguration, preaching national conciliation and the installation of a constituent national assembly. It read:&lt;ref&gt;[http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/mat/2010/04/18/discurso-de-tancredo-neves-preparado-para-posse-na-presidencia-da-republica-916374505.asp Discurso de Tancredo Neves preparado para posse na Presidência da República]&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony to transfer power took place at the [[Palácio do Planalto]]. President Figueiredo did not appear, refusing to give the presidential ribbon on to José Sarney since he was a substitute and not his elected successor. It was the official photographer of the palace, Gervézio Batista, who put the ribbon around Sarney's torso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acervo.estadao.com.br/noticias/personalidades,joao-figueiredo,551,0.htm|title=João Figueiredo|publisher=Acervo Estadão|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acervo.oglobo.globo.com/fatos-historicos/tancredo-vence-no-colegio-eleitoral-mas-morre-antes-da-posse-9789890|title=Tancredo vence no Colégio Eleitoral, mas morre antes da posse|publisher=O Globo|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcrs.uol.com.br/site/noticia.php?codn=53947|title=A história revisitada|publisher=Jornal do Comércio|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1985 Sarney fulfilled the promise Tancredo had made during his campaign, to bring Message 330, which called for the convening of a new [[Constituent Assembly]],&lt;ref name=brazil1985&gt;https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;u=http://www2.camara.leg.br/atividade-legislativa/legislacao/Constituicoes_Brasileiras/constituicao-cidada/assembleia-nacional-constituinte/linha-do-tempo&amp;prev=search&lt;/ref&gt; to National Congress.&lt;ref name=brazil1985 /&gt;  This resulted in passage of Constitutional Amendment 26 on November 27, 1985.&lt;ref name=brazil1985 /&gt; New constituents were chosen on November 15, 1986&lt;ref name=brazil1985 /&gt; and later took office on February 1st, 1987, readily initiating the elaboration of the new [[Constitution of Brazil]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jb.com.br/pais/noticias/2013/10/04/marco-entre-a-ditadura-e-a-democracia-constituicao-de-1988-completa-25-anos/|title=Marco entre a ditadura e a democracia, Constituição de 1988 completa 25 anos|publisher=Jornal do Brasil|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was great tension at the time due to the possibility of the growing democratic opening being interrupted. In the event of Sarney not taking office, President of [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]], Ulysses Guimarães, would. Ulysses belonged to the PMDB and was not well accepted by the members of the military. The biggest risk was that a throwback would occur. At the time, the more conservative sectors of the military, the so-called “hardliners” were trying to destabilize the re-democratization process,to maintain with the [[Brazilian military government]] in power.

On the eve of March 15, Ulysses, [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], Sarney and the [[Brazilian Army|Minister of the Army]], Leônidas Pires Gonçalves had a meeting. During the meeting, Leônidas’ interpretation of the 1967 Constitution prevailed, and so, the National Congress decided on Sarney.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

“Hospital da Base” in Brasília was undergoing restoration when Tancredo was admitted, and had demolished its ICU. The poor hospital environment contributed to complications after his surgery, and Tancredo's health declined. He was transferred to the [[Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo]] in [[São Paulo]]. Tancredo had seven surgeries during the time he was in the hospital. He died of a generalized infection on April 21 (same date as [[Tiradentes]]'s death), at the age of 75. Tancredo's death was announced with sadness by the president's official spokesman, [[Antônio Britto]]. Rumors at the time said that Tancredo had been dead for days, and that his death was being concealed so that the political problems resulting from the formation of a new government presided by José Sarney could be resolved and so the date of his death would coincide with Tiradentes’ death.

Antônio Britto, the official spokesman, declared in 1985: “I am sorry to inform that the President of the Republic, Mr. Tancredo de Almeida Neves, died last night at 10:23 p.m. at the Heart Institute of the “Hospital das Clínicas”. There was great commotion in the nation, especially because Neves was the first civilian ever elected president since 1960, when [[Jânio Quadros]] was elected president. He was also the first politician from the military opposition to be elected president since the [[Coup d'état|Military Coup]] of 1964.

Brazil followed the [[Mineiro]] politician's death closely, and organized one of the largest funerals in the country's history. It was calculated at the time that between [[São Paulo]], [[Brasília]], [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[São João del Rei]], more than two million people saw the coffin in procession. A song by Mineiro singer, [[Milton Nascimento]], titled “Coração de Estudante”, marked the episode in the minds of the nation. The elected president foresaw an epitaph during a conversation with a group of friends in the Senate: “Here lies Tancredo Neves unwillingly”. It was never engraved on the tombstone that was placed beside the St. Francis of Assisi Church at the cemetery in São Paulo. His burial in São João del Rei was transmitted on national TV. Ulysses Silveira Guimarães gave a speech before his grave, which was grave number 85 (year of his election). There is a commemorative plaque at the cemetery from the [[President of France]], [[François Mitterrand]], who had met Tancredo during his visit to Europe.

In March, 2008, Tancredo's grave was vandalized and the marble piece from the upper part of the tomb was broken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estadao.com.br/nacional/not_nac142980,0.htm Túmulo de Tancredo Neves é destruído parcialmente em MG] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828085418/http://www.estadao.com.br/nacional/not_nac142980,0.htm |date=2008-08-28 }} - ''[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]'', 19 de março de 2008 (visitado em 19-3-2008).&lt;/ref&gt; He was honored in São João del Rei with the installation of his statue placed next to the statue of [[Tiradentes]].

In 2012, Tancredo's children requested a Habeas Data from the “Federal Justice” in Brasília. The “Federal Medicine Council” and the “Regional Council of the State of Distrito Federal” would have to render them all of the investigations, ethical-disciplinary inquiries, documents, and doctor's testimonials relative to the care delivered to the president.&lt;ref name=carta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartacapital.com.br/politica/familia-de-tancredo-neves-quer-ter-acesso-aos-prontuarios-medicos-dele|title=Família de Tancredo Neves quer ter acesso aos prontuários médicos dele|publisher=Carta Capital|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=em&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.em.com.br/app/noticia/politica/2012/02/09/interna_politica,276938/familia-quer-documentos-medicos-sobre-a-morte-de-tancredo-neves.shtml|title=Família quer documentos médicos sobre a morte de Tancredo Neves|publisher=Estado de Minas|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=estadao&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,filhos-querem-ver-prontuario-de-tancredo-,833374,0.htm|title=Filhos querem ver prontuário de Tancredo|publisher=Estadão|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neves family is represented by Historian and Researcher, Luís Mir, author of the book: “The Patient, The Tancredo Neves Case”, and by attorneys Juliana Porcaro Bisol, Bruno Prenholato and Cláudia Duarte. According to them, the requested documentation will allow for a historical investigation of what really happened, especially because it would contain the identification of the doctors responsible for the President's treatment.&lt;ref name=carta/&gt;&lt;ref name=em/&gt;&lt;ref name=estadao/&gt;

==Legacy and tributes==
[[Image:Monumento-Tancredo-Neves.jpg|thumb|Monument in tribute to Tancredo Neves.]]

Twenty years after his death, the medical body of “Hospital da Base” in Brasília, revealed that they had not announced the correct report at that time. And, that it had not been [[diverticulitis]], but a [[tumor]]. Although it was benign, the discovery of a tumor could have been interpreted as [[cancer]] back then. That would have caused unpredictable effects on the political development of that time.

The vice-president of the time, José Sarney, took office as President, bringing an end to the period of five governments that had been conducted by members of the Military.

Even without taking office, Tancredo Neves is, by law, cast amongst the former Presidents of Brazil, by law 7.465, of April 21, 1986: “Citizen Tancredo de Almeida Neves, elected and not vested due to his death, will be figured in the gallery of those who have been anointed by the Brazilian nation, to the “Supreme Justice”, under all legal matters”.

In 1990, the Tancredo Neves Memorial was opened in his hometown [[São João del Rei]], where a narration of his personal and political journey can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eravirtual.org/pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=170&amp;Itemid=40|title=Memorial Tancredo Neves|publisher=Era Virtual|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 2010, a special stamp was created to celebrate Tancredo's 100th birthday. This event was part of a series of tributes that took place until his birth date, March 4. During a tribute to the former President's 100 birthday in Brasília, his bust was inaugurated in the “Senate Noble Hall”. He is remembered as “a conciliating and an able political articulator”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729193004/http://www.estadao.com.br/estadaodehoje/20100301/not_imp517520,0.php Homenagens relembram os 100 anos de Tancredo Neves] - ''[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]'', 1º de março de 2010 (visitado em 1-3-2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

A city in Bahia was named [[Presidente Tancredo Neves]] in his honor. And, the capital of [[Bahia]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], has its business and finance centers on Avenida Tancredo Neves. [[Tancredo Neves International Airport]] in [[Belo Horizonte]] is named for him. The [[Tancredo Neves Bridge]] connects the Brazilian city of [[Foz do Iguaçu]] with the Argentine [[Puerto Iguazú]], crossing over the [[Iguassu River]].

Tancredo wrote not only articles for newspapers such as ''Estado de Minas'', ''O Correio'' and ''Diário de São João del Rei'', but he was also author of “The parliamentary regime and Brazil’s reality” and “The world scene and national security” published in the magazine ''Revista Brasileira de Estudos Políticos''. He also wrote numerous speeches and opinions that were published in newspapers, magazines and parliamentary annuals.

On February 24, 1983 he took seat 12 in the Minas Gerais Academy of Arts having been sponsored by Alvarenga Peixoto to replace Alberto Donato.

He left two testimonials that were featured on books. The first book was written based on an interview he had given his niece, Lucília de Almeida Neves. It was titled “Tancredo Neves, the trajectory of a Liberal” and narrated his political trajectory until 1954 only, because he stopped the interview there in order to focus completely on the elections in the Electoral College that was taking place in 1985. The second interview turned book was titled “Tancredo talks about Getúlio”, where he gave testimonials about the late president, and his own political actions beside him.

A feature film and a biography were made about Tancredo's life. The film by [[João Batista de Andrade]] was titled “A Céu Aberto”.  And the biography “Tancredo Neves, The trajectory of a Liberal” was written by his niece Lucília de Almeida Neves Delgado and Vera Alice Cardoso. In 2011, the documentary titled “Tancredo – The crossing” by [[Silvio Tendler]] was released.

In 2010, the book titled “The Patient - the Tancredo Neves Case” by Luís Mir was launched. The book gathers documents obtained at “Hospital da Base” in Brasília and from the Heart Institute of [[Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo]] in [[São Paulo]], where Tancredo died. The book shows a surgical guide that better explains his surgeries, and has testimonials from the specialists involved. It reveals what happened “behind the scenes” of the clinical case that altered the path of Brazilian democracy and shook the reputation of doctors in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livrariasaraiva.com.br/produto/3046953/o-paciente-o-caso-tancredo-neves|title=O Paciente - O Caso Tancredo Neves|publisher=Saraiva|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2010/07/25/presidente-tancredo-poderia-ter-tomado-posse-e-foi-vitima-de-erros-medicos-diz-livro.htm|title=Presidente Tancredo poderia ter tomado posse e foi vítima de erros médicos, diz livro|publisher=UOL NOTÍCIAS|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2010, Minas Gerais Governor Aécio Neves, inaugurated the new branch of the “State Government”, denominated “Administrative City Tancredo Neves”.

In 2013, the Tancredo Neves Memorial was inaugurated in [[Brasília]]. It is located on the Panteão da Pátria in the [[Praça dos Três Poderes]]. The space features videos, digital media and original documents portraying steps of the period of the re-democratization of Brazil. It also showcases some of Tancredo's speech manuscripts, letters written by him and to him by personalities such as Juscelino Kubistchek and João Goulart, as well as material from the [[Diretas Já]] campaign, and his certificate as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/politica/memorial-tancredo-neves-e-inaugurado-em-brasilia,983bce2103e01410VgnCLD2000000ec6eb0aRCRD.html|title=Memorial Tancredo Neves é inaugurado em Brasília|publisher=Terra Brasil|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trailer Tracking System==
Trailer tracking systems can provide essential information to trailer operators on; status, location, door activity and history. These systems utilize the information to provide reliable and protected services to shippers of perishable commodities.

Trailer Tracking is also a trucking term in which, when a Semi turns a corner the trailer tires will be closer to the curb (even jump the curb if semi turns to sharp) than the truck cab will be.

Trailer tracking systems require 4 essential components to operate.

==Career==

===Police===
Ashley Tsang joined the Hong Kong Police in January 1966 as a [[Hong Kong Police#Ranks|Probationary Inspector]].&lt;ref name=ts/&gt; From 1987 to 1989 he was in charge of the Narcotics bureau. From 1992 to 1994 he was headed the criminal law division, including the commander for [[Hong Kong island]] region.&lt;ref name="big5x"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-07/03/content_468473.htm|title=曾蔭培簡歷 |publisher=Big5.xinhuanet.com|date=27 September 2005|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 he was director of crime and security department. From 1996 to 1999 he was deputy commissioner of police.&lt;ref name="big5x"/&gt; In 2001, he became the [[Commissioner of Police (Hong Kong)|HK Commissioner of Police]] and retired in 2003.&lt;ref name=ts/&gt;

===Property director===
In May 2004, he joined property firm [[NWS Holdings]], a subsidiary of [[New World Development]], as an executive director. Prior to his brother becoming [[Chief executive of Hong Kong]], there were criticism in 2005 that Tsang Yam-pui moved from a position of highest trust (police commissioner) to an executive of a real estate firm, where the company's profit depend on the government's regulation.&lt;ref name=ts/&gt;

==Controversy==

===NWS deal issue===
As early as June 2003, New World Development wanted to convert the [[Wan Chai]] [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]] car park into a used car venue.&lt;ref name="ts2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GG19Ak10.html|title=Tsang denies influence in brother's job at NWS|publisher=The Standard|date=19 July 2005|accessdate=11 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403095740/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GG19Ak10.html|archivedate=3 April 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Tsang Yam-pui became director, and Donald Tsang became chief executive, the demand by New World was approved. Both brothers denied any association to this deal. A NWS spokesman even had to come out to say they were not involved.&lt;ref name="ts2"/&gt;

As a commissioner, he engaged in a public dispute with a female senior inspector, Sharon Lim, who refused to remove [[Hair highlighting|highlight]]s from her hair, which she had dyed since 1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3898">The '''Ukrainian Internet Association''' (UIA) was founded in November 2000 in [[Kiev]], the capital of [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="ccrc-offence" /&gt; It currently owns the Ukrainian Internet Exchange Network ([[UA-IX]]) network, which is the biggest [[internet exchange]] network in Ukraine. Additionally, in February 2010 it has announced a bid for a company that would monitor Ukrainian internet users population, in addition to two other companies that also monitor it, namely [[Internet Advertisement Association of Ukraine]] and [[Bigmir.net]].

In June 2006 the UIA warned that proposed increased government regulation of the internet in Ukraine would amount to censorship.&lt;ref name="pr-censorship" /&gt; It had made similar complaints previously in October 2003.&lt;ref name="if-complains" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ifee-secret police" /&gt; On 17 July 2003 the government of Ukraine requested service providers to install equipment which would allow all internet traffic to be monitored. The UIA said this was an "unacceptable breach of privacy for Internet users" and that such action was, under then-existing law, illegal.&lt;ref name="rfe-concern" /&gt;

In March 2004 the UIA announced the formation of a committee that would "carry out development of recommendations on conscientious use of the Internet and methods of Internet offences prosecution on the basis of current Ukrainian law."&lt;ref name="ccrc-offence" /&gt;

EuropeMedia has called the UIA "the oldest and one of the most influential organisations in Ukrainian Internet".&lt;ref name="em-left out" /&gt;

'''Chief Usman Mofeyintioluwa Lawal-Osula''' (1910 – December 2, 1972) was a Nigerian businessman with interests across [[insurance]], [[real estate]] and other industries. As a member of the [[Benin Empire|Benin]] royal family, he held a hereditary [[traditional]] [[title]]&lt;ref name="kkeleja1995"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawal Osula v. Lawal Osula (1995) 10SCNJ 84; An Overview|url=http://kkeleja.net/publications/Osula_v_Osula.html|publisher=K. K.

==Legal battle of will==
[[File:Gidley Lawal Osula Britain.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Mr. C. Gidley (left), a former member of the [[Nigeria Police Force]] and Chief U.M. Lawal-Osula]]
The case of the [[will and testament|will]] of Chief U.M. Lawal-Osula has become one of the most notable [[family law]] cases taught around the world as final [[judgment (law)|judgment]] came after 23 years of disputes and court battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bainham|first1=Andrew|title=The International Survey of Family Law: 1997|date=1999|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Kluwer Law International (on behalf of the International Society of Family Law)|location=Netherlands|isbn=90-411-1187-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death in 1972, a will written by Chief U.M. Lawal-Osula dated November 22, 1968 was found.&lt;ref name="unnlawdocs1"/&gt;

By the [[Edo people|Benin]] native law and custom, a Benin traditional chief is succeeded by his eldest son at death but before the death of Chief U.M. Lawal-Osula, he made a [[will and testament|will]] in which he made provisions for his wife and children.&lt;ref name="kkeleja1995"/&gt; However, following the death of U.M. Lawal-Osula, a man who provisions were not made for in the will claimed to be the eldest son of the chief was the [[plaintiff]] and this caused controversy over the question of whether the wife and children (the [[defendants]]) in the will were, in fact, children of U.M. Lawal-Osula.&lt;ref name="kkeleja1995"/&gt;

In 1986, the [[plaintiff]]s initiated an action in which they claimed against the [[defendant]]s that the last [[will and testament|testament]] of the [[testator]] dated November 22, 1968 is null and void in the Bendel State High Court&lt;ref name="kkeleja1995"/&gt; despite the chief explicitly stating ''"...that nobody shall modify or vary this Will. It is my will that the native law and custom of Benin shall not apply to alter or modify this my will."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Dadem |first1= Y.Y.D. |title= Can a Person Subject to Islamic Law Make a Will in Nigeria |journal= Review of Nigerian Law and Practice, Nigerian Law School |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=2008 |page=60 |url= http://www.afrilegstud.com/calsreview/PDF/ajibaye.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1995, two years after the death of the 1st defendant,&lt;ref name="lawpavilionpersonal1995"&gt;{{cite web |title= LYDIA MODUPE LAWAL-OSULA &amp; ORS V.

'''Éditions Gallimard''' ({{IPA-fr|edisjɔ̃ ɡalimaːʁ|lang}}) is one of the leading French book [[publisher]]s. ''[[The Guardian]]'' has described it as having "the best [[backlist]] in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Paul, [http://books.guardian.co.uk/internationalwriting/story/0,6194,348130,00.html "The French Connection"]; ''[[The Guardian]]'', July 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 it and its subsidiaries published 1,418 titles.

Founded by [[Gaston Gallimard]] in 1911, the publisher is now majority-owned by his grandson [[Antoine Gallimard (publisher)|Antoine Gallimard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dictionnaire encyclopédique du Livre en deux volumes | publisher=Éditions du Cercle de la Libraire | author=Pascal Fouché | p=251 | year=2005 | isbn=2-7654-0911-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The publisher was founded on 31 May 1911 in Paris by [[Gaston Gallimard]], [[André Gide]], and [[Jean Schlumberger]] as ''Les Éditions de la [[Nouvelle Revue Française]]'' (NRF).

From its 31 May 1911 founding until June 1919, Nouvelle Revue Française published one hundred titles including ''La Jeune Parque'' by [[Paul Valéry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henri Vignes|author2=Pierre Boudrot|title=Bibliographie des éditions de la Nouvelle Revue française : 26 mai 1911-15 juillet 1919|publisher=Libraire H. Vignes|location=Paris|year=2011|isbn=9782867421822}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michel Jarrety|title=Paul Valéry|isbn=9782010178894|publisher=Hachette supérieur|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; NRF published the second volume of [[In Search of Lost Time]], In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower, which became the first [[Prix Goncourt]]-awarded book published by the company.&lt;ref name="gallimardhist"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Les Échos (newspaper)|title=Gallimard, une histoire si française|date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nouvelle Revue Française adopted the name "Librairie Gallimard" in 1919.

During the [[occupation of France in World War II]], Gaston Gallimard was hosted in [[Carcassonne]] by poet [[Joë Bousquet]]. He returned to [[Paris]] on October 1940 to enter discussions with the Nazi German authorities, who wished to control his publishing company. It was agreed that Gaston Gallimard would still control his company if he collaborated with the authorities and published pro-Nazi writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L'édition française sous l'Occupation : 1940-1944|author={{ill|Pascal Fouché|fr}}|year=1987|publisher=Bibliothèque de littérature française contemporaine de l'Université Paris|oclc=17851738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catalogue ==
Éditions Gallimard's best-selling authors include [[Albert Camus]] (29 million copies), [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]] (26.3 million copies), and [[J.K. Rowling]] (whose ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series sold 26 million copies).&lt;ref name="gallimardhist"/&gt; Other important authors include [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Roald Dahl]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Philip Roth]], [[George Orwell]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Pablo Neruda]], and [[John Steinbeck]].

As of 2011, its catalog consists of 36 [[Prix Goncourt]] winners, 38 writers who have received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], and ten writers who have been awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]].&lt;ref name="gallimardhist"/&gt; In 2010 the company had a turnover of {{€|230|link=yes}} million,&lt;ref name="gallimardhist"/&gt; and over 1,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{ill|Livres hebdo|fr}}, 14 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
