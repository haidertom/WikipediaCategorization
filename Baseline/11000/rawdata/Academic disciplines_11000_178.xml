'''Agroecology''' is the study of [[applied ecology|ecological processes applied]] to [[agriculture|agricultural]] production systems. Bringing [[ecology#Fundamental principles of ecology|ecological principles]] to bear in [[agroecosystem]]s can suggest novel management approaches that would not otherwise be considered. The term is often used imprecisely and may refer to "a science, a movement, [or] a practice".&lt;ref&gt;Wezel, A., Bellon, S., Dor√©, T., Francis, C., Vallod, D., David, C. (2009). Agroecology as a science, a movement or a practice. A review. Agronomy for Sustainable Development (published online)&lt;/ref&gt; Agroecologists study a variety of agroecosystems. The field of agroecology is not associated with any one particular method of [[farming]], whether it be [[Organic farming|organic]], [[Integrated farming|integrated]], or [[Industrial agriculture|conventional]], [[Intensive farming|intensive]] or [[Extensive farming|extensive]]. However, it has much more in common with organic and integrated farming.&lt;ref&gt;Wibblemann et al. (2013) Mainstreaming Agroecology: Implications for Global Food and Farming Systems. {{cite web |url=http://futureoffood.org/pdfs/Coventry_University_2013_Maintstreaming_Agroecology.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522154628/http://futureoffood.org/pdfs/Coventry_University_2013_Maintstreaming_Agroecology.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological strategy==
Agroecologists do not unanimously oppose technology or inputs in agriculture but instead assess how, when, and if technology can be used in conjunction with natural, social and human assets.&lt;ref&gt;Pretty, Jules. 2008. Agricultural sustainability: concepts, principles and evidence. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 363, 447-465.&lt;/ref&gt; Agroecology proposes a context- or site-specific manner of studying agroecosystems, and as such, it recognizes that there is no universal formula or recipe for the success and maximum well-being of an agroecosystem.  Thus, agroecology is not defined by certain management practices, such as the use of [[Biological control|natural enemies]] in place of [[insecticides]], or [[polyculture]] in place of [[monoculture]].

Instead, agroecologists may study questions related to the four system properties of agroecosystems: [[Ecology#Ecosystem productivity|productivity]], [[Ecological stability|stability]], [[sustainability]] and [[equitability]].&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Gordon R. 1985. Agroecosystem analysis. Agricultural Administration, 20, 31-55.&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to disciplines that are concerned with only one or some of these properties, agroecologists see all four properties as interconnected and integral to the success of an agroecosystem. Recognizing that these properties are found on varying spatial scales, agroecologists do not limit themselves to the study of agroecosystems at any one scale: gene-organism-population-community-ecosystem-landscape-biome, field-farm-community-region-state-country-continent-global.

Agroecologists study these four properties through an interdisciplinary lens, using natural sciences to understand elements of agroecosystems such as soil properties and plant-insect interactions, as well as using social sciences to understand the effects of farming practices on rural communities, economic constraints to developing new production methods, or cultural factors determining farming practices.

==Approaches==
Agroecologists do not always agree about what agroecology is or should be in the long-term. Different definitions of the term agroecology can be distinguished largely by the specificity with which one defines the term "ecology", as well as the term's potential political connotations. Definitions of agroecology, therefore, may be first grouped according to the specific contexts within which they situate agriculture.
Agroecology is defined by the [[OECD]] as "the study of the relation of agricultural crops and environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=81 Agroecology], Glossary of Statistical Terms&lt;/ref&gt; This definition refers to the "-ecology" part of "agroecology" narrowly as the natural environment. Following this definition, an agroecologist would study agriculture's various relationships with [[soil health]], water quality, air quality, meso- and micro-fauna, surrounding flora, environmental toxins, and other environmental contexts.

A more common definition of the word can be taken from Dalgaard et al., who refer to agroecology as the study of the interactions between plants, animals, humans and the environment within agricultural systems.  Consequently, agroecology is inherently multidisciplinary, including factors from [[agronomy]], [[ecology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]] and related disciplines.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt; In this case, the "-ecology" portion of "agroecology is defined broadly to include social, cultural, and economic contexts as well. Francis et al. also expand the definition in the same way, but put more emphasis on the notion of food systems.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;

Agroecology is also defined differently according to geographic location. In the global south, the term often carries overtly political connotations. Such political definitions of the term usually ascribe to it the goals of social and economic justice; special attention, in this case, is often paid to the traditional farming knowledge of indigenous populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agroecology.org Agroecology.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422150352/http://www.agroecology.org/ |date=2006-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; North American and European uses of the term sometimes avoid the inclusion of such overtly political goals. In these cases, agroecology is seen more strictly as a scientific discipline with less specific social goals.

===Agro-population ecology===
This approach is derived from the science of ecology primarily based on [[population ecology]], which over the past three decades has been displacing the ecosystems biology of [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]].  Buttel explains the main difference between the two categories, saying that "the application of population ecology to agroecology involves the primacy not only of analyzing agroecosystems from the perspective of the [[population dynamics]] of their constituent species, and their relationships to [[climate]] and [[biogeochemistry]], but also there is a major emphasis placed on the role of [[genetics]]."&lt;ref name=buttel&gt;Buttel, Frederick. "Envisioning the Future Development of Farming in the USA: Agroecology between Extinction and Multifunctionality?" New Directions in Agroecology Research and Education (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous agroecology===

This concept was proposed by political ecologist Josep Gar√≠ to recognise and uphold the integrated agro-ecological practices of many indigenous peoples, who simultaneously and sustainably safeguard, manage and use ecosystems for agricultural, food, biodiversity and cultural purposes at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Gar√≠, Josep A. (2001). Biodiversity and Indigenous Agroecology in Amazonia. Etnoecologica 5 (7): 21-37&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous agroecologies are not systems and practices halted in time, but keep co-evolving with new knowledge and resources, such as that provided by development projects, research initiatives and agro-biodiversity exchanges. In fact, the first agro-ecologists were indigenous peoples that advocated development policies and programmes to support their systems, rather than replacing them.&lt;ref&gt;Gar√≠, Josep A. (2000). The Political Ecology of Biodiversity. DPhil Dissertation, University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusive agroecology===
Rather than viewing agroecology as a subset of agriculture, Wojtkowski&lt;ref&gt;Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2002) Agroecological Perspectives in Agronomy, Forestry and Agroforestry. Science Publishers Inc., Enfield, NH, 356p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2006) Introduction to Agroecology: Principles and Practices. Haworth Press, Binghamton, NY, 404p.&lt;/ref&gt; takes a more encompassing perspective. In this, natural ecology and agroecology are the major headings under ecology. Natural ecology is the study of organisms as they interact with and within natural environments. Correspondingly, agroecology is the basis for the land-use sciences. Here humans are the primary governing force for organisms within planned and managed, mostly terrestrial, environments.

As key headings, natural ecology and agroecology provide the theoretical base for their respective sciences. These theoretical bases overlap but differ in a major way. Economics has no role in the functioning of natural ecosystems whereas economics sets direction and purpose in agroecology.

Under agroecology are the three land-use sciences, [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and [[agroforestry]]. Although these use their plant components in different ways, they share the same theoretical core.

Beyond this, the land-use sciences further subdivide. The subheadings include agronomy, [[organic farming]], traditional agriculture, [[permaculture]], and [[silviculture]]. Within this system of subdivisions, agroecology is philosophically neutral. The importance lies in providing a theoretical base hitherto lacking in the land-use sciences. This allows progress in biocomplex agroecosystems including the multi-species plantations of forestry and agroforestry.

==Applications==
To arrive at a point of view about a particular way of farming, an agroecologist would first seek to understand the contexts in which the farm(s) is(are) involved. Each farm may be inserted in a unique combination of factors or contexts. Each farmer may have their own premises about the meanings of an agricultural endeavor, and these meanings might be different from those of agroecologists. Generally, farmers seek a configuration that is viable in multiple contexts, such as family, financial, technical, political, logistical, market, environmental, spiritual. Agroecologists want to understand the behavior of those who seek livelihoods from plant and animal increase, acknowledging the organization and planning that is required to run a farm.

===Views on organic and non-organic milk production===

Because [[organic agriculture]] proclaims to sustain the health of soils, ecosystems, and people,&lt;ref&gt;IFOAM (International Federation for Organic Agriculture Movements)&lt;/ref&gt; it has much in common with Agroecology;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} this does not mean that Agroecology is synonymous with organic agriculture, nor that Agroecology views organic farming as the 'right' way of farming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Also, it is important to point out that there are large differences in [[Organic food|organic standards]] among countries and certifying agencies.

Three of the main areas that agroecologists would look at in farms, would be: the environmental impacts, animal welfare issues, and the social aspects.

Environmental impacts caused by organic and non-organic milk production can vary significantly. For both cases, there are positive and negative environmental consequences.

Compared to conventional milk production, [[organic milk]] production tends to have lower [[eutrophication]] potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;‚àí&lt;/sup&gt;) and phosphates (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;‚àí&lt;/sup&gt;) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of [[methane]].&lt;ref&gt;Boer, I J. M. 2003. Environmental impact assessment of conventional and organic milk production. Livestock Production Science. Vol 80, p 69‚Äì77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animal welfare]] issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

A key component of animal welfare is freedom to perform their innate (natural) behavior, and this is stated in one of the basic principles of organic agriculture. Also, there are other aspects of animal welfare to be considered ‚Äì such as freedom from hunger, thirst, discomfort, injury, fear, distress, disease and pain. Because organic standards require loose housing systems, adequate bedding, restrictions on the area of slatted floors, a minimum [[forage]] proportion in the [[ruminant]] diets, and tend to limit stocking densities both on [[pasture]] and in housing for dairy cows, they potentially promote good foot and hoof health. Some studies show lower incidence of placenta retention, milk fever, abomasums displacement and other diseases in organic than in conventional dairy herds.&lt;ref&gt;Hovi, M. el al. 2003. Animal health and welfare in organic livestock production in Europe: current state and future challenges. Livestock Production Science. Vol 80, p 41‚Äì53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the level of infections by parasites in organically managed herds is generally higher than in conventional herds.&lt;ref&gt;Bennedsgaard, T.W. et al. 2003. Eleven years of organic dairy production in Denmark: herd health and production related to time of conversion and compared to conventional production. Livestock production science. Vol 80, p 121-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social aspects of dairy enterprises include life quality of farmers, of farm labor, of rural and urban communities, and also includes public health.

Both organic and non-organic farms can have good and bad implications for the [[life quality]] of all the different people involved in that [[food chain]]. Issues like labor conditions, labor hours and labor rights, for instance, do not depend on the organic/non-organic characteristic of the farm; they can be more related to the socio-economical and cultural situations in which the farm is inserted, instead.

As for the public health or [[food safety]] concern, [[organic foods]] are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.

In an organic dairy farm, an agroecologist could evaluate the following:

# Can the farm minimize environmental impacts and increase its level of sustainability, for instance by efficiently increasing the [[productivity]] of the animals to minimize [[waste]] of feed and of land use?
# Are there ways to improve the [[animal health|health status]] of the herd (in the case of organics, by using [[biological pest control|biological controls]], for instance)?
# Does this way of farming sustain good [[quality of life]] for the [[farmer]]s, their families, [[farmworker|rural labor]] and communities involved?

===Views on no-till farming===

[[no-till farming|No-tillage]] is one of the components of [[conservation agriculture]] practices and is considered more environmental friendly than complete [[tillage]].&lt;ref name=Garcia-Torres&gt;Garcia-Torres, L. et al. 2002. Summary of the Workshop on Soil Protection and Sustainable Agriculture organized by the EU Commission DG Environment and the DG Environmental Quality of the Spanish Ministry of Environment (Soria, Spain)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Branco, H. and Lal, R. 2008. Principles of Conservation Management. No Tillage-Farming (Ch.8). Springer Verlag. Netherlands. P. 195&lt;/ref&gt; There is a general consensus that no-till can increase carbon content of topsoils, especially when combined with cover crops, but whether this improves the function of soils as a carbon sink is contested.&lt;ref name=Garcia-Torres/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolliger, A. et al. 2006. Taking stock of the Brazilian "Zero Till Revolution": A review of landmark research and farmers' practice. Adv. Agron. Vol 91, p 47‚Äì110&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Baker, J. M., Ochsner, T. E., Venterea, R. T., &amp; Griffis, T. J. (2007). Tillage and soil carbon sequestration‚ÄîWhat do we really know?. Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment, 118(1-4), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Powlson, D. S., Stirling, C. M., Jat, M. L., Gerard, B. G., Palm, C. A., Sanchez, P. A., &amp; Cassman, K. G. (2014). Limited potential of no-till agriculture for climate change mitigation. Nature Climate Change, 4(8), 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

No-till can contribute to higher [[soil organic matter]] and organic carbon content in soils,&lt;ref name=Calegari&gt;Calegari, A. et al. 2008. Impact of Long-Term No-Tillage and Cropping System Management on Soil Organic Carbon in an Oxisol: A Model for Sustainability. Agronomy Journal. Vol 100, Issue 4, p 1013-1019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, T. and Post, W. 2002. Soil Organic Carbon Sequestration Rates by Tillage and Crop Rotation: A Global Data Analysis. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 66:1930‚Äì1946&lt;/ref&gt; though reports of no-effects of no-tillage in organic matter and organic carbon soil contents also exist, depending on environmental and crop conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Machado, P.L.O.A. and Silva, C.A. 2001. Soil management under no-tillage systems in the tropics with special reference to Brazil. Nutr. Cycling Agroecosyst. Vol 61, p 119‚Äì130&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, no-till can indirectly reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by decreasing the use of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=Calegari /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koga, N. et al. 2003. Fuel consumption-derived CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions under conventional and reduced tillage cropping systems in northern Japan. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment. Vol 99, p 213‚Äì219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most crops can benefit from the practice of no-till, but not all crops are suitable for complete no-till agriculture.&lt;ref name="Fleizo et al. 2002"&gt;Fleizo et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koller&gt;Koller, K. 2003. Techniques of soil tillage. Ed. Adel El Titi ([[CRC Press]])&lt;/ref&gt; Crops that do not perform well when competing with other plants that grow in untilled soil in their early stages can be best grown by using other conservation tillage practices, like a combination of [[strip-till]] with no-till areas.&lt;ref name=Koller/&gt; Also, crops which harvestable portion grows underground can have better results with strip-tillage,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} mainly in soils which are hard for plant roots to penetrate into deeper layers to access water and nutrients.

The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations,&lt;ref&gt;Pavuk, D.M. 1994. Influence of weeds within Zea mays crop plantings on populations of adult Diabrotica barberi and Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment. Vol 50, p 165-175&lt;/ref&gt; which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Brust, B. Stinner &amp; D. McCartney. 1986. Predator activity and predation in corn agroecosystems. Environmental Entomology 15:1017-1021&lt;/ref&gt;

In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, G.W., and P.R. Hill. 2000. Fall strip-tillage systems. p. 193‚Äì199. In R.C. Reeder (ed.) Conservation tillage systems and management. MWPS-45, 2nd ed. Iowa State Univ., Ames.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Licht, M.A. and Al-Kaisi, M. 2005. Strip-tillage effect on seedbed soil temperature and other soil physical properties. Soil and Tillage Research. Vol 80, p 233-249&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to [[pathogen]]s, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds,&lt;!-- I thought tillage caused more weed problems than no-till? This is one of the main reasons no-tillage is practiced --&gt; it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for [[pest control]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, [[mulch-till]] and ridge-till, all of them ‚Äì just as no-till ‚Äì categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.

In a no-till system, an agroecologist could&lt;!-- Would they ask these questions? Where did this section originate?--&gt; ask the following:

# Can the farm minimize environmental impacts and increase its level of sustainability; for instance by efficiently increasing the productivity of the crops to minimize land use?
# Does this way of farming sustain good quality of life for the farmers, their families, rural labor and [[communities|rural communities]] involved?

==History==

===Pre-WWII===
The notions and ideas relating to crop ecology have been around since at least 1911 when [[Franklin Hiram King|F.H. King]] released ''Farmers of Forty Centuries''. King was one of the pioneers as a proponent of more quantitative methods for characterization of water relations and physical properties of soils.&lt;ref name=francis&gt;{{cite journal |last=Francis |date=2003 |title=Agroecology: the ecology of food systems |journal=Journal of Sustainable Agriculture |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=99‚Äì118 |doi=10.1300/J064v22n03_10|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s the attempt to merge agronomy and ecology was born with the development of the field of crop ecology. Crop ecology's main concern was where crops would be best grown.&lt;ref name=gliess&gt;Gliessman, Stephen. R  Agroecology: Ecological Processes in Sustainable Agriculture. Ann Arbor: Sleeping Bear Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, it was only in 1928 that agronomy and ecology were formally linked by Klages.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klages, K.H.W. 1928. Crop ecology and ecological crop geography in the agronomic curriculum. J. Amer. Soc. Agron. 20:336-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of the term agroecology was in 1928, with the publication of the term by Bensin in 1928.&lt;ref name=wezel/&gt; The book of Tischler (1965), was probably the first to be actually titled 'agroecology'.&lt;ref&gt;Tischler, W. (1965). Agrar√∂kologie. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Jena, Germany, 499 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; He analysed the different components (plants, animals, soils and climate) and their interactions within an agroecosystem as well as the impact of human [[agricultural management]] on these components. Other books dealing with agroecology, but without using the term explicitly were published by the German zoologist Friederichs (1930) with his book on agricultural zoology and related ecological/environmental factors for plant protection,&lt;ref&gt;Friederichs, K. (1930) Die Grundfragen und Gesetzm√§√üigkeiten der land- und forstwirtschaftlichen Zoologie. Vol. 1: √ñkologischer Teil, Vol. 2: Wirtschaftlicher Teil. Verlagsbuchhandlung Paul Parey, Berlin, Germany, 417 and 443 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and by American crop physiologist Hansen in 1939&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, B., Alr√∏e, H.F., Kristensen, E.S., 2001. Approaches to assess the [[environmental impact]] of [[organic agriculture|organic farming]] with particular regard to Denmark. Agric. Ecosys. Environ. 83, 11‚Äì26.&lt;/ref&gt; when both used the word as a synonym for the application of ecology within agriculture.&lt;ref name=dalgaard&gt;Dalgaard, Tommy, and Nicholas Hutchings, John Porter. "Agroecology, Scaling and Interdisciplinarity." Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment 100(2003): 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=This sentence seems self-contradictory. I.e., did they use the term or not?|date=July 2016}}

===Post-WWII===
Gliessman mentions that post-WWII, groups of scientists with ecologists gave more focus to experiments in the natural environment, while [[agronomist]]s dedicated their attention to the cultivated systems in agriculture.&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; According to Gliessman,&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; the two groups kept their research and interest apart until books and articles using the concept of agroecosystems and the word agroecology started to appear in 1970.&lt;ref name=wezel&gt;Wezel, A., Soldat, V. (2009). A quantitative and qualitative historical analysis of the scientific discipline agroecology. International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability 7 (1): 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dalgaard&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt; explains the different points of view in ecology schools, and the fundamental differences, which set the basis for the development of agroecology.  The early ecology school of [[Henry Gleason]] investigated plant populations focusing in the [[hierarchical]] levels of the organism under study.

Friederich Clement's ecology school, however included the organism in question as well as the higher hierarchical levels in its investigations, a "landscape perspective".  However, the ecological schools where the roots of agroecology lie are even broader in nature. The ecology school of [[Arthur Tansley|Tansley]],&lt;!--(1935)--&gt; whose view included both the biotic organism and their environment, is the one from which the concept of agroecosystems emerged in 1974 with Harper.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harper, J.L., 1974. Agric. Ecosyst. Agroecosyst. 1, 1‚Äì6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s the increasing awareness of how humans manage the landscape and its consequences set the stage for the necessary cross between agronomy and ecology. Even though, in many ways the [[environmental movement]] in the US was a product of the times, the  {{clarify|text=Green Decade,|date=July 2016}} spread an environmental awareness of the [[unintended consequence]]s of changing ecological processes. Works such as ''[[Silent Spring]]'', and  ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', and  changes in legislation such as the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], [[Clean Water Act]], and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] caused the public to be aware of societal growth patterns, agricultural production, and the overall capacity of the system.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt;

===Fusion with ecology===
After the 1970s, when agronomists saw the value of ecology and ecologists began to use the agricultural systems as study plots, studies in agroecology grew more rapidly.&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; Gliessman describes that the innovative work of Prof. Efraim Hernandez X., who developed research based on [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous systems of knowledge]] in [[Mexico]], led to education programs in agroecology.&lt;ref name=qFran&gt;qtd. in Francis ''et al.'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 Prof. Efraim Hernandez X. explained that modern agricultural systems had lost their ecological foundation when [[socio-economic]] factors became the only driving force in the [[food system]].&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; The acknowledgement that the socio-economic interactions are indeed one of the fundamental components of any agroecosystems came to light in 1982, with the article Agroecologia del Tropico Americano by Montaldo. The author argues that the socio-economic context cannot be separated from the agricultural systems when designing agricultural practices.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;

In 1995 Edens et al. in Sustainable Agriculture and Integrated Farming Systems solidified this idea proving his point by devoting special sections to economics of the systems, ecological impacts, and ethics and values in agriculture.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; Actually, 1985 ended up being a fertile and creative year for the new discipline. For instance in the same year, [[Miguel Altieri]] integrated how consolidation of the farms, and cropping systems impact pest populations. In addition, Gliessman highlighted that socio-economic, technological, and ecological components give rise to producer choices of food production systems.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; These pioneering agroecologists have helped to frame the foundation of what we today consider the interdisciplinary field of agroecology and have led to advances in a number of farming systems. In Asian rice, for example, crop diversification by growing flowering crops in strips beside rice fields has recently been demonstrated to reduce pests so effectively (by the flower nectar attracting and supporting parasitoids and predators) that insecticide spraying is reduced by 70%, yields increase by 5%, together resulting in an economic advantage of 7.5% [http://www.nature.com/articles/nplants201614 (Gurr et al., 2016)].

== By region ==

The principles of agroecology are expressed differently depending on local ecological and social contexts.

=== Latin America ===

{{Main article|Agroecology in Latin America}}
Latin America's experiences with North American Green Revolution agricultural techniques have opened space for agroecologists.  Traditional or [[indigenous knowledge]] represents a wealth of possibility for agroecologists, including "exchange of wisdoms".  See Miguel Alteiri's ''Enhancing the Productivity of Latin American Traditional Peasant Farming Systems Through an Agroecological Approach'' for information on agroecology in Latin America.

Agroecological techniques and knowledge played an important role in solving the severe food crisis in [[Cuba]] following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Funes |first1=Fernando |last2=Garc√≠a |first2=Luis |last3=Bourque |first3=Martin |last4=P√©rez |first4=Nilda |last5=Rosset |first5=Peter |title=Sustainable Agriculture and Resistance: Transforming Food Production in Cuba |location= Oakland, CA |publisher=Food First Books |isbn=0-935028-87-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Cuba's urban agricultural movement, agroecology is integral to production in Cuban [[organop√≥nico|organop√≥nicos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10460-015-9659-y |title=Low-carbon food supply: The ecological geography of Cuban urban agriculture and agroecological theory |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=771‚Äì784 |year=2016 |last1=Cederl√∂f |first1=Gustav }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===

Historically, agroecology has had low traction in Africa, as governments, international organisations, extension services and farmers' organisations tended to focus on issues of inputs and outputs as the defining factors to deal with recurrent food crises and chronic malnutrition in the continent. Agrocecology was only a minor proposal from a few, non-governmental, small-scale projects and a sort of "experimental" idea of the Farmer Field Schools programme.

In the early 2000s, when the AIDS pandemic was creating a major rural crisis across Africa, Josep Gar√≠ proposed FAO to consider an agroecological approach as the most effective way to empower farmers cope with the impacts of the AIDS pandemic on agriculture and food production: in particular, he proposed agro-biodiversity as a key resource and knowledge for farmers to address the labour and malnutrition crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Gar√≠, Josep A. (2003). Agrobiodiversity strategies to combat food insecurity and HIV/AIDS impact in rural Africa. FAO / Population and Development Service, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was rapidly adopted by the Farmer Field Schools scheme across the world, and even presented and translated in China.&lt;ref&gt;Gar√≠, Josep A. (2004). Plant diversity, sustainable rural livelihoods and the HIV/AIDS crisis. Bangkok: UNDP &amp; FAO, 2004. Published in English and Chinese. {{ISBN|974-92021-4-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, agroecology has started to permeate projects and discourses on farming and natural-resource management in Africa. In 2011, the 1st encounter of agroecology trainers took place in Zimbabwe and issued the Shashe Declaration.

=== Madagascar ===
{{Main article|Agroecology in Madagascar}}
Most of the historical farming in Madagascar has been conducted by indigenous peoples.  The French [[Colonialism|colonial]] period disturbed a very small percentage of land area, and even included some useful experiments in [[Sustainable forestry]]. [[Slash-and-burn]] techniques, a component of some [[shifting cultivation]] systems have been practised by natives in Madagascar for centuries.  As of 2006 some of the major agricultural products from slash-and-burn methods are wood, charcoal and grass for [[Zebu]] grazing.  These practices have taken perhaps the greatest toll on land fertility since the end of French rule, mainly due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.

}}The '''W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research''' ('''AIAR'''), is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] research institution located in East [[Jerusalem]]. It is the oldest American research center for ancient Near Eastern studies in the Middle East.  Founded in 1900 as the ''American School of Oriental Research'', it was renamed in 1970 after its most distinguished director and the father of [[Biblical archaeology]], [[William F. Albright]].  Its mission is to develop and disseminate scholarly knowledge of the literature, history, and culture of the Near East, as well as the study of civilization from pre-history to the early Islamic period.  
Today, the Albright Institute is one of three separately incorporated institutes affiliated with the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (ASOR), the others being the American Center of Oriental Research ‚ÄìACOR- in [[Amman]], Jordan, and the Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute ‚ÄìCAARI- in [[Nicosia]], Cyprus.  
In 1948, the then [[American School of Oriental Research]], also known as  the Jerusalem School, played a significant role in the discovery and identification of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (see below). Between 1981 and 1996,  the Albright Institute, together with the Institute of Archaeology, [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], excavated at the ancient [[Philistine]] site of Tel Miqne-[[Ekron]], one of the five Philistine capital cities mentioned in the [[Bible]]. With the appointment of the new Director, Matthew J. Adams (2014), the Institute is now engaged in the Jezreel Valley Regional Project, a long-term, multi-disciplinary survey and excavation project investigating the history of human activity in the [[Jezreel Valley]] from the Paleolithic through the Ottoman period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jezreelvalleyregionalproject.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in an historic 1920s-period building, now a Jerusalem landmark, the Albright maintains residential and research facilities including a 35,000 volume library, publications offices, and archaeological laboratories.

==Fellowships==

The Institute‚Äôs unique international fellowship program fosters a culture of intellectual integrity and respect. It provides an opportunity for students and scholars from all over the world including Israelis and Palestinians to interact and exchange information and ideas in a friendly and convivial environment, which is not duplicated in any other such institution in the region. It also promotes working relationships with related institutions in Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 
	More than 3,000 persons participate in the Albright Institute‚Äôs annual wide range of programs including lectures, reports, workshops, field trips, and social events. The Institute also supports 31 ASOR-affiliated and Albright-assisted excavation, survey, and publications projects. 
	In the current academic year, the Albright awarded over $340,000 in grants, fellowships, and fees. This year‚Äôs 64 Fellows include 34 Fellows with stipends and fee awards, and 30 Associate Senior, Post-Doctoral, and Research Fellows with funding from other sources.  In the academic year 2012-13, the Institute initiated the Seymour Gitin Distinguished Professorship, which is open to internationally recognized senior scholars of all nationalities who have made significant contributions to their field of study.

==The Dead Sea Scrolls==

The Institute played a significant role in the discovery and preservation of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. The Scrolls contain approximately eight hundred separate works written between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE. They include the only Jewish Bible manuscripts from that period, including a manuscript of Exodus that dates to c. 250 BCE.   Manuscripts or fragments of every book in the Hebrew Bible except the [[Book of Esther]] were unearthed, as well as many other Jewish religious texts, many previously unknown.  Most scholars believe that the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] were the property of the [[Essenes]] who lived at the site of Khirbet Qumran.  The Essenes were a Jewish sect active in the last century BCE and the first century CE, at the same time as the [[Pharisees]] and the [[Sadducees]].

In the spring of 1948, the Institute was contacted by a representative of [[Mar Samuel]], the Metropolitan (Archbishop) of the Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem, who wanted to authenticate four ancient scrolls that he had recently purchased from an antiquities dealer.
One of the younger scholars in residence at the Institute at that time, [[John C. Trever]] recognized the antiquity of the manuscripts and photographed three of the four scrolls in the basement of the Albright under very adverse conditions.  Trever was the first to photograph 1QIsaiah(a), a complete scroll of the book of Isaiah dating to approximately 100 BCE.   Trever sent copies of his photographs to his mentor‚Äîfamed Near Eastern scholar and former Institute director [[William F. Albright]], who sent him a telegram congratulating him on the "greatest manuscript discovery of modern times!‚Äù

In early September 1948,  [[Mar Samuel]], contacted ASOR-currently the Albright Institute-in Jerusalem and the then Director Professor  [[Ovid R. Sellers]]. Samuel showed Sellers some additional scroll fragments that he had acquired. Sellers then focused on finding the cave in which the scrolls had been found. In late 1948, nearly two years after the discovery of the scrolls, scholars had yet to locate the cave where the fragments had been found. Conducting such a search was dangerous. When the British mandate in Palestine ended on May 15, 1948, war broke out immediately, and peace would not be restored until November. The cave was finally discovered on January 28, 1949, by a UN observer, and Sellers brought his box brownie camera to take the first photos of the cave, which were soon published in Life Magazine.

In 1952, [[Roland de Vaux]], the head of the French Biblical School in Jerusalem, organized a search of the caves in the cliffs above the Dead Sea near the site of [[Qumran]].  ASOR joined this expedition, and discovered Cave 3, the cave in which the famous [[Copper Scroll]] was found.  Cave 3 was the only Qumran cave to be completely excavated by professional archaeologists.

The Albright Institute continues to play a role in Scrolls scholarship to the present day.  In the 1990s, Board Chair Joy Ungerleider established a Dorot Dead Sea Scrolls fellowship at the Albright to enable young American scholars to work on the Scroll fragments in the nearby [[Rockefeller Museum]].  One of the first holders of this fellowship was Sidnie White Crawford, Board Chair and former president of the Institute, who lived and worked at the Albright from 1989-1991 on the editions of several Deuteronomy manuscripts from Cave 4, and the Reworked Pentateuch manuscripts, also from Cave 4.  The Albright has hosted many Scrolls scholars while they pursued their research, including Eugene C. Ulrich (University of Notre Dame), Mark Smith (New York University), and Eileen Schuller (McMaster University).  In addition, former fellow and trustee Jodi Magness (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill) has produced the seminal work on Qumran archaeology in the twenty-first century.

==The Ekron Royal Dedicatory Inscription==
{{main|Ekron inscription}}
The Albright‚Äôs excavations at Tel Miqne [[Ekron]]  is a joint project with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and was excavated from 1981 until 1996 under the direction of the Albright‚Äôs Dorot Director and Professor of Archaeology, Seymour Gitin, and Professor Trude Dothan of the Hebrew University. The excavations have  led to one of the most important archaeological discoveries in Israel in the 20th century, perhaps second only to that of the  [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].  In 1996, a significant artifact for the corpus of Biblical Archaeology was recovered, a monumental dedicatory inscription of the seventh-century king of Ekron Ikausu. The inscription not only securely identifies the site by mentioned the name Ekron, but it gives a king-list of the rulers of [[Ekron]], fathers to sons: Ya'ir, Ada, Yasid, Padi, and Ikausu, and the name of the goddess Patgayah to whom the temple is dedicated.

Both Padi and Ikausu are mentioned in the seventh century BCE Neo-Assyrian Royal Annals as Kings of Ekron, thus providing a basis for dating their reigns.  This makes the Ekron Inscription prime documentary evidence for establishing the chronology of events relating to the late biblical period, especially the history of the [[Philistines]].  The Goddess Patgayah refers to the Aegean mother goddess of Delphi, and Ikausu meaning the Achaean or the Greek may point to the Greek heritage of the Philistines or reflect contact between the [[Philistines]] and their ‚Äòhomeland‚Äô Greece in the Archaic period of the 7th century, during which there was intensive economic and cultural exchange.

The '''''Benezit Dictionary of Artists''''' (in [[French language|French]], ''B√©n√©zit: Dictionnaire des peintres, sculpteurs, dessinateurs et graveurs'') is an extensive publication of bibliographical information on [[painters]], [[sculptors]], [[designers]] and [[engraving|engravers]] created primarily for art museums, auction houses, historians and dealers. It was published by [[√âditions Gr√ºnd]] in [[Paris]] but has been sold to [[Oxford University Press]].

First published in the [[French language]] in three volumes between 1911 and 1923, the [[dictionary]] was put together by [[Emmanuel B√©n√©zit]] (1854‚Äì1920) and a team of international specialists with assistance from his son the painter [[Emmanuel-Charles B√©n√©zit]] (1887‚Äì1975), and daughter Marguerite B√©n√©zit. After the elder B√©n√©zit's death the editors were [[Edmond-Henri Zeiger-Viallet]] (1895‚Äì1994) and the painter [[Jacques Busse]] (1922‚Äì2004), the younger B√©n√©zit having already left Paris and moved to Provence. The next edition was an eight-volume set published between 1948 and 1955, followed by a ten-volume set in 1976 and a 14-volume set in 1999. In 2006, an English-language edition was published for the first time. A 14-volume set, it has more than 20,000 pages, with over 170,000 entries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5546">The '''Sex Orientation Scale''' ('''SOS''') was [[Harry Benjamin]]'s attempt to classify and understand various forms and subtypes of [[transvestism]] and [[transsexualism]] in biological males, published in 1966.&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"&gt;Benjamin, Harry (1966). ''The Transsexual Phenomenon.'' The Julian Press, {{ISBN|9780446824262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|first=Rachel Ann|title=The Praeger Handbook of Transsexuality: Changing Gender to Match Mindset|year=2006|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.

The diagnosis and treatment of transvestites and transsexuals. ''[[Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy]]'' Volume 1, Issue 3, 1975 doi:10.1080/00926237508405291&lt;/ref&gt; Much like Kinsey's understanding of sexual orientation, Benjamin understood the nature of gender identity and gender expression not as a discrete scale, but as a spectrum, a continuum with many variations.  However the Benjamin scale does not reflect a modern understanding of gender identity and is not useful as a contemporary diagnostic tool, especially due to its conflation of gender identity with sexual orientation.

|}

Benjamin noted, "It must be emphasized again that the remaining six types are not and never can be sharply separated."&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"/&gt;
Benjamin added a caveat: "It has been the intention here to point out the possibility of several conceptions and classifications of the transvestitic and the transsexual phenomenon. Future studies and observations may decide which one is likely to come closest to the truth and in this way a possible understanding of the etiology may be gained."&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"/&gt;

Benjamin's Scale references and uses Alfred Kinsey's sexual orientation scale to distinguish between "true transsexualism" and "transvestism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frayser|first=Suzanne G.|title=Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide|year=1995|publisher=Libr. Unlimited|location=Englewood, Colo.|isbn=978-1-56308-131-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZArPH0nFGo0C&amp;pg=PA368&amp;lpg=PA368&amp;dq=%22Sex+Orientation+Scale%22+Harry+Benjamin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kku09KRmiY&amp;sig=8rJyeb6RrtDihtljgxfYZ-__O7k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VbJIUOPrLoWg8QTS9IHQDA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sex%20Orientation%20Scale%22%20Harry%20Benjamin&amp;f=false|author2=Whitby, Thomas|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the strict relationship between gender identity (Benjamin's Scale) and sexual orientation (Kinsey's Scale) was just a result of the researcher's biases, not his scientific findings.

== Modern views ==
Contemporary views on gender identity and classification differ markedly from Harry Benjamin's original opinions.&lt;ref name="Ekins2005"&gt;Ekins, Richard (2005). Science, politics and clinical intervention: Harry Benjamin, transsexualism and the problem of heteronormativity ''[[Sexualities (journal)|Sexualities]]'' July 2005 vol. 8 no. 3 306-328 doi: 10.1177/1363460705049578&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation is no longer regarded a criterion for diagnosis, or for distinction between transsexuality, transvestism and other forms of gender variant behavior and expression.  Modern views also exclude fetishistic transvestism from the spectrum of transsexual identity/classification, this type of transvestism is not related to gender expression or identity but is a distinctly sexual phenomenon most commonly practised by people who are neither transsexual nor homosexual. Benjamin's scale was designed for use with [[trans women]], and [[trans men]]'s identities do not align with these categories.&lt;ref name="Hansbury2008"&gt;Hansbury, Griffin (2008). The Middle Men: An Introduction to the Transmasculine Identities. ''[[Studies in Gender and Sexuality]]''  Volume 6, Issue 3, 2005 doi:10.1080/15240650609349276&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bloviation''' is a style of empty, pompous political speech popularized by United States President [[Warren G. Harding]], who, himself a master of the technique, described it as "the art of speaking for as long as the occasion warrants, and saying nothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The American Past: A Survey of American History |first=Joseph R. | last=Conlin |authorlink = Joseph R.

In terms of its etymology, according to one source, the word is a "compound of blow, in its sense of 'to boast' (also in another typical Americanism, ''blowhard''), with a mock-[[Latin]] ending to give it the self-important stature implicit in its meaning."&lt;ref name="quinion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-blo1.htm|title= Bloviate|authorlink=Michael Quinion|first=Michael |last=Quinion|year=1999|publisher=[[World Wide Words]]|accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum''' (''BLM'') is a [[history museum]] in [[Braunschweig]], Germany, operated by the state of [[Lower Saxony]]. The museum is scattered on four locations: ''Vieweghaus'', ''Hinter √Ñgidien'' (both in Braunschweig), ''Kanzlei'' ([[Wolfenb√ºttel]]) and ''Bauernhausmuseum'' ([[Bortfeld]]).

The collection covers 500,000 years and includes objects from the history of the [[Brunswick Land|Braunschweig area]], including culture, economy, technology, folk arts, and social history. Today, the BLM hosts a collection of 600,000 to 800,000 objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{De icon}} [http://www.3landesmuseen.de/Geschichte.467.0.html BLM] Sammlung &gt; Sammlungsbest√§nde &gt; Die Sammlungsbest√§nde des Braunschweigischen Landesmuseums. Retrieved 2013-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The museum's history dates back to October 11, 1891, when it was founded in the [[Duchy of Brunswick]] as ''Vaterl√§ndisches Museum f√ºr Braunschweigische Landesgeschichte''.&lt;ref&gt;{{De icon}} [http://www.3landesmuseen.de/Geschichte.467.0.html BLM] √úber uns &gt; Geschichte &gt; Landesgeschichte seit mehr als 120 Jahren. Retrieved 2013-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally it was located in a street called ''Hagenscharrn'' in the city of Braunschweig. In 1938, the museum was renamed to Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum f√ºr Geschichte und Volkstum. This name remained until December 31, 1982.

==Vieweghaus==
The [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] building, the former publishing house of [[Vieweg+Teubner Verlag|Vieweg Verlag]], hosts the main collection, and is located in the [[Innenstadt (Braunschweig)|city center]] at the [[Dankwarderode Castle|castle square]] (''Burgplatz''). A large part of the collection was moved there in 1986. &lt;!-- Highlights are... --&gt;

==Hinter √Ñgidien==
Located in the street ''[[Aegidienkirche, Braunschweig|Hinter St. Aegidien]]'', this annex exhibits [[Jewish ceremonial art|Judaica]] and was opened to the public in 1746. Center piece is a [[synagogue]] interior from [[Hamburg]].

==Kanzlei Wolfenb√ºttel==
This annex focuses on prehistoric and ancient history (500,000 BC until 8th century AD) of the region and was established there in 1959. The building was built in the 16th century and is located in the city center.

==Bauernhausmuseum==
The Bortfelder Bauernhausmuseum section was opened in 1968 and is located in Bortfeld, a village in the municipality of [[Wendeburg]], [[Peine (district)|district of Peine]]. This museum reflects on the rural life of the region. The central attraction is a [[farmhouse]] from 1639 (reetgedecktes Hallenhaus).

'''Charles S. Liebman''' ([[Hebrew]]: ◊ô◊©◊¢◊ô◊î◊ï ◊ú◊ô◊ë◊û◊ü) (New York City October 20, 1934 &amp;ndash; September 3, 2003) was a [[political scientist]] and prolific author on [[Judaism|Jewish life]] and [[Israel]]. A professor at [[Bar-Ilan University]], he previously served on university faculties in the United States.

==Biography==
In 1965, Liebman published a pioneering essay, ‚Äú[http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=1924 Orthodoxy in American Jewish Life],‚Äù in the ''[[American Jewish Year Book]]''. His 14 books include ''Ambivalent American Jew: Politics, Religion, and Family in American Jewish Life''. According to Cohen (2003), Liebman "argued that [[American Jews]] struggle to integrate into the larger society while trying to maintain a distinctive [[Identity (social science)|group identity]]." According to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Rabbi [[Reuven Bulka]], "Liebman's exhaustive study was an eye-opener for many who had dismissed Orthodoxy as a negligible force on the American Jewish scene and also was a partial harbinger of much more literature on Orthodoxy which has proliferated ever since."

In a provocative paper, "[http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=3085 Extremism as a Religious Norm]," Liebman (1983) analyzes [[Fundamentalism|religious]] [[extremism]] in Israel and argues that "religious extremism is the norm and that it is not religious extremism but religious moderation that requires explanation." A critical respondent appreciated the description of Israel but rejected Liebman's generalization as [[begging the question]] of whether "extremism should be regarded as "normal religion or even religion at all" (Cumpsty 1985:217).

In a 1990 study of American and Israeli Judaism (‚ÄúTwo Worlds of Judaism‚Äù), Liebman articulated a concept of "Jewish [[personalism]]" which, writes his co-author, is "the tendency of American Jews to pick those parts of Judaism they find personally meaningful, rather than complying with external requirements of religious law, [[Zionism|Zionist]] ideology or ethnic obligation" (Cohen 2003).

He was born in [[New York City]] and attended secondary school at the [[Herzliya Hebrew High School|Gymnasia Herzliya]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. He earned degrees from the [[University of Miami]] (B.A.) and [[University of Illinois]] (M.A., Ph.D.). He moved to Israel in 1969. With his wife Carol, he had three children. He was an observant Jew, concerned about [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]], served in the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] on an education unit, and was politically a dove regarding Israel. (Cohen 2003)

Personally, Liebman is said to have had a "fierce devotion to [[honesty]], even at the risk of unpopularity" (Cohen 2003). For example, in a book review, he writes: "If a [reviewer] can't be kind he must be fair. I find it impossible to be kind to an author who writes.... a statement comparable to saying that an American state is located somewhere between New York and California. ... Since I cannot be kind I will try very hard to be fair. The book does have redeeming features" (Liebman 1984:137f.).

In November 2007, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] published a memorial volume, ''Ambivalent American Jew: Politics, Religion, and Family in American Jewish Life'' (Stuart Cohen and Bernard Susser, editors). According to an obituary in ''[[The Forward]]'', "Liebman was widely regarded as the pre-eminent social scientist of Jews and Judaism in the latter third of the 20th century" (Cohen 2003).

==Awards==
* In 2000, Liebman was awarded the [[Marshall Sklare Award]].
* In 2003, Liebman was awarded the [[Israel Prize]], for government studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site (in Hebrew) ‚Äì Recipient‚Äôs C.V. | url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashsag/YeshayahuLibman/KorotHaimYeshayahuLibman.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site (in Hebrew) ‚Äì Judges' Rationale for Grant to Recipient | url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashsag/YeshayahuLibman/NimokyHsoftim.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chemical waste''' is a [[Waste types|waste]] that is made from harmful chemicals (mostly [[industrial waste|produced by large factories]]). Chemical waste may fall under regulations such as [[COSHH]] in the [[United Kingdom]], or the [[Clean Water Act]] and [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] in the [[United States]]. In the U.S., the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]], as well as state and local regulations also regulate chemical use and disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollutionequipment-digital.com/pollutionequipment/20100405/?pg=17#pg13|title=Techniques for Efficient Hazardous Chemicals Handling and Disposal|date=April‚ÄìMay 2010|page=13.|access-date=10 March 2016|author=Hallam, Bill|work=Pollution Equipment News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical waste may or may not be classed as [[hazardous waste]]. A '''chemical hazardous waste''' is a solid, [[liquid]], or [[gas]]eous material that displays either a ‚ÄúHazardous Characteristic‚Äù or is specifically ‚Äúlisted‚Äù by name as a hazardous waste. There are four characteristics chemical wastes may have to be considered as hazardous. These are Ignitability, [[Corrosive|Corrosivity]], Reactivity, and Toxicity. This type of hazardous waste must be categorized as to its identity, constituents, and hazards so that it may be safely handled and managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ehrs.upenn.edu/media_files/docs/pdf/wastesectionupdatefinal.pdf|title=LABORATORY CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Environmental Health and Radiation Safety University of Pennsylvania|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical waste is a broad term and encompasses many types of materials. Consult the [[Safety data sheet|Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)]], Product Data Sheet or Label for a list of constituents. These sources should state whether this chemical waste is a waste that needs special disposal.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Waste - Disposal of Laboratory Wastes (GUIDANCE) {{!}} Current Staff {{!}} University of St Andrews|url = https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/policy/healthandsafety/publications/waste/waste-disposaloflaboratorywastesguidance/|website = www.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guidance for Disposal of Laboratory Chemical Wastes ==
In the laboratory, chemical wastes are usually segregated on-site into appropriate waste [[carboy]]s, and disposed by a specialist contractor in order to meet safety, health, and legislative requirements.
[[File:Chemical Waste Disposal Guideline.jpg|thumb|267x267px|Chemical waste category that should be followed for proper packaging, labelling, and disposal of chemical waste.]]
Innocuous aqueous waste (such as solutions of [[sodium chloride]]) may be poured down the sink. Some chemicals are washed down with excess water.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This includes: concentrated and dilute [[acid]]s and [[alkali]]s, harmless soluble inorganic salts (all drying agents), [[alcohol]]s containing salts, hypochlorite solutions, fine (tlc grade) [[Silicate|silica]] and [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]]. [[Aqueous solution|Aqueous]] waste containing toxic compounds are collected separately.

Waste [[mercury (element)|elemental mercury]], spent [[acid]]s and [[Alkali|bases]] may be collected separately for [[recycling]].

Waste [[organic solvents]] are separated into [[Organochloride|chlorinated]] and non-chlorinated solvent waste. Chlorinated solvent waste is usually incinerated at high temperature to minimize the formation of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shibamoto|first=T|year=2007|title=Dioxin formation from waste incineration.|journal=Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology|volume=190|pages=1‚Äì41|pmid=17432330|author2=Yasuhara, A|author3=Katami, T}}&lt;!--|access-date=10 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/waste_management/l28072_en.htm|title=Waste incineration|last=Europa|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-chlorinated solvent waste can be burned for [[energy recovery]].

In contrast to this, chemical materials on the "Red List" should never be washed down a drain. This list includes:&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; compounds with transitional metals, [[biocide]]s, [[cyanide]]s, [[mineral oil]]s and [[hydrocarbon]]s, poisonous [[organosilicon]] compounds, metal phosphides, [[phosphorus]] element, and [[fluoride]]s and [[nitrite]]s.

Moreover, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) prohibits disposing certain materials down any UVM drain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chemical Waste Management  {{!}} Environmental Health and Safety at UVM|url = http://www.uvm.edu/safety/lab/chemicalwaste#Selecting%2520the%2520Correct%2520Container|website = www.uvm.edu|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including [[flammable liquid]]s, liquids capable of causing damage to wastewater facilities (this can be determined by the [[pH]]), highly [[Viscosity|viscous]] materials capable of causing an obstruction in the [[wastewater]] system, [[Radioactive waste|radioactive]] materials, materials that have or create a strong odor, wastewater capable of significantly raising the temperature of the system, and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]] or [[Endocrine system|endocrine]] disruptors.

Broken [[laboratory glassware|glassware]] are usually collected in plastic-lined cardboard boxes for landfilling. Due to contamination, they are usually not suitable for recycling. Similarly, used [[hypodermic needle]]s are collected as [[sharps waste|sharps]] and are incinerated as [[medical waste]].

== Chemical Compatibility Guideline ==
Many chemicals may react adversely when combined. It is recommended that incompatible chemicals be stored in separate areas of the lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chemical Compatibility and Segregation Guides|url = http://orf.od.nih.gov/EnvironmentalProtection/WasteDisposal/Pages/chem_compat.aspx|website = orf.od.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acids]] should be separated from [[alkalis]], [[metals]], [[cyanides]], [[sulfides]], [[azides]], [[phosphides]], and [[Oxidise|oxidizers]]. The reason being, when combined acids with these type of compounds, violent [[exothermic reaction]] can occur possibly causing [[Flammability|flammable gas]], and in some cases [[Explosion|explosions.]]

[[Oxidizing agent|Oxidizers]] should be separated from [[acid]]s, [[Organic matter|organic materials]], [[metal]]s, [[reducing agent]]s, and [[ammonia]]. This is because when combined [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizers]] with these type of compounds, inflammable, and sometimes [[toxic]] compounds can occur.

=== Container compatibility ===
When disposing hazardous laboratory chemical waste, chemical compatibility must be considered. For safe disposal, the container must be chemically compatible with the material it will hold. Chemicals must not react with, weaken, or dissolve the container or lid. [[Acids]] or [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] should not be stored in [[metal]]. [[Hydrofluoric acid]] should not store in [[glass]]. [[Gasoline]] ([[solvents]]) should not store or transport in lightweight [[polyethylene]] containers such as milk jugs. Moreover, the Chemical Compatibility Guidelines should be considered for more detailed information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Store and Dispose of Hazardous Chemical Waste|url = http://blink.ucsd.edu/safety/research-lab/hazardous-waste/chemical.html#Select-compatible-containers|website = blink.ucsd.edu|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laboratory waste containers ==
Packaging, labelling, storage are the three requirements for disposing chemical waste.

=== Packaging&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = General Requirements|url = http://www.ehs.utoronto.ca/resources/wmindex/wm4.htm|website = www.ehs.utoronto.ca|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
[[File:Chemical Waste Area.jpg|thumb|How to properly label, package, and store chemical waste safely.]]
For packaging, chemical liquid waste containers should only be filled up to 75% capacity to allow for [[Vapor|vapour expansion]] and to reduce potential spills which could occur from moving overfilled containers. Container material must be compatible with the stored [[hazardous waste]]. Finally, wastes must not be packaged in containers that improperly identify other nonexisting hazards.

In addition to the general packaging requirements mentioned above, incompatible materials should never be mixed together in a single container. Wastes must be stored in containers compatible with the chemicals stored as mentioned in the container compatibility section. [[Solvent]] safety cans should be used to collect and temporarily store large volumes (10‚Äì20 litres) of [[Flammability|flammable]] organic waste [[solvent]]s, precipitates, [[solid]]s or other non-fluid wastes should not be mixed into safety cans.

=== Labelling ===
Label all containers with the group name from the chemical waste category and an itemized list of the contents. All chemicals or anything contaminated with chemicals posing a significant hazard. All waste must be appropriately packaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laboratory|first=National Research Council (US) Committee on Prudent Practices in the|date=2011-01-01|title=Management of Waste|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK55885/|language=en|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storage ===
When storing chemical wastes, the containers must be in good condition and should remain closed unless waste is being added. [[Hazardous waste]] must be stored safely prior to removal from the laboratory and should not be allowed to accumulate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Container should be sturdy and leakproof, also has to be labeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chem.wisc.edu/deptfiles/docs/lab-waste-disposal-portrait.pdf|title=Laboratory Waste Disposal|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All liquid waste must be stored in leakproof containers with a screw- top or other secure lid. [[Snap cap]]s, mis-sized caps, [[parafilm]] and other loose fitting lids are not acceptable. If necessary, transfer waste material to a container that can be securely closed. Keep waste containers closed except when adding waste. Secondary containment should be in place to capture spills and leaks from the primary container, segregate incompatible [[hazardous wastes]], such as [[acids]] and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mun.ca/sgs/current/chem_waste.pdf|title=PROCEDURES FOR LABORATORY CHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Memorial University|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mapping of chemical waste in the United States==
[[TOXMAP]] is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov |title=SIS Specialized Information System |author= |work= |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA)  [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US Federal Government.  TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov |title=Toxnet |author= |work= |publisher=United States National Library of Medicine |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PubMed]], and from other 
authoritative sources.

==Chemical waste in Canadian aquaculture ==
Chemical waste in our oceans is becoming a major issue for marine life. There have been many studies conducted to try and prove the effects of chemicals in our oceans. In Canada, many of the studies concentrated on the Atlantic provinces, where fishing and aquaculture are an important part of the economy. 
In New Brunswick, a study was done on the [[sea urchin]] in an attempt to identify the effects of toxic and chemical waste on life beneath the ocean, specifically the waste from salmon farms. Sea urchins were used to check the levels of metals in the environment. It is advantageous to use green sea urchins, [[Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis]], because they are widely distributed, abundant in many locations, and easily accessible. By investigating the concentrations of metals in the green sea urchins, the impacts of chemicals from [[Aquaculture of salmonids|salmon aquaculture]] activity could be assessed and detected. Samples were taken at 25-metre intervals along a transect in the direction of the main tidal flow. The study found that there was impacts to at least 75&amp;nbsp;m based on the intestine metal concentrations. So based on this study it is clear that the metals are contaminating the ocean and negatively affecting aquatic life.

[[Image:Underside.JPG|thumb|Green Sea Urchin or S. droebacheinsis'']]

==Uranium in Ground and Surface Water in Canada==
Another issue regarding chemical waste is the potential risk of surface and groundwater contamination by the heavy metals and [[radionuclides]] leached from uranium waste-rock piles (UWRP) A Radionuclide is an atom that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. Uranium waste-rock piles refers to [[Uranium mining]], which is the process of extraction of uranium ore from the ground. An example of such threats is in Saskatchewan, Uranium mining and ore processing (milling) can pose a threat to the environment. In open pit mining, large amounts of materials are excavated and disposed off in waste-rock piles. Waste-rock piles from the [[Uranium mining]] industry can contain several heavy metals and contaminants that may become mobile under certain conditions. Environmental contaminants may include [[acid mine drainage]], higher concentrations of radionuclides, and non-radioactive metals/metalloids (i.e. As, Mo, Ni, Cu, Zn).

The leachability of heavy metals and radionuclide from UWRP plays a significant role in determining their potential environmental risks to surrounding surface and groundwater. Substantial differences in the solid-phase partitioning and chemical leachability of Ni and U were observed in the investigated UWRP lithological materials and background organic-rich lake sediment. For Instance, in the uranium-mining district of Northern Saskatchewan, Canada, the sequential extraction results showed that a significant amount of Ni ([[Nickel]]) was present in the non-labile residual fraction, while Uranium was mostly distributed in the moderately labile fractions. Although Nickel was much less labile than Uranium, the observed Nickel exceeded Uranium concentrations in [[Leaching model (soil)|leaching]]]]. The observed Nickel and Uranium concentrations were relatively high in the underlying organic-rich lake sediment. Expressed as the percentage of total metal content, potential leachability decreased in the order U &gt; Ni. Data suggest that these elements could potentially migrate to the water table below the UWRP. Detailed information regarding the solid-phase distribution of [[contaminant]]s in the UWRP is critical to understand the potential for their environmental transport and mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/env/waterres/cycle/groundwater/well/uranium.html|title=Uranium in Well Water - Water Resources Management|first=Department of Municipal Affairs and|last=Environment|date=|website=www.env.gov.nl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:London School of Economics Statistics Machine Room 1964.jpg|thumb|right|Students working in the Statistics [[Computer lab|Machine Room]] of the [[London School of Economics]] in 1964.]]
'''Computational statistics''', or '''statistical computing''', is the interface between [[statistics]] and [[computer science]]. It is the area of [[computational science]] (or scientific computing) specific to the mathematical science of [[statistics]]. This area is also developing rapidly, leading to calls that a broader concept of computing should be taught as part of general [[statistical education]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Deborah A. Nolan|Nolan, D.]] &amp; Temple Lang, D. (2010). "Computing in the Statistics Curricula", ''[[The American Statistician]]'' '''64''' (2), pp.97-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in [[Statistics|traditional statistics]] the goal is to transform [[raw data]] into [[knowledge]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Edward Wegman|Wegman, Edward]] J. ‚Äú[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24536995 Computational Statistics: A New Agenda for Statistical Theory and Practice.]‚Äù ''[http://www.washacadsci.org/journal/ Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences]'', vol. 78, no. 4, 1988, pp. 310‚Äì322. ''JSTOR''&lt;/ref&gt; but the focus lies on [[computer]] intensive [[statistical methods]], such as cases with very large [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and non-homogeneous [[data set]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The terms 'computational statistics' and 'statistical computing' are often used interchangeably, although Carlo Lauro (a former president of the [[International Association for Statistical Computing]]) proposed making a distinction, defining 'statistical computing' as "the application of computer science to statistics",
and 'computational statistics' as "aiming at the design of algorithm for implementing
statistical methods on computers, including the ones unthinkable before the computer
age (e.g. [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]], [[Monte Carlo simulation|simulation]]), as well as to cope with analytically intractable problems" [''[[sic]]''].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| first=Carlo|last=Lauro| title=Computational statistics or statistical computing, is that the question?| journal= Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis| volume=23| issue=1| year=1996| pages=191‚Äì193| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V8V-3SWT44Y-F/2/5320a35df36fb38ffba03483c73dc861| doi=10.1016/0167-9473(96)88920-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'Computational statistics' may also be used to refer to computationally ''intensive'' statistical methods including [[resampling (statistics)|resampling]] methods, [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods, [[local regression]], [[kernel density estimation]], [[artificial neural networks]] and [[generalized additive model]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5087">The '''cultural studies theory of composition''' (hereafter referred to as "cultural studies") is a field of [[composition studies]] that examines both writing as an artifact of culture and the contexts of writing situations. It also examines what happens to writing when cultures come into contact with each other, situations often referred to as "contact zones".&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Mary Louise. "Arts of the Contact Zone." Profession 91. New York: MLA, 1991, 33-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How cultural studies began ==
Cultural studies arose in the 1970s and 1980s as a way of empowering otherwise disenfranchised voices: those who did not follow common or accepted political or social norms. It is a way of challenging an established power by investigating issues of "multiculturalism, the politics of literacy, and the implications of race, class, and gender".&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana, and John Trimbur. "Cultural Studies and Composition." A Guide to Composition Studies, ed. Gary Tate, Amy Rupiper, Kurt Schick. New York: Oxford UP, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the discipline exists a variety of agendas and methods, but the fundamental idea behind cultural studies is to give voice to "the masses" and encourage representation of all cultures within a society.

Cultural studies pedagogy tends to include examinations of [[popular culture|pop culture]] and media texts and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana, and John Trimbur. "Cultural Studies and Composition." A Guide to Composition Studies, ed. Gary Tate, Amy Rupiper, Kurt Schick. New York: Oxford UP, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies is influential in the composition classroom because it enables instructors to help students write about subjects they were familiar with and to "teach close reading and interpretation of texts....substituting popular culture or media for literary texts";&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana, and John Trimbur. "Cultural Studies and Composition." A Guide to Composition Studies, ed. Gary Tate, Amy Rupiper, Kurt Schick. New York: Oxford UP, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; allows for the idea that we are inundated by culture in everything we see and read, and so it is useful in the composition classroom to analyze, examine, close-read, and understand the meaning in and around the texts.

== Teaching methods and implications ==
Cultural studies composition instructors can use a variety of genres for students to work within and between. They include:
&lt;br /&gt;-- Production-based studies (emphasizes the producer; the "political organization of the conditions of production"&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Richard. "What is Cultural Studies, Anyway?" Social Text 16.1 (1986-87): 38-80.&lt;/ref&gt;)
&lt;br /&gt;-- Text-based studies (i.e. literary criticism)
&lt;br /&gt;-- Studies of lived culture (ethnographic, historic, semiotic looks at how people are enculturated or contextualized)

Classroom methods include using pop culture and [[media studies]] into composition classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana, and John Trimbur. "Cultural Studies and Composition." A Guide to Composition Studies, ed. Gary Tate, Amy Rupiper, Kurt Schick. New York: Oxford UP, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Often these sources tend to allow students to write about what they know and to close-read and interpret texts about culture instead of literature.&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana, and John Trimbur. "Cultural Studies and Composition." A Guide to Composition Studies, ed. Gary Tate, Amy Rupiper, Kurt Schick. New York: Oxford UP, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It helps students contextualize their own experiences. Teachers use multicultural texts&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Mary Louise. "Arts of the Contact Zone." Profession 91. New York: MLA, 1991, 33-40.&lt;/ref&gt; that introduce and encourage discussions of multiple literacies, the implications of power, and the "contact zones" where cultures overlap and potentially collide.

When it comes to the personal essay, students from different multicultural backgrounds will bring different approaches, from the way the begin their stories to the information they choose to address.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, Jeanne Weiland. "Telling Stories: Rethinking the Personal Narrative in the Contact Zone of a Multicultural Classroom." Professing in the Contact Zone: Bringing Theory and Practice Together. Ed. Janice M. Wolff. Urbana: NCTE, 1994, 274-290.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that workshopping the personal narrative (or, perhaps, any writing) in a classroom full of diversity can bring challenges, not just with understanding each other's words, but also with understanding meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, Jeanne Weiland. "Telling Stories: Rethinking the Personal Narrative in the Contact Zone of a Multicultural Classroom." Professing in the Contact Zone: Bringing Theory and Practice Together. Ed. Janice M. Wolff. Urbana: NCTE, 1994, 274-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques of cultural studies ==
Critics have debated the ethics of professors pitching their soapboxes in class. Others accuse cultural studies compositionists as teaching an ideology, not writing.

== Current directions of cultural studies ==
One of the directions cultural studies is taking, is for civic- and community-service-oriented composition classes.

This expression is the base of the Islamic institution of ''[[hisbah]]''. It forms a central part of the Islamic doctrine for all Muslims. It is also explicitly referred to in two [[Ancillaries of the Faith]] in [[Shia Islam]], [[commanding what is just]] and [[forbidding what is evil]].{{cn|date=November 2015}}

==Some Quranic examples==

*[[Sura]] [[Al Imran|3]].104 &lt;sup&gt;[[Translation of the Qur'an|translated]] by [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]&lt;/sup&gt;
::''Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, '''enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong''': They are the ones to attain felicity.''
alternative translation:
::''Let there arise out of you a nation who invites to goodness and '''enjoin What is right and forbid What is evil''': They are the one's to attain felicity.''&lt;ref name="GFQ" /&gt;

*[[Sura]] [[Al Imran|3]].110 &lt;sup&gt;[[Translation of the Qur'an|translated]] by [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]&lt;/sup&gt;
::''Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind, '''enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong''', and believing in Allah. If only the People of the Book had faith, it were best for them: among them are some who have faith, but most of them are transgressors.''
alternative translation:
::''You are the best community that has been raised up for mankind: '''You enjoin What is right and forbid What is evil''', and You believe in Allah; if the people of the scripture deary it, it had been better for them, some of them believers, but most of them are evil-livers.''&lt;ref name="GFQ" /&gt;

Other examples include:
*[[Sura]] 9, v.71&lt;ref name="GFQ" /&gt;
*[[Sura]] 9, v.112&lt;ref name="GFQ" /&gt;
*[[Sura]] 31, v.17&lt;ref name="GFQ" /&gt;

==Hadith examples==
[[Abu Sa‚Äòid al-Khudri]] reported that the prophet [[Muhammad]] said, "Whoever amongst you sees an evil, he must change it with his hand. If he is not able to do so, then with his tongue. And if he is not able to do so, then with his heart, and that is the weakest form of faith".&lt;ref name="TKFD" /&gt;

A standard medieval interpretation of this Hadith is, as [[Al-Nawawi]] had explained, that such passages of scripture had to be interpreted in accordance with established Shariah principles, such as the state's sole prerogative in declaring [[jihad]]. 'Changing the reprehensible by hand,' or by compulsion, was the purview of the state alone. 'Changing with the tongue' was the right of the ulama. Ordinary, individual Muslims should only reject the reprehensible with their hearts.&lt;ref name="jacb"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = A.C. Brown|first1 = Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan A.C. Brown|title = Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy|date = 2014|publisher = [[Oneworld Publications]]|isbn = 978-1780744209|page = 130|chapter = 4. Clinging to the Canon in a Ruptured World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fatawa Hindiyya / Fatawa Alamgiri, Dar el-Fekr, Beirut, 1310 A.H. vol.5 p.353. Quote: "Commanding the good with hand is for those in position of political authority, with tongue it is for the scholars and with the heart it for the laymen."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions (interpretation)==
A person should have knowledge of what is considered ''[[Fard|wajib]]'' (obligatory or duty) and ''[[haram]]'' (sinful or forbidden) in relation to interpreting the two requisites although in a broad-spectrum.

In [[astronomy]] and [[celestial navigation]], an '''ephemeris''' (plural: '''ephemerides'''; {{ety|la|ephemeris|diary}}, {{ety|gre|''ŒµœÜŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒØœÇ'' (ephemeris)|diary, journal}}{{sfn|ephemeris|1992}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.27:9:113.LSJ|title=Liddell &amp; Scott Dictionary on Perseus at University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ephemeris|title=Dictionary ‚àí ephemeris|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ephemeris|url=http://www.lexilogos.com/latin/gaffiot.php?q=ephemeris|work=Dictionnaire Gaffiot latin-fran√ßais}}&lt;/ref&gt;) gives the positions of naturally occurring [[astronomical objects]] as well as [[artificial satellites]] in the [[sky]] at a given [[time]] or times. Historically, positions were given as printed [[table (information)|table]]s of [[quantity|values]], given at regular intervals of date and time. Modern ephemerides are often computed electronically from mathematical models of the motion of astronomical objects and the Earth. Even though the calculation of these tables was one of the [[history of computing|first applications of mechanical computers]], printed ephemerides are still produced, as they are useful when computational devices are not available.

The astronomical position calculated from an ephemeris is given in the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical polar coordinate system]] of [[right ascension]] and [[declination]]. Some of the astronomical phenomena of interest to astronomers are [[eclipse]]s, [[apparent retrograde motion]]/planetary stations, planetary {{linktext|ingress}}es, [[sidereal time]], positions for the mean and true [[Lunar node|nodes of the moon]], the [[phases of the Moon]], and the positions of minor [[celestial bodies]] such as [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]].

Ephemerides are used in celestial navigation and astronomy. They are also used by some [[astrologers]].

== Modern ephemeris ==
For scientific uses, a modern planetary ephemeris comprises software that generates positions of planets and often of their satellites, [[asteroid]]s, or [[comet]]s, at virtually any time desired by the user.

Typically, such ephemerides cover several centuries, past and future; the future ones can be covered because the field of [[celestial mechanics]] has developed several accurate theories. Nevertheless, there are [[Secular variation|secular phenomena]] which cannot adequately be considered by ephemerides. The greatest uncertainties in the positions of planets are caused by the perturbations of numerous [[asteroid]]s, most of whose masses and orbits are poorly known, rendering their effect uncertain. Reflecting the continuing influx of new data and observations, [[NASA]]'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([[JPL]]) has revised its [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|published ephemerides]] nearly every year for the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgij A. Krasinsky]] and [[Victor A. Brumberg]], ''Secular Increase of Astronomical Unit from Analysis of the Major Planet Motions, and its Interpretation'' [http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/GAKVAB.pdf Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy 90: 267‚Äì288, (2004)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar system]] ephemerides are essential for the navigation of [[spacecraft]] and for all kinds of space observations of the [[planet]]s, their [[natural satellite]]s, [[star]]s, and [[Galaxy|galaxies]].

Scientific ephemerides for sky observers mostly contain the positions of celestial bodies in [[right ascension]] and [[declination]], because these coordinates are the most frequently used on star maps and telescopes. The [[Equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]] of the coordinate system must be given. It is, in nearly all cases, either the actual equinox (the equinox valid for that moment, often referred to as "of date" or "current"), or that of one of the "standard" equinoxes, typically [[J2000.0]], [[B1950.0]], or J1900. Star maps almost always use one of the standard equinoxes.

Scientific ephemerides often contain further useful data about the moon, planet, asteroid, or comet beyond the pure coordinates in the sky, such as elongation to the sun, brightness, distance, velocity, apparent diameter in the sky, phase angle, times of rise, transit, and set, etc.
Ephemerides of the planet [[Saturn]] also sometimes contain the apparent inclination of its ring.

[[Celestial navigation]] serves as a backup to the [[Global Positioning System]]. Software is widely available to assist with this form of navigation; some of this software has a self-contained ephemeris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = American Practical Navigator: An Epitiome of Navigation | date = 2002 | page = 270 | publisher = National Imagery and Mapping Agency | location = Bethesda, MD | url = http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_62&amp;pubCode=0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; When software is used that does not contain an ephemeris, or if no software is used, position data for celestial objects may be obtained from the modern ''[[Nautical Almanac]]'' or ''Air Almanac''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Almanacs and Other Publications ‚Äî Naval Oceanography Portal| accessdate = 11 November 2016| url = http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/publications | publisher = [[United States Naval Observatory]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ephemeris is usually only correct for a particular location on the Earth. In many cases, the differences are too small to matter. However, for nearby [[asteroid]]s or the [[Moon]], they can be quite important.

[[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) navigation satellites transmit electronic ephemeris data consisting of health and exact location data. A GPS receiver can use the transmissions from multiple such satellites to calculate its own location using [[trilateration]].

Other modern ephemerides recently created are the EPM (Ephemerides of Planets and the Moon), from the Russian Institute for Applied Astronomy of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pitjeva|first=Elena V.|title=The dynamical model of the planet motions and EPM ephemerides|journal=Highlights of Astronomy|date=August 2006|volume=14|pages=470|doi=10.1017/S1743921307011453|bibcode=2007HiA....14..470P}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the INPOP (''{{lang|fr|Int√©grateur num√©rique plan√©taire de l'[[Observatoire de Paris]]}}'') by the French [[IMCCE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INPOP10e, a 4-D planetary ephemeris|url=http://www.imcce.fr/inpop/|publisher=IMCCE|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3717">'''Epochalism''' is an attitude of respect for the progressive [[spirit of the age]] and for social and technological advancement, which was contrasted by [[Clifford Geertz]] with what he termed the ([[Essentialism|essentialist]]) valorisation of traditional values. He viewed this distinction as a central social polarity pervading developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''The Interpretation of Culture'' (1973)  p. 240-1&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the term used has been used to describe the [[Post-Fordism|post-Fordist]], [[postmodern]] belief that the current era or epoch represents a fundamental clean break with the past; is something unique in human history; and due to this radical change, previous rules will no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 44 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Urry, ''Climate Change and Society'' (2011) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polarities in emerging economies==
Epochalism in the developing world can be seen purely as a progressive force, favouring movement toward secularisation and industrial advance, as opposed to a regressive return to the traditional values of community and [[Gemeinschaft]].&lt;ref&gt;B. K. Khlief, ''Language, Ethnicity and Education in Wales'' (1980) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice the situation is likely to be more complicated: nationalist struggles for independence have often relied on essentialist appeals to authentic ethnic communities and cultural practices, as well as to epochalism, in order to free themselves from dependence on a Western [[Conceptual model|model]]/Western control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Said]], ''Culture and Imperialism'' (1993) p. 263 and p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet epochalism==
The rapid rise of the [[World Wide Web]] led many [[digerati]] to see it as an unprecedented human phenomenon, wholly divorced from all past experience.&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evgeny Morozov]] used the term epochalism to describe the prevalent 21st-century belief that "one is living in truly exceptional times ‚Äì an intellectual fallacy I call 'epochalism{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous technological advances, as with the age of railways or the age of broadcasting,&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; had of course made very similar claims for themselves; and [[A. E. Housman]] a century before had denounced the mind "which commands no outlook upon the past or the future, but believes that the fashion of the present, unlike all fashions heretofore, will endure perpetually".&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Housman, ''Collected Poems and Selected Prose'' (1988) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Late modernity]] however, with its shortening of awareness of time-spans and its focus on the present,&lt;ref&gt;I. Craib, ''The Importance of Disappointment'' (1994) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; makes the short-sightedness of epochalism - with what Morozov saw as its dark fetishism of Internet-based solutions&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; - an increasingly plausible intellectual posture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22928">In '''flow chemistry''', a [[chemical reaction]] is run in a continuously flowing stream rather than in [[batch production]].  In other words, pumps move fluid into a tube, and where tubes join one another, the fluids contact one another.  If these fluids are reactive, a reaction takes place.  Flow chemistry is a well-established technique for use at a large scale when [[manufacturing]] large quantities of a given material.  However, the term has only been coined recently for its application on a [[laboratory]] scale.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kirschning (Editor): [http://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/browse/singleSeries.htm?sn=4 Chemistry in flow systems] and [http://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/browse/singleSeries.htm?sn=17 Chemistry in flow systems II] Thematic Series in the Open Access [[Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry]].&lt;/ref&gt; Often, [[microreactors]] are used.

== Batch vs. flow ==
===Comparing parameter definitions in Batch vs Flow===
*Reaction [[stoichiometry]]: In batch production this is defined by the concentration of [[chemical reagent]]s and their [[volumetric]] [[ratio]]. In flow this is defined by the [[concentration]] of reagents and the ratio of their flow rate.
*Residence time: In batch production this is determined by how long a vessel is held at a given temperature. In flow the volumetric [[Residence time distribution|residence time]] is given by the ratio of volume of the reactor and the overall flow rate, as most often, [[plug flow reactor]]s are used.

== Running flow reactions ==

Choosing to run a [[chemical reaction]] using flow chemistry, either in a [[microreactor]] or other mixing device offers a variety of pros and cons.

=== Advantages ===
* Reaction temperature can be raised above the solvent's [[boiling point]] as the volume of the laboratory devices is typically small. Typically, non-compressible fluids are used with no gas volume so that the [[expansion factor]] as a function of [[pressure]] is small.
* Mixing can be achieved within seconds at the smaller scales used in flow chemistry.
* Heat transfer is intensified. Mostly, because the area to volume ratio is large. As a result, endothermic and exothermic reactions can be thermostated easily and consistently. The temperature gradient can be steep, allowing efficient control over reaction time.
* Safety is increased: 
** Thermal mass of the system is dominated by the apparatus making thermal runaways unlikely. 
** Smaller reaction volume is also considered a safety benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Movsisyan|first=M.|last2=Delbeke|first2=E. I. P.|last3=Berton|first3=J. K. E. T.|last4=Battilocchio|first4=C.|last5=Ley|first5=S. V.|last6=Stevens|first6=C.

** The reactor operates under [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady-state]] conditions. 
* Flow reactions can be automated with far less effort than batch reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Fitzpatrick|first = Daniel E.|last2 = Battilocchio|first2 = Claudio|last3 = Ley|first3 = Steven V.|date = 2016-02-19|title = A Novel Internet-Based Reaction Monitoring, Control and Autonomous Self-Optimization Platform for Chemical Synthesis|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.oprd.5b00313|journal = Organic Process Research &amp; Development|volume = 20|issue = 2|pages = 386‚Äì394|doi = 10.1021/acs.oprd.5b00313|issn = 1083-6160}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for unattended operation and experimental planning. By coupling the output of the reactor to a detector system, it is possible to go further and create an automated system which can sequentially investigate a range of possible reaction parameters (varying [[stoichiometry]], residence time and temperature) and therefore explore reaction parameters with little or no intervention. 
Typical drivers are higher yields/selectivities, less needed manpower or a higher safety level.

* [[multistep synthesis|Multi step reactions]] can be arranged in a continuous sequence.  This can be especially beneficial if intermediate compounds are unstable, toxic, or sensitive to air, since they will exist only momentarily and in very small quantities.
* The position along the flowing stream and reaction time point are directly related to one another. This means that it is possible to arrange the system such that further reagents can be introduced into the flowing reaction stream at a precise time point that is desired.
* It is possible to arrange a flowing system such that purification is coupled with the reaction. There are three primary techniques that are used:
** Solid phase scavenging&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Christopher D. |author2=Baxendale, Ian R. |author3=Tranmer, Geoffrey K. |author4=Baumann, Marcus |author5=Smith, Stephen C. |author6=Lewthwaite, Russell A. |author7=Ley, Steven V. |title=Tagged phosphine reagents to assist reaction work-up by phase-switched scavenging using a modular flow reactor|journal=Org. Biomol. Chem.|year=2007|volume=5|pages=1562‚Äì1568|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2007/OB/b703033a|accessdate=10 May 2013|doi=10.1039/b703033a}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Chromatographic separation
** Liquid/Liquid Extraction
* Reactions which involve reagents containing dissolved gases are easily handled, whereas in batch a pressurized "bomb" reactor would be necessary.
* Multi phase liquid reactions (e.g. [[Phase-transfer catalyst|phase transfer catalysis]]) can be performed in a straightforward way, with high reproducibility over a range of scales and conditions.
* Scale up of a proven reaction can be achieved rapidly with little or no process development work, by either changing the reactor volume or by running several reactors in parallel, provided that flows are recalculated to achieve the same residence times.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Dedicated equipment is needed for precise continuous dosing (e.g. [[pumps]]), connections, etc.
* Start up and shut down procedures have to be established. 
* Scale up of ''micro effects'' such as the high area to volume ratio is not possible and [[economy of scale]] may not apply. Typically, a scale up leads to a dedicated plant.
* Safety issues for the storage of reactive material still apply.
The drawbacks have been discussed in view of establishing small scale continuous production processes by Pashkova and Greiner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pashkova | first1 = A. | last2 = Greiner | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1002/cite.201100037 | title = Towards Small-Scale Continuous Chemical Production: Technology Gaps and Challenges | journal = Chemie Ingenieur Technik | pages = n/a | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuous flow reactors ==
[[Image:Coflore ACR.jpg|thumb|reaction stages of a multi-cell flow reactor]]

[[Continuous reactors]] are typically tube like and manufactured from non-reactive materials such as stainless steel, glass and polymers. Mixing methods include [[diffusion]] alone (if the diameter of the reactor is small e.g. &lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm, such as in [[microreactors]]) and [[static mixers]]. Continuous flow reactors allow good control over reaction conditions including heat transfer, time and mixing.

The residence time of the reagents in the reactor (i.e. the amount of time that the reaction is heated or cooled) is calculated from the volume of the reactor and the flow rate through it:

:Residence time = Reactor Volume / Flow Rate

Therefore, to achieve a longer residence time, reagents can be pumped more slowly and/or a larger volume reactor used.  Production rates can vary from nano liters to liters per minute.

Some examples of flow reactors are spinning disk reactors (Colin Ramshaw);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oxley|first=Paul|author2=Brechtelsbauer, Clemens |author3=Ricard, Francois |author4=Lewis, Norman |author5= Ramshaw, Colin |title=Evaluation of Spinning Disk Reactor Technology for the Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals|journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.|year=2000|volume=39|issue=7|pages=2175‚Äì2182|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/3004572/1740005940/name/%255BTKI%255D%2BEvaluation%2Bof%2BSpinning%2BDisk.pdf|accessdate=10 May 2013|doi=10.1021/ie990869u}}&lt;/ref&gt; spinning tube reactors; multi-cell flow reactors; oscillatory flow reactors; [[microreactors]]; hex reactors; and 'aspirator reactors'.
In an aspirator reactor a pump propels one reagent, which causes a reactant to be sucked in. This type of reactor was patented around 1941 by the Nobel company for the production of [[nitroglycerin]].

=== Flow reactor scale ===
The smaller scale of micro flow reactors or [[microreactors]] can make them ideal for process development experiments. Although it is possible to operate flow processes at a ton scale, [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] efficiency benefits from improved [[thermal transfer|thermal]] and [[mass transfer]] as well as mass transport.

== Key application areas ==

=== Use of gases in flow ===
Laboratory scale flow reactors are ideal systems for using gases, particularly those that are toxic or associated with other hazards.  The gas reactions that have been most successfully adapted to flow are [[hydrogenation]] and [[carbonylation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Csaj√°gi|first=Csaba |author2=Borcsek, Bernadett |author3=Niesz, Kriszti√°n |author4=Kov√°cs, Ildik√≥ |author5=Sz√©kelyhidi, Zsolt |author6=Bajk√≥, Zolt√°n |author7=√úrge, L√°szl√≥ |author8=Darvas, Ferenc|title=High-Efficiency Aminocarbonylation by Introducing CO to a Pressurized Continuous Flow Reactor|journal=Org. Lett.|date=22 March 2008|volume=10|issue=8|pages=1589‚Äì1592|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ol7030894|accessdate=10 May 2013|doi=10.1021/ol7030894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mercadante|first=Michael A.|author2=Leadbeater, Nicholas E.|title=Continuous-flow, palladium-catalysed alkoxycarbonylation reactions using a prototype reactor in which it is possible to load gas and heat simultaneously|journal=Org. Biomol.

D. |author2=Ghaini, A. |author3=Constantinou, A. |author4=Cantu-Perez, A. |author5=Motherwell, W. B.  |author6=Gavriilidis, A.|title=Ozonolysis in Flow Using Capillary Reactors|journal=Org. Process Res. Dev.|date=23 June 2011|volume=15|issue=5|pages=989‚Äì996|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/op200036d|accessdate=10 May 2013|doi=10.1021/op200036d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons for the suitability of flow systems for hazardous gas handling are:
*Systems allow the use of a fixed bed [[catalyst]]. Combined with low solution concentrations, this allows all compound to be adsorbed to catalyst in the presence of gas
*Comparatively small amounts of gas are continually exhausted by the system, eliminating the need for many of the special precautions normally required for handling toxic and/or flammable gases
*The addition of pressure means that a far greater proportion of the gas will be in solution during the reaction than is the case conventionally
*The greatly enhanced mixing of the solid, liquid and gaseous phases allows the researcher to exploit the kinetic benefits of elevated temperatures without being concerned about the gas being displaced from solution

=== Photochemistry in combination with flow chemistry ===
Continuous flow photochemistry offers multiple advantages over batch [[photochemistry]]. Photochemical reactions are driven by the number of [[photon]]s that are able to activate molecules causing the desired reaction. The large surface area to volume ratio of a microreactor maximizes the illumination, and at the same time allows for efficient cooling, which decreases the [[Side product|thermal side products]].

=== Electrochemistry in combination with flow chemistry ===
Continuous flow electrochemistry like continuous photochemistry offers many advantages over analogous batch conditions. Electrochemistry like Photochemical reactions can be considered as a 'reagent-less' reactions. In an electrochemical reaction the reaction is facilitated by the number of electrons that are able to activate molecules causing the desired reaction. Continuous electrochemistry apparatus reduces the distance between the electrodes used to allow better control of the number of electrons transferred to the reaction media enabling better control and selectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Noyhouzer, T. and Mandler, D. (2013), A New Electrochemical Flow Cell for the Remote Sensing of Heavy Metals. Electroanalysis, 25: 109‚Äì115. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elan.201200369/full doi:10.1002/elan.201200369]
&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments in electrochemical flow-systems enabled the combination of reaction-oriented electrochemical flow systems with species-focused spectroscopy which allows complete analysis of reactions involving multiple electron transfer steps, as well as unstable intermediates.&lt;ref&gt;Noyhouzer T, Snowden M.E., Tefashe U.M., and Mauzeroll J., Modular Flow-Through Platform for Spectroelectrochemical Analysis,
Analytical Chemistry 2017 89 (10), 5246-5253 [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04649 DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04649]&lt;/ref&gt; These systems which are referred to as [[spectroelectrochemistry]](SEC) systems can enable the use of [[Ultraviolet‚Äìvisible spectroscopy|UV-vis]] as well as more complex methods such as [[electrochemiluminescence]](ECL). Furthermore, using electrochemistry allows another degree of flexibility since the use has control not only on the flow parameters and the nature of the electrochemical measurement itself, but also on the geometry or nature of the electrode (or electrodes in the case of an electrode array).&lt;ref&gt;Noyhouzer T,Perry SC,Vicente-Luis A, Hayes PL and Mauzeroll J., The Best of Both Worlds: Combining Ultramicroelectrode and Flow Cell Technologies, Journal of the Electrochemical Society 2018 165 (2), H10-15 [http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/165/2/H10.short DOI: 10.1149/2.0641802jes]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process development ===
The process development change from a serial approach to a parallel approach. In batch the chemist works first followed by the chemical engineer. In flow chemistry this changes to a parallel approach, where chemist and chemical engineer work interactively. Typically there is a plant setup in the lab, which is a tool for both. This setup can be either commercial or non commercial. The development scale can be small (ml/hour) for idea verification using a [[chip system]] and in the range of a couple of liters per hour for scalable systems like the [[flow miniplant]] technology. Chip systems are mainly used for liquid-liquid application while [[flow miniplant]] systems can deal with solids or viscous material.

=== Scale up of microwave reactions ===
Microwave reactors are frequently used for small scale batch chemistry. However, due to the extremes of temperature and pressure reached in a microwave it is often difficult to transfer these reactions to conventional non-microwave apparatus for subsequent development, leading to difficulties with scaling studies. A flow reactor with suitable high temperature ability and pressure control can directly and accurately mimic the conditions created in a microwave reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Damm | first1 = M. | last2 = Glasnov | first2 = T. N. | last3 = Kappe | first3 = C. O. | title = Translating High-Temperature Microwave Chemistry to Scalable Continuous Flow Processes | doi = 10.1021/op900297e | journal = Organic Process Research &amp; Development | volume = 14 | pages = 215 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This eases the synthesis of larger quantities by extending reaction time.

=== Manufacturing scale solutions ===
Flow systems can be scaled to the tons per hour scale. [[Plant redesign]] (batch to conti for an existing plant), Unit Operation (exchaning only one reaction step) and [[Modular Multi-purpose]] (Cutting a continuous plant into modular units) are typical realization solutions for flow processes.

=== Other uses of flow ===
It is possible to run experiments in flow using more sophisticated techniques, such as [[solid phase chemistry|solid phase chemistries]]. Solid phase [[reagent]]s, catalysts or scavengers can be used in [[solution]] and pumped through glass columns, for example, the synthesis of alkaloid natural product oxomaritidine using solid phase chemistries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baxendale|first=Ian R. |author2=Jon Deeley |author3=Charlotte M. Griffiths-Jones |author4=Steven V. Ley |author5=Steen Saaby |author6=Geoffrey K. Tranmer|title=A flow process for the multi-step synthesis of the alkaloid natural product oxomaritidine: a new paradigm for molecular assembly|journal=Chemical Communications|year=2006|issue=24|pages=2566‚Äì2568|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2006/CC/b600382f|accessdate=9 May 2013|doi= 10.1039/B600382F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an increasing interest in polymerization as a continuous flow process.  For example, '''[[Reversible addition‚àífragmentation chain transfer polymerization|Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain Transfer]]''' or '''RAFT''' polymerization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hornung|first=Christian H. |author2=Guerrero-Sanchez, Carlos |author3=Brasholz, Malte |author4=Saubern, Simon |author5=Chiefari, John |author6=Moad, Graeme |author7=Rizzardo, Ezio |author8=Thang, San H. |title=Controlled RAFT Polymerization in a Continuous Flow Microreactor|journal=Org.

Continuous flow techniques have also been used for controlled generation of nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles in a Flow Microreactor|url=http://syrris.com/news/syrris-in-publications/368-synthesis-of-gold-nanoparticles-in-a-flow-microreactor|work=Rudy Metale|author=Marek Wojnicki|author2=Krzysztof Pac≈Çawski |author3=Magdalena Luty-B≈Çocho |author4=Krzysztof Fitzner |author5=Paul Oakley |author6=Alan Stretton |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very rapid mixing and excellent temperature control of [[microreactors]] are able to give consistent and narrow particle size distribution of nanoparticles.

== Segmented flow chemistry ==
As discussed above, running experiments in continuous flow systems is difficult, especially when one is developing new chemical reactions, which requires screening of multiple components, varying stoichiometry, temperature and residence time. In continuous flow, experiments are performed serially, which means one experimental condition can be tested. Experimental throughput is highly variable and as typically five times the residence time is needed for obtaining [[Steady state (chemistry)|steady state]]. For temperature variation the thermal mass of the reactor as well as peripherals such as fluid baths need to be considered. More often than not, the analysis time needs to be considered.

Segmented flow is an approach that improves upon the speed in which screening, optimization and libraries can be conducted in flow chemistry. Segmented flow uses a "[[Plug flow reactor model|Plug Flow]]" approach where specific volumetric experimental mixtures are created and then injected into a high pressure flow reactor. Diffusion of the segment (reaction mixture) is minimized by using immiscible solvent on the leading and rear ends of the segment.

|[[File:Segment Graphics.gif|thumb|250px|alt=Segment flow through reactor|Segment serial flow]]
|}

One of the primary benefits of segmented flow chemistry is the ability to run experiments in a serial/parallel manner where experiments that share the same residence time and temperature can be repeatedly created and injected. In addition, the volume of each experiment is independent to that of the volume of the flow tube thereby saving a significant amount of reactant per experiment. When performing reaction screening and libraries, segment composition is typically varied by composition of matter. When performing reaction optimization, segments vary by stoichiometry.

|[[File:Serial-Parallel Segmented Flow Chemistry.jpg|230px|thumb|upright|alt=Serial/Parallel Segmented Flow|Serial/Parallel Segments]]
|}

Segmented flow is also used with online LCMS, both analytical and preparative where the segments are detected when exiting the reactor using UV and subsequently diluted for analytical LCMS or injected directly for preparative LCMS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9954">'''Frame analysis''' (also called '''framing analysis''') is a [[multi-disciplinary]] [[social science]] research method used to analyze how people understand situations and activities. The concept is generally attributed to the work of [[Erving Goffman]] and his 1974 book ''Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience'' and has been developed in [[social movement]] theory, [[policy studies]] and elsewhere.

Framing theory and frame analysis is a broad theoretical approach that has been used in [[communication studies]], news (Johnson-Cartee, 1995), politics, and social movements among other applications. "Framing is the process by which a communication source, such as a news organization, defines and constructs a political issue or public controversy" (Nelson, Oxley, &amp; Clawson, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;221).

==As rhetorical criticism==
Frame analysis had been proposed as a type of rhetorical analysis for political actors in the 1980s.  Political communication researcher [[Jim A. Kuypers]] first published his work advancing framing analysis as a rhetorical perspective in 1997. His approach begins inductively by looking for themes that persist across time in a text (for Kuypers, primarily news narratives on an issue or event), and then determining how those themes are framed. Kuypers' work begins with the assumption that frames are powerful rhetorical entities that "induce us to filter our perceptions of the world in particular ways, essentially making some aspects of our multi-dimensional reality more noticeable than other aspects. They operate by making some information more salient than other information. ..."&lt;ref&gt;
Jim A. Kuypers, '' Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action '', Lexington Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In "Framing Analysis From a Rhetorical Perspective" Kuypers details the differences between framing analysis as rhetorical criticism and as a social scientific endeavor, in particular arguing that framing criticism offers insights unavailable to social scientists.&lt;ref&gt;
Jim A. Kuypers, "Framing Analysis From a Rhetorical Perspective", P. D'Angelo and J. A. Kuypers, eds., ''Doing News Framing Analysis,'' Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 work, ''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action''&lt;ref&gt;
''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action''&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers offers a detailed template for doing framing analysis from a rhetorical perspective. According to Kuypers, "Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner. Frames operate in four key ways: they define problems, diagnose causes, make moral judgments, and suggest remedies. Frames are often found within a narrative account of an issue or event, and are generally the central organizing idea."&lt;ref&gt;Jim A. Kuypers, ''Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age'' , Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers' work is based on the premise that framing is a rhetorical process and as such it is best examined from a rhetorical point of view.

==For social movements==
Framing has been utilized to explain the process of social movements (Snow &amp; Benford, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Snow, David A. and Robert D. Benford (1988). "Ideology, Frame Resonance, and Participant Mobilization". Pp. 197-217 in Bert Klandermans, Hanspeter Kriesi, and Sidney Tarrow (eds.), From Structure to Action: Social Movement Participation Across Cultures. Greenwich, Conn.: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Movements are carriers of beliefs and ideologies. In addition, they are part of the process of constructing meaning for participants and opposers (Snow &amp; Benford, 1988). Mass movements are said to be successful when the frames projected align with the frames of participants to produce resonance between the two parties. This is a process known as ''frame alignment''.

==Frame alignment‚Äîa process to explain social movement theory==
Snow and Benford (1988) say that frame alignment is an important element in social mobilization or movement. They argue that when individual frames become linked in congruency and complementariness, that "frame alignment" occurs (p.&amp;nbsp;198; Snow et al. 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;464&lt;ref&gt;Snow, David A., R. Burke Rochford, Jr., Steven K. Worden, and Robert D. Benford. 1986. "Frame Alignment Processes, Micromobilization, and Movement Participation." American Sociological Review 51: 464-481.&lt;/ref&gt;), producing "frame resonance", which is key to the process of a group transitioning from one frame to another (although not all framing efforts are successful). The conditions that affect or constrain framing efforts are:
* "The robustness, completeness, and thoroughness of the framing effort". Snow and Benford (1988) identify three core framing tasks and the degree to which these tasks are attended to will determine participant mobilization. The three tasks are: 
:# diagnostic framing for the identification of a problem and assignment of blame;
:# prognostic framing to suggest solutions, strategies, and tactics to a problem; and
:# motivational framing that serves as a call to arms or rationale for action.
* The relationship between the proposed frame and the larger belief system; centrality ‚Äì the frame cannot be of low hierarchical significance and salience within the larger belief system. Its range and interrelatedness ‚Äì if the frame is linked to only one core belief or value that, in itself, is of limited range within the larger belief system, the frame has a high degree of being discounted.
* Relevance of the frame to the realities of the participants; a frame must be relevant to participants and inform them. Relevancy can be constrained by empirical credibility or testability, it relates to participant experience, and has narrative fidelity, that is, it fits in with existing cultural myths and narrations.
* Cycles of protest (Tarrow 1983a; 1983b); the point at which the frame emerges on the timeline of the current era and existing preoccupations with social change. Framing efforts may be affected by previous frames.

Snow and Benford (1988) propose that once proper frames are constructed as described above, large-scale changes in society such as those necessary for social movement can be achieved through frame alignment.

==For political thought==
Frame analysis for political thought has been dominated by two popular cognitive scientists: [[George Lakoff]], nurturant parent governance; and [[Frank Luntz]], strict father governance.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Watts, co-founder, Empathy Surplus Project, http://empathysurplus.com/?recruiter_id=2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four types of frame alignment==
There are four types, which include frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension and frame transformation.

# '''Frame bridging''' is the "linkage of two or more ideologically congruent but structurally unconnected frames regarding a particular issue or problem" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;467). It involves the linkage of a movement to "unmobilized sentiment pools or public opinion preference clusters" (p.&amp;nbsp;467) of people who share similar views or grievances but who lack an organizational base.
#'''Frame amplification''' refers to "the clarification and invigoration of an interpretive frame that bears on a particular issue, problem, or set of events" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;469). This interpretive frame usually involves the invigorating of values or beliefs.
# '''Frame extensions''' are a movement's effort to incorporate participants by extending the boundaries of the proposed frame to include or encompass the views, interests, or sentiments of targeted groups. (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;469)
#'''Frame transformation''' is a process required when the proposed frames "may not resonate with, and on occasion may even appear antithetical to, conventional lifestyles or rituals and extant interpretive frames" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;473). When this happens, new values, new meanings and understandings are required in order to secure participants and support. Goffman (1974, p.&amp;nbsp;43‚Äì44) calls this "keying" where "activities, events, and biographies that are already meaningful from the standpoint of some primary framework transpose in terms of another framework" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;474) such that they are seen differently. There are two types of frame transformation:
## '''Domain-specific transformations''' such as the attempt to alter the status of groups of people, and
## '''Global interpretive frame transformation''' where the scope of change is quite radical as in a change of world views, total conversions of thought, or uprooting of all that is familiar (e.g. moving from [[communism]] to [[market capitalism]]; religious conversion, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2917">The '''Harmonised monitoring scheme''' is a long term [[river]] [[water quality]] [[environmental monitoring|monitoring]] scheme in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/environment/inlwater/iwhmsdb.htm DEFRA - Freshwater quality - Harmonised Monitoring Scheme] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130402151656/http://archive.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/environment/inlwater/iwhmsdb.htm |date=2013-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to refer to the long term [[data set]]s produced by the scheme.

==Establishment==

The scheme was established in 1974 by the [[Department of the Environment]] with much of the initial planning and implementation undertaken by the [[Water Research Centre]]. It involved the creation of a network of sites across the UK. Most sites were at the downstream [[freshwater]] limits of the larger rivers although some of the largest rivers also included additional locations below major tributary confluences. Before inclusion of any location in the survey, homogeneity testing was carried out to characterise quality variations laterally and vertically within the river section chosen. For each designated point a specific sampling location was identified based on the results of the homogeneity exercise. In addition laboratories who were to undertake the analysis of samples were identified and a comprehensive [[Analytical quality control|AQC]] exercise was conducted to ensure comparability of data derived from the monitoring programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/1979/AN/an9790400290 Analytical Quality Control in the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The scheme was originally intended to operate for 10 years from 1974 to 1984 to provide date to the Department of the Environment to permit the identification of national trends in water quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/research/completed-research/reports/dwi0224.pdf Co-ordination of analytical control for DOE Harmonised monitoring scheme]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also intended to satisfy the acquirements of the EU decision on the exchange of monitoring data requirements.

==Operation==
The scheme is administered by the [[Environment Agency]] in [[England]], by [[Natural Resources Wales]] in [[Wales]] and by [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency|SEPA]] in [[Scotland]] and involves routine monitoring at 230 sites including 56 river systems in Scotland.

==Data==
The data produced by the scheme provides a continuous and consistent record of quality of rivers across the UK for more than 30 years and can be used to demonstrate changes in water quality over that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepa.org.uk/science_and_research/data_and_reports/water/scottish_river_water_quality.aspx SEPA -Scottish River water quality trends]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Holus''' is a [[holographic]] product under development by H+Technology. The concept was first developed in 2013, before funding via [[Kickstarter]] meant the product could be taken to market. The purpose of Holus is to simulate [[holographic]] experiences and is technically different from typical hologram stickers found on credit cards and currency notes.

Holus has been criticized by some commentators as a revamping [[Pepper's ghost]], a 19th-century optical trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@sableraph/how-to-sell-a-19th-century-parlor-trick-as-a-3d-holographic-display-c12a861cb8bf|title=Did Holus scam 200.000$ of Kickstarter backers using a 19th century parlor trick?|date=11 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/07/10/why-is-kickstarter-letting-a-h.html|title=Why is Kickstarter letting a hologram "scam" raise $250k?|first=Wrecksdart|last=Says|date=10 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Holus was developed in late 2013 by a team in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Gorey|first1 = Colm|title = The Holus tabletop hologram generator is now a reality|url = https://www.siliconrepublic.com/gear/2015/06/11/the-holus-tabletop-hologram-generator-is-now-a-reality|publisher = Silicon Republic|date = June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Holus Creates a New 3D Experience|url = http://smartreality.co/holus-creates-a-new-3d-experience/|publisher = SmartReality|date = September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before H+ Tech began looking for funding for the device, Holus won a number of awards for its design. This included he Vancouver User Experience Award in the non-profit category for partnering up with Ronald McDonald House to build Magic Room and the Peoples Choice Award to achieve excellence in joy, elegance, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Vancouver User Experience Awards winners announced|url = http://habaneroconsulting.com/about/news/vancouver-user-experience-awards-winners-announced|publisher = Habanero Consulting|date = December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first major coverage came from a review by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in early 2015. At the time, the technology was demonstrated to bring animals to life within the 3D glass box. The product was referred to in the review as roughly the "size of a microwave".&lt;ref name="mit2"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Metz|first1 = Rachel|title = Virtual Creatures in a Box, Controlled by You|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/535456/virtual-creatures-in-a-box-controlled-by-you/|publisher = [[MIT Technology Review]]|date = February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept went on to win two awards at the NextBC awards in [[Canada]] in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = DigiBC - Digital Media &amp; Wireless in BC|url = http://www.digibc.org/cpages/blog|publisher = DigiBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to build mass versions of the product, a [[Kickstarter]] campaign was launched in order to take the idea to market. It used a similar technology to the [[optical illusion]] known as [[Pepper's ghost]]. This drew criticism from some during its [[Kickstarter]] campaign. It launched its [[Kickstarter]] campaign in June 2015 and generated twice its target of $40,000 within the first 48 hours.&lt;ref name="techcrunch2"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Tepper|first1 = Fitz|title = Holus Is A Tabletop Device That Turns Digital Media Into A 3D Hologram|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/10/holus-is-a-tabletop-device-that-turns-digital-media-into-a-3d-hologram/#.ry9hfw:AcpM|publisher = [[TechCrunch]]|date = June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology is similar to the technology used to display the music artists [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Usmar|first1 = Jo|title = Dead rapper Tupac is lined up for a tour after his Coachella Festival comeback|url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/weird-celeb-news/after-a-hologram-of-tupac-performs-at-coachella-797345|publisher = [[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|date = April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the technology has advanced, with a number of [[startup company|startups]] entering the market. One of these was H+ Technology, who first began working on the technology in early 2013. The aim of the product at the time has remained the same until today, to produce 3D technology that can be used in the home on a tabletop.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Other reviews likened it to the technology used in the [[Star Wars]] films when the character [[R2-D2]] projected a [[hologram]] call on a small platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Griffiths|first1 = Sarah|title = The force is strong with this one! Star Wars-style 'holobox' creates virtual 3D worlds and lets you make hologram calls|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3118591/The-force-strong-one-450-Star-Wars-style-holobox-creates-virtual-3D-worlds-lets-make-hologram-calls.html|publisher = [[Daily Mail]]|date = June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
Due to the technology being in its infancy, the media has covered the R&amp;D of the product and its potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interactive Holographic platform Holus, with 3D printing design options, successfully funded within hours |url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20150611-interactive-holographic-platform-holus-with-3d-printing-design-options.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613192312/http://www.3ders.org/articles/20150611-interactive-holographic-platform-holus-with-3d-printing-design-options.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 13, 2015 |publisher=3ders |date=June 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spatial light modulator]]s have been mentioned as one potential development on future versions of Holus. The [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Simon Fraser University]] have both assisted with the research work of such displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = H+Technology breaks through crowdfunding goal on first day|url = https://www.ece.ubc.ca/news/201506/htechnology-breaks-through-crowdfunding-goal-first-day|publisher = [[University of Columbia]]|date = June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4074">'''Hydroinformatics''' is a branch of [[Information science|informatics]] which concentrates on the application of [[information technology|information and communications technologies]] (ICTs) in addressing the increasingly serious problems of the equitable and efficient use of [[water]] for many different purposes. Growing out of the earlier discipline of [[computational hydraulics]], the numerical [[simulation]] of water flows and related processes remains a mainstay of hydroinformatics, which encourages a focus not only on the technology but on its application in a social context. 

On the technical side, in addition to [[computational hydraulics]], hydroinformatics has a strong interest in the use of techniques originating in the so-called [[artificial intelligence]] community, such as [[artificial neural networks]] or recently [[support vector machines]] and [[genetic programming]]. These might be used with large collections of observed data for the purpose of [[data mining]] for knowledge discovery, or with data generated from an existing, physically based model in order to generate a computationally efficient emulator of that model for some purpose.

Hydroinformatics recognises the inherently social nature of the problems of water management and of decision making processes, and strives to understand the social processes by which technologies are brought into use. Since the problems of water management are most severe in the majority world, while the resources to obtain and develop technological solutions are concentrated in the hands of the minority, the need to examine these social processes are particularly acute.

Hydroinformatics draws on and integrates [[hydraulics]], [[hydrology]], [[environmental engineering]] and many other disciplines. It sees application at all points in the [[water cycle]] from atmosphere to ocean, and in artificial interventions in that cycle such as urban drainage and water supply systems. It provides support for decision making at all levels from governance and policy through management to operations.

Hydroinformatics has a growing world-wide community of researchers and practitioners, and postgraduate programmes in Hydroinformatics are offered by many leading institutions. The [[Journal of Hydroinformatics]] provides a specific outlet for Hydroinformatics research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwaponline.com/jh/toc.htm IWA Publishing - Journal of Hydroinformatics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the community gathers to exchange ideas at the biennial conferences. These activities are coordinated by the joint [[IAHR]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iahr.org/ International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Water Association|IWA]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwa-network.org/ IWA HomePage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Association of Hydrological Sciences|IAHS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://iahs.info/ IAHS-AISH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.iwahq.org/Home/Networks/Specialist_groups/List_of_groups/Hydroinformatics/ Hydroinformatics Section].

There is a growing need for professionals and managers to appreciate and work with these new technologies and tools.

The '''Ikaria Study''' is a small-scale survey by  the [[University of Athens]] School of Medicine of the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and lifestyle of  [[Greek people]] over age 80 on the island of Ikaria.&lt;ref name="DAN BUETTNER"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that the Ikarian diet includes [[olive oil]], [[red wine]], [[fish]], [[coffee]], [[herbal tea]], [[honey]], potatoes, [[garbanzo bean]]s, [[black-eyed pea]]s, [[lentils]], and a  limited amount of meat, sugar and [[dairy products]],  except [[goat milk]].&lt;ref name="DAN BUETTNER" /&gt;

The data showed that people on Ikaria were  reaching the age of 90 at 2.5 times the rate Americans do, and that  Ikarian men   are almost four times as likely as American men to reach age 90.&lt;ref name="DAN BUETTNER" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38574">'''Inquiry-based learning''' (also '''enquiry-based learning''' in [[British English]])&lt;ref&gt;The UK dictionaries Collins and Longman list the spelling "inquiry" first, and Oxford simply calls it another spelling, without labeling it as US English.&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[active learning]] that starts by posing questions, problems or scenarios‚Äîrather than simply presenting established facts or portraying a smooth path to knowledge. The process is often assisted by a [[facilitator]]. Inquirers will identify and research issues and questions to develop their knowledge or solutions. Inquiry-based learning includes [[problem-based learning]], and is generally used in small scale investigations and projects, as well as [[research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceebl.manchester.ac.uk/ebl/ What is Inquiry Based Learning (EBL)?] Centre for Excellence in Enquiry-Based Learning. University of Manchester. Retrieved October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The inquiry-based instruction is principally very closely related to the development and practice of thinking skills.&lt;ref&gt;Dost√°l, J. (2015). [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxkb3MwMDN8Z3g6MmU4MzM5YzA1YzcyNzM4 Inquiry-based instruction : Concept, essence, importance and contribution.] Olomouc: Palack√Ω University, {{ISBN|978-80-244-4507-6}}, doi 10.5507/pdf.15.24445076&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Inquiry-based learning is primarily a [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] method, developed during the [[discovery learning]] movement of the 1960s as a response to traditional forms of instruction‚Äîwhere people were required to memorize information from instructional materials,&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. S. (1961). "The act of discovery". Harvard Educational Review 31 (1): 21‚Äì32.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[direct instruction]] and [[rote learning]].  The philosophy of inquiry based learning finds its antecedents in [[constructivist learning]] theories, such as the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]], [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]], and [[Paulo Freire|Freire]] among others,&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J (1997) How We Think, New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P.

Vygotsky approached constructivism as learning from an experience that is influenced by society and the facilitator. The meaning constructed from an experience can be concluded as an individual or within a group.&lt;ref name="journals2.scholarsportal.info"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toward a theory of experience"/&gt;

In the 1960s Joseph Schwab called for inquiry to be divided into three distinct levels.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, J. (1960) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1083585 Inquiry, the Science Teacher, and the Educator]. The School Review ¬© 1960 The University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; This was later formalized by Marshall Herron in 1971, who developed the Herron Scale to evaluate the amount of inquiry within a particular lab exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Herron, M.D. (1971). The nature of scientific enquiry. The school review, 79(2), 171‚Äì212.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there have been a number of revisions proposed and inquiry can take various forms. There is a spectrum of inquiry-based teaching methods available.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, J. G., &amp; Wilhelm, P. J. (2010). Inquiring minds learn to read, write, and think: Reaching all learners through inquiry. Middle School Journal, May 2010, 39‚Äì46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

Specific learning processes that people engage in during inquiry-learning include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = T. | last2 = Urhahne | first2 = D. | last3 = Schanze | first3 = S. | last4 = Ploetzner | first4 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Collaborative inquiry learning: Models, tools, and challenges | url = http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/21303| journal = International Journal of Science Education | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 349‚Äì377 | bibcode = 2010IJSEd..32..349B | doi = 10.1080/09500690802582241 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Creating questions of their own
*Obtaining supporting evidence to answer the question(s)
*Explaining the evidence collected
*Connecting the explanation to the knowledge obtained from the investigative process
*Creating an argument and justification for the explanation

Inquiry learning involves developing questions, making observations, doing research to find out what information is already recorded, developing methods for experiments, developing instruments for data collection, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, outlining possible explanations and creating predictions for future study.&lt;ref name="science.education.nih.gov"/&gt;

=== Levels ===

There are many different explanations for inquiry teaching and learning and the various levels of inquiry that can exist within those contexts. The article titled ''The Many Levels of Inquiry'' by Heather Banchi and Randy Bell (2008)&lt;ref name="science.education.nih.gov"/&gt; clearly outlines four levels of inquiry.

'''Level 1''': Confirmation Inquiry&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher has taught a particular science theme or topic. The teacher then develops questions and a procedure that guides students through an activity where the results are already known. This method is great to reinforce concepts taught and to introduce students into learning to follow procedures, collect and record data correctly and to confirm and deepen understandings.

'''Level 2''': Structured Inquiry&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher provides the initial question and an outline of the procedure. Students are to formulate explanations of their findings through evaluating and analyzing the data that they collect.

'''Level 3''': Guided Inquiry&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher provides only the research question for the students. The students are responsible for designing and following their own procedures to test that question and then communicate their results and findings.

'''Level 4''': Open/True Inquiry&lt;br /&gt;
Students formulate their own research question(s), design and follow through with a developed procedure, and communicate their findings and results. This type of inquiry is often seen in science fair contexts where students drive their own investigative questions.

Banchi and Bell (2008) explain that teachers should begin their inquiry instruction at the lower levels and work their way to open inquiry in order to effectively develop students' inquiry skills. Open inquiry activities are only successful if students are motivated by intrinsic interests and if they are equipped with the skills to conduct their own research study.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, H., Joung, Y. J., Kim, M. (2012). The challenges of science inquiry teaching for pre-service teachers in elementary classrooms: Difficulties on and under the scene. Research in Science &amp; Technological Education, 42(3), 589‚Äì608.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open/true inquiry learning ===

An important aspect of inquiry-based learning (and science) is the use of open learning, as evidence suggests that only utilizing lower level inquiry is not enough to develop critical and scientific thinking to the full potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berg | first1 = C A R | last2 = Bergendahl | first2 = V C B | last3 = Lundberg | first3 = B K S | last4 = Tibell | first4 = L A E | year = 2003 | title = Benefiting from an open-ended experiment?

There is an emphasis on the individual manipulating information and creating meaning from a set of given materials or circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Hannafin, M., Land, S., Oliver, K. (1999). Open learning environments: Foundation, methods, and models. In C. M. Reigeluth (Ed.), Instructional-design theories and models. A new paradigm of instructional theory Volume II (pp. 115‚Äì140). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In many conventional and structured learning environments, people are told what the outcome is expected to be, and then they are simply expected to 'confirm' or show evidence that this is the case.

Open learning has many benefits.&lt;ref name="Zion, M. 2007"/&gt; It means students do not simply perform experiments in a routine like fashion, but actually think about the results they collect and what they mean. With traditional non-open lessons there is a tendency for students to say that the experiment 'went wrong' when they collect results contrary to what they are told to expect. In open learning there are no wrong results, and students have to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the results they collect themselves and decide their value.

Open learning has been developed by a number of science educators including the American [[John Dewey]] and the German [[Martin Wagenschein]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Wagenschein's ideas particularly complement both open learning and inquiry-based learning in teaching work. He emphasized that students should not be taught bald facts, but should understand and explain what they are learning. His most famous example of this was when he asked physics students to tell him what the speed of a falling object was. Nearly all students would produce an equation, but no students could explain what this equation meant.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Wagenschien used this example to show the importance of understanding over knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ed.fnal.gov/trc_new/sciencelines_online/fall97/activity_inserts.html |title= The Science Journal: Writing and Inquiry Development|publisher= |accessdate=2017-01-03|author=Dahl, Susan | author2=Franzen, Pat }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inquisitive learning ===
Sociologist of education [[Phillip Brown (sociologist)|Phillip Brown]] defined '''inquisitive learning''' as learning that is [[Intrinsic motivation|intrinsically motivated]] (e.g. by curiosity and interest in knowledge for its own sake), as opposed to ''acquisitive learning'' that is [[Extrinsic motivation|extrinsically motivated]] (e.g. by acquiring high scores on examinations to earn credentials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Phillip |authorlink=Phillip Brown (sociologist) |date=March 2003 |title=The opportunity trap: education and employment in a global economy |journal=European Educational Research Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=141‚Äì179 |doi=10.2304/eerj.2003.2.1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stiwne |first1=Elinor Edvardsson |last2=Alves |first2=Mariana Gaio |date=March 2010 |title=Higher education and employability of graduates: will Bologna make a difference? |journal=European Educational Research Journal |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=32‚Äì44 [33] |doi=10.2304/eerj.2010.9.1.32|citeseerx=10.1.1.1013.4278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nielsen |first=Gritt B. |date=2015 |title=Figuration work: student participation, democracy and university reform in a global knowledge economy |series=EASA series |volume=27 |location=New York |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=9781782387718 |oclc=896861729 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=I9TtBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 136]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, occasionally the term ''inquisitive learning'' is simply used as a synonym for ''inquiry-based learning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graseck |first=Paul |date=January 2005 |title=Where's the ministry in administration?: attending to the souls of our schools |journal=Phi Delta Kappan |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=373‚Äì378 |doi=10.1177/003172170508600508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=Jeff C. |last2=Smart |first2=Julie |last3=Alston |first3=Daniel M. |date=October 2016 |title=Development and validation of Teacher Intentionality of Practice Scale (TIPS): a measure to evaluate and scaffold teacher effectiveness |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=159‚Äì168 |doi=10.1016/j.tate.2016.05.007|bibcode=2003TeTeE..19..309T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inquiry-based science education ==

=== History of science education ===

Inquiry learning has been used as a teaching and learning tool for thousands of years, however, the use of inquiry within public education has a much briefer history.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2000"&gt;National Research Council. 2000. Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards: A Guide for Teaching and Learning. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek and Roman [[educational philosophies]] focused much more on the art of agricultural and domestic skills for the middle class and [[Rhetoric|oratory]] for the wealthy upper class. It was not until the Enlightenment, or the Age of Reason, during the late 17th and 18th century that the subject of Science was considered a respectable academic body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, M. (2006). The History and Philosophy of Education: Voices of Educational Pioneers Upper Saddle River, NJ.: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0130955507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the 1900s the study of science within education had a primary focus on memorizing and organizing facts.

John Dewey, a well-known philosopher of education at the beginning of the 20th century, was the first to criticize the fact that [[science education]] was not taught in a way to develop young scientific thinkers. Dewey proposed that science should be taught as a process and way of thinking ‚Äì not as a subject with facts to be memorized.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2000"/&gt; While Dewey was the first to draw attention to this issue, much of the reform within science education followed the lifelong work and efforts of Joseph Schwab. 
Joseph Schwab was an educator who proposed that science did not need to be a process for identifying stable truths about the world that we live in, but rather science could be a flexible and multi-directional inquiry driven process of thinking and learning. 
Schwab believed that science in the classroom should more closely reflect the work of practicing scientists. Schwab developed three levels of open inquiry that align with the breakdown of inquiry processes that we see today.&lt;ref name="Schwab, J 1966"&gt;Schwab, J. 1966. The Teaching of Science. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

#Students are provided with questions, methods and materials and are challenged to discover relationships between variables
#Students are provided with a question, however, the method for research is up to the students to develop
#Phenomena are proposed but students must develop their own questions and method for research to discover relationships among variables

Today, we know that students at all levels of education can successfully experience and develop deeper level thinking skills through scientific inquiry.&lt;ref name="National Science Education Standards 1996"&gt;National Science Education Standards. (1996). National Academy Press. Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; The graduated levels of scientific inquiry outlined by Schwab demonstrate that students need to develop thinking skills and strategies prior to being exposed to higher levels of inquiry.&lt;ref name="Schwab, J 1966"/&gt; Effectively, these skills need to be scaffolded by the teacher or instructor until students are able to develop questions, methods, and conclusions on their own.&lt;ref name="Ban chi, H. 2008"&gt;Ban chi, H., &amp; Bell, R. (2008). The Many Levels of Inquiry. Science and Children, 46(2), 26‚Äì29.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A catalyst for reform within North American science education was the 1957 launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], the Soviet Union satellite. This historical scientific breakthrough caused a great deal of concern around the science and technology education the American students were receiving. In 1958 the U.S. congress developed and passed the National Defense Education Act in order to provide math and science teachers with adequate teaching materials.&lt;ref name="science.education.nih.gov"&gt;National Institute for Health. (2005). Doing Science: The Process of Science Inquiry. http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih6/inquiry/guide/info_process-a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

America's National Science Education Standards (NSES) (1996)&lt;ref name="National Science Education Standards 1996"/&gt; outlines six important aspects pivotal to inquiry learning in [[science education]].

#Students should be able to recognize that science is more than [[memorizing]] and knowing facts.
#Students should have the opportunity to develop new knowledge that builds on their prior knowledge and scientific ideas.
#Students will develop new knowledge by restructuring their previous understandings of scientific concepts and adding new information learned.
#Learning is influenced by students' social environment whereby they have an opportunity to learn from each other.
#Students will take control of their learning.
#The extent to which students are able to learn with deep understanding will influence how transferable their new knowledge is to real life contexts.

== In other disciplines/programs ==

Science naturally lends itself to investigation and collection of data, but it is applicable in other subject areas where people are developing critical thinking and investigation skills.  In [[history]], for example, Robert Bain in his article in ''[[How Students Learn]]'', describes how to "problematize" history.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, R.B., Donovan, M.S. &amp; Bransford, J.D. (Eds). (2005). "They thought the world was flat?": Applying the principles of How People Learn in teaching high school history. How Students Learn. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press. http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309074339&lt;/ref&gt; Bain's idea is to first organize a learning curriculum around central concepts. Next, people studying the curriculum are given a question and primary sources such as eye witness historical accounts, and the task for inquiry is to create an interpretation of history that will answer the central question.  It is held that through the inquiry people will develop skills and factual knowledge that supports their answers to a question. They will form an hypothesis, collect and consider information and revisit their hypothesis as they evaluate their data.

=== Ontario's kindergarten program ===

After Charles Pascal's report in 2009, the Canadian province of [[Ontario]]'s Ministry of Education decided to implement a full day kindergarten program that focuses on inquiry and play-based learning, called The Early Learning Kindergarten Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pascal|first1=Charles|title=With Our Best Future in Mind|url=http://ywcacanada.ca/data/research_docs/00000001.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2014, all primary schools in Ontario started the program. The curriculum document&lt;ref name="MoE"/&gt; outlines the philosophy, definitions, process and core learning concepts for the program. Bronfenbrenner's ecological model, Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, Piaget's child development theory and Dewey's experiential learning are the heart of the program's design. As research shows, children learn best through play, whether it is independently or in a group. Three forms of play are noted in the curriculum document, pretend or "pretense" play, socio-dramatic play and constructive play. Through play and authentic experiences, children interact with their environment (people and/or objects) and question things; thus leading to inquiry learning. A chart on page 15 clearly outlines the process of inquiry for young children, including initial engagement, exploration, investigation, and communication.&lt;ref name="MoE"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Education|title=Early Learning Kindergarten Program|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/kindergarten_english_june3.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new program supports holistic approach to learning. For further details, please see the curriculum document.&lt;ref name="MoE"/&gt;

Since the program is extremely new, there is limited research on its success and areas of improvement. One government research report was released with the initial groups of children in the new kindergarten program. The Final Report: Evaluation of the Implementation of the Ontario Full-Day Early-Learning Kindergarten Program from Vanderlee, Youmans, Peters, and Eastabrook (2012) conclude with primary research that high-need children improved more compared to children who did not attend Ontario's new kindergarten program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vanderlee|first1=Mary-Louise|last2=Youmans|first2=S|last3=Peters|first3=R|last4=Eastabrook|first4=J|title=Final report: Evaluation of the implementation of the Ontario full-day early-learning kindergarten program|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/kindergarten/FDELK_ReportFall2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with inquiry-based learning in all divisions and subject areas, longitudinal research is needed to examine the full extent of this teaching/learning method.

== Misconceptions about inquiry ==

There are several common misconceptions regarding inquiry-based science, the first being that inquiry science is simply instruction that teaches students to follow the scientific method. Many teachers had the opportunity to work within the constraints of the scientific method as students themselves and figure inquiry learning must be the same. Inquiry science is not just about solving problems in six simple steps but much more broadly focused on the intellectual problem-solving skills developed throughout a scientific process.&lt;ref name="National Science Education Standards 1996"/&gt; Additionally, not every hands-on lesson can be considered inquiry.

Some educators believe that there is only one true method of inquiry, which would be described as the level four: Open Inquiry. While open inquiry may be the most authentic form of inquiry, there are many skills and a level of conceptual understanding that the students must have developed before they can be successful at this high level of inquiry.&lt;ref name="Ban chi, H. 2008" /&gt; While inquiry-based science is considered to be a teaching strategy that fosters higher order thinking in students, it should be one of several methods used. A multifaceted approach to science keeps students engaged and learning.

Not every student is going to learn the same amount from an inquiry lesson; students must be invested in the topic of study to authentically reach the set learning goals. Teachers must be prepared to ask students questions to probe their thinking processes in order to assess accurately. Inquiry-science requires a lot of time, effort, and expertise, however, the benefits outweigh the cost when true authentic learning can take place{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Neuroscience complexity ==

The literature states that inquiry requires multiple cognitive processes and variables, such as causality and co-occurrence that enrich with age and experience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhn|first1=D|last2=Black|first2=J|last3=Keselman|first3=A|last4=Kaplan|first4=D|title=The development of cognitive skills to support inquiry learning|journal=Cognition and Instruction|date=2000|volume=18|issue=4|pages=495‚Äì523|doi=10.1207/s1532690xci1804_3|citeseerx=10.1.1.527.1718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhn|first1=D|last2=Pease|first2=M|title=What needs to develop in the development of inquiry skills?|journal=Cognition and Instruction|date=2008|volume=26|issue=4|pages=512‚Äì59|doi=10.1080/07370000802391745}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kuhn, et al. (2000) used explicit training workshops to teach children in grades six to eight in the United States how to inquire through a quantitative study. By completing an inquiry-based task at the end of the study, the participants demonstrated enhanced mental models by applying different inquiry strategies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In a similar study, Kuhan and Pease (2008) completed a longitudinal quantitative study following a set of American children from grades four to six to investigate the effectiveness of scaffolding strategies for inquiry. Results demonstrated that children benefitted from the scaffolding because they outperformed the grade seven control group on an inquiry task.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  Understanding the neuroscience of inquiry learning the scaffolding process related to it should be reinforced for Ontario's primary teachers as part of their training.

== Notes for educators ==

Inquiry-based learning is fundamental for the development of higher order thinking skills. According to Bloom's Taxonomy, the ability to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information or new understandings indicates a high level of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Krathwohl, D. R. (2002). A revision of Bloom's Taxonomy: An overview. Theory Into Practice, 41(4), 212‚Äì218.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers should be encouraging divergent thinking and allowing students the freedom to ask their own questions and to learn the effective strategies for discovering the answers. The higher order thinking skills that students have the opportunity to develop during inquiry activities will assist in the critical thinking skills that they will be able to transfer to other subjects.

As shown in the section above on the neuroscience of inquiry learning, it is significant to scaffold students to teach them how to inquire and inquire through the four levels. It cannot be assumed that they know how to inquire without foundational skills. Scaffolding the students at a younger age will result in enriched inquiring learning later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Inquiry-based learning can be done in multiple formats, including:

* Field-work
* Case studies
* Investigations
* Individual and group projects
* Research projects

* Teacher is Facilitator in IBL environment
* Place needs of students and their ideas at the center
* Don't wait for the perfect question, pose multiple open-ended questions. 
* Work towards common goal of understanding
* Remain faithful to the students' line of inquiry
* Teach directly on a need-to-know basis
* Encourage students to demonstrate learning [https://.yifindia.com using a range of media]

=== Necessity for teacher training ===

There is a necessity for professional collaboration when executing a new inquiry program (Chu, 2009; Twigg, 2010). The teacher training and process of using inquiry learning should be a joint mission to ensure the maximal amount of resources are used and that the teachers are producing the best learning scenarios. The scholarly literature supports this notion. Twigg's (2010) education professionals who participated in her experiment 
emphasized year round professional development sessions, such as workshops, weekly meetings and observations, to ensure inquiry is being implemented in the class correctly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Another example is Chu's (2009) study, where the participants appreciated the professional collaboration of educators, information technicians and librarians to provide more resources and expertise for preparing the structure and resources for the inquiry project.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1671"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chu|first1=K.W.S|title=Inquiry project-based learning with a partnership of three types of teachers and the school librarian|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=2009|volume=60|issue=8|pages=1671‚Äì86|doi=10.1002/asi.21084}}&lt;/ref&gt; To establish a professional collaboration and researched training methods, administration support is required for funding.

Nonetheless the constructivist movement gained great momentum in the 1990s, because many educators began to write about this philosophy of learning.

Hmelo-Silver, Duncan, &amp; Chinn cite several studies supporting the success of the constructivist [[Problem-based learning|problem-based]] and inquiry learning methods. For example, they describe a project called GenScope, an inquiry-based science software application. Students using the GenScope software showed significant gains over the control groups, with the largest gains shown in students from basic courses.&lt;ref name="hmelo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hmelo-Silver | last2 = Duncan | last3 = Chinn | year = 2007 | title = Scaffolding and Achievement in Problem-Based and Inquiry Learning: A Response to Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) | url = http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/hmelo_ep07.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Educational Psychologist | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 99‚Äì107 | doi=10.1080/00461520701263368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Hmelo-Silver et al. also cite a large study by Geier on the effectiveness of inquiry-based science for middle school students, as demonstrated by their performance on high-stakes standardized tests. The improvement was 14% for the first cohort of students and 13% for the second cohort.

In a 2006 article, the Thomas B. Fordham Institute's president, Chester E. Finn Jr., was quoted as saying "But like so many things in education, it gets carried to excess...

Richard E. Mayer from the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote in 2004 that there was sufficient research evidence to make any reasonable person skeptical about the benefits of discovery learning‚Äîpracticed under the guise of cognitive constructivism or social constructivism‚Äîas a preferred instructional method. He reviewed research on discovery of problem-solving rules culminating in the 1960s, discovery of conservation strategies culminating in the 1970s, and discovery of LOGO programming strategies culminating in the 1980s. In each case, guided discovery was more effective than pure discovery in helping students learn and transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = R | year = 2004 | title = Should there be a three-strikes rule against pure discovery learning?

It should be cautioned that inquiry-based learning takes a lot of planning before implementation.  It is not something that can be put into place in the classroom quickly.  Measurements must be put in place for how students knowledge and performance will be measured and how standards will be incorporated.  The teacher's responsibility during inquiry exercises is to support and facilitate student learning (Bell et al., 769‚Äì770).  A common mistake teachers make is lacking the vision to see where students' weaknesses lie.  According to Bain, teachers cannot assume that students will hold the same assumptions and thinking processes as a professional within that discipline (p.&amp;nbsp;201).

While some see inquiry-based teaching as increasingly mainstream, it can be perceived as in conflict with [[standardized testing]] common in [[standards-based assessment]] systems which emphasise the measurement of student knowledge, and meeting of pre-defined criteria, for example the shift towards "fact" in changes to the National Assessment of Educational Progress as a result of the American [[No Child Left Behind]] program.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Programs such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Program can be criticized for their claims to be an inquiry based learning program.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} While there are different types of inquiry (as stated above) the rigid structure of this style of inquiry based learning program almost completely rules out any real inquiry based learning in the lower grades. Each "unit of inquiry" is given to the students, structured to guide them and does not allow students to choose the path or topic of their inquiry. Each unit is carefully planned to connect to the topics the students are required to be learning in school and does not leave room for open inquiry in topics that the students pick. Some may feel that until the inquiry learning process is open inquiry then it is not true inquiry based learning at all. Instead of opportunities to learn through open and student-led inquiry, the IB program is viewed by some to simply be an extra set of learning requirements for the students to complete.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Chu (2009) used a mixed method design to examine the outcome of an inquiry project completed by students in Hong Kong with the assistance of multiple educators. Chu's (2009) results show that the children were more motivated and academically successful compared to the control group.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1671"/&gt;

== Research ==
The collective term nanotechnology describes the study and manipulation of objects at smallest sizes. In general, the nanotechnology deals with structures ranging in size from 1-100 nanometers in at least one spatial direction. 100 nanometers are roughly one-thousandth of the diameter of a normal human hair. With these small dimensions surface properties come to the fore compared with the bulk properties of materials and also often quantum effects has to be taken into account. Nanotechnology is the technology of small things with new features and functionalities. 

Nano engineering is the engineering on the nanoscale, i.e., the selective artificial fabrication of nanotechnology structures such as tiny transistors on computer chips. With nano engineering the closely related term quantum engineering aims to produce and manipulate a defined quantum state, such as the realization of a Bose-Einstein condensate or an electronic device with adjusted electron spin. The size of such systems is also often in the nanometer range. 

Nanomaterials of various shapes, composition and size in the nanometer range are produced and analyzed in the laboratory. Nanoparticles have due to their small size special chemical and physical properties that differ significantly from the properties of macroscopic particles and solids. The cause therefore is the large ratio of surface to volume of the nanoparticles, so that they strongly interact with their environment. Added where appropriate quantum mechanical effects. 

The artificially created structures and materials are investigated in a wide variety and analyzed. The analysis in the nanometer range requires variety and latest equipment and techniques. The necessary technological equipment is centrally located in the LNQE research building and is complemented by the equipment in the institutions.

'''Mimesis criticism''' is a method of interpreting texts in relation to their literary or cultural models. Mimesis, or '''imitation''' (''imitatio''), was a widely used rhetorical tool in antiquity up until the 18th century's [[Romanticism|romantic]] emphasis on originality. Mimesis criticism looks to identify [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] relationships between two texts that go beyond simple echoes, [[allusion]]s, [[citation]]s, or [[redaction]]s. The effects of imitation are usually manifested in the later text by means of distinct [[characterization]], [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], and/or [[plot (narrative)|plot]] structure.

As a critical method, '''mimesis criticism''' has been pioneered by [[Dennis MacDonald]], especially in relation to [[New Testament]] and other early Christian narratives imitating the "canonical" works of [[Classics|Classical]] Greek literature.

==History==

===Aristotle===
Greek rhetorician [[Aristotle]] (4th century {{smallcaps|b.c.e.}}) discusses the rhetorical technique of mimesis or imitation; what Aristotle describes, however, is the author's imitation of nature, not earlier literary or cultural models.

===Philodemus===
[[Philodemus|Philodemus of Gadara]] (1st century {{smallcaps|b.c.e.}}), an [[Epicurean]] philosopher and poet and one of [[Virgil]]'s teachers, affirms that writers of prose histories and fictions used literary models. He writes (rhetorically) in book five of ''On Poetry'', "Who would claim that the writing of prose is not reliant on the Homeric poems?" (5.30.36-31.)

===Dionysius of Halicarnassus===
A Greek historian and rhetorician from the late first century {{smallcaps|b.c.e.}}/early first century {{smallcaps|c.e.}}, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] represents a change from the Aristotelian rhetorical notion of [[mimesis]], from imitation of nature to imitation of literature. His most important work in this respect, ''[[Dionysian imitatio|On Mimesis]]'' ({{lang|grc|Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ ŒºŒπŒºŒÆœÉŒµœâœÇ}}, ''Per√¨ mimƒìse≈çs''), survives only in fragments. Apparently, most of this work concerned the proper selection of literary models.

===Quintilian===
Roman rhetorician [[Quintilian|M. Fabius Quintilianus]] published his twelve-volume [[Institutio Oratoria|''Institutio oratoria'']] around 95 {{smallcaps|c.e}}. In book 10, Quintilian - who was well-read with respect to both Greek and Latin rhetoricians, including [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] - gives advice to teachers who are instructing students in oration. He tells them that, by the time students begin composition, they should be so well-versed in exemplary models that are able to imitate them without physically consulting them (10.1.5). Quintilian writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;For in everything which we teach examples are more effective even than the rules which are taught in the schools, so long as the student has reached a stage when he can appreciate such examples without the assistance of a teacher, and can rely on his own powers to imitate them. (10.1.15; Butler, LCL)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He also advises that students constantly reread the exemplary models (10.1.19), not only in sections but all the way through (10.1.20), so that they might be empowered to imitate these models with more craft and subtlety.

Of course, the selection of one's literary model is of the utmost importance. In Quintilian's opinion, one could find no better model than Homer, "for he has given us a model and an inspiration for very department of eloquence" (10.1.46; Butler, LCL). When it comes to the act of imitation itself, he writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no doubt that in art no small portion of our task lies in imitation, since, although invention came first and is all-important, it is expedient to imitate whatever has been invented with success. And it is a universal rule of life that we should wish to copy what we approve in others. It is for this reason that boys copy the shapes of letters that they may learn to write, and that musicians take the voices of their teachers, painters the works of their predecessors, and peasants the principles of agriculture which have been proved in practice, as models for their imitation. In fact, we may note that the elementary study of every branch of learning is directed by reference to some definite standard that is placed before the learner. (10.2.1-2; Butler, LCL)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, students are encouraged to ''improve'' upon their chosen models (10.2.12). One way for students to accomplish this task, Quintilian says, is to imitate several models in eclectic fashion: "We shall do well to keep a number of different excellences before our eyes, so that different qualities from different authors may impose themselves on our minds, to be adopted for use in the place that becomes them best" (10.2.26; Butler, LCL). On this point, Quintilian was at odds with Cicero, who felt it best for authors to imitate a single author.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Knowles Ruthven, ''Critical Assumptions'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1979), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
In order to circumvent the capriciousness of subjectivity, [[Dennis MacDonald|MacDonald]] suggests six criteria for determining whether a claim for a mimetic connection between texts is reasonable: accessibility, analogy, density, order, distinctive traits, and interpretability. The first two criteria concern the status of the text used as a model ("ante-text"); the final four concern the later text that may have used the antetext.

*'''Accessibility''': One must demonstrate that the author of the later text would have been reasonably able to access a copy of the text being imitated. Was the antetext well known or obscure at the time of the later text's composition?
*'''Analogy''': If one text is discovered to imitate a certain antetext, it is probable that other texts have also done so. Are there examples of other authors using this antetext as a literary model?
*'''Density''': The greater number of parallels one can induce between the two texts, the stronger one's case will be for a mimetic relationship between them.
*'''Order''': The more frequently the parallels between the two texts follow the same order, the less likely it becomes that the parallels are just coincidental.
*'''Distinctive Traits''': If there are parallels between two texts, but none of the parallels are anything but one would expect in their respective contexts, then it becomes difficult to argue for a mimetic connection. Especially helpful are [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequiturs]] or other unusual elements present in the later text which parallel the proposed model. It is also typical for authors to use significant names to alert the reader to the textual interplay.
*'''Interpretability''': A common motivation for imitating an earlier text is to rival that text, whether philosophically, theologically, politically, or otherwise. If one can determine such a motivation in a compelling fashion, then there is a stronger case for imitation.

==Mimesis in Early Christianity==

===New Testament===
Two examples of imitation within the New Testament will be outlined. The first pertains to Luke's use of 1 Kings 17 as a literary model. The second outlines Luke's imitation of Homer's ''Odyssey'' 10-12 in Acts 20.&lt;ref&gt;These examples come from MacDonald and can be found in his various publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 1 Kings 17:9-24
! Luke 7:11-16
|-
| Elijah went to Sarepta.
| Jesus went to Nain.
|-
| Elijah saw a widow after approaching the city gate. Her son later becomes sick and dies.
| Jesus saw a widow's dead son after approaching the city gate being carried out on a bier.
|-
| Elijah told the widow, "Give me your son."
| Jesus told the widow, "Do not weep."
|-

|}

One can justifiably argue that Luke used 1 Kings 17:9-24 as a model for Luke 7:11-16 because it meets the criteria of '''mimesis criticism'''. '''Criterion 1''' ('''Accessibility'''): Luke cites this very story in Luke 4:25-26. '''Criterion 2''' ('''Analogy'''): Mark provides an analogous imitation of 1 Kings 17 with his story about the raising of Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:35-43). '''Criteria 3''' ('''Density'''), '''4''' ('''Order'''), and '''5''' ('''Distinctive Traits''') can be identified in the above table. The most important aspect for '''criterion 5''' is the identical Greek wording for "And he gave him to his mother." '''Criterion 6''' ('''Interpretability'''): Luke improves upon his model in the following ways. In 1 Kings, the widow initiates the miracle by castigating Elijah for causing her son's death; in Luke, Jesus is the one to initiate the miracle. In 1 Kings, Elijah then reproaches God, asking if God has "brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son" (17:20); in Luke, Jesus does not blame God for the boy's death but instead has compassion for her. In 1 Kings, it is the {{smallcaps|Lord}} who raises the boy, not Elijah; in Luke, it is Jesus himself. In 1 Kings, only the widow responds to the miracle; in Luke, a "large crowd" responds positively.

In the same way, one can justifiably argue that Luke has used the story of Elpenor from ''Odyssey'' 10-12 as a model for his account of Eutychus in Acts 20:5-12 using the criteria. '''Criterion 1''' ('''Accessibility'''): Books 10-12 of ''Odyssey'' were among the most popular in antiquity. '''Criterion 2''' ('''Analogy'''): Among the many imitations of these books in antiquity, Virgil's ''Aeneid'' contains two, the stories about Palinurus and Misenus. '''Criteria 3''' ('''Density'''), '''4''' ('''Order'''), and '''5''' ('''Distinctive Traits''') can be seen to be met by referring to the above table. Of particular significance is Luke's name choice: Homer often called Elpenor "unlucky" (''Odyssey'' 11.61, 76, 80); Luke's Eutychus literally means "good fortune." Furthermore, the raising of Luke's Eutychus occurs in the Troad, the cite of the Trojan War. '''Criterion 6''' ('''Interpretability'''): Luke emulates Homer in the following ways. Elpenor fell to his death because he was in a drunken stupor; Eutychus appeared to die after falling asleep (out a window) while listening to Paul preach deep into the night. Odysseus was unaware of Elpenor's misfortune; Paul knew immediately about Eutychus' fall and also that "his soul [was] still in him." Later in Homer's story, Elpenor's body was buried at dawn; at dawn, the other believers lifted up Eutychus alive.

In addition to imitating the [[Septuagint]] and Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', MacDonald proposes that Mark's Gospel and Luke-Acts used the following literary models: Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', several [[Homeric hymns|''Homeric Hymns'']], [[Euripides]]' [[The Bacchae|''Bacchae'']] and [[Herakles (Euripides)|''Madness of Heracles'']], and dialogues by [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] about [[Socrates]].

===Christian Apocrypha===
In his seminal work ''Christianizing Homer:'' The Odyssey'', Plato, and'' The Acts of Andrew, MacDonald argues that the second-century {{smallcaps|c.e.}} apocryphal work, the [[Acts of Andrew]], was a Christian version of Homer's [[Iliad]]. Elsewhere, MacDonald has also argued for the presence of Homeric imitations in the [[Acts of Peter]], another second-century {{smallcaps|c.e.}} apocryphal work.

==Controversy==

===Scholarly Opposition===
Karl Olav Sandnes, the most vocal of MacDonald's critics, objects that MacDonald's "reading of both Mark's Gospel and Acts assumes a readership with an in-depth as well as extensive familiarity with the Homeric epics. This implies that the curriculum of encyclical studies had penetrated into the Christian movement to an extent which the present study has not confirmed. Ancient education was designed for the upper strata of the population."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Olav Sandnes, ''The Challenge of Homer: School, Pagan Poets, and Early Christianity'' (Library of New Testament Studies; T&amp;T Clark Int'l, 2009), 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Sandnes argues deductively: Since such familiarity with Homer was limited to the upper stratum of society, and since the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts (nor their audiences) are not believed to belong to this stratum, then the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts simply ''could not'' have imitated Homer in the way MacDonald suggests.

MacDonald's response has been threefold. First, a more sure decision about the education of the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts would result from an [[Inductive reasoning|''inductive'']] approach to the question, rather than Sandnes' [[Deductive reasoning|''deductive'']] approach. Second, access to Homer was ''not'' restricted to the cultural elite. According to a first-century {{smallcaps|ce}} writer, "From the earliest age, children beginning their studies are nursed on Homer's teaching. One might say that while we were still in swathing bands we sucked from his epics as from fresh milk. He assists the beginner and later the adult in his prime. In no stage of life, from boyhood to old age, do we ever cease to drink from him."&lt;ref&gt;Ps.-Heraclitus, ''Quaest. Hom.'' 1.5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, MacDonald notes that Sandnes does not offer any other explanation for the parallels between the New Testament writings and Homer.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis R. MacDonald, ''Homer, Vergil, and the New Testament'' (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret M. Mitchell]] has also published a critical response to MacDonald's work on Homeric imitation within the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M. Mitchell, "Homer in the New Testament?" ''The Journal of Religion'' 83 (2003): 244-60.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald addresses Mitchell's critiques, as well as earlier criticism from Sandnes,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Olav Sandnes, "''Imitatio Homeri''? An Appraisal of Dennis R. MacDonald's 'Mimesis Criticism,'" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 124 (2005): 715-32.&lt;/ref&gt; in an article titled, "My Turn: A Critique of Critics of 'Mimesis Criticism.'"&lt;ref&gt;Dennis R. MacDonald, "My Turn: A Critique of Critics of 'Mimesis Criticism,'" (Occasional Papers of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity 53; The Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for Historicity of Jesus===
MacDonald's arguments for the mimetic nature of the Gospel narratives have influenced how some view the question of the [[historicity of Jesus]]. Some have taken the extremist position that all of the Gospel narratives are exclusively the byproduct of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelists']] literary imagination, influenced by [[Homer]] and the [[Septuagint|Septuagintal narratives]], and not historical memory. Perhaps this is due to a misunderstanding of MacDonald's claim that the Gospel of [[Gospel of mark|Mark]] was an "intentional fiction." MacDonald believes that such a stance is taking matters too far, although he himself holds to a minimalist view of the [[Historical Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. MacDonald, "My Turn," 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; This debate is usually generated in non-academic circles, such as [[YouTube]] [[Vlogs|video blogs]].&lt;ref&gt;One such prolific video blogger on YouTube, with the username [https://www.youtube.com/user/TruthSurge TruthSurge], has posted a number of vlogs on this topic. Particularly relevant are the videos titled, "Excavating the Empty Tomb (beyond a reasonable doubt)," parts 4-9b.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6708">The '''Moredun Research Institute''' is a scientific research institution based at the '''Pentlands Science Park''', in the [[Bush Estate]] area of [[Midlothian]], Scotland. It conducts research into [[Veterinary pathology|diseases of farm livestock]] and the promotion of [[animal health]] and [[Animal welfare|welfare]].

Moredun employs over 200 [[Veterinarian|vets]], scientists and support staff, that are funded primarily by the [[Agriculture, Food and Rural Communities Directorate]] of the [[Scottish Government]]. The Institute received [[Pound sterling|¬£]]7.1 million from the government in 2010-11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/public-bodies/about/Bodies National Public Bodies Directory], the Scottish Government&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Animal Diseases Research Association''', now the registered charity the '''Moredun Foundation''', was founded in 1920 by a group of Scottish farmers, with the aim of improving the health of livestock, especially [[Sheep farming|sheep]]. The association founded a research institute employing vets and scientists, and over the decades the scope of animal health work expanded to cover goats, cows, horses and wildlife.

The Institute was originally based at [[Moredun]], in Edinburgh.

The origins of Moredun go back to the years following World War I which saw an increased demand for home grown food and a significant rise in the market value of livestock. This emphasised the seriousness of the losses associated with disease and concerned farmers voiced their strong support for an organised body to conduct research into livestock diseases. In the 1920s Louping Ill and Braxy claimed almost a third of the lambs born in Scotland and Grass Sickness was having a devastating effect on horses, which were used for heavy labour on farms at that time. In March 1920 a group of enlightened Scottish farmers held a public meeting at the Highland and Agricultural Society‚Äôs chambers in Edinburgh and the Animal Diseases Research Association (now known as The Moredun Foundation) was formed. Within six years the founder members had raised enough funds to buy a plot of land and build the Moredun Research Institute. Within ten years of the Research Institute opening, Moredun scientists had discovered the cause and developed vaccines and treatment strategies for Braxy and lamb dysentery. Scientists then went on to solve the mystery of Louping Ill which was found to be caused by a virus transmitted by ticks and a vaccine was soon developed.

By the 1940s over half a million doses of vaccine and treatment products were produced and distributed by Moredun. Research gained momentum and further funding was secured to find out the causes of many different diseases such as: scrapie, pine, milk fever, Johne‚Äôs disease and a range of respiratory and reproductive disorders. Vaccines, diagnostics and treatment strategies followed. Today, many of the veterinary medicines and vaccines that are routinely used on farms have been researched, developed or tested at Moredun. This research is vital ‚Äì 17% of the value of the UK sheep industry is lost each year due to infectious diseases. Subclinical infections of gut parasites are estimated to cost the UK sheep industry over ¬£84 million a year in lost production. Enzootic abortion in ewes is thought to cost the UK sheep industry ¬£15 million a year and Johne‚Äôs disease costs the UK cattle industry ¬£13 million a year. Ninety years on, and still governed by farmers, Moredun‚Äôs mission to improve animal health and welfare remains strong and Moredun continues to apply cutting edge science and technology to help protect both livestock and people, today and tomorrow.

==Pentlands Science Park==
The Pentlands Science Park opened in 1995. It is part of the '''Moredun Group''', under the control of the Moredun Foundation. It is a [[public-private partnership]]. The Pentlands Science Park and Moredun are participants in the [[Edinburgh Science Triangle]] project.

In addition to being the home of the Moredun Research Institute, the science park has attracted 20 companies to the site. The focus of Pentlands Science Park is [[animal bioscience]] but the tenants include research companies involved in [[pharmaceuticals]], [[software]], and [[environmental science]]. The area occupied by non-Moredun organisations is approximately 55,000 [[sq ft]], and these tenants employ over 200 people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39926">'''Nutrition transition''' is the shift in dietary [[food consumption|consumption]] and [[energy expenditure]] that coincides with economic, [[demographic change|demographic]], and [[epidemiological]] changes. Specifically the term is used for the transition of developing countries from traditional diets high in cereal and fiber to more [[Western pattern diet]]s high in [[sugar]]s, fat, and animal-source food.

==Historical framework==
The nutrition transition model was first proposed in 1993 by [[Barry Popkin]], and is the most cited framework in literature regarding the nutrition transition,&lt;ref name=Popkin1993&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | year = 1993 | title = Nutritional Patterns and Transitions | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 138‚Äì157 | doi=10.2307/2938388}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been subject to some criticism for being overly simplified.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkes C | title = Uneven dietary development: linking the policies and processes of globalization with the nutrition transition, obesity and diet-related chronic diseases | journal = Globalization and Health | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 4 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16569239 | doi = 10.1186/1744-8603-2-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lang2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lang T, Rayner G | title = Overcoming policy cacophony on obesity: an ecological public health framework for policymakers | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 165‚Äì81 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17316322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789x.2007.00338.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popkin posits that two other historic transitions affect and are affected by nutritional transition. The first is the [[demographic transition]], whereby a pattern of high fertility and high mortality transforms to one of low fertility and low mortality. Secondly, an [[epidemiological transition]] occurs, wherein a shift from a pattern of high prevalence of [[infectious disease]]s associated with [[malnutrition]], and with periodic famine and poor environmental sanitation, to a pattern of high prevalence of chronic and [[degenerative disease]]s associated with urban-industrial lifestyles is shown. These concurrent and dynamically influenced transitions share an emphasis on the ways in which populations move from one pattern to the next. 
Popkin used five broad patterns to help summarize the nutrition transition model.&lt;ref name=Popkin1993/&gt; While these patterns largely appear chronological, it is important to note that they are not restricted to certain periods of human history and still characterize certain geographic and socioeconomic subpopulations. The first pattern is that of collecting food, a characterization of hunter-gatherers, whose diets were high in carbohydrates and low in fat, especially saturated fat. The second pattern is defined by famine, a marked scarcity and reduced variation of the food supply. The third pattern is one of receding famine. Fruits, vegetables, and animal protein consumption increases, and starchy staples become less important in the diet. The fourth pattern is one of degenerative diseases onset by a diet high in total fat, cholesterol, sugar, and other refined carbohydrates and low in polyunsaturated fatty acids and fiber. This pattern is often accompanied by an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. The fifth pattern, and most recently emerging pattern, is characterized by a behavioral change reflective of a desire to prevent or delay degenerative diseases. Recent and rapid changes seen in developing countries from the second and third pattern to the fourth is the common focus of nutrition transition research and desire for policy that would emphasize a healthier overall diet characterizes the shift from the fourth to the fifth pattern.

==Relation to economic development==
The nutrition transition has much of its roots in economic factors related to the development of a nation or subpopulations within a nation. It was once believed that current nutrition transition was endemic only to [[industrialized nations]] like the United States, but increasing research has indicated that not only is nutrition transition occurring most rapidly in low- and middle-income [[developing countries]], the stress of its effects stands to burden the poorest populations of these countries the most as well.&lt;ref name=Chopra2002&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chopra M, Galbraith S, Darnton-Hill I | title = A global response to a global problem: the epidemic of overnutrition | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 80 | issue = 12 | pages = 952‚Äì8 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12571723 | pmc = 2567699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2001b&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | year = 2001 | title = The Nutrition Transition and Obesity in the Developing World | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 131 | issue = | pages = 871‚Äì873 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2003&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | year = 2003 | title = The Nutrition Transition in the Developing World | journal = Development Policy Review | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 581‚Äì597 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8659.2003.00225.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Prentice2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prentice AM | title = The emerging epidemic of obesity in developing countries | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 93‚Äì9 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16326822 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyi272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmidhuber2005&gt;{{cite report | vauthors = Schmidhuber J, Shetty P | title = The Nutrition Transition to 2030: Why Developing Countries Are Likely to Bear the Major Burden. | work = 97th Seminar of the European Association of Agricultural Economists. | publisher = University of Reading | location = England | date = 21 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This shift is attributable to many causes. [[Globalization]] has played a large role in altering the access and availability of foods in formerly undeveloped nations. Demographic shifts from rural to urban areas are central to this as well as the liberalization of food markets, global food marketing, and the emergence of transnational food companies in developing countries.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin1999&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | year = 1999 | title = Urbanization, Lifestyle Changes and the Nutrition Transition | journal = World Development | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1905‚Äì1916 | doi=10.1016/s0305-750x(99)00094-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007&gt;Hawkes C. "Globalization, Food, and Nutrition Transitions." Washington, DC: IFPRI, (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; All these forces of globalization are creating [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes that contribute to the nutrition transition. Technological advancements are making previously arduous labor less difficult and thus altering energy expenditure that would have helped offset the caloric increases in the diet.&lt;ref name=Popkin2001b/&gt; Daily tasks and leisure are also affected by technological advancements and contributing to greater rates of inactivity. The aforementioned increases in calorie are due to increased consumption of [[edible oils]], animal-source foods, caloric [[sweetener]]s, accompanied by reduced consumption of [[grain]]s and fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=Chopra2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2001a&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = Nutrition in transition: the changing global nutrition challenge | journal = Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 10 | issue =  Supplement | pages = S13‚Äì8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11708577 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2002a&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = An overview on the nutrition transition and its health implications: the Bellagio meeting | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 5 | issue = 1A | pages = 93‚Äì103 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 12027297 | doi = 10.1079/phn2001280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = Does global obesity represent a global public health challenge? | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 232‚Äì3 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21159790 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.110.008458 | pmc = 3021421 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes play into human biological preferences seen across the world.&lt;ref name=Drewnowski1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drewnowski A, Popkin BM | title = The nutrition transition: new trends in the global diet | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 31‚Äì43 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9155216 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.1997.tb01593.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socioeconomic factors also play an important role as do cultural values tied to appearance and status.

===Globalization and economic factors ===
The current nutrition transition seen in the [[emerging market]]s of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa, and urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa is largely a product of globalization. International [[food trade]], investment, [[commercialization]] and [[food marketing|marketing]] are drastically impacting the availability of and access to energy-dense, but nutrient-deficient foods causing the aforementioned shift from traditional diet.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007/&gt; Another byproduct of globalization has been a marked demographic transition in these countries from rural areas to urban ones. Urban populations are more susceptible to current trends in nutrition transition because of the improved transportation, commercial food distribution and marketing, less labor-intensive-occupations, and changes in household eating habits and structure.&lt;ref name=Popkin1993/&gt;
The [[liberalization]] of food markets has had a drastic effect on [[consumption pattern]]s across the globe. Liberalization and commercialization of domestic agricultural markets are opening up food trading since this is needed to compete in the world market.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkes C, Eckhardt C, Ruel M, Minot N | year = 2005 | title = Diet Quality, Poverty, and Food Policy: A New Research Agenda for Obesity Prevention in Developing Countries | url = https://www.unscn.org/web/archives_resources/files/scnnews29.pdf | journal = SCN News | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 20‚Äì22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This had led to changes in the types of food produced, and increases in amounts of food imported into developing countries, which affects the relative availability and [[food prices|prices of different foods]]. 
Food demand is being shaped by increases in income and [[urbanization]]. As these rapidly developing nations continue to accrue high incomes per capita, their food spending is increasing as well. They elect to use these higher incomes on more calorically-dense foods that are sweeter and higher in fats.&lt;ref name=Popkin2003/&gt; For example, in China, for the same extra dollar of income, an average Chinese person is purchasing higher calorie food today than that person would have done for the same extra yuan in 1990.&lt;ref name=Shufa2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Du S, Mroz TA, Zhai F, Popkin BM | title = Rapid income growth adversely affects diet quality in China--particularly for the poor! | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1505‚Äì15 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15246178 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.01.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid [[urbanization]] has also shaped food demand globally. The [[demographic transition]] from rural areas to urban populations is a well documented byproduct of globalization and technological advancements. This is because agro-food systems have replaced local subsistence farming in many rural areas.&lt;ref name=Brody2002&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brody J | year = 2002 | title = The Global Epidemic of Childhood Obesity: Poverty, Urbanization, and Nutrition Transition | journal = Nutrition Bytes | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 1‚Äì7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The supply of food is directly sculpted by increasing demand in these areas with growing income. Urbanization is increasing access to new foods and therefore altering the supply chain. This is why transnational food companies have grown so rapidly over the past few decades. These companies are making processed and fast foods much cheaper and more widely available through the growth of transnational supermarkets and chain restaurants. Food is not only easier to obtain in urban areas; it is also cheaper and less time-consuming to acquire which creates an imbalance between energy intake and output.&lt;ref name=Caba2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caballero B | title = The global epidemic of obesity: an overview | journal = Epidemiologic Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1‚Äì5 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17569676 | doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxm012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their advertising and promotional strategies have a strong effect on consumer choices and desire. Foreign direct investment is also stimulating processed food sales in these supermarkets by lowering prices and creating incentives for advertising and promotion. A large proportion of this advertising is for energy-dense processed foods and is being directed at children and youth.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007/&gt;
Technological and transportation advancements are reducing the barriers that once limited global food trade. These techniques are critical to facilitating the production and distribution needed in a global market.  Better preservation techniques are helping to reduce waste which contributes to lower prices for consumers. Technology is creating higher yields which also reduce prices.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2006/&gt;

===Lifestyle changes===
The forces of globalization are strongly influencing many lifestyle changes in developing countries. Major changes in economic structures from agrarian economies to industrialized economies are reducing physical activity levels in occupations around the world.&lt;ref name=Popkin2001a/&gt; Even in agricultural work, gas-powered technologies are helping reduce the energy expenditure needed to perform pertinent farming tasks. These reduced activity levels are not just seen in the workplace, but in homes as well. Daily tasks that were once laborious engagements are now much easier with the help of technological advancements, with examples being appliances such as washing machines, refrigerators, and stoves. Also, recent leaps in the efficiency of food production (canning, refrigeration, freezing, and packaging being a few of the most notable) and improvements in cookware, such as the introduction of improved metal stoves which use fossil fuels and microwave ovens, have helped reduce domestic efforts greatly.&lt;ref name=Popkin2001a/&gt;

Leisure is being greatly impacted as well. Activities such as playing sports outside are being replaced with television watching and computer games.&lt;ref name=Popkin2003/&gt; Decreasing physical leisure activities can also be contributed to urbanization wherein access to fields needed to play such games as soccer are not available due to such dense populations and their subsequent demand for land.&lt;ref name=Brody2002/&gt; Other important lifestyle changes fueling the nutrition transition relate to the composition of diets. These dietary shifts have been mentioned previously several times but deserve greater scrutiny. Diets rich in legumes, other vegetables, and coarse grains are disappearing in all regions and countries. Taking their place are diets characterized by fat-rich edible and vegetable oils, cheap animal-source foods high in fat and protein, and artificially sweetened foods high in sugar and refined carbohydrates. Consumption of caloric beverages such as soda represented 21% of all calorie intake in Mexico from 1996 to 2002.&lt;ref name=Popkin2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2011/&gt; Processes of globalization that have influenced food markets have made these products much cheaper, flavorful, and easier to produce which has in turn driven up their demand. So while globalization and the accompanying economic development has created higher levels of food security for developing countries, the ongoing trend of eating in a more Western fashion has caused increased rates of adverse health and childhood obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drewnowski A, Popkin BM | year = 1997 | title = The Nutrition Transition: New Trends in the Global Diet | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 31‚Äì43 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.1997.tb01593 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopsychosocial forces===
The desires for these new diets and lifestyles are very understandable from a biological and psychosocial perspective. For example, humans have an innate preference for sweets dating back to [[hunter-gatherer]] populations. These sweets signaled a good source of energy for hunter-gatherers that were not food secure. This same concept also relates to human predisposition for energy-dense fatty foods. These foods were needed to sustain long journeys and provided a safety net for times of famine. Humans also desire to eliminate physical exertion. This can explain the shift to more sedentary lifestyles from occupational, domestic, and leisurely activities that were previously much more physical taxing.&lt;ref name=Popkin2011/&gt; 
Socioeconomic and cultural influences also contribute to lifestyle changes associated with nutrition transition. The transfer of tastes by means of [[tourism]] and open food trade has introduced developing nations to foods previously enjoyed only by industrialized countries. Global food [[advertising]] and promotion has only further cemented these dietary changes.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007/&gt; Additionally some cultures view obese body types in high regard as they relate them to power, beauty and affluence.&lt;ref name=Prentice2006/&gt; Several studies suggest that [[socioeconomic status]] contributes greatly to nutrition transition wherein there is a lack of [[healthy diet|healthy food]] alternatives completely or a lack of affordable healthy food alternatives.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mont2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Monteiro CA, Conde WL, Lu B, Popkin BM | title = Obesity and inequities in health in the developing world | journal = International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 1181‚Äì6 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15211362 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0802716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Franco2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franco M, Diez Roux AV, Glass TA, Caballero B, Brancati FL | title = Neighborhood characteristics and availability of healthy foods in Baltimore | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 561‚Äì7 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18842389 | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and economic outcomes==
While increased [[food security]] is a major benefit of global nutrition transition, there are a myriad of coinciding negative health and economic consequences. Rates of obesity are soaring across the world and recent trends suggest that incidences of [[overnutrition]] in coming decades will overtake that of [[undernutrition]] in the developing world. As well there will be a marked [[epidemiological transition|epidemiological shift]] from [[infectious disease]] to degenerative, [[noncommunicable disease]], NCDs in these countries.&lt;ref name=Chopra2002/&gt; As it stands now these countries face a unique paradox in having to deal with both over- and undernutrition, a dual burden of malnutrition, that will inevitably be accompanied by both infectious and noncommunicable diseases, a dual burden of disease.&lt;ref name=Caba2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caballero B | title = A nutrition paradox--underweight and obesity in developing countries | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 352 | issue = 15 | pages = 1514‚Äì6 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15829531 | doi = 10.1056/nejmp048310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanu2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanumihardjo SA, Anderson C, Kaufer-Horwitz M, Bode L, Emenaker NJ, Haqq AM, Satia JA, Silver HJ, Stadler DD | title = Poverty, obesity, and malnutrition: an international perspective recognizing the paradox | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 107 | issue = 11 | pages = 1966‚Äì72 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17964317 | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2007.08.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vonke2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vonke D | year = 2011 | title = The Paradox of Malnutrition in Developing Countries | journal = African Research Review | volume = 5 | issue = 19| pages = 40‚Äì48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Uauy2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uauy R, Albala C, Kain J | title = Obesity trends in Latin America: transiting from under- to overweight | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 131 | issue = 3 | pages = 893S‚Äì899S | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11238781 | doi = 10.1093/jn/131.3.893S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The economic impact will be enormous as well. In addition to reduced productivity, the health systems of these countries stand to face a tremendous burden.&lt;ref name=Popkin2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = Global nutrition dynamics: the world is shifting rapidly toward a diet linked with noncommunicable diseases | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 84 | issue = 2 | pages = 289‚Äì98 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16895874 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/84.2.289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health outcomes===
The foremost health outcome of the global nutrition transition will be an increased prevalence of obesity across the world. Obesity prevalence in developing countries increased from 2.3% in 1988 to 19.6% in 1998.&lt;ref name=Popkin1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM, Doak CM | title = The obesity epidemic is a worldwide phenomenon | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 56 | issue = 4 Pt 1 | pages = 106‚Äì14 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9584495 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.1998.tb01722.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidences are highest among women and children, indicating health inequities across global populations.&lt;ref name=Misra2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Misra A, Khurana L | title = Obesity and the metabolic syndrome in developing countries | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 93 | issue = 11 Suppl 1 | pages = S9-30 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18987276 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2008-1595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obesity is strongly linked to degenerative, NCDs such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension. WHO estimates place NCDs as the principal global cause of morbidity and mortality,&lt;ref name=WHR1997&gt;{{cite book | title = World Health Report 1997: Conquering Suffering, Enriching Humanity | location = Geneva | publisher = World Health Organization | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and global prevalence of chronic diseases is projected to increase substantially over the next 2 decades in developing countries.&lt;ref name=Misra2008/&gt; Between 1990 and 2020, mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]], CVDs, in developing countries is expected to increase 120% for women and 137% for men compared to 29 and 49% respectively in industrialized countries.&lt;ref name=Misra2008/&gt; In many of the countries facing epidemics of overnutrition, there is still widespread undernutrition.

===Dual burden of disease===
Deemed as a developmental challenge of epidemic proportions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/ga11138.doc.htm | title = Non-Communicable Diseases Deemed Development Challenge of ‚ÄòEpidemic Proportions‚Äô in Political Declaration Adopted During Landmark General Assembly Summit |publisher=Un.org |date= |access-date=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the double burden of disease (DBD) is an emerging global health challenge, that exists predominately in low-to-middle income countries. More specifically, the DBD refers to the dual burden of communicable and [[non-communicable disease]]s(NCD). Today, over 90 per cent of the world‚Äôs disease burden occurs in developing regions, and most are attributed to communicable diseases.  Communicable diseases are [[infectious disease]]s that  ‚Äúcan be passed between people through proximity, social contact or intimate contact.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vancouver Coastal Health |url=http://www.vch.ca/your_health/communicable_diseases/ |title=Communicable Diseases -Vancouver Coastal Health |publisher=Vch.ca |date=2013-01-16 |access-date=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common diseases in this category include whooping cough or tuberculosis, HIV/AIDs, malaria, influenza (the flu), and mumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boutayeb A, Boutayeb S | title = The burden of non communicable diseases in developing countries | journal = International Journal for Equity in Health | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 2 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15651987 | pmc = 546417 | doi = 10.1186/1475-9276-4-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    
As low-to-middle income countries continue to develop, the types of diseases that affecting populations within these countries shifts primarily from infectious diseases, such as diarrhea and pneumonia, to primarily non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and obesity.  This shift is increasingly being referred to as the risk transition.&lt;ref name="euro.who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases |title=WHO/Europe &amp;#124; Noncommunicable diseases |publisher=Euro.who.int |date=2013-06-14 |access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalHealthRisks_report_full.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, as globalization and the proliferation of pre-packaged foods continues, traditional diets and lifestyles are changing in many developing countries.  As such, it is becoming increasingly common to see low-to-middle income countries battle with century old issues such as food insecurity and under nutrition, in addition to emerging health epidemics such as chronic heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and diabetes.  Diseases once characteristic of industrialized nations, are increasingly becoming health challenges of epidemic proportions in many low-to-middle income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/2_background/en/index1.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; 2. Background |publisher=Who.int |date= |access-date=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic impact===
The economic impact of these rising rates and dual burdens of disease looks to be tremendous. Disability, decreased quality of life, greater use of health care facilities, and increased absenteeism are strong associated with obesity.&lt;ref name=Misra2008/&gt;  With inadequate resources, poorly construed health systems, and a general lack of expertise to address the burden of infective diseases, the disease burden for low-to-middle countries is exacerbated by the rising rate of non-communicable diseases. This is often attributed to the fact that these countries by nature have ill-health systems that possess inadequate resources to detect and prevent many non-communicable diseases.‚Äù&lt;ref name="euro.who.int"/&gt;  Social constructs within these countries often amplify the risk of the double burden, as inequality, gender, and other social determinants often have a role to play in disparate access and allocation of health services and resources.&lt;ref name="euro.who.int"/&gt;  If current trends are maintained, the World Health Organization predicts that low-and-middle income countries will be unable to support the burden of disease within the foreseeable future.

==Implications for policy==
Countries worldwide have made several, varied efforts to address the consequences of the nutrition transition. These policies target the food environment, governance, food system, or education and can be generally classified into the following categories:

=== Public Nutrition Education Policy ===
[[Nutrition Education|Nutrition education]] intends to facilitate healthy behavioral changes, at the individual level. Dietary guidelines, specifically, promote public awareness of nutritional needs. Over 60 countries in the Global North and South have established national dietary guidelines.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Q, Liu S, Liu R, Xue H, Wang Y | title = Food Policy Approaches to Obesity Prevention: An International Perspective | journal = Current Obesity Reports | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 171‚Äì82 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 25705571 | doi = 10.1007/s13679-014-0099-6 | pmc = 4333683 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrition Labeling Policy ===
Nutrition labeling for food packages and in restaurants may encourage consumers to choose healthier foods. Nutrition labeling has been emphasized as important in influencing food choices and potentially reducing the intake of fat, sugar, and sodium.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== School-focused Policy ===
Schools are viewed as a primary target of intervention for implementing nutrition-related policies. Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to exposure to unhealthy foods before, during, and after school. Children are more susceptible to developing early obesity and are likely to remain obese throughout adulthood. School policies are varied and specific to the political, economic, and social climates of a place. They can focus on increasing nutritional standards, promoting active lifestyles, regulating school meal programs, and banning the sale of certain foods and beverages in and around schools.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Food Marketing Regulation ===
[[Food marketing]], via several media outlets - television, the Internet, packaging, popular culture - has been an effective strategy for influencing and changing consumers' food choices, particularly among children. Several studies have indicated the association between exposure to food advertising and food choices and beliefs. The impact of advertising has led to support for government level regulation of food marketing. Countries have implemented voluntary or mandatory restrictions on advertisements of unhealthy food products.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Food companies are also urged to implement responsible food marketing strategies. Efforts by corporations should reverse drivers of food consumption, including convenience, low cost, good taste, and nutritional knowledge. Recommendations include downsizing packaging, reducing serving sizes, and recreating formulas to decrease caloric content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witkowski|first=Terrence H. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2007|title=Food Marketing and Obesity in Developing Countries: Analysis, Ethics, and Public Policy|journal=Journal of Macromarketing|volume=27.2|pages=126-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxation ===
Stemming from the success of taxation of tobacco products in reducing tobacco usage, policy makers and researchers have adopted a parallel approach for reducing obesity. The WHO supported economic policies as a method of influencing food prices and promoting healthy eating in public spaces (cite, 2008). Tax policies, in the form of [[Sin tax|sin taxes]] or [[Pigovian tax|Pigovian taxes]], generally target unhealthy food and drink products, including the "[[fat tax]]," "junk food tax," and of particular popularity, the [[Sugary drink tax|tax on sugar-sweetened beverages]] (SSBs). Taxation is intended to combat obesity by increasing the price of SSBs and unhealthy foods and in turn, reducing their consumption, as well as generating revenue that may be used towards obesity prevention programs or promotion of fruit and vegetable consumption.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the effectiveness of taxation remains under scrutiny - economists argue that taxes are inefficient for combating obesity and can result in greater losses for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mann|first=Stefan| name-list-format = vanc |date=2008|title=Framing Obesity in Economic Theory and Policy| jstor = 29770461 |journal=Review of Social Economy|volume=66|issue=2|pages=163‚Äì179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comprehensive Approach ===
The literature suggests that it may be ideal for governments to adopt a holistic policy approach to address the obesity epidemic, given the associated social conditions.&lt;ref name="Weiler_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiler R, Stamatakis E, Blair S | title = Should health policy focus on physical activity rather than obesity? Yes | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = c2603 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20501586 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c2603 | jstor = 40702159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Policy package" recommendations have been a supported framework for preventing obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases worldwide because they are adaptable to country-specific circumstances. For example, the NOURISHING framework summarizes key avenues for action and policy but is flexible to suit a range of national and local contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkes C, Jewell J, Allen K | title = A food policy package for healthy diets and the prevention of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases: the NOURISHING framework | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 14 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 159‚Äì68 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24103073 | doi = 10.1111/obr.12098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization has called for governments to have multi-faceted interventions, focusing on food security, food safety, healthy lifestyle, and nutrition.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roussev|first=Leslie | name-list-format = vanc |date=2014|title=The WHO's CRASH DIET: The role of governments in the international obesity crisis and why the global strategy falls short| jstor = 24889898 |journal=The International Lawyer|volume=48|issue=1|pages=51‚Äì78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the scope of the pandemic but the diverse place-based trends and risk factors, appropriate and adequate intervention calls for policy change across multiple levels - population and individual - and the need for international collaboration.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Malik VS, Willett WC, Hu FB | title = Global obesity: trends, risk factors and policy implications | language = En | journal = Nature Reviews. Endocrinology | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 13‚Äì27 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23165161 | doi = 10.1038/nrendo.2012.199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, evaluations of programs and initiatives on their impact on obesity are necessary to both enhance efficacy of existing interventions and provide a foundation for future interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM, Adair LS, Ng SW | title = Global nutrition transition and the pandemic of obesity in developing countries | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 70 | issue = 1 | pages = 3‚Äì21 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22221213 | pmc = 3257829 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00456.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==
Case studies for individual nations are plentiful. The [[BRICS]] countries are specifically studied in great depth because of their rapidly transitioning economies, but more slowly developing nations are well studied too.

===Industrialized nations===
Case studies in the United States and United Kingdom are particularly bountiful.&lt;ref name=Lang2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = Recent dynamics suggest selected countries catching up to US obesity | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 91 | issue = 1 | pages = 284S‚Äì288S | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19906804 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.28473C | pmc = 2793114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing countries===
Reports based in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and developed areas of sub-Saharan Africa can be found in a wide range of academic literature.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shufa2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Uauy2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mok2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mokhtar N, Elati J, Chabir R, Bour A, Elkari K, Schlossman NP, Caballero B, Aguenaou H | title = Diet culture and obesity in northern Africa | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 131 | issue = 3 | pages = 887S‚Äì892S | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11238780 | doi = 10.1093/jn/131.3.887S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2002b&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = The shift in stages of the nutrition transition in the developing world differs from past experiences! | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 5 | issue = 1A | pages = 205‚Äì14 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 12027286 | doi = 10.1079/PHN2001295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riosmena F, Frank R, Akresh IR, Kroeger RA | title = U.S. Migration, Translocality, and the Acceleration of the Nutrition Transition in Mexico | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers.

===Aboriginal populations===
Worldwide, [[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginal populations]] have experienced radical changes in diet. Traditional diets and food intakes have been replaced by diets consisting of foods high in fat, sugar and salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma S | title = Assessing diet and lifestyle in the Canadian Arctic Inuit and Inuvialuit to inform a nutrition and physical activity intervention programme | journal = Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics | volume = 23 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 5‚Äì17 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 21158957 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2010.01093.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change in diet is related to the life-style changes during the last century: for example, Hunter-gatherer communities became more settled, and traditional food gathering methods changed. The nutrition transition has been linked to increased rates of [[non-communicable diseases]] amongst Aboriginal populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhnlein HV, Receveur O, Soueida R, Egeland GM | title = Arctic indigenous peoples experience the nutrition transition with changing dietary patterns and obesity | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 6 | pages = 1447‚Äì53 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15173410 | doi = 10.1093/jn/134.6.1447 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrialization introduced a less complicated way to access food; a protein rich diet was replaced by white bread, processed food and sugary beverages.

Traditional food of [[First Nations]] included [[burbot]] filet (or muscle) and [[moose]] liver. Food consumption provided essential fats (i.e., fatty acids) and proteins that played a key medicinal role in the prevention and reduction of obesity and obesity-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robidoux MA, Haman F, Sethna C | title = The relationship of the burbot (Lota lota L.) to the reintroduction of off-the-land foods in the Sandy Lake First Nation Community | journal = Biodemography and Social Biology | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 12‚Äì29 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19835098 | doi = 10.1080/19485560903054630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4301">{{About|optical depth in astrophysics|optical depth in general|optical depth}}

'''Optical depth''' in astrophysics refers to a specific level of transparency.  Optical depth and actual depth, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; respectively, can vary widely depending on the absorptivity of the astrophysical environment.  Indeed, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is able to show the relationship between these two quantities and can lead to a greater understanding of the structure inside a star.

Optical depth is a measure of the [[Mass attenuation coefficient|extinction coefficient]] or [[Absorbance|absorptivity]] up to a specific 'depth' of a star's makeup.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau \equiv \int_0^z \alpha  dz = \sigma N.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/OpticalDepth.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption here is that either the extinction coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; or the column number density &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is known.  These can generally be calculated from other equations if a fair amount of information is known about the chemical makeup of the star. From the definition, it is also clear that large optical depths correspond to higher rate of obscuration. Optical depth can therefore be thought of as the opacity of a medium. 

The extinction coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated using the [[Radiative transfer#Solutions to the equation of radiative transfer|transfer equation]].  In most astrophysical problems, this is exceptionally difficult to solve since solving the corresponding equations requires the incident radiation as well as the radiation leaving the star. These values are usually theoretical.

In some cases the [[Beer-Lambert Law]] can be useful in finding &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=e^\frac{4 \pi \kappa}{\lambda_0},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]], and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]] of the incident light before being absorbed or scattered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.files.chem.vt.edu/chem-ed/spec/beerslaw.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note that the Beer-Lambert Law is only appropriate when the absorption occurs at a specific wavelength, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt;. For a gray atmosphere, for instance, it is most appropriate to use the Eddington Approximation.

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is simply a constant that depends on the physical distance from the outside of a star.  To find &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; at a particular depth &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt;, the above equation may be used with &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and integration from &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;z=z'&lt;/math&gt;.

== The Eddington approximation and the depth of the photosphere ==
Since it is difficult to define where the [[photosphere]] of a star ends and the [[chromosphere]] begins, astrophysicists usually rely on the [[Radiative transfer#The Eddington approximation|Eddington Approximation]] to derive the formal definition of &lt;math&gt;\tau=2/3&lt;/math&gt;

Devised by [[Sir Arthur Eddington]] the approximation takes into account the fact that &lt;math&gt;H^-&lt;/math&gt; produces a "gray" absorption in the atmosphere of a star, that is, it is independent of any specific wavelength and absorbs along the entire electromagnetic spectrum.  In that case,
:&lt;math&gt;T^4 = \frac{3}{4}T_e^4\left(\tau + \frac{2}{3}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[effective temperature]] at that depth and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the optical depth.

This illustrates not only that the observable temperature and actual temperature at a certain physical depth of a star vary, but that the optical depth plays a crucial role in understanding the stellar structure.  It also serves to demonstrate that the depth of the photosphere of a star is highly dependent upon the absorptivity of its environment.  The photosphere extends down to a point where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is about 2/3, which corresponds to a state where a photon would experience, in general, less than 1 scattering before leaving the star.

The above equation can be rewritten in terms of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the following way:
:&lt;math&gt;T^4 = \frac{3}{4}T_e^4\left(\int_0^z (\alpha)  dz  + \frac{2}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Which is useful, for example, when &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is not known but &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27522">'''Optimal control theory''' deals with the problem of finding a control law for a given system such that a certain [[optimality criterion]] is achieved.

It is an extension of the [[calculus of variations]], and is a [[mathematical optimization]] method for deriving [[control theory|control policies]]. The method is largely due to the work of [[Lev Pontryagin]] and [[Richard Bellman]] in the 1950s, after contributions to calculus of variations by [[Edward J. McShane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. E. |last=Bryson |authorlink=Arthur E. Bryson |year=1996 |title=Optimal Control‚Äî1950 to 1985 |journal= IEEE Control Systems |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=26‚Äì33 |doi=10.1109/37.506395 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimal control can be seen as a [[control strategy]] in [[control theory]].

==General method==
Optimal control deals with the problem of finding a control law for a given system such that a certain [[optimality criterion]] is achieved. A control problem includes a [[cost functional]] that is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of state and control variables. An '''optimal control''' is a set of [[differential equation]]s describing the paths of the control variables that minimize the cost function. The optimal control can be derived using [[Pontryagin's minimum principle|Pontryagin's maximum principle]] (a [[necessary condition]] also known as Pontryagin's minimum principle or simply Pontryagin's Principle),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=I. M. |last=Ross |authorlink=I. Michael Ross |year=2009 |title=A Primer on Pontryagin's Principle in Optimal Control |location= |publisher=Collegiate Publishers |isbn=978-0-9843571-0-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by solving the [[Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi‚ÄìBellman equation]] (a [[sufficient condition]]).

We begin with a simple example. Consider a car traveling in a straight line on a hilly road. The question is, how should the driver press the accelerator pedal in order to ''minimize'' the total traveling time? Clearly in this example, the term ''control law'' refers specifically to the way in which the driver presses the accelerator and shifts the gears. The ''system'' consists of both the car and the road, and the ''optimality criterion'' is the minimization of the total traveling time. Control problems usually include ancillary [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. For example, the amount of available fuel might be limited, the accelerator pedal cannot be pushed through the floor of the car, speed limits, etc.

A proper cost function will be a mathematical expression giving the traveling time as a function of the speed, geometrical considerations, and [[initial condition]]s of the system. It is often the case that the [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s are interchangeable with the cost function.

Another optimal control problem is to find the way to drive the car so as to minimize its fuel consumption, given that it must complete a given course in a time not exceeding some amount. Yet another control problem is to minimize the total monetary cost of completing the trip, given assumed monetary prices for time and fuel.

A more abstract framework goes as follows.  Minimize the continuous-time cost functional

:&lt;math&gt;J=\Phi\,[\,\textbf{x}(t_0),t_0,\textbf{x}(t_f),t_f\,] + \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \mathcal{L}\,[\,\textbf{x}(t),\textbf{u}(t),t\,] \,\operatorname{d}t&lt;/math&gt;

subject to the first-order dynamic constraints (the '''state equation''')

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \textbf{a}\,[\,\textbf{x}(t),\textbf{u}(t),t\,],&lt;/math&gt;

the algebraic ''path constraints''

:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{b}\,[\,\textbf{x}(t),\textbf{u}(t),t\,] \leq \textbf{0},&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[boundary condition]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\phi}\,[\,\textbf{x}(t_0),t_0,\textbf{x}(t_f),t_f\,] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''state'', &lt;math&gt;\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''control'', &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the independent variable (generally speaking, time), &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial time, and &lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal time.  The terms &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''endpoint cost '' and ''[[Lagrange multiplier|Lagrangian]]'', respectively.  Furthermore, it is noted that the path constraints are in general ''inequality'' constraints and thus may not be active (i.e., equal to zero) at the optimal solution.  It is also noted that the optimal control problem as stated above may have multiple solutions (i.e., the solution may not be unique).  Thus, it is most often the case that any solution &lt;math&gt;[\textbf{x}^*(t^*),\textbf{u}^*(t^*),t^*]&lt;/math&gt; to the optimal control problem is ''locally minimizing''.

==Linear quadratic control==
A special case of the general nonlinear optimal control problem given in the previous section is the [[Linear-quadratic regulator|''linear quadratic'' (LQ) optimal control problem]].  The LQ problem is stated as follows.  Minimize the ''quadratic'' continuous-time cost functional

:&lt;math&gt;J=\tfrac{1}{2} \mathbf{x}^{\mathsf{T}}(t_f)\mathbf{S}_f\mathbf{x}(t_f) + \tfrac{1}{2} \int_{t_0}^{t_f} [\,\mathbf{x}^{\mathsf{T}}(t)\mathbf{Q}(t)\mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{u}^{\mathsf{T}}(t)\mathbf{R}(t)\mathbf{u}(t)\,]\, \operatorname{d}t&lt;/math&gt;

Subject to the ''linear'' first-order dynamic constraints

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)=\mathbf{A}(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{B}(t) \mathbf{u}(t), &lt;/math&gt;

and the initial condition

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}(t_0) = \mathbf{x}_0&lt;/math&gt;

A particular form of the LQ problem that arises in many control system problems is that of the ''linear quadratic regulator'' (LQR) where all of the matrices (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;) are ''constant'', the initial time is arbitrarily set to zero, and the terminal time is taken in the limit &lt;math&gt;t_f\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; (this last assumption is what is known as ''infinite horizon'').  The LQR problem is stated as follows.  Minimize the infinite horizon quadratic continuous-time cost functional

:&lt;math&gt;J=\tfrac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty}[\,\mathbf{x}^{\mathsf{T}}(t)\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{u}^{\mathsf{T}}(t)\mathbf{R}\mathbf{u}(t)\,]\, \operatorname{d}t&lt;/math&gt;

Subject to the ''linear time-invariant'' first-order dynamic constraints

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)=\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{B} \mathbf{u}(t), &lt;/math&gt;

and the initial condition

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}(t_0) = \mathbf{x}_0&lt;/math&gt;

In the finite-horizon case the matrices are restricted in that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; are positive semi-definite and positive definite, respectively.  In the infinite-horizon case, however, the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; are not only positive-semidefinite and positive-definite, respectively, but are also ''constant''.  These additional restrictions on
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; in the infinite-horizon case are enforced to ensure that the cost functional remains positive.  Furthermore, in order to ensure that the cost function is ''bounded'', the additional restriction is imposed that the pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt; is ''[[Controllability|controllable]]''.  Note that the LQ or LQR cost functional can be thought of physically as attempting to minimize the ''control energy'' (measured as a quadratic form).

The infinite horizon problem (i.e., LQR) may seem overly restrictive and essentially useless because it assumes that the operator is driving the system to zero-state and hence driving the output of the system to zero. This is indeed correct. However the problem of driving the output to a desired nonzero level can be solved ''after'' the zero output one is. In fact, it can be proved that this secondary LQR problem can be solved in a very straightforward manner.  It has been shown in classical optimal control theory that the LQ (or LQR) optimal control has the feedback form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(t)=-\mathbf{K}(t)\mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a properly dimensioned matrix, given as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}(t)=\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{B}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{S}(t),&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the solution of the differential [[Riccati equation]].  The differential Riccati equation is given as

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{S}}(t) = -\mathbf{S}(t)\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{A}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{S}(t)+\mathbf{S}(t)\mathbf{B}\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{B}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{S}(t)-\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

For the finite horizon LQ problem, the Riccati equation is integrated backward in time using the terminal boundary condition

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}(t_f) = \mathbf{S}_f&lt;/math&gt;

For the infinite horizon LQR problem, the differential Riccati equation is replaced with the ''algebraic'' Riccati equation (ARE) given as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{0} = -\mathbf{S}\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{A}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{S}+\mathbf{S}\mathbf{B}\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{B}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{S}-\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

Understanding that the ARE arises from infinite horizon problem, the matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; are all ''constant''.  It is noted that there are in general multiple solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation and the ''positive definite'' (or positive semi-definite) solution is the one that is used to compute the feedback gain.  The LQ (LQR) problem was elegantly solved by [[Rudolf Kalman]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalman, Rudolf. ''A new approach to linear filtering and prediction problems''. Transactions of the ASME, Journal of Basic Engineering, 82:34‚Äì45, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numerical methods for optimal control==
Optimal control problems are generally nonlinear and therefore, generally do not have analytic solutions (e.g., like the linear-quadratic optimal control problem).  As a result, it is necessary to employ numerical methods to solve optimal control problems.  In the early years of optimal control ({{abbr|c.|circa}} 1950s to 1980s) the favored approach for solving optimal control problems was that of ''indirect methods''.  In an indirect method, the calculus of variations is employed to obtain the first-order optimality conditions.  These conditions result in a two-point (or, in the case of a complex problem, a multi-point) [[boundary-value problem]].  This boundary-value problem actually has a special structure because it arises from taking the derivative of a [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]].  Thus, the resulting [[dynamical system]] is a [[Hamiltonian system]] of the form

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl} \dot{\textbf{x}} &amp; = &amp; \partial H/\partial\boldsymbol{\lambda} \\ \dot{\boldsymbol{\lambda}} &amp; = &amp; -\partial H/\partial\textbf{x} \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;H=\mathcal{L}+\boldsymbol{\lambda}^{\mathsf{T}}\textbf{a}-\boldsymbol{\mu}^{\mathsf{T}}\textbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;

is the ''augmented Hamiltonian'' and in an indirect method, the boundary-value problem is solved (using the appropriate boundary or ''transversality'' conditions).  The beauty of using an indirect method is that the state and adjoint (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;) are solved for and the resulting solution is readily verified to be an extremal trajectory.  The disadvantage of indirect methods is that the boundary-value problem is often extremely difficult to solve (particularly for problems that span large time intervals or problems with interior point constraints).   A well-known software program that implements indirect methods is BNDSCO.&lt;ref&gt;Oberle, H. J. and Grimm, W., "BNDSCO-A Program for the Numerical Solution of Optimal Control Problems," Institute for Flight Systems Dynamics, DLR, Oberpfaffenhofen, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach that has risen to prominence in numerical optimal control since the 1980s is that of so-called ''direct methods''.  In a direct method, the state and/or control are approximated using an appropriate function approximation (e.g., polynomial approximation or piecewise constant parameterization).  Simultaneously, the cost functional is approximated as a ''cost function''.  Then, the coefficients of the function approximations are treated as optimization variables and the problem is "transcribed" to a nonlinear optimization problem of the form:

Minimize

: &lt;math&gt; F(\textbf{z})\,&lt;/math&gt;

subject to the algebraic constraints

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{lcl} \textbf{g}(\textbf{z}) &amp; = &amp; \textbf{0} \\ \textbf{h}(\textbf{z}) &amp; \leq &amp; \textbf{0} \end{array} &lt;/math&gt;

Depending upon the type of direct method employed, the size of the nonlinear optimization problem can be quite small (e.g., as in a direct shooting or quasilinearization method), moderate (e.g. [[pseudospectral optimal control]]&lt;ref name="ReviewPOC"&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=I. Michael Ross |first=I. M. |last=Ross |first2=M. |last2=Karpenko |title=A Review of [[Pseudospectral optimal control|Pseudospectral Optimal Control]]: From Theory to Flight |journal=Annual Reviews in Control |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=182‚Äì197 |year=2012 |doi=10.1016/j.arcontrol.2012.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) or may be quite large (e.g., a direct [[collocation method]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Betts |first=J. T. |title=Practical Methods for Optimal Control Using Nonlinear Programming |publisher=SIAM Press |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |edition=2nd |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-89871-688-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). In the latter case (i.e., a collocation method), the nonlinear optimization problem may be literally thousands to tens of thousands of variables and constraints. Given the size of many NLPs arising from a direct method, it may appear somewhat counter-intuitive that solving the nonlinear optimization problem is easier than solving the boundary-value problem. It is, however, the fact that the NLP is easier to solve than the boundary-value problem. The reason for the relative ease of computation, particularly of a direct collocation method, is that the NLP is ''sparse'' and many well-known software programs exist (e.g., [[SNOPT]]&lt;ref&gt;Gill, P. E., Murray, W. M., and Saunders, M. A., ''User's Manual for SNOPT Version 7: Software for Large-Scale Nonlinear Programming'', University of California, San Diego Report, 24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) to solve large sparse NLPs. As a result, the range of problems that can be solved via direct methods (particularly direct ''collocation methods'' which are very popular these days) is significantly larger than the range of problems that can be solved via indirect methods. In fact, direct methods have become so popular these days that many people have written elaborate software programs that employ these methods. In particular, many such programs include ''DIRCOL'',&lt;ref&gt;von Stryk, O., ''User's Guide for DIRCOL (version 2.1): A Direct Collocation Method for the Numerical Solution of Optimal Control Problems'', Fachgebiet Simulation und Systemoptimierung (SIM), Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt (2000, Version of November 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; SOCS,&lt;ref&gt;Betts, J.T. and Huffman, W. P., ''Sparse Optimal Control Software, SOCS'', Boeing Information and Support Services, Seattle, Washington, July 1997&lt;/ref&gt; OTIS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hargraves |first=C.

Tools and Techniques, ICATT. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, due to the advent of the [[MATLAB]] programming language, optimal control software in MATLAB has become more common. Examples of academically developed MATLAB software tools implementing direct methods include ''RIOTS'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schwartz-home.com/RIOTS/ RIOTS], based on {{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |last=Schwartz |first=Adam |date=1996 |title=Theory and Implementation of Methods based on Runge‚ÄìKutta Integration for Solving Optimal Control Problems |publisher=University of California at Berkeley |url= |oclc=35140322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[DIDO (optimal control)|DIDO]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ross, I.

A., ''User's Manual for GPOPS: A MATLAB Package for Dynamic Optimization Using the [[Gauss pseudospectral method|Gauss Pseudospectral Method]]'', University of Florida Report, August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; while an example of an industry developed MATLAB tool is ''[[PROPT]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rutquist, P. and Edvall, M. M, ''PROPT ‚Äì MATLAB Optimal Control Software," 1260 S.E. Bishop Blvd Ste E, Pullman, WA 99163, USA: Tomlab Optimization, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; These software tools have increased significantly the opportunity for people to explore complex optimal control problems both for academic research and industrial problems. Finally, it is noted that general-purpose MATLAB optimization environments such as [[TOMLAB]] have made coding complex optimal control problems significantly easier than was previously possible in languages such as C and [[FORTRAN]].

==Discrete-time optimal control==
The examples thus far have shown [[continuous time]] systems and control solutions. In fact, as optimal control solutions are now often implemented [[Digital data|digital]]ly, contemporary control theory is now primarily concerned with [[discrete time]] systems and solutions.  The Theory of [[Consistent Approximations]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Polak, ''On the use of consistent approximations in the solution of semi-infinite optimization and optimal control problems'' Math. Prog. 62 pp. 385‚Äì415 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; provides conditions under which solutions to a series of increasingly accurate discretized optimal control problem converge to the solution of the original, continuous-time problem.  Not all discretization methods have this property, even seemingly obvious ones.  For instance, using a variable step-size routine to integrate the problem's dynamic equations may generate a gradient which does not converge to zero (or point in the right direction) as the solution is approached.   The direct method ''[http://www.schwartz-home.com/RIOTS RIOTS]'' is based on the Theory of Consistent Approximation.

==Examples==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
A common solution strategy in many optimal control problems is to solve for the costate (sometimes called the [[shadow price]]) &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The costate summarizes in one number the marginal value of expanding or contracting the state variable next turn. The marginal value is not only the gains accruing to it next turn but associated with the duration of the program. It is nice when &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be solved analytically, but usually the most one can do is describe it sufficiently well that the intuition can grasp the character of the solution and an equation solver can solve numerically for the values.

Having obtained &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the turn-t optimal value for the control can usually be solved as a differential equation conditional on knowledge of &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Again it is infrequent, especially in continuous-time problems, that one obtains the value of the control or the state explicitly. Usually the strategy is to solve for thresholds and regions that characterize the optimal control and use a numerical solver to isolate the actual choice values in time.

===Finite time===
{{confusing|section|small=left|reason=the law of evolution mentioned in the example is not mentioned in the article and is probably not the same as [[evolution]]|date=October 2018}}
Consider the problem of a mine owner who must decide at what rate to extract ore from their mine. They own rights to the ore from date &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to date &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. At date &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there is &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; ore in the ground, and the time-dependent amount of ore &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; left in the ground declines at the rate of &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; that the mine owner extracts it. The mine owner extracts ore at cost &lt;math&gt;u(t)^2/x(t)&lt;/math&gt; (the cost of extraction increasing with the square of the extraction speed and the inverse of the amount of ore left) and sells ore at a constant price &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Any ore left in the ground at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; cannot be sold and has no value (there is no "scrap value"). The owner chooses the rate of extraction varying with time &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; to maximize profits over the period of ownership with no time discounting.

| 1. Discrete-time version

The manager maximizes profit &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \left[ pu_t - \frac{u_t^2}{x_t} \right] &lt;/math&gt;
subject to the law of evolution for the state variable &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_{t+1} - x_t = - u_t\!&lt;/math&gt;

Form the Hamiltonian and differentiate:
:&lt;math&gt;H = pu_t - \frac{u_t^2}{x_t} - \lambda_{t+1} u_t&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial H}{\partial u_t} = p - \lambda_{t+1} - 2\frac{u_t}{x_t} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{t+1} - \lambda_t = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial x_t} = -\left( \frac{u_t}{x_t} \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

As the mine owner does not value the ore remaining at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda_T = 0\!&lt;/math&gt;

Using the above equations, it is easy to solve for the &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_t&lt;/math&gt; series
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_t = \lambda_{t+1} + \frac{(p-\lambda_{t+1})^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_{t+1} = x_t \frac{2 - p + \lambda_{t+1}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
and using the initial and turn-T conditions, the &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; series can be solved explicitly, giving &lt;math&gt;u_t&lt;/math&gt;.

The manager maximizes profit &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi = \int_0^T \left[ pu(t) - \frac{u(t)^2}{x(t)} \right] dt &lt;/math&gt;
subject to the law of evolution for the state variable &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \dot x(t) = - u(t) &lt;/math&gt;

Form the Hamiltonian and differentiate:
:&lt;math&gt;H = pu(t) - \frac{u(t)^2}{x(t)} - \lambda(t) u(t) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial H}{\partial u} = p - \lambda(t) - 2\frac{u(t)}{x(t)} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\dot\lambda(t) = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial x} = -\left( \frac{u(t)}{x(t)} \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

As the mine owner does not value the ore remaining at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda(T) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Using the above equations, it is easy to solve for the differential equations governing &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dot\lambda(t) = -\frac{(p-\lambda(t))^2}{4}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = x(t) \frac{p- \lambda(t)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
and using the initial and turn-T conditions, the functions can be solved to yield
:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \frac{(4-pt+pT)^2}{(4+pT)^2} x_0  &lt;/math&gt;

'''Patent visualisation''' is an application of [[information visualisation]]. The number of [[patents]] has been increasing steadily,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/ipstats/en/statistics/patents/pdf/941e_2010.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus forcing companies to consider [[intellectual property]] as a part of their strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin G. Rivette, David Kline, "Discovering new value in intellectual property", ''Harvard Business Review'' (January‚ÄìFebruary 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Patent visualisation, like [[patent map]]ping, is used to quickly view a patent portfolio.

Software dedicated to patent visualisation began to appear in 2000, for example Aureka from Aurigin (now owned by [[Thomson Reuters]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/intellectual_property/ip_products/a-z/aureka/]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many patent and portfolio analytics platforms, such as Patentcloud, Relecura, PatSnap and Patent iNSIGHT Pro,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intellogist.com/wiki/Patent_iNSIGHT_Pro|title=Patent iNSIGHT Pro|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer options to visualise specific data within patent documents by creating Topic Maps,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.relecura.com/reports/Relecura_Whitepaper_-_Topic_Maps.pdf Conduct patent portfolio analysis using comparative Topic Maps]&lt;/ref&gt; Priority Maps, IP Landscape reports,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentinsightpro.com/techreports/1113/Tech%20Insight%20Report%20-%20Graphene.pdf Graphene Technology Insight Report]&lt;/ref&gt; etc. Software converts [[patents]] into [[infographics]] or maps, to allow the analyst to "get insight into the data" and draw conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel A Keim et IEEE Computer Society, "Information visualization and visual data mining," IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS 8 (2002): 1--8.&lt;/ref&gt; Also called patinformatics,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Trippe, "Patinformatics: Tasks to tools," World Patent Information 25, n¬∞. 3 (September 2003): 211-221.&lt;/ref&gt; it is the "science of analysing patent information to discover relationships and trends that would be difficult to see when working with patent documents on a one-and-one basis".{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

Patents contain structured data (like publication numbers) and [[unstructured data|unstructured text]] (like title, abstract, claims and visual info). Structured data are processed by [[data-mining]] and unstructured data are processed with [[text-mining]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura Ruotsalainen, "Data mining tools for technology and competitive intelligence" VTT Research Notes 2451(October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data mining==
The main step in processing structured information is [[data-mining]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.data-mining-software.com/data_mining_history.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612094951/http://www.data-mining-software.com/data_mining_history.htm |date=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which emerged in the late 1980s. Data mining involves statistics, [[artificial intelligence]], and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exforsys.com/tutorials/data-mining/how-data-mining-is-evolving.html|title=How Data Mining is Evolving|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patent data mining extracts information from the structured data of the patent document.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Sungjoo Lee, Byungun Yoon, et Yongtae Park, "An approach to discovering new technology opportunities: Keyword-based patent map approach," Technovation 29, n¬∞. 6 (Juin): 481-497.&lt;/ref&gt; These structured data are bibliographic fields such as location, date or status.

===Structured fields===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Structured data !! Description !! Business Intelligence use
|-
| Data || Patents contain identifying data including priority, publication data and the issue date.
* Priority data regroup priority number assigned for the first application, the corresponding date and priority country.
* The publication data encompasses the publication number given when the patent is published, 18 months after filling and the publication date.
* The issue date is the data the patent is granted, usually 3.5 years after filling depending on the patent office.
||Crossing dates and locations fields offer a global vision of a technology in time and space.
|-
| Assignee || Patent assignees are organizations or individuals - the owners of the patent. || The field can offer a ranking of the principal actors of the environment, thus allowing us to visualise potential competitors or partners.
|-
| Inventor|| Inventors develop the invention/patent. || Inventors' field combined with the assignee field can create a social network and provide a method to follow field experts.
|-
| Classification|| The classification can regroup inventions with similar technologies. The most commonly used is the [[International Patent Classification]] (IPC). However, patent organizations have their own classification; for instance, the European Patent Office has framed the [[European Classification|ECLA]].|| Grouping patents by theme offers an overview of the corpus and the potential applications of studied technology.
|-
| Status|| The legal status indicates whether an application is filed, approved, or rejected.|| Patent family and legal status searching is very important for litigation and competitive intelligence.
|}

===Advantages===
Data mining allows study of filing patterns of competitors and locates main patent filers within a specific area of technology. This  approach can be helpful to monitor competitors' environments, moves and innovation trends and gives a macro view of a technology status.

==Text-Mining==

===Principle===
Text mining is used to search through unstructured text documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/~msharp/text_mining.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017010444/http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/~msharp/text_mining.htm |date=October 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0172219009000465 | doi=10.1016/j.wpi.2009.05.008 | volume=32 | title=Review of the state-of-the-art in patent information and forthcoming evolutions in intelligent patent informatics | year=2010 | journal=World Patent Information | pages=30‚Äì38 | last1 = Bonino | first1 = Dario | last2 = Ciaramella | first2 = Alberto | last3 = Corno | first3 = Fulvio}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is widely used on the Internet, its success in [[bioinformatics]] and now in the intellectual property environment.&lt;ref&gt;Sholom Weiss and al, Text Mining : Predictive Methods for Analyzing Unstructured Information, 1er ed. (Springer 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Text mining is based on a statistical analysis of word recurrence in a corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Blanchard "La cartographie des brevets" La Recherche n¬∞.398 (2006) : 82-83&lt;/ref&gt; An algorithm extracts words and expressions from title, summary and claims and gathers them by [[declension]]. "And" and "if" are labeled as non-information bearing words and are stored in the [[Stop words|stopword]] list. Stoplists can be specialized in order to create an accurate analysis. Next, the algorithm ranks the words by weight, according to their frequency in the patent's corpus and the document frequency containing this word. The score for each word is calculated using a formula such as:&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Salton et Christopher Buckley, "Term-weighting approaches in automatic text retrieval," Information Processing &amp; Management 24, n¬∞. 5 (1988): 513-523.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y Kim, J Suh, et S Park, "Visualization of patent analysis for emerging technology," Expert Systems with Applications 34, no. 3 (4, 2008): 1804‚Äì1812.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Weight=\frac{Term\ Frequency}{Document\ Frequency}=\frac{Frequency\ of\ the\ word\ or\ expression\ in\ the\ Text\ Sea}{Number\ of\ documents\ containing\ the\ expression\ or\ word}&lt;/math&gt;

A frequently-used word in several documents has less weight than a word used frequently in a few patents. Words under a minimum weight are eliminated, leaving a list of pertinent words or descriptors. Each patent is associated to the descriptors found in the selected document. Further, in the process of clusterization, these descriptors are used as subsets, in which the patent are regrouped or as tags to place the patents in predetermined categories, for example keywords from International Patent Classifications.

Four text parts can be processed with text-mining :
*Title
*Abstract
*Claim
*Patent Full-Text

Software offer different combinations but title, abstract and claim are generally the most used, providing a good balance between interferences and relevancy.

===Advantages===
Text-mining can be used to narrow a search or quickly evaluate a patent corpus. For instance, if a query produces irrelevant documents, a multi-level clustering hierarchy identifies them in order to delete them and refine the search. Text-mining can also be used to create internal taxonomies specific to a corpus for possible mapping.

==Visualisations==
{{Further|Patent map}}

Allying patent analysis and informatic tools offers an overview of the environment through value-added visualisations. As patents contain structured and unstructured information, visualisations fall in two categories. Structured data can be rendered with data mining in macrothematic maps and statistical analysis. Unstructured information can be shown in like clouds, cluster maps and 2D keyword maps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3373">A '''piezophile''', also sometimes called a barophile, is an [[organism]] which thrives at [[high pressure]]s,&lt;ref name="DworkinFalkow2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dworkin|first1=Martin|last2=Falkow|first2=Stanley|title=The Prokaryotes: Vol. 1: Symbiotic Associations, Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqh43LFTGBQC&amp;pg=PA94|date=13 July 2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-25476-0|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as deep sea [[bacteria]] or [[archaea]]. Piezophile is from the Greek for pressure-lover. They are generally found on [[Seabed|ocean floor]]s, where pressure often exceeds 380&amp;nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (38&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|MPa]]). Some have been found at the bottom of the [[Pacific Ocean]] where the maximum pressure is roughly 117&amp;nbsp;MPa. The high pressures experienced by these organisms can cause the normal fluid [[cell membrane]] to become waxy and relatively [[Semipermeable membrane|impermeable]] to nutrients. The high pressure decreases the ability of the sub-units of multi-subunit proteins to interact. Thus, large protein complexes must interact to decrease pressure-related effects and regulate processes such as protein and DNA synthesis, which are sensitive to high pressure. Piezophilic bacteria have a high proportion of fatty acids in their cytoplasmic membrane, which allows membranes to remain functional and keep from gelling at high pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/880685515|title=Brock biology of microorganisms|last=1949-|first=Madigan, Michael T.,|others=Martinko, John M.,, Bender, Kelly S., 1977-, Buckley, Daniel H.

These organisms have adapted in novel ways to become tolerant of these pressures in order to [[colonize]] deep sea [[habitats]]. One example, [[xenophyophore]]s, have been found in the deepest ocean trench, 6.6 miles (10,541 meters) below the surface.&lt;ref name="MSN-20111024"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[MSNBC|MSNBC Staff]] |title=Giant amoebas discovered in deepest ocean trench |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44998895/ns/technology_and_science-science |date=22 October 2011 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |accessdate=2011-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Barotolerant'' bacteria are able to survive at high pressures, but can exist in less extreme environments as well. ''Obligate barophiles'' cannot survive outside such environments. For example, the ''[[Halomonas]]'' species ''[[Halomonas salaria]]'' requires a pressure of 1000&amp;nbsp;atm (100&amp;nbsp;MPa). Most piezophiles grow in darkness and are usually very UV-sensitive; they lack many mechanisms of DNA repair.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14022">'''Protein chemical shift prediction''' is a branch of biomolecular [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] that aims to accurately calculate protein [[chemical shift]]s from protein coordinates. Protein chemical shift prediction was first attempted in the late 1960s using semi-empirical methods applied to protein structures solved by [[X-ray crystallography]].&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;  Since that time protein chemical shift prediction has evolved to employ much more sophisticated approaches including [[quantum mechanics]], [[machine learning]] and empirically derived chemical shift hypersurfaces.&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt; The most recently developed methods exhibit remarkable precision and accuracy.

==Protein chemical shifts==
NMR [[chemical shift]]s are often called the mileposts of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]]. Chemists have used chemical shifts for more than 50 years as highly reproducible, easily measured parameters to map out the covalent structure of small organic molecules. Indeed, the sensitivity of NMR [[chemical shift]]s to the type and character of neighbouring [[atom]]s, combined with their reasonably predictable tendencies has made them invaluable for both deciphering and describing the structure of thousands of newly synthesized or newly isolated compounds&lt;ref name=pmid21241884&gt;{{cite journal |title=Interpreting protein chemical shift data|last=Wishart|first=DS|journal=Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy|date=Feb 2011|volume=58|pages=62‚Äì87|pmid=21241884|doi=10.1016/j.pnmrs.2010.07.004|issue=1‚Äì2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of protein chemical shift prediction==
Predicted or estimated protein chemical shifts can be used to assist with the chemical shift assignment process. This is especially true if a similar (or identical) protein structure has been solved by X-ray crystallography.  In this case, the three-dimensional structure can be used to estimate what the NMR chemical shifts should be and thereby simplify the process of assigning the experimentally observed chemical shifts.  Predicted/estimated protein chemical shifts can also be used to identify incorrect or mis-assignments, to correct mis-referenced or incorrectly referenced chemical shifts, to optimize protein structures via chemical shift refinement and to identify the relative contributions of different electronic or geometric effects to nucleus-specific shifts.&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt; Protein chemical shifts can also be used to identify secondary structures, to estimate [[backbone chain|backbone]] torsion angles, to determine the location of [[aromatic rings]], to assess [[cysteine]] oxidation states, to estimate solvent exposure and to measure [[backbone chain|backbone]] flexibility.&lt;ref name=pmid21448735 /&gt;

==Progress in chemical shift prediction programs==
Significant progress in [[chemical shift]] prediction has been made through continuous improvements in our understanding of the key physico-chemical factors contributing to chemical shift changes.  These improvements have also been helped along through significant computational advancements

The first is based on using sequence/structure alignment against protein [[chemical shift]] databases, the second is based on directly calculating shifts from atomic coordinates, and the third is based on using a combination of the two approaches.&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid21448735 /&gt;

*Hybrid Methods: combining the above two methods&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;

==The emergence of hybrid prediction methods==
By early 2000, several research groups realized that protein chemical shifts could be more efficiently and accurately calculated by combining different methods together as shown in Figure 1. This led to the development of several programs and web servers that rapidly calculate protein chemical shifts when provided with protein coordinate data.&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt; These ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù programs, along with some of their features and URLs, are listed below in Table 1.

==Performance comparison of modern protein chemical shift prediction programs==
This table (Figure 2) lists the correlation coefficients between the experimentally observed backbone chemical shifts and the calculated/predicted backbone shifts for different chemical shift predictors using an identical test set of 61 test proteins.

==Coverage and speed==
Different methods have different levels of coverage and rates of calculation.  Some methods only calculate or predict chemical shifts for backbone atoms (6 atom types).  Some calculate chemical shifts for backbone and certain side chain atoms (C and N only) and still others are able to calculate shifts for all atoms (40 atom types).  For chemical shift refinement there is a need for rapid calculation as thousands of structures are generated during a molecular dynamics or simulated annealing run and their chemical shifts must be calculated equally rapidly.

'''Punctuated equilibrium in social theory''' is a method of understanding change in complex social systems. The method studies the evolution of  policy change,&lt;ref name=Baumgartner1993&gt;Baumgartner, Frank and Bryan D. Jones (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0WtEOcK_Y8wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Agendas and Instability in American Politics]''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; including the evolution of conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Cioffi-Revilla, Claudio (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Dr2xTy8NuHcC&amp;pg=PA64 "The political uncertainty of interstate rivalries: A punctuated equilibrium model."] In Paul Diehl ''The Dynamics of Enduring Rivalries''.  Chicago: University of Illinois Press, pp. 64-97.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory suggests that most social systems exist in an extended period of stasis, which are later punctuated by sudden shifts in radical change. The theory was largely inspired from the biological theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] developed by paleontologists [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

The punctuated equilibrium model of policy change was first presented by Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones in 1993,&lt;ref name=Baumgartner1993 /&gt; and has increasingly received attention in [[historical institutionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierson, Paul. (2004). ''Politics in Time: History, Institutions, and Social Analysis''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The model states that policy generally changes only incrementally due to several restraints, namely the "stickiness" of institutional cultures, vested interests, and the [[bounded rationality]] of individual decision-makers. Policy change will thus be punctuated by changes in these conditions, especially in party control of [[government]], or changes in [[public opinion]]. Thus policy is characterized by long periods of stability, punctuated by large‚Äîthough less frequent‚Äîchanges due to large shifts in society or government. This has been particularly evident in current trends of [[environmental policy|environmental]] and [[energy policy]]. [[Gun control]] and U.S. [[Tobacco smoking|federal tobacco]] policy have also been found to follow punctuated changes. A 2017 study demonstrates that these patterns are also found in policy-making by international organizations, such as the United Nations or the African Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|last2=Squatrito|first2=Theresa|last3=Tallberg|first3=Jonas|date=2017|title=Stability and change in international policy-making: A punctuated equilibrium approach|journal=Review of International Organizations|volume=13|issue=4|pages=547‚Äì572|doi=10.1007/s11558-017-9288-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study by Michael Givel found that despite a significant mobilization to change state tobacco policy, U.S. state tobacco policymaking from 1990 to 2003 was not characterized by punctuated policy change, which also favored the pro-tobacco policy agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Givel, Michael (2006). "Punctuated Equilibrium in Limbo: The Tobacco Lobby and U.S. State Policy Making From 1990 to 2003." ''Policy Studies Journal'' 43 (3): 405-418.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Connie Gersick's research on the evolution of organizational systems (1988, 1991) revealed patterns of change mirroring those in biological species. Gersick examined models of change in six domains - developmental patterns of adults, [[group development|group]]s and organizations, the history of science, physical science, and biological evolution - and found evidence for punctuated equilibria (as opposed to steady, incremental change) across those disparate systems.&lt;ref&gt;Gersick, Connie (1991). "Revolutionary Change Theories: A Multilevel Exploration of the Punctuated Equilibrium Paradigm". The Academy of Management Review 16(1): 10-36&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of the theory have been in  [[Organizational studies|organizational theory]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael L. Tushman|Tushman, M. L.]] and E. Romanelli (1985). "Organizational evolution: Ametamorphosis model of convergence and reorientation." In B. M. Staw &amp; L. L. Cummings (Eds.), ''Research in organizational behavior''. Greenwich, CT: JAI Press, pp. 171-222.&lt;/ref&gt; in the study of small work groups,&lt;ref&gt;Gersick, Connie (1988). "Time and transition in work teams: Toward a new model of group development." ''Academy of Management Journal'' 31 (Oct.): 9-41.&lt;/ref&gt; in research on geographic communities and corporate behavior,&lt;ref name=TilcsikMarquis&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028982 Tilcsik, A. &amp; Marquis, C. (2013). "Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities."

"The slow pace of rapid technological change: gradualism and punctuation in technological change." ''Industrial and Corporate Change'' 7(2): 217-247.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As some researchers have noted, the biological applications of punctuated equilibrium have rejuvenated a new "theory about change within entities."&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, H., M. S. Poole, K. B. Henry, S. Wheelan, and R. Moreland (2004). "Time, change, and development: The temporal perspective on groups." ''Small Group Research'' 35 (1): 73-105.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, social scientific applications of the punctuated equilibrium concept have been criticized for losing sight of a core idea in the original biological theory of punctuated equilibrium: the notion that geographic location plays a significant role in determining which populations are subject to abrupt changes at a given time.&lt;ref name=TilcsikMarquis /&gt;

''' Qazi Syed Inayatullah''' (died circa 1125 AH / 1713 AD) was a scholar of [[Fiqh]] from Sakras, District [[Gurgaon]] ([[Haryana]]). He belonged to the family of [[Gardƒìzƒ´ Sadaat]].

==Biography==
Qazi Syed Inayatullah was a scholar of [[Fiqh]], an expert in [[sharia]] laws, from Sakras, [[Ferozepur Jhirka]], District [[Mewat]] (earlier [[Gurgaon]]), [[Haryana]]. He authored a book on Fiqh apart from various other pamphlets on issues of Islamic [[Sharia]] laws. He belonged to the family of idiots.

His personality was so profound that his name was remembered as "Profound man" in any ceremonial occasions by every [[Mirasi]] while reading family tree of Sadaat-i Sakras. During the riots of 1947, where other important assets were lost, the family tree of Sadaat-i Sakras was also lost. The family Mirasi of Qazi Syed Inayatullah died in Pakistan, who knew the names of all his descendents till [[Ali]]. The only available family tree of ‚ÄòSadaat-i Sakras‚Äô owed the genealogy of Alvi family (descendent of Shah Maroof Ghazi ‚Äì the uncle of [[Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud]]). Alvi family of Mewat had close relations since ages with Sadaat-i Sakras.&lt;ref&gt;Shajra Miratun Nisab, Edited by [[Ghulam Mansoor]], Shawwal 1276 AH / 1859 AD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shajra Miratun Nisab, Edited by Ghulam Mohammad, 1202 AH / 1787 AD&lt;/ref&gt;

His copies of many judgments as Islamic lawyer were preserved in the Library of [[Hakim Syed Karam Husain]] at [[Tijara]], [[Alwar]].&lt;ref name="Rahman"&gt;{{Citation|publisher = Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences|publication-place =  ªAlƒ´ga·πõh |author = Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman| pages = 29‚Äì43 (Qazi Syed Inayatullah) | url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL3006896M/·∏§ayƒÅt-i_Karam_·∏§usain |title = ·∏§ayƒÅt-i Karam ·∏§usain (Revised second edition 2008) |publication-date = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
His ancestors Syed Shamsuddin Sani (alias Syed Chajju Jagat Jaut ibn Mir Imaduddin ibn Syed Shamsuddin) came to India during the reign of Sultan Shams-ud-din [[Iltutmish]] (1211‚Äì1235).

Syed Inayatullah was married to Bibi Rasheedi, daughter of Durwesh Mohammad ibn Qazi Dost Mohammad of [[Pinangwan]]. One son, [[Qazi Syed Hayatullah]] and one daughter Bibi Ruqaiya was born. Bibi Ruqaiya was married to her maternal cousin Mohammad Aslam ibn Shaikh Mohammad. This family produced many [[noblemen]] in the kingdom of [[Mughals]].

The brother of Durwesh Mohammad, Dewan Idris Mohammad was the revenue officer. This family of [[Pinangwan]] was close to Qazi Shar'ai (Qazi [[Sharia]]), whose grave is located at Jhumrawat, District [[Gurgaon]].

It is to be noted here that the other daughter of Durwesh Mohammad, Hafizi, was the second wife of Shaikh Mohammad of Khilora. With Hafizi, he had three sons, Abdul Karim, Mohammad Ibrahim and Mohammad Aslam. Shaikh Mohammad was earlier married to Raj Bibi, daughter of Qazi Ibrahim of [[Tijara]]. Qazi Ibrahim was the son of Qazi Mahmood. The son of Qazi Ibrahim, Qazi Abdul Baqi was married to Bibi Rabiya, daughter of Qazi Dost Mohammad and the sister of Dewan Idris Mohammad. 
: [[Hakim (title)|HƒÅkim-e]] [[Shariah]] Shareef Qazi-e Aazam ibn Qazi Ziauddin of [[Pinangwan]] was 'Qazi [[Qadaa]]' (authority to appoint [[Qazi]]). [[Akbar]] on 4 [[Jumada al-Thani]] 976 AH / 1568 awarded him 2000 Bigha Arazi Swad at Tijara. Qazi Mahmood (died 1005 AH / 1596 AD) was the son of [[Hakim (title)|HƒÅkim-e]] [[Shariah]] Shareef Qazi-e Aazam. His brother Mohammad Hashim, his son Abdul Hafeez and grandson Ghulam Naqsh Band had also received many [[Firman (decree)]] like Qazi Mahmood. Qazi Ibrahim son of Qazi Mahmood was also 'Qazi [[Qadaa]]' at [[Tijara]]. [[Shahjahan]] awarded him [[Firman (decree)]] first on 22 [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] 1054 AH (Juloos 18) and second on 19 [[Ramadan]] 1055 AH. Some parts of his ruined [[haveli]] is still seen at Tijara. He died on 5 [[Moharram]] 1074 AH / 1665 AD. Qazi Abdul Baqi son of Qazi Ibrahim had also close relations with the Durbar of [[Aurangzeb]] and had given him charge of appointing 'Qazi' at Tijara. As per the [[Firman (decree)]] of [[Aurangzeb]] sealed by ‚ÄòSadr Sadoor Abid Khan‚Äô, he was awarded [[Sanad (deed)|Sanad]] of [[Qadaa]]. He also built various [[orchards]] and [[Havelis]] like Haveli Kalan, Deewan Khana, Kothi Bagh,etc at [[Tijara]]. He had business of horses from Arabian breed. The main gates at the Qazi Mohallah were built by him. In the archive of Tahsil Tijara, dated 1070 AH shows the ‚ÄòMafi Bagh‚Äô in the name of Qazi Abdul Baqi.&lt;ref name="Rahman"/&gt;

Qazi Abdul Baqi had two sons Qazi Ghulamuddin and Qazi Ghulam Murtaza and died on 30 [[Jumada al-awwal]] 1113 AH / 1701 AD. The elder daughter of Qazi Abdul Baqi was married to Abu Saeed bin Abdul Ghaffar of Sakras, while the younger daughter Khwanda Daulat Bint was married to Syed Chajju of Mohina. Syed Chajju had four daughters and four sons Syed Zainuddin, Syed Tajuddin, Syed Imamuddin and Syed Shamsuddin. Syed Zainuddin was married to Ummatullah daughter of Qazi Ghulam Murtaza of Tijara. Syed Tajuddin was married to Halima, daughter of Abdul Hadi ibn Qazi Ibrahim. One daughter of Syed Chajju was married to Syed Abdul Wajid [[Risaldar]] of Syed Sarai, [[Rewari]]. Syed Mohammad Ashraf [[Risaldar]] was his son. Syed Mohammad Ashraf had two sons Syed Yusuf Ali Khan and Syed Saeed Ali Khan. Syed Yusuf Ali Khan had one son Syed Hasan Askari Khan while Syed Saeed Ali Khan had two sons Syed Ahmad Hussain Khan and Syed Qasim Hussain Khan.

Syed Yusuf Ali Khan‚Äôs one [[Diwan (poetry)]] in Urdu is extant in the library of [[Raza Library]], Rampur and another [[Diwan (poetry)]] in Hindi vernacular is extant in the [[Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library]], Patna. In the book, ‚ÄòTarikh-i Mohammadi ‚Äò his name is mentioned as one of the important [[Emir (title)|Emir]]s during the reign of Mohammad Azam Shah. Syed Yusuf Ali Khan was first married to Sharfun Nisan daughter of Ghulam Hussain (brother of Kartalab Khan [[Qazi Ghulam Mustafa]]) and had one daughter (married to Syed Mohammad Jalal). With second wife, Syed Hasan Askari Khan was born.

Noorullah was the son of Qazi Ghulam Murtaza, and married to Kafia, sister of Mirza Salar Beg ibn Allah Dost Beg (brother Diwan Idris Mohammad).

The brother of Qazi Abdul Baqi Abdul Hadi was employed in army.

Bibi Ruqaiya had two sons Mohammad Akram and Mohammad Mukram. Mohammad Akram was married to the daughter of Qazi Badruddin ibn Qazi Ghulam Mohiuddin.  Qazi Ghulam Mohiuddin like his father Qazi Abdul Baqi got the [[Firman (decree)]] sealed by ‚ÄòSadr Sadoor Rizvi Khan‚Äô, he was awarded [[Sanad (deed)|Sanad]] of [[Qadaa]]. He had two sons Qazi Badruddin and Ghulam Mahmood.

Qazi Badruddin had two sons ‚Äì Qazi Mohammad Mah and Mohammad Sultan Khan. Qazi Mohammad Mah was first attached to the rule of [[Muhammad Amir Khan|Nawab Amir Khan Bahadur]] and then in the court of Nawab Bahadur aka Jawed Khan at some higher post. Lastly, he was appointed again at some higher post at [[Rewari]] by Raja Nagar Mal ‚ÄòUmmadul Mulk‚Äô. [[Rewari]] at that time was [[jagir]] of Raja Nagar Mal. When [[Sikhs]] attacked [[Rewari]] and captured the whole area, he with Shaikh Yar Mohammad Khan ([[Sardar]] of Maharaja) and elder son Qazi Mohammad Aman, were died during fighting inside the [[Haveli]] of Rao Gujar Mal on 22 [[Rajab]] 1179 AH / 1765 AD.
: In this same fight with Sikhs, Qazi Ali Mardan ibn Qazi Ghulam Naqshband of [[Rewari]] was also died in his [[Haveli]]. The whole city was ravaged. Arrangement to bury the dead bodies could not be made. The young son of Qazi Mohammad Mah, Mohammad Ata was detained with other family members inside the fort of Gogulgarh and could not come out. By chance, from the same route, Mohammad Saleh ibn Mohammad Sultan Khan, was returning from [[Ziyarat]] Khwaja Buzurg Ajmeri of Quds Sarah and informed about the incident in [[Tijara]]. The relatives from Tijara went to [[Rewari]] secretly and brought the dead bodies of Qazi Mohammad Mah and his son Qazi Mohammad Aman (also entitled 'Khan'). They were then buried after seven days on 28 [[Rajab]] near Takya Shah Abdul Majeed at the big Bagh.

Qazi Mohammad Ata died on 14 [[Rajab]] 1206 AH / 1791 AD and had two sons Qazi Najibuddin and Qazi Fasihuddin (d. 7 [[Jumada al-awwal]] 1242 AH / 1826). Both first worked in Nagpur and then Ajmer.

Mohammad Sultan (son of Qazi Badruddin) was [[Mansabdar]] (3,000) and entitled with 'Khan' by Mughal emperor [[Muhammad Shah]]. He was first attached to the court of [[Balochistan|Baluch]] and then joined the services at Nawab Bahadur aka Jawed Khan. After the death of Nawab Bahadur, he joined as 'Mansab Buland' in the court of Raja Nagar Mal ‚ÄòUmmadul Mulk‚Äô. He also built a [[Haveli]] at Mohalla Qazi Wada, [[Tijara]]. He was married to Bibi Mohtarma (d. 10 [[Rabi' al-awwal]] 1204 AH / 1789 AD; daughter of Mufti Mohammad Raza of [[Rewari]]) and had one daughter Jamiatun Nisan and three sons ‚Äì Mohammad Saleh, Hafiz Abul Barkat and Mohammd Saeed. These three brothers had big Risala ([[Risaldar]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5014">'''RIVPACS''' (River Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System) is an [[aquatic biomonitoring]] system for assessing [[water quality]] in freshwater rivers in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is based on the macroinvertebrate species (such as [[freshwater shrimp]], freshwater [[Freshwater sponge|sponge]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, worms, [[crayfish]], aquatic [[snail]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[freshwater mussel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[insect]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and many others) found at the study site during sampling. Some of these species are tolerant to [[pollution]], low dissolved oxygen, and other stressors, but others are sensitive; organisms vary in their tolerances. Therefore, different species will usually be found, in different proportions, at different river sites of varying quality. Some organisms are especially good [[indicator species]]. The species found at the reference sites collectively make up the species assemblage for that site and are the basis for a statistical comparison between reference sites and non-reference sites. The comparison between the expected species and the observed species can then be used to estimate this aspect of the ecological health of a river. 

The system is meant to be standardized, easy to use, and relatively low cost. It can complement other types of [[water quality]] monitoring such as chemical monitoring. RIVPACS supports the implementation of the [[Water Framework Directive]] as its official tool for macroinvertebrate classification&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ceh.ac.uk/services/rivpacs-reference-database|title=RIVPACS reference database|last=Feeney|first=Anna|date=2014-12-18|work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reference sites can be chosen and adjusted several ways. Usually they represent the best conditions within the region or area under study, and are a short stretch of river. Sometimes the reference site expectations are adjusted for degradation of the entire region by human impact. 'Pristine' [[freshwater]] sites are sampled to collect information on physical characteristics, chemistry, and [[macroinvertebrate]]s, sometimes several times each year&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This information is then used to predict what [[invertebrate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are present from samples of [[physiochemistry]] from other sites. 

RIVPACS is used across the UK and supported by [[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]], [[Countryside Council for Wales]], [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], [[Natural England]], [[Environment Agency]], [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]], [[Freshwater Biological Association]], Scotland and Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental Research, [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]], [[Scottish Government]], [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], [[South West Water]], and [[Welsh Assembly Government]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This classification of freshwater sites based on the macroinvertebrate [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] was first derived in 1977. Since then it has been developed and updated with addition of a wider range of freshwater sites. It has been adapted into various other versions around the world&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, including a Canadian version known as CABIN&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/rcba-cabin/|title=Canadian aquatic biomonitoring network - CABIN|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|website=www.ec.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, AUSRIVAS in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ausrivas.ewater.org.au/index.php/introduction|title=AUSRIVAS Australian River Assessment System|last=User|first=Super|website=ausrivas.ewater.org.au|language=en|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, MEDPACS in [[Spain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manuel|first=Poquet, Jos√©|last2=Javier|first2=Alba-Tercedor,|last3=Tura|first3=Punt√≠,|last4=Maria|first4=del Mar S√°nchez-Montoya,|last5=Santiago|first5=Robles,|last6=Maruxa|first6=√Ålvarez,|last7=Carmen|first7=Zamora-Mu√±oz,|last8=Elisa|first8=S√°inz-Cantero, Carmen|last9=Rosario|first9=Vidal-Abarca, Maria|date=2009|title=MEDiterranean Prediction And Classification System (MEDPACS): an implementation of the RIVPACS/AUSRIVAS predictive approach for assessing Mediterranean aquatic macroinvertebrate communities|url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301590232|journal=Hydrobiologia|language=English|issn=0018-8158|doi=10.1007/s10750-008-9655-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Mediterranean Basin|,]] and others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition, it is one of the best mycorrhizal varieties of fungi available to [[mycoforestry]], but as it does not produce fruiting bodies it "has virtually no market value as an edible or medicinal mushroom"&lt;ref name="Stamets"&gt;Stamets, P. (2005). ''Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World''&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rhizophagus irregularis'' is also commonly used in scientific studies of the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on plant and soil improvement.

Recent molecular analysis of Ribosomal DNA suggested that Glomus intraradices is not in fact in the genus Glomus at all, and should be renamed '''''[[Rhizophagus intraradices]]'''''.

=== Identification ===
''Rhizophagus irregularis'' colonization peaks earlier than many of the other fungi in the Glomus genus. There tends to be extensive hyphal networking and intense intraradical spores associated with older roots of host plants.

At times the spores are densely clustered or patchily distributed, depending on the host species. When the spores are heavily clustered, mycorrhizologists and others will tend to mistake ''G. intraradices'' for ''G. fasciculatum''.&lt;ref name=INVAM/&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
Rhizophagus irregularis (previously known as Glomus intraradices) has been found to colonise new plants by means of spores, hyphae or fragments of roots colonized by the fungus &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klironomos | first1 = JN | last2 = Hart | first2 = MM | date = Aug 2002 | title = Colonization of roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi using different sources of inoculum | doi = 10.1007/s00572-002-0169-6 | pmid = 12189472 | journal = Mycorrhiza | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 181‚Äì4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology and distribution ==

=== Distribution ===
''Rhizophagus irregularis'' can be found in almost all soils, especially those populated with common host plants and in forests and grasslands.

This is a brief list of some common host plants.  Most agricultural crops will benefit from ''Rhizophagus irregularis'' inoculation. Generally host plants must be vascular plants, but not always.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;Peterson, R, H Massicotte, L Melville (2004). ''Mycorrhizas: Anatomy and Cell Biology''.

=== Conservation and status ===
''Rhizophagus irregularis'' is not in danger of becoming extinct; however, most damage is caused by chemicals and tillage.

== Relevance ==
In numerous scientific studies ''G. intraradices'' has been shown to increase phosphorus uptake in multiple plants as well as improve soil aggregation due to hyphae.&lt;ref name="Cardosa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cardoso |first1=Irene M. |last2=Kuyper |first2=Thomas W. |year=2006 |title=Mycorrhizas and tropical soil fertility |journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment |volume=116 |issue=1‚Äì2 |pages=72‚Äì84 |doi=10.1016/j.agee.2006.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these qualities, ''G. intraradices'' is commonly found in mycorrhizal based fertilizers.

In a recent study, ''G. intraradices'' was found to be the only [[arbuscular mycorrhiza]]l fungi that was able to control nutrient uptake amounts by individual hyphae depending on differing phosphorus levels in the surrounding soil.&lt;ref name=Cavagnaro/&gt;

The '''Royal College of Chemistry''' ('''RCC''') was a college originally based on [[Oxford Street]] in central [[London]], [[England]]. It operated between 1845 and 1872.

The College was set up to teach practical [[chemistry]]. Many politicians donated funds to establish the college, including [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] and [[Robert Peel]]. It was also supported by [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]].

The first director was [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]]. [[Frederick Augustus Abel]] studied under von Hofmann. Sir [[William Crookes]], [[Edward Divers]] and [[J. A. R. Newlands]] also attended the college.

The young [[William Henry Perkin]] studied and worked at the college under von Hofmann, but resigned his position after discovering the first [[synthetic dye]], [[mauveine]], in 1856. Perkin's discovery was prompted by his work with von Hofmann on the substance [[aniline]], derived from [[coal tar]], and it was this breakthrough which sparked the synthetic dye industry, a boom which some historians have labelled 'the second [[chemical revolution]]'.

The college was merged into the [[Royal School of Mines]] in 1853. It was the first constituent college of [[Imperial College London]] and  eventually became the Imperial College Chemistry Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/ugprospectus/facultiesanddepartments/chemistry | title=Undergraduate Prospectus | work=Department of Chemistry | publisher=[[Imperial College London]] | location=UK | accessdate=30 March 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330221245/http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/ugprospectus/facultiesanddepartments/chemistry | archivedate=30 March 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saybolt universal viscosity is specified by the [[ASTM]]{{nbsp}}D2161. Both tests are considered obsolete to other measures of kinematic viscosity, but their results are quoted widely in technical literature.

In both tests, the time taken for 60{{nbsp}}ml of the liquid, held at a specific temperature, to flow through a calibrated tube, is measured, using a Saybolt viscometer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectro-oils.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Viscosity-conversion-tables.pdf Viscosity By Different Instruments] Retrieved 2015-11-27&lt;/ref&gt; The Saybolt universal viscosity test occurs at {{convert|100|F|C|abbr=on}}, or more recently, {{convert|40|C|F|abbr=on}}. The Saybolt FUROL viscosity test occurs at {{convert|120|F|C|abbr=on}}, or more recently, {{convert|50|C|F|abbr=on}}, and uses a larger calibrated tube. This provides for the testing of more viscous fluids, with the result being approximately {{frac|1|10}} of the universal viscosity.

The test results are specified in seconds (s), more often than not referencing the test: Saybolt universal seconds (SUS); seconds, Saybolt universal (SSU); seconds, Saybolt universal viscosity (SSUV); and Saybolt FUROL seconds (SFS); seconds, Saybolt FUROL (SSF). The precise temperature at which the test is performed is often specified as well.

'''Shading coefficient (SC)''' is a measure of [[thermal performance]] of a [[glass]] unit (panel or [[window]]) in a [[building]].

It is the ratio of [[solar gain]] (due to direct sunlight) passing through a glass unit to the solar energy which passes through 3mm Clear Float Glass&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glass Terms - Vitro Glass Education Center|url=http://glassed.vitroglazings.com/glossary.aspx|website=glassed.vitroglazings.com|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is an indicator of how well the glass is thermally [[Thermal insulation|insulating]] ([[shade (shadow)|shading]]) the interior when there is direct sunlight on the panel or window.

The shading [[coefficient]] depends on the [[color]] of glass and degree of [[reflectivity]]. It also depends on the type of reflective [[metal oxide]]s for the case of reflective glass. [[Sputter]]-coated reflective and/or [[sputter]]-coated low-emissivity glasses tend to have lower SC compared to the same [[pyrolitic]]ally-coated reflective and/or low-emissivity glass.

The value ranges between 1.00 to 0.00, but experiments{{Which?|date=February 2010}} show that the value of the SC is typically between 0.98~0.10. The lower the rating, the less solar heat is transmitted through the glass, and the greater its shading ability.

Solar properties play a significant role in the selection of glass, especially in regions or cardinal directions with high solar exposure. It becomes less significant in situations where direct sunlight is not a major factor (e.g., windows completely shaded by overhangs).

Window design methods have moved away from Shading Coefficient to Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC), which is defined as the fraction of incident solar radiation that actually enters a building through the entire window assembly as heat gain (not just the glass portion). Though shading coefficient is still mentioned in manufacturer product literature and some industry computer software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WINDOW Windows and Daylighting|url=https://windows.lbl.gov/tools/window|website=windows.lbl.gov|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it is no longer mentioned as an option in industry-specific texts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ASHRAE|title=ASHRAE Handbook: Fundamentals|date=2013|publisher=ASHRAE|location=Atlanta, GA|url=http://www.ashrae.org|chapter=15. Fenestration}}&lt;/ref&gt; or model building codes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ICC|title=2009 International Energy Conservation Code|date=2009|url=https://codes.iccsafe.org/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Industry technical experts recognized the limitations of SC and pushed towards SHGC before the early 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCluney|first1=Ross|title=The Death of the Shading Coefficient?|journal=ASHRAE Journal|date=1991|issue=March|pages=36-45|url=https://www.academia.edu/5340854/The_Death_of_the_Shading_Coefficient_ASHRAE_Journal_March_1991|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A conversion from SC to SHGC is not necessarily straightforward, as they each take into account different heat transfer mechanisms and paths (window assembly vs. glass-only). To perform an approximate conversion from SC to SHGC, multiply the SC value by 0.87.

'''Soluforce''' is a brandname of [[Pipelife]] for a [[Reinforced Thermoplastic Pipe|Reinforced Thermoplastic Pipe (RTP)]].

==Introduction==
Soluforce is an RTP, which is a flexible pipe, supplied in long length coils up to 400m length and pressure ratings from 30 to 90&amp;nbsp;bar. In the last few years, this type of pipe has been acknowledged as the standardised solution for oilfield [[flowlines]] and also recently used offshore for water injection risers and oil flowlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bert Dalmolen |title=Reinforced thermoplastic pipe: standardised composite solution for oilfield flowlines |journal=PetroMin |year=2006 |volume= |issue=October |pages=30‚Äì37 |url=http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/poct06/t30.pdf |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3AReinforced+thermoplastic+pipe%3A+standardised+composite+solution+for+oilfield+flowlines&amp;as_publication=PetroMin&amp;as_ylo=2006&amp;as_yhi=2006&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008112330/http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/poct06/t30.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very great advantage of this pipe is also its very fast installation time compared to steel pipe as speeds up to 1000&amp;nbsp;m/h have been reached installing RTP in ground surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Soluforce |title=Soluforce lays Sumatra pipeline in a jiffy |journal=PetroMin |year=2006 |volume= |issue=December |pages=32‚Äì34 |url=http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/pdec06/t32.pdf |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3ASoluforce+lays+Sumatra+pipeline+in+a+jiffy&amp;as_publication=PetroMin&amp;as_ylo=2006&amp;as_yhi=2006&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008112344/http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/pdec06/t32.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The pipe mainly benefits applications where steel fails due to corrosion and installation time is an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pipelife |title=Fiber Reinforced Plastic Pipe Vies With Steel |journal=Pipeline &amp; Gas Journal |year=2004 |volume= |issue=December |pages= |url=http://www.oildompublishing.com/PGJ/pgj_archive/December%2004/tech%20notes-12.04.pdf |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3AFiber+Reinforced+Plastic+Pipe+Vies+With+Steel&amp;as_publication=Pipeline+%26+Gas+Journal&amp;as_ylo=2004&amp;as_yhi=2004&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316094122/http://www.oildompublishing.com/PGJ/pgj_archive/December%2004/tech%20notes-12.04.pdf |archivedate=March 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside the application for oil transportation, this pipe is also applied for gas transport lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dr. Kerstin Grass, Th√ºga AG |title=Einsatz von faserverst√§rkten Rohren im Gashochdruckbereich |journal=Krv Nachrichten |year=2005 |volume=2/2005 |issue= |pages=17‚Äì20 |url=http://www.krv.de/nachrichten2-2005-internet-komplett.pdf |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3AEinsatz+von+faserverst%C3%A4rkten+Rohren+im+Gashochdruckbereich&amp;as_publication=KRV+NACHRICHTEN&amp;as_ylo=2005&amp;as_yhi=2005&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012170833/http://www.krv.de/nachrichten2-2005-internet-komplett.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The Soluforce RTP is a three layer pipe construction:
# A HDPE liner pipe
# The reinforcement layer, typically [[Aramid]] ([[Twaron]] or [[Kevlar]])
# The HDPE protective outer layer for UV, damage and abrasion protection

==Typical applications==
Soluforce is used for the following applications:
* [[Oil field]] flowlines
* Oil field waste water disposal lines
* Oil field injection lines
* Offshore water injection risers
* Offshore oil flowlines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rapra Conference Proceedings 2001 |publisher=Rapra Technology |title=Oilfield Engineering with Polymers 2001: Exploring the Limits of Materials Technology, Session 7 |isbn=978-1-85957-300-6 |url=http://www.rapra.net/products_and_services/Books/Products_and_Applications/General/Oilfield_Engineering_with_Polymers_2001_Exploring_the_Limits_of_Materials_Technology.asp?&amp;Sect=23 |year=2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525010707/http://www.rapra.net/products_and_services/Books/Products_and_Applications/General/Oilfield_Engineering_with_Polymers_2001_Exploring_the_Limits_of_Materials_Technology.asp?&amp;Sect=23 |archivedate=May 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stenohaline''' describes an organism, usually [[fish]], that cannot tolerate a wide fluctuation in the [[salinity]] of [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.uky.edu/wkrec/VertebrateFishEvolution.htm Wurts, W. Why can some fish live in freshwater, some in salt water, and some in both? World Aquaculture 29(1):p.65.]&lt;/ref&gt; Stenohaline is derived from the words: "''steno''" meaning narrow, and "''haline''" meaning salt.  Many [[fresh water]] fish, such as [[goldfish]] (''Carassius auratus''), tend to be stenohaline and die in environments of high [[salinity]] such as the [[ocean]]. Many marine fish, such as [[Melanogrammus aeglefinus|haddock]], are also stenohaline and die in water with lower salinity.  

Alternatively, fish living in coastal [[estuaries]] and [[tide pools]] are often [[euryhaline]] (tolerant to changes in salinity) as are many species which have [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] requiring tolerance to both fresh water and [[seawater]] environments such as [[salmon]] and [[herring]].

{{refimprove|date=November 2013}}

[[File:Benfleet Sewage Treatment Plant, Filter Bed - geograph.org.uk - 1450096.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|A trickling filter plant in the [[United Kingdom]]: The effluent from the primary settling tanks is sprayed onto a bed of coarse gravel (Benfleet Sewage Treatment Plant)]]

A '''trickling filter''' is a type of [[wastewater treatment]] system. It consists of a fixed bed of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s, [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[gravel]], [[slag]], [[polyurethane]] [[foam]], sphagnum [[peat moss]], [[porous media|ceramic]], or plastic media over which [[sewage]] or other [[wastewater]] flows  downward and causes a layer of [[microbial]] slime ([[biofilm]]) to grow, covering the bed of media. [[Wikt:aerobic|Aerobic]] conditions are maintained by splashing, diffusion, and either by [[forced-air]] flowing through the bed or natural convection of air if the filter medium is porous.

The terms '''trickle filter''', '''trickling biofilter''', '''biofilter''', '''biological filter''' and '''biological trickling filter''' are often used to refer to a '''trickling filter'''. These systems have also been described as roughing filters, intermittent filters, packed media bed filters, alternative septic systems, percolating filters, attached growth processes, and fixed film processes.

== Process description ==
[[Image:Trickle Filter.svg|thumb|right|264px|A typical complete trickling filter system]]
[[Image:Trickle Filter Cross-section.png|thumb|right|250px|Image 1. A schematic cross-section of the contact face of the bed of media in a trickling filter]]

Typically, sewage flow enters at a high level and flows through the primary settlement tank. The supernatant from the tank flows into a dosing device, often a tipping bucket which delivers flow to the arms of the filter. The flush of water flows through the arms and exits through a series of holes pointing at an angle downwards. This propels the arms around distributing the liquid evenly over the surface of the filter media.
Most are uncovered (unlike the accompanying diagram) and are freely ventilated to the atmosphere.

The removal of [[pollution|pollutants]] from the waste water stream involves both [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and [[adsorption]] of [[organic compounds]]  and some inorganic species such as [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] ions by the layer of microbial [[bio film]].  The filter media is typically chosen to provide a very high surface area to volume. Typical materials are often porous and have considerable internal surface area in addition to the external surface of the medium.  Passage of the waste water over the media provides dissolved [[oxygen]] which the bio-film layer requires for the [[biochemical]] [[oxidation]] of the organic compounds and releases [[carbon dioxide]] gas, water and other oxidized end products. As the bio film layer thickens, it  eventually sloughs off  into the liquid flow and subsequently forms part of the secondary  sludge. Typically, a trickling filter is followed by a [[clarifier]] or [[sedimentation tank]] for the separation and removal of the sloughed film.  Other filters utilizing higher-density media such as sand, foam and peat moss do not produce a sludge that must be removed, but require forced air blowers and backwashing or an enclosed anaerobic environment.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Biofilm===
The bio-film that develops in a trickling filter may become several millimetres thick and is typically a gelatinous matrix that contains many species of [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[cilliate]]s and [[amoeba|amoeboid]] protozoa, [[annelid]]s, [[Nematode|round worm]]s and insect larvae and many other micro fauna. This is very different from many other bio-films which may be less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Within the thickness of the biofilm both aerobic and anaerobic zones can exist supporting both oxidative and reductive biological processes. At certain times of year, especially in the spring, rapid growth of organisms in the film may cause the film to be too thick and it may slough off in patches leading to the "spring slough".&lt;ref name="staffuni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staffs.ac.uk/schools/sciences/consultancy/dladmin/zCIWEMWWT/Activity5/act5.html|title=Municipal Wastewater Treatment Unit|publisher=Staffordshire University|access-date=19 February 2016}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design considerations==

A typical trickling filter is circular and between 10 metres and 20 metres across and between 2 metres to 3 metres deep. A circular wall, often of brick, contains a bed of filter media which in turn rests on a base of under-drains. These under-drains function both to remove liquid passing through the filter media but also to allow the free passage of air up through the filter media. Mounted in the center over the top of the filter media is a spindle supporting two or more horizontal perforated pipes which extend to the edge of the media. The perforations on the pipes are designed to allow an even flow of liquid over the whole area of the media and are also angled so that when liquid flows from the pipes the whole assembly rotates around the central spindle.&lt;ref name ="staffuni"/&gt; Settled sewage is delivered to a reservoir at the centre of the spindle via some form of dosing mechanism, often a tipping bucket device on small filters.

Larger filters may be rectangular and the distribution arms may be driven by hydraulic or electrical systems.&lt;ref name ="staffuni"/&gt;

==Types==
Single trickling filters may be used for the treatment of small residential septic tank discharges and very small rural sewage treatment systems. Larger centralized sewage treatment plants typically use many trickling filters in parallel.

Systems can be configured for single-pass use where the treated water is applied to the trickling filter once before being disposed of, or for multi-pass use where a portion of the treated water is cycled back and re-treated via a [[Feedback|closed loop]].  Multi-pass systems result in higher treatment quality and assist in removing Total Nitrogen (TN) levels by promoting [[nitrification]] in the aerobic media bed and [[denitrification]] in the anaerobic septic tank. Some systems use the filters in two banks operated in series so that the wastewater has two passes through a filter with a sedimentation stage between the two passes. Every few days the filters are switched round to balance the load. This method of treatment can improve nitrification and de-nitrification since much of the carbonaceous oxidative material is removed on the first pass through the filters.

=== Media types ===
Trickling may have a variety of types of filter media used to support the biofilm. Types of media most commonly used include [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[pumice]], plastic matrix material, open-cell [[polyurethane]] [[foam]], clinker, gravel, [[sand]] and [[geotextiles]].  Ideal filter medium optimizes [[surface area]] for microbial attachment, wastewater retention time, allows air flow, resists plugging is mechanically robust in all weathers allowing walking access across the filter and does not degrade.  Some residential systems require forced aeration units which will increase maintenance and operational costs.

===Industrial wastewater treatment===

The treatment of industrial wastewater may involve specialized trickling filters which use plastic media and high flow rates. Wastewaters from a variety of industrial processes have been treated in trickling filters. Such industrial wastewater trickling filters consist of two types:

* Large tanks or concrete enclosures filled with plastic packing or other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/CE/msaleh/ChE%20107.11March06.ppt King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Course ChE 101.11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728064144/http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/CE/msaleh/ChE%20107.11March06.ppt |date=2011-07-28 }} Saudi Aramco Engineering Development Program, pages 62-65 including Figure 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vertical towers filled with plastic packing or other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT4351729&amp;id=U3c8AAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=trickle+filter+%22packed+tower%22+wastewater Biological filter and process] U.S. patent 4,351,729, September 28, 1982, Assigned to Celanese Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.auburn.edu/~davisda/classes/facilities/presentations/Recirc_overview.pdf Lecture] by Dr. Allen Davis, [[Auburn University]], page 6 of 8 pdf pages including schematic of packed tower trickling filter){{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of inexpensive plastic tower packings has led to their use as trickling filter beds in tall towers, some as high as 20 meters.&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R. |title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]| edition=1st| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=1967|lccn=67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 1960s, such towers were in use at: the Great Northern Oil's [[Pine Bend Refinery]] in [[Minnesota]]; the Cities Service Oil Company Trafalgar Refinery in [[Oakville, Ontario]] and at a kraft paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Bryan and D.H. Moeller, ''Aerobic Biological Oxidation Using Dowpac'', Paper 42, Conference on Biological Waste Treatment, Manhattan College, April 20, 1960. [http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~alleman]&lt;/ref&gt;

The treated water effluent from industrial wastewater trickling filters is typically processed in a clarifier to remove the sludge that sloughs off the microbial slime layer attached to the trickling filter media as for other trickling filter applications.

Some of the latest trickle filter technology involves aerated biofilters of  plastic media in vessels using blowers to inject air at the bottom of the vessels, with either downflow or upflow of the wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcus Van Sperling|title= Activated Sludge and Aerobic Biofilm Reactors|edition= |publisher =IWA Publications|year=2007|isbn=1-84339-165-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3857">A variable-speed drive (VSD) [[air compressor]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quincycompressor.com/qgv.html Variable Speed Drive Compressor]&lt;/ref&gt; is an air compressor that takes advantage of [[variable-speed drive]] technology.  This type of compressor uses a special drive to control the speed (RPM) of the unit, which in turn saves energy compared to a fixed speed equivalent.

The most common form of VSD technology in the air compressor industry is a [[variable-frequency drive]], which converts the incoming [[Alternating current|AC]] power to [[Direct current|DC]] and then back to a quasi-sinusoidal AC power using an inverter switching circuit.  The [[variable-frequency drive]] article provides additional information on electronic speed controls used with various types of AC motors.

==Benefits==
The benefits of this technology included reducing power cost, reducing power surges (from starting AC motors), and delivering a more constant pressure.  The down side of this technology is the heavy expense associated with the drive, and the sensitivity of these drives ‚Äì specifically to heat and moisture.

==Industry==
Typically a fifth of a factory's electricity bill is attributed to the production of compressed air.  The majority of modern factories are heavily involved in cutting costs, and energy awareness should be a key concern.  For example, 10‚Äì12% of all power generated in the UK is dedicated to the production of compressed air, and a portion of this power is wasted energy.

Large electrical cost savings can be achieved by installing a variable speed drive compressor in place of an existing rotary screw or piston machine. Because of this, many governments, including the US and UK, are pushing the industries to move towards this technology in hopes of reducing wasted energy.  Governments offer various incentives, such as tax rebates or interest free loans, to cover the upgrades.

However, variable speed drive compressors are not necessarily appropriate for all industrial applications.  If a variable speed drive compressor operates continuously at full speed, the switching losses of the frequency converter result in a lower energy efficiency than an otherwise identically sized fixed speed compressor.  Where demand remains constant within 5‚Äì15% of the total free air delivery flow rate, dual-control compressors configured in a split solution can provide higher efficiency than a VFD.

A professional air audit is the best way to identify if a VFD compressor is most appropriate for any given compressed air application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cascousa.com/our-services/air-system-engineering/ Air Audit]&lt;/ref&gt; These audits are available from various companies that specialize in the implementation of compressed air equipment, which can determine the most efficient controls for a compressed air system ‚Äì including variable speed, variable capacity or using storage and flow controllers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ace-group.eu/places-might-find-compressor/ Industrial Air Compressor]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Warner and Swasey Observatory''' is the astronomical [[observatory]] of [[Case Western Reserve University]]. Named after [[Worcester R. Warner]] and [[Ambrose Swasey]], who built it at the beginning of the 20th century, it was initially located on Taylor Road in [[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], USA.  The observatory, which at that time housed a {{convert|9.5|in|cm|adj=on}} [[refracting telescope|refractor]], was donated in 1919 to the Case School of Applied Science. The newer {{convert|24|in|cm|adj=on}} Burrell [[Schmidt telescope]] was built in 1939.

Due to rising [[light pollution]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], a new station in [[Geauga County, Ohio|Geauga County]]'s [[Montville Township, Geauga County, Ohio|Montville Township]] was established in 1950s. Named after [[Jason John Nassau]], the station initially housed the Burrell telescope, which was later moved to [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]]. Instead of Burrell the station was equipped with the 36-inch robotic telescope. In 2008 Nassau Station was sold to the [[Geauga Park District]] and subsequently incorporated into its Observatory Park.

The observatory currently operates the old 9.5-inch refractor (now known as the rooftop telescope) at the university's [[University Circle]] campus, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] in [[Arizona]]. The old site on Taylor Road was sold in 1983.

==History==
[[Image:Warner and Swasey Observatory.jpg|thumb|upright|The Taylor Road facility of the Warner and Swasey Observatory]]

The observatory was originally built by Worchester R. Warner and Ambrose Swasey, owners of [[Warner &amp; Swasey Company]], which made precision instruments and [[telescope]]s in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They became trustees of the Case School of Applied Science (later renamed to [[Case Institute of Technology]]), and built an observatory in [[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]], which they gave to the school in 1919. This original observatory building was located on Taylor Road four miles east of the university campus and housed a 9.5-inch [[refracting telescope|refractor]], and was dedicated in 1920. The building was designed by the firm of [[Walker and Weeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Cleveland Legacy: The Architecture of Walker and Weeks |last=Johannesen |first=Eric |date=1998 |publisher=Kent State University Press |location=Kent, Ohio |isbn=0-87338-589-6 |pages=87‚Äì88 |url=http://upress.kent.edu/books/Johannesen.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years the observatory grew to house several more telescopes and instruments, such as the 24-inch Burrell Schmidt telescope, as well as an astronomical library and public lecture hall.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|last=Claspy|first=William|publisher=Warner and Swasey Observatory, Case Western Reserve University|title=History of the Warner and Swasey Observatory|url=http://astrwww.cwru.edu/history.shtml|date=2006|accessdate=2009-08-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509072403/http://astrwww.cwru.edu/history.shtml|archivedate=2008-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, it became apparent that the [[light pollution]] from Cleveland was beginning to make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A new site was constructed 30 miles to the east in [[Geauga County, Ohio|Geauga County]], known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope was moved to this location. In order to compensate for the move, a 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

In 1978, the Astronomy Department of [[Case Western Reserve University]] made a deal with the [[Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy]] (AURA) to build a new observatory at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] to house the Burrell Schmidt. The telescope was moved from [[Ohio]] to [[Arizona]] in May 1979, and in 1980 the 36-inch [[reflecting telescope|reflector]] on Taylor Road was moved to the Nassau Station. This meant no further astronomical work was done at the Taylor Road facility, and as a result the faculty and resources of the original observatory were moved to the main campus of Case Western Reserve University in 1982.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The Taylor Road facility was sold in 1983, was abandoned, and remained neglected until 2005 when it was sold to a couple who planned to convert the building into a [[House|residence]].&lt;ref name=flipline&gt;{{cite web|title=The History....|url=http://www.flipline.com/wso/history.html|accessdate=2009-08-18|publisher=The Warner &amp; Swasey Observatory Restoration project|last=Elek|first=Tim|last2=Neff|first2=Matt|last3=Solary|first3=Tony|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704065403/http://flipline.com/wso/history.html|archivedate=2008-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=O'Malley |title=Family's New Focus: Turning Old Observatory Into Home |url=http://www.cleveland.com/whateverhappened/plaindealer/index.ssf?/whateverhappened/more/observatory.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=2005-09-07 |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607163203/http://www.cleveland.com/whateverhappened/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fwhateverhappened%2Fmore%2Fobservatory.html |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans stalled when its new owner was convicted of [[mortgage fraud]] and sent to prison in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=O'Malley |title=Nayyir Al Mahdi's dream of turning observatory into home ended with indictment |url=http://www.cleveland.com/whateverhappened/plaindealer/index.ssf?/whateverhappened/more/nayyir.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607163303/http://www.cleveland.com/whateverhappened/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fwhateverhappened%2Fmore%2Fnayyir.html |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burrell Schmidt Telescope===
The 24-inch Burrell Schmidt Telescope was originally built in 1939 by [[Warner &amp; Swasey Company]] of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] and was housed at the Taylor Road facility.&lt;ref name=Nassau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nassau|first=J.J.|title=The Burrell telescope of the Warner and Swasey Observatory|date=1945|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=101|pages=275‚Äì279|doi=10.1086/144719|bibcode=1945ApJ...101..275N}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently housed at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] near [[Tucson, Arizona]]. The telescope recently had its optics upgraded with a very wide field of view [[CCD array]], which is much more sensitive than the [[photographic plate]]s. It is the instrument used today by the Case astronomers.&lt;ref name=NewsLetter&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Camera Sees "First Light" on Burrell Schmidt Telescope|url=http://astroweb.case.edu/news/Newsletter092008.pdf|format=pdf|date=September 2008|journal=Astronomy Department Newsletter|publisher=Case Western Reserve University|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nassau Station Robotic Observatory===
The Nassau Station, originally constructed in the 1950s, currently houses a 36-inch reflecting telescope.

As a result, the observatory was left unused for several years until 2008, when it was sold to the [[Geauga Park District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Geauga Park District purchases Nassau Observatory from Case Western Reserve University |url=http://blog.case.edu/case-news/2008/10/09/nassauobservatory |publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]] |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park district reopened the facility as part of its Observatory Park on June 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joan |last=Rusek |title=Geauga's Observatory Park Opens Early for Historic View of Venus |url=http://www.cleveland.com/west-geauga/index.ssf/2012/06/post_43.html |work=[[Sun Newspapers|Sun News]] |date=2012-06-21 |accessdate=2012-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Elizabeth |last=Lundblad |title=Geauga Park District's Observatory Park Helps Visitors See the Stars |url=http://www.news-herald.com/articles/2012/11/25/news/nh6261754.txt |work=[[The News-Herald (Ohio)|The News-Herald]] |date=2012-11-25 |accessdate=2012-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The park was designated as a dark sky park by the [[International Dark Sky Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Mangels |title=$2 million Geauga park would preserve a patch of dark sky |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/02/2_million_geauga_park_would_pr.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rooftop Telescope===
The Rooftop Telescope is a 9.5-inch refractor that was originally constructed in 1894 by Warner and Swasey for their own use.&lt;ref name=flipline/&gt; The telescope was the first instrument of the Warner and Swasey Observatory and was originally used at the Taylor Road facility, but was put into storage when the Astronomy Department of Case Western Reserve University was relocated to the A. W. Smith building on the main campus. In 1986 the telescope was reinstalled in a new dome on the roof of the A. W. Smith building.&lt;ref name=Cuyahoga&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio's Observatories: CWRU Observatories|url=http://www.cuyastro.org/ohioobs.html|accessdate=2009-08-18|publisher=Cuyahoga Astronomical Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913064335/http://www.cuyastro.org/ohioobs.html|archivedate=2009-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The telescope remains in excellent condition today and is available for use by all students, faculty, and staff at CWRU once they go through a seminar on proper telescope use.&lt;ref name=Cuyahoga/&gt; It is also often used for public observing nights by the university's Physics and Astronomy Club.

Observers using the Warner and Swasey Observatory have made important contributions to astronomical research.  An early example is work carried out by the observatory's then director, Jason Nassau, on the classification of [[carbon star]]s and [[stellar classification|M-type stars]] in 1949;&lt;ref name=Blanco&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanco|first=Victor M.|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=39|issue=1|pages=1‚Äì18|date=September 2001|url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.astro.39.1.1?cookieSet=1#h4|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.39.1.1|title=Telescopes, red stars, and Chilean skies|bibcode=2001ARA&amp;A..39....1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; more recently, observations made using the Burrell Schmidt telescope led to the discovery of the galaxy [[Andromeda VIII]] in 2003. This galaxy orbits the more famous [[Andromeda Galaxy]], and was previously undiscovered due to its position in front of the bright disk of the parent galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=H.L.|author2=Harding, P. |author3=Hurley-Keller, D. |author4= Jacoby, G. |date=2003|title=Andromeda VIII: A New Tidally Distorted Satellite of M31|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=596|issue=2|pages=L183‚ÄìL186|bibcode=2003ApJ...596L.183M|doi= 10.1086/379625|arxiv = astro-ph/0309254 }}  ([http://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/pr03/cwru0301.html Observatory press release])&lt;/ref&gt;  The Burrell Schmidt has also recently been used to image the intracluster light in the [[Virgo Supercluster]].  The intracluster light is a thousand times fainter than the night sky, and was observed after combining seventy images of the cluster which were taken with the Burrell Schmidt telescope.&lt;ref name=Virgo&gt;{{cite web|last=Mihos|first=C.|display-authors=etal |date=2005|title=Diffuse Light in the Virgo Supercluster|url=http://astroweb.case.edu/hos/Virgo/|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division III [[Northwest Conference]] and was featured in [[Loren Pope]]'s ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]''. Willamette's mascot is the [[binturong|bearcat]] and old gold and cardinal are the school colors. Approximately 2,800 students are enrolled at Willamette between the graduate and undergraduate programs.&lt;ref name="willamette.edu"/&gt; The school employs over 200 full-time professors on the {{convert|69|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus located across the street from the [[Oregon State Capitol]].

Originally named the [[Oregon Institute]], the school was an unaffiliated outgrowth of the [[Methodist Mission]]. The name was changed to Wallamet University in 1852, followed by the current spelling in 1870. Willamette founded the first medical school and law school in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the second half of the 19th century. In the 20th century, the school started a [[sister school]] relationship with [[Tokyo International University]] and began competing in intercollegiate athletics.

Willamette's undergraduate programs exist within the school's College of Liberal Arts. The school was rated 82nd among American liberal arts colleges by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' for 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Liberal Arts Colleges -  Willamette University |publisher=''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/willamette-3227/overall-rankings |accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of the graduate programs is the [[Willamette University College of Law|College of Law]], founded in 1883 and currently located in the Truman Wesley Collins Legal Center.

==History==
The university was founded as the [[Oregon Institute]] by the missionary [[Jason Lee (missionary)|Jason Lee]], who had arrived in what was then known as the [[Oregon Country]] in 1834 and had founded the Indian Manual Labor Institute for the education of the local [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]]. Lee requested additional support for his mission, and received 53 additional volunteers in 1839, who arrived on the ship ''[[Lausanne (ship)|Lausanne]]''. After a series of meetings in Lee's home, the by-laws were adopted and board of trustees elected and the institute was officially established on February 1, 1842. The Oregon Institute officially opened on August 13, 1844 with a total of five students and one teacher, Mrs. [[Chloe Clark Willson|Chloe Clarke Willson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://willamette.edu/about/history/highlights_1834-1899.html|title=About: History of Willamette: 1834 - 1899 {{!}} Willamette University|website=willamette.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee served as the first President of the Board of Trustees, followed by [[David Leslie (Oregon politician)|David Leslie]] after Lee's death in 1845. Leslie would serve until his death in 1869.&lt;ref name=wu&gt;Gatke, Robert Moulton. 1943. ''Chronicles of Willamette, the pioneer university of the West''. Portland, Or: Binfords &amp; Mort.&lt;/ref&gt; The original purpose of the institute was the education of the missionaries' children.

[[File:Eaton Hall from OSC.JPG|left|thumb|[[Eaton Hall (Oregon)|Eaton Hall]] built in 1909]]
The original building of the institute was a three-story frame structure first occupied in 1844. At the time, it was one of the largest structures in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It housed the first session of the state legislature to meet in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]] after the capital was moved there in 1851. The building burned down in 1877. In 1867, a new brick building was finished to house the school and named University Hall.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt; The building was renamed as [[Waller Hall]] in 1912 to honor the Reverend [[Alvin F. Waller]], and is now the oldest university building west of the [[Mississippi River]] still in use.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt; The first president was [[Francis S. Hoyt]], who served in that position from 1853 until 1860 and was replaced by [[Thomas Milton Gatch]] who is the only president of the school to serve as president two different times.&lt;ref name=presidents&gt;[http://www.willamette.edu/about/president/past/index.html Past Presidents.] Willamette University. Retrieved on September 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the institution was changed to "Wallamet University" in 1852. The following year, the [[Oregon Territorial Legislature]] granted a charter to the university. The first graduate was Emily J. York, who received a degree as Mistress of English Literature in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://willamette.edu/about/history/highlights_1834-1899.html|title=About: History of Willamette: 1834 - 1899 {{!}} Willamette University|website=willamette.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, the university established the first [[Willamette University School of Medicine|school of medicine]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref name=archive&gt;Cowan, Ron.

In December 1941, the university's football team traveled to Hawaii to play the [[University of Hawaii]]. Many students accompanied the team by passenger ship to [[Oahu]]. The game was played was on December 6. The following day, many of the Willamette students witnessed the bombing of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] from their hotels on [[Waikiki|Waikiki Beach]].  Their return trip was delayed by many weeks, and some of the students returned to Oregon by helping on ships transporting the wounded to the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://willamette.edu/about/history/highlights_1900-1949.html|title=About: History of Willamette: 1900 - 1949 {{!}} Willamette University|website=willamette.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the team members stayed with football players from [[Punahou School]].

During World War II, Willamette was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="williamette-v-12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palynology.org/history/tschudy.html |title=AASP Primary Records Program |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |last=Nichols |first=D.J. |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |year=1987 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907095050/http://www.palynology.org/history/tschudy.html |archivedate=September 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lausanne Hall]], previously a women's residence, served as a "ship" for trainees between 1943 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://willamette.edu/about/history/highlights_1900-1949.html|title=About: History of Willamette: 1900 - 1949 {{!}} Willamette University|website=willamette.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|69|acre|adj=on}} campus is directly south of the [[Oregon State Capitol]], affording students access to internships in the institutions of [[Government of Oregon|Oregon government]]. Much of downtown Salem, including the Capitol, is on land once owned by the university. Railroad tracks are located directly east of the school, with the [[Salem (Amtrak station)|Salem Amtrak Station]] near the southeastern edge of campus.&lt;ref name="plan"/&gt; South of the school is [[Salem Hospital (Oregon)|Salem Hospital]], with [[Bush's Pasture Park]] and the school's [[McCulloch Stadium]] opposite the hospital.&lt;ref name="plan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;

Willamette's core area lies between State Street on the north, Bellevue Street on the south, Winter Street to the west, and 12th Street on the east.&lt;ref name="plan"/&gt; On the west side of Winter Street lie the university's graduate programs in business and law.&lt;ref name="map"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.willamette.edu/map/campus_map.pdf|title=Willamette University Campus Map|date=December 1, 2008|publisher=Willamette University|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional school properties outside of the core area are the [[Hallie Ford Museum of Art]], the [[Oregon Civic Justice Center]], the Tokyo International University of America campus, and several residential buildings.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; Willamette owns several other properties along State Street west of the main campus.&lt;ref name="plan"/&gt; The school plans on redeveloping portions of the west end of campus in order to better tie the campus to downtown Salem.&lt;ref name="plan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Plan blurs boundaries of Willamette U, Salem|last=Cowan|first=Ron|date=January 8, 2006|work=Statesman Journal|page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic buildings on campus include [[Eaton Hall (Oregon)|Eaton Hall]] and Smullin/Walton Hall, which are primarily used by humanities departments. Science classes are generally held in the Collins and Olin buildings. Willamette's music program is housed by the G. Herbert Smith Auditorium and Fine Arts building, as well as the Mary Stuart Rogers auditorium. Administrative offices are found in the Putnam University Center and [[Waller Hall]], Willamette's oldest building. Waller Hall was built using bricks made of clay from the campus quad.

In addition to Greek housing, eleven residence halls exist on the Willamette campus. Undergraduate students are under contract to live on campus for two years, after which they may move into private residence or one of the university's apartment complexes. [[Lausanne Hall]], originally home of the university's Women's College, is now one of the university's undergraduate dormitories. The building commemorates the ship that brought the reinforcements to Lee in 1839. York Hall commemorates the university's first graduate.

The Mill Stream runs through the middle of the campus. Starting across 12th Street and flowing through the length of the campus, it passes by the [[Martha Springer Botanical Garden]], the [[Mark O. Hatfield Library|Hatfield Library]], Hudson Hall, the University Center, Smith Auditorium and Goudy Commons. This artificial stream, commonly referred to as the Mill Stream, was once known as the Mill Race. It forms a "W" shape when viewed from the University Center. Biology and environmental science classes utilize the Mill Stream as an authentic research venue. As part of the freshman matriculation ceremony, new students place a lit candle into the Mill Stream and watch it float downstream.

On-campus athletics facilities are located in the southeast portion of the campus. These include a soccer field, tennis courts, and the Sparks Center.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; Softball, football, and baseball stadiums are located outside of the main campus.

===Greek life===
There are five fraternities and three sororities at Willamette. The sororities are [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Alpha Chi Omega]], and [[Alpha Phi]]. Alpha Chi Omega and Pi Beta Phi have their own houses located along sorority row on Mill Street. The fraternities at Willamette are [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], and [[Sigma Chi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://willamette.edu/offices/osa/greek/index.html|title=Student Activities: Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life|website=willamette.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek life at Willamette began in the 1920s with the foundation of several local fraternities and sororities. In 1942, G. Herbert Smith, a member of [[Beta Theta Pi]], became President of Willamette, and invited national fraternities and sororities onto campus. The local fraternities were soon converted into national fraternities and sororities. Pi Beta Phi became the first national sorority at Willamette in 1944, and Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Chi, and Phi Delta Theta were installed in 1947. At its peak, there were six fraternities and five sororities at Willamette.

Two other sororities, [[Chi Omega]] and [[Alpha Phi]], and the fraternity [[Delta Tau Delta]], used to have chapters at Willamette.  In the mid-1990s, Delta Tau Delta lost its charter. The two sororities lost their charters after their move to sorority row. Chi Omega was transformed into a multicultural oriented residence known as WISH (Willamette International Studies House). In the spring of 2014, Alpha Phi accepted an invitation from the university's Panhellenic Council to reorganize their chapter on Willamette's campus. In the fall of 2014, Beta Theta Pi began recolonization of its chapter on Willamette's campus with the consent of the university's Inter-Fraternity council.
