'''AFC Ajax NV''' is mostly known as a [[Football team|football club]]. Since 17 May 1998 the club is registered as a [[Naamloze Vennootschap]] (N.V.) listed on the stock exchange [[Euronext]] Amsterdam. As a company the club strives to make a profit through ticket sales, as well as through income accumulated by competing in National, Continental as well as Global [[Association football|football]]. Half of the [[revenue]] is generated through club [[merchandise]], [[advertising]], and income from selling [[broadcasting|broadcasting rights]].&lt;ref name="AFC Ajax NV-2012-Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/financials/financials.asp?ticker=AJAX:NA |title=AFC Ajax NV 2012 Annual Report, Filing Date Feb 23, 2013 |publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek |accessdate =September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ajax is the only Dutch club with an [[initial public offering]] (IPO). Outside the Netherlands in countries such as the UK, Germany, Italy or Turkey there are more football clubs with IPOs, including the most successful of them all, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], who are accredited with advising Ajax Amsterdam to enter the [[stock market]]. Several members of Ajax [[Board of directors|Board of Commissioners]] have a financial background in trade. For example, former [[treasurer]] of the club [[Arie van Os]] was a famous [[stockbroker]] from Amsterdam, who had worked for [[Van der Moolen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vorige.nrc.nl/sport/ajax/article1882997.ece |title=God van de handel liet Ajax in de steek |publisher=NRC.nl |accessdate=2008-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202125824/http://vorige.nrc.nl/sport/ajax/article1882997.ece |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a limited amount of the shares in AFC Ajax NV are publicly traded on the Stock Market. The "Vereniging AFC Ajax"  ({{lang-en|AFC Ajax Association}})  retain 73% of the shares. The following majority share holders are Insurance company [[Delta Lloyd Group]] with 9.95%, followed by former Stockbroker Adri Strating with 8.65%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wiebezit.nl/afc-ajax-n-v-.html |title=Majority shareholders of AFC Ajax N.V. |access-date=2013-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044733/http://wiebezit.nl/afc-ajax-n-v-.html |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of AFC Ajax}}
In 1900, [[Floris Stempel]], Carel Reeser and Johan Dade founded the [[AFC Ajax|Amsterdamsche Football Club Ajax]] in [[Amsterdam]].

In 1911, Ajax moved into its first stadium [[Het Houten Stadion]] playing to the max capacity of 15,000. The funding for the stadium came from Wim Eggerman, a local businessman, and president of the club at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metronieuws.nl/regionaal/5-historische-ajax-plekken/SrZljo!MOHCqK7yI0pkQ/ |title=5 historische Ajax-plekken |publisher=Metro Nieuws |accessdate=2013-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308022734/http://www.metronieuws.nl/regionaal/5-historische-ajax-plekken/SrZljo!MOHCqK7yI0pkQ/ |archive-date=2014-03-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, Ajax expanded into [[baseball]] as one of the founding clubs of the newly formed [[Honkbal Hoofdklasse]], the team won the national title four times, before the club shut down its baseball division exactly 50 years later.

In 1934, Ajax relocated to a new stadium [[De Meer Stadion]], playing to an increased capacity of 22,000. The stadium was designed and funded by [[Architect]] and Ajax [[Board of directors|Commissioner]] [[Jordanus Roodenburgh]], who had designed and completed the first stadium for Ajax as well. Ajax also played their International fixtures at the [[Olympic Stadium (Amsterdam)|Olympic Stadium]] in Amsterdam to an increased capacity of 64,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dare.uva.nl/document/52848 |title=De Meer |publisher=Universiteit van Amsterdam|accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, [[Jaap van Praag (sports director)|Jaap van Praag]] was made the new chairman of the club, a position he held until 1978. The period during his tenure is widely considered Ajax most glorious, with the club winning the intercontinental title, as well as the continental title three years in a row from 1971–1973.

In 1972, Ajax won the [[Eredivisie]] league title, the Dutch Cup, the European Cup, the European Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup all in the same calendar year, also completing the European Cup treble the following year.

In 1989, [[Michael van Praag]], the son of Jaap, became the new chairman of Ajax, a position he held until 2003. The club won the UEFA Cup in 1992 and the UEFA Champions League in 1995, winning the Intercontinental Cup once more the same year under his guidance.

In 1996, construction was completed of a new soccer specific stadium, the [[Amsterdam ArenA]] to an increased capacity of 53,052. AFC AJax NV own 13% of the new stadium, which includes a training facility [[Sportpark De Toekomst]], itself with a capacity of 5,000. The remaining proprietorship of the stadium is held by the [[Government of Amsterdam]].

In 1998, AFC Ajax NV was created as the club registered as a [[Naamloze vennootschap]] company and were listed on the stock exchange [[Euronext]] Amsterdam on May 17 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://listofcompanies.co.in/afc-ajax-nv/ |title=Ajax opent voetbalacademie in Griekenland|publisher=List of Companies: AFC Ajax N.V.|date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, AFC Ajax NV acquired 51% proprietorship of newly founded [[Ajax Cape Town F.C.]], through a merger of previous clubs Seven Stars and Cape Town Spurs, as AFC Ajax NV expanded their operations to South Africa. The remaining shares of the club were divvied between the Comitis family and the minority share holders the Efstathiou family. That same year on 18 June 1999, AFC Ajax NV acquired 51% shares of [[Ashanti Gold SC]], a West-African football club from Ghana, with [[Ashanti Goldfields Corporation]] retained 49% proprietorship of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.modernghana.com/sports/90594/2/ashantigold-sporting-club-sponsors-brief.html | title=Ashantigold Sporting Club -Sponsors Brief |work=Ajax.nl|date=22 November 2005 |accessdate= 2013-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, AFC Ajax NV acquired 72,5% of the shares of Belgian club [[K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot|Germinal Beerschot]] with whom Ajax had formed a parternship a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajax.nl/web/show/id=154417/contentid=13351 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530164834/http://www.ajax.nl/web/show/id=154417/contentid=13351 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 May 2012 |title=Ajax vergroot belang in Germinal Beerschot Antwerpen |language=Dutch |work=Ajax.nl |date=14 November 2001 |accessdate=2013-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, AFC Ajax NV sold all of its shares in [[K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot|Germinal Beerschot]] back to Belgian businessman Jos Verhaegen for the symbolic price of €1, ending the fusion of both clubs and their joint operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://217.118.160.21/(/financien/rtlz/nieuws/)/components/financien/rtlz/2003/03_maart/13-ajax_gba_1euro.xml |title=Ajax verkoopt belang in Germinal voor 1 euro |language=Dutch |work=RTL Z |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=2013-05-02 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ajax also sold their shares of [[Ashanti Gold SC]] back to Ashanti Goldfields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajax.nl/web/show/id=154417/contentid=27266 |title=Ajax zet financiële participatie in Ashanti Goldfields om in technische samenwerking |language=Dutch |work=Ajax.nl |date=14 February 2003 |accessdate=2013-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313144559/http://www.ajax.nl/web/show/id%3D154417/contentid%3D27266 |archivedate=2012-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead Ajax expanded operations to Orlando, Florida, in the United States, forming Ajax America, as well as the [[Ajax Orlando Prospects]] competing in the USL Pro league, before the North American club folded in 2007.

In 2011, AFC Ajax NV opened the [[Ajax Hellas Youth Academy]] in Greece, in conjunction with George Kazianis and All Star Consultancy forming the first Ajax youth academy outside the Netherlands. Together they opened a total of 15 youth teams in Greece and Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1441/Ajax/article/detail/1898817/2011/03/15/Ajax-opent-voetbalacademie-in-Griekenland.dhtml |title=Ajax opent voetbalacademie in Griekenland|publisher=AD.nl|date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alejandro M. Castillero Pinilla''' (born 1972 in [[Chitré]], [[Panama]]) is an [[lawyer|attorney]], [[real estate]] investor, [[shareholder]] of Nazareno Livestock Cattle Ranch, and founding partner of [https://web.archive.org/web/20120304071504/http://haoodnla.com/article/lxy09218424y9j01/250386 Castillero &amp; Castillero] [[law firm]] in Chitré, the capital of the [[Herrera Province|province of Herrera]], on the [[Azuero Peninsula]] of Panama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radiopanama.com.pa/oir.aspx?id=827513|title=Alejandro Castillero director de PRONAT designado habla en Radio Panamá sobre los planes de trabajo que desarrollará al llegar a la institución.|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Castillero was named Technical Coordinator of [http://www.dgmarket.com/tenders/adminShowBuyer.do~buyerId=1347235 PRONAT] — the National Land Administration Program, the sole government entity responsible for facilitating the titling process in Panama — by Panama President [[Ricardo Martinelli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/ver_nodo.php?cod=550|title=Títulos de propiedad entrega PRONAT en La 24 de Diciembre|date=2009-10-23|website=www.presidencia.gob.pa|access-date=2018-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317053825/http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/ver_nodo.php?cod=550|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, under the Martinelli administration, he and his PRONAT team have, on average, titled more than 2,500 properties per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tupolitica.com/cambio-democratico-panama/ricardo-martinelli-visita-azuero.html/|title=Ricardo Martinelli visita Azuero |work= TuPolitica.com - El Sitio y Centro de Prensa Oficial de la Política en Panamá |language=es|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financed by [[Inter-American Development Bank]]), the extent of this [[land titling]] initiative is unprecedented for the Central American country, and is critical to achieving the Panama federal government’s goal of titling the entire country within five years to accelerate [[investment]] opportunities nationwide.

The impact of Castillero’s and his team’s early work at PRONAT came to fruition on December 31, 2009 when [http://www.panama-guide.com/article.php/analysis-new-law-80-rop-land-titles Law 80] was passed, facilitating possessory rights and free land titles across the Panamanian [[coastal zone]]s and [[island]]s. These regions, incidentally, are home to many [[indigenous people]]s, whose agrarian livelihoods render most unable to pay even modest amounts for the titles that stand to name them rightful owners of land which, in most cases, has sustained their families for generations.

With this in mind, PRONAT made titles for properties of five hectares or less available free-of-charge to the possessor. For those who wish to title more than five hectares — or buy currently unoccupied untitled land from the government — a price table, based on property location and size, is included in the law, alleviating discrepancies and legal confusion.

Castillero earned his Law and Political Science degree from [http://usmapanama.com/ Santa Maria La Antigua University] in [[Panama City]], Panama, and later, a master's degree in international banking and financial law from [[Boston University]], USA.

Castillero has held many important posts throughout his career, namely, National Director of Copyrights at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101103065503/http://meduca.gob.pa/ Ministry of Education], Legal Advisor to the http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/index.asp?lang=en&amp;iso3=PAN Agriculture Affairs Committee] of the [[National Assembly of Panama|National Legislative Assembly]], and Legal Advisor to the [http://www.superbancos.gob.pa/home_eng.asp Superintendency of Banks].

Castillero stepped down in 2009 as CEO of [http://www.cascorrealty.com Cascor Realty] to accept his public position as Director of PRONAT, but remains active in various [[Philanthropy|philanthropic initiatives]] and [[charitable organization]]s. Alejandro is a founding member of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708165714/http://district5690.clubwizard.com/IMUpload/ACF3169.pdf Rotary Club of Chitré], Treasurer of the Herrera sub-Program of The [[Special Olympics]], and President of the Eneida Moreno de Castillero Foundation, a local organization dedicated to advancing the [[public welfare]] of the province of Herrera and the entire Azuero region.

Born in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], to a Lebanese property developer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=bar-knee |title=Midani a naughty boy? |url=http://www.mail-archive.com/newslist@rednews.co.uk/msg00587.html |publisher=Red News |date=27 March 2002 |accessdate=22 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was a Lebanese junior [[table tennis]] champion at the age of 15, and moved to England at 18.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; By the mid-1980s, he had become chairman of the [[Manchester Giants (1975–2001)|Warrington Vikings]] basketball team. In 1985, he received an approach from Manchester United FC chairman [[Martin Edwards]], who wished to make Manchester United into a multi-sport club; as part of the deal, the Vikings moved from [[Warrington]], [[Cheshire]], to the Stretford Sports Centre in [[Trafford]], [[Greater Manchester]], changed its name to Manchester United Basketball Club, and Al Midani received a seat on the Manchester United board as well as shares in the club. He remained involved with the basketball club even after they separated from Manchester United and became the Manchester Eagles (and subsequently the Manchester Giants), but had left the club by the time it folded in 2001.

In 1991, Al Midani attempted a takeover bid of Manchester United as part of a consortium that included club director and former player [[Bobby Charlton]] and would have installed Charlton as chairman, but was put off by Edwards' asking price of £30&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;McKinstry (2002), pp. 357–8&lt;/ref&gt; He retained his shares in the club through its flotation on the [[London Stock Exchange]] later that year, but in 1997, Al Midani sold 500,000 shares in Manchester United (0.77% of the club) at around £6 each, causing an 11.5p drop in the share price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Willcock |title=NatWest Markets offers graduates useful advice |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/natwest-markets-offers-graduates-useful-advice-1256778.html |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print |date=19 June 1997 |accessdate=22 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he left the Manchester United board and was declared bankrupt after running up over £2&amp;nbsp;million of gambling debts in four days at the Rio hotel in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Soccer boss bankrupt from gambling debts |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1403361/Soccer-boss-bankrupt-from-gambling-debts.html |work=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=2 August 2002 |accessdate=22 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a 12&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;cent shareholder in Bobby Charlton Enterprises, the main company behind the Bobby Charlton Soccer School and Charlton's ventures into "lunches with legends".&lt;ref&gt;McKinstry (2002), p. 427&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baker Perkins Ltd''' is a British engineering company based in [[Peterborough]] offering manufacturing and process services to the [[food industry]] throughout the world.

==History==
The company has its origins with [[Jacob Perkins]] (1766-1849), an American inventor who moved to England in 1819 from [[Massachusetts]]. His son, [[Angier March Perkins]] (1799-1881), founded the firm of A. M. Perkins &amp; Co Ltd to manufacture his inventions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hevac-heritage.org/victorian_engineers/perkins/perkins.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, the company merged with Werner &amp; Pfleiderer (London) to form Werner, Pfleiderer &amp; Perkins Ltd. In 1904, WP&amp;P moved their manufacturing from London to [[Westwood, Peterborough]]. In 1914, owing to pressure over its German-sounding name, the company became Perkins Engineers Ltd. During [[World War I]], the company produced a range of armaments including [[Harry Ricardo|Ricardo]] engines for [[Mark IV tank]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westwoodworks.net/HowItWas/WestwoodWorksInWW1/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918 it merged with [[Joseph Allen Baker|Joseph Baker]] &amp; Sons Ltd of [[Willesden]] to become Joseph Baker Sons &amp; Perkins Ltd and in 1923, Baker Perkins Ltd.

By the time of the merger, Baker and Perkins were well-established names in the bakery, biscuit, confectionery, chocolate and chemical machinery industries. Just as the companies combined, the Bakers bought a factory in [[Saginaw]], Michigan, that for over 60 years was the base for manufacture of food and chemical equipment in North America.

Between the wars, the company manufactured a wide range of machinery including laundry equipment. 
In 1939, Baker Perkins was asked to take on production of the new [[QF 6 pounder 10 cwt gun|twin 6-pounder coast defence gun]] and also made components for a wide range of other artillery pieces.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westwoodworks.net/HowItWas/WestwoodWorksInWW2/index.htm#7&lt;/ref&gt;  Post war, Baker Perkins specialised in equipment for the food processing and printing industries.

==Later Mergers==
The business had expanded to become global in its organisation and sales when in 1987 the dairy and liquid food specialist, [[APV plc|APV]], acquired it. During this time the company relocated from old premises near the centre of Peterborough to a new purpose-built facility on the outskirts.

In 2006 Baker Perkins regained its historical name and its independence when it was acquired by private investors.

Most recently, Baker Perkins has introduced new moulding and forming technology for bread; developed equipment allowing confectioners to develop candies and lollipops; and pioneered technology expanding the variety of snacks and breakfast cereals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakerperkins.com/about-us/the-baker-perkins-story/ www.bakerperkins.com/about-us/the-baker-perkins-story] Detailed history of Baker Perkins&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker Perkins currently operates in two office locations, the headquarters being in [[Paston, Peterborough|Paston]], [[Peterborough]] with a second office in [[Grand Rapids]], Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bakerperkins.com/contact/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade Associations==
Baker Perkins maintains close links to the industries it serves through membership of key trade associations and research organisations. These include [[AACC International]], PMCA,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmca.com/membershiplisting.asp&lt;/ref&gt; BEMA and B&amp;CMA in the US: and the Leatherhead Food International&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leatherheadfood.com/member-services-member&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brewing Industry Research Foundation|Campden BRI]] in the UK.

[[Image:Catherine Cranston.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The resolute Kate Cranston around 1903, dressed in the [[1850s in fashion|style of the 1850s]].]]
'''Catherine Cranston''' (27 May 1849 – 18 April 1934), widely known as '''Kate&amp;nbsp;Cranston''' or '''Miss&amp;nbsp;Cranston''', was a leading figure in the development of [[tea room]]s. She is nowadays chiefly remembered as a major patron of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]], in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. The name of ''Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms'' lives on in reminiscences of Glasgow in its heyday.

==Background==
Her father, George Cranston, was a baker and pastry maker and, in 1849, the year of her birth, he became proprietor of the ''[[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]] Chop House and Commercial Lodgings'' at No. 39 George Square in Glasgow city centre.&lt;ref name="Glasgow Story"/&gt; The hotel was renamed the Royal Horse, then renamed again in May 1852 to become ''Cranston's Hotel and Dining Rooms'', offering: 
:"Convenient Coffee room and detached Smoking Rooms on Ground Floor, commodious Commercial Room and Parlour, comfortable Bed-rooms and Baths, &amp;c.  Coffee always ready. Cigars, wines, spirits, ales, Newspapers, Time-Tables, Writing Materials. ''Superior and varied Bill of Fare at the usual moderate charges.''&lt;ref name="Glasgow Story"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSA01336&amp;t=2&amp;urltp=searchq.php%3Fqsearch%3Dcranston%26amp%3Bstart%3D0%26amp%3Bend%3D20%26amp%3Bft%3D36%26amp%3Bl%3Dy | title = Advertisement, Post Office Directory 1852-3 | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her slightly older brother Stuart (1848–1921) became a tea dealer and, according to ''Glasgow in 1901'', was "a pioneer of the business" there of "tea shops pure and simple" who by 1901 had three such tearooms offering nothing more substantial to eat than a sandwich. Kate went on to create much more of a social facility.&lt;ref name=G1901&gt;{{cite book | first= James Hamilton | last= Muir | authorlink= | author2= Muirhead Bone, James Bone and Archibald Hamilton Charteris, under the collective pen name of Muirhead Hamilton Bone | year= 1901 | title= Glasgow in 1901 | edition= facsimile reissue 2001 | publisher= William Hodge &amp; Co. of Glasgow, reissued by White Cockade Publishing | location= Oxford | isbn=1-873487-09-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other cities in the United Kingdom, Glasgow was then a centre of the [[temperance movement]] which sought an alternative to male-centred [[pub]]s. Tea had previously been a luxury for the rich, but from the 1830s it was promoted as an alternative to alcoholic drinks, and many new cafés and coffee houses were opened, catering more for ordinary people. However it was not until the 1880s that tea rooms and tea shops became popular and fashionable.&lt;ref name=Tea4you&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tea.co.uk/index.php?pgId=98 | title = Tea 4 You: A Social History | publisher = UK Tea Council | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms==
[[Image:Miss Cranston's.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Poster design by Charles Rennie Mackintosh.]]
In 1878 Miss Kate Cranston opened her first tearoom, the Crown Luncheon Room, on [[Argyle Street, Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=glasgowmuseums&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.glasgowmuseums.com/showProject.cfm?venueid=0&amp;itemid=42 | title = Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Ingram Street Tearooms | publisher = Glasgow Museums – Projects | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She set high standards of service, food quality and cleanliness, and her innovation lay in seeing the social need for something more than a restaurant or a simple "tea shop", and in putting equal attention into providing amenities designed in the latest style. Her first tearoom was decorated in a contemporary baronial style. On 16 September 1886 she opened her Ingram Street tearoom and in 1888 commissioned [[George Henry Walton|George Walton]] to decorate a new smoking room in the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts style]] in one of her tea rooms.&lt;ref name=arts&amp;crafts&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.achome.co.uk/biographies/biographies.htm | title = Arts &amp; Crafts Home | publisher = Mark Golding – Projects | accessdate = 6 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 she became happily married to John Cochrane,&lt;ref name=famousscots&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rampantscotland.com/famous/blfamcranston.htm | title = Famous Scots – Kate Cranston (1850–1934) | publisher = rampantscotland | accessdate = 30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to trade under the name of ''Miss Cranston's Tearooms''. She opened new tearooms in Buchanan Street in 1897 (designed by [[George Washington Browne]]), expanded to take over the whole building in Argyle Street by 1898 (designed by [[H and D Barclay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200086|title=Dictionary of Scottish Architects - DSA Architect Biography Report (August 6, 2018, 11:04 am)|first=David|last=Goold|date=|website=www.scottisharchitects.org.uk|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), then completed her chain of four establishments with the [[Willow Tearooms]] (by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]) in [[Sauchiehall Street]], opened in 1903.&lt;ref name=glasgowmuseums/&gt;

While other cities offered very expensive and very basic tea rooms by 1901, Kate Cranston set the standard in Glasgow for more welcoming establishments. Rooms were provided for ladies only and for gentlemen only, as well as luncheon rooms where they could dine together and smoking rooms and billiards rooms for the gentlemen. ''Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms'' became social centres for all, for business men and apprentices, for ladies and ladies' maids. The ''Ladies Rooms'' were a particular success, newly allowing respectable women to get out and meet together without male company. Unlike cafes or tearooms in other cities, there was no intrusive supervision and those having tea had an assortment of [[Scone (bread)|Scone]]s and cakes to hand, with a discreet notice reminding newcomers to remember the amount consumed. At "the accounting", ''Glasgow in 1901'' reported, "One states the amount of ones indebtedness, and receives a check therefor from the attendant maiden. This, with the corresponding coin or coins, one hands in at the pay-desk, and so home. Nothing could be simpler or less irritating."&lt;ref name=G1901/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;{{cite book | first= | last= | authorlink= | year= 1991 | title= Charles Rennie Mackintosh | edition= Originally published: Richard Drew, 1987 | publisher= Chambers | location= Edinburgh | isbn=0-550-22540-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was a centre of artistic innovation at the time, and the tearooms served as art galleries for paintings by the "[[Glasgow School|Glasgow Boys]]". The architect Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] visited the Buchanan Street tearoom in 1898, finding it "just a little outré", and wrote from there to his wife that "Miss Cranston is now Mrs. Cochrane, a dark, fat wee body with black sparkling luminous eyes, wears a bonnet garnished with roses, and has made a fortune by supplying cheap clean goods in surroundings prompted by the New Art Glasgow School."&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;&lt;ref name=pocketguide&gt;{{cite book | first= John | last= McKean | authorlink= |author2=Colin Baxter | year= 1998 | title= Charles Rennie Mackintosh Pocket Guide | edition= | publisher= Colin Baxter Photography Ltd. | location= Grantown-on-Spey | isbn=1-900455-48-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tea rooms opened around the city, and in the late 1880s fine hotels elsewhere in Britain and in America began to offer tea service in tea rooms and tea courts.&lt;ref name=classiccafes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classiccafes.co.uk/History.html |title=Classic Cafes: An Intimate History |publisher=Adrian Maddox |accessdate=5 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323201633/http://www.classiccafes.co.uk/History.html |archivedate=23 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Glasgow in 1901'' reported that "Glasgow, in truth, is a very [[Tokyo|Tokio]] for tea-rooms. Nowhere can one have so much for so little, and nowhere are such places more popular and frequented." and that "It is not the accent of the people, nor the painted houses, nor yet the absence of [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] policemen that makes the Glasgow man in London feel that he is in a foreign town and far from home. It is a simpler matter. It is the lack of tea-shops."&lt;ref name=G1901/&gt; The original Sauchiehall Street tearoom building is presently being restored and is scheduled for reopening in 2018. It is planned to develop the adjacent building as a Mackintosh visitor centre. The 'Willow Tearooms' brand has been separated from the building and is now run privately at a location within a department store further along the street and at Buchanan Street adjacent to Miss Cranston's original premises. Both locations feature recreated Mackintosh furniture and interior features.

===Walton and Mackintosh===
[[Image:Mackintosh, BuchananTearooms Frieze.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mackintosh's design for the frieze at the Buchanan Street tearoom.]]
[[George Henry Walton|George Walton]] set up ''George Walton &amp; Co, Ecclesiastical and House Decorators'' on the basis of his 1888 commission from Kate Cranston, and in 1896 was commissioned by her to design the interiors of new tearooms, designed and built by [[George Washington Browne]] of [[Edinburgh]], at 91–93 [[Buchanan Street]], which opened the following year.&lt;ref name=arts&amp;crafts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSE01207&amp;t=2&amp;urltp=searchq.php%3Fqsearch%3Dcranston%26amp%3Bstart%3D0%26amp%3Bend%3D20%26amp%3Bft%3D36%26amp%3Bl%3Dy | title = Coat tree by George Walton | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assisted in this by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] who designed wall [[mural]]s in the form of [[stencil]]led [[frieze]]s depicting opposing pairs of elongated female figures surrounded by roses for the ladies' tearoom, the luncheon room and the smokers' gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.designmuseum.org/design/index.php?id=114 | title = Charles Rennie Mackintosh...Designer Information | publisher = The Design Museum | accessdate = 6 May 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060427233547/http://www.designmuseum.org/design/index.php?id=114 | archivedate = 27 April 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"It is believed (and averred) that in no other town can you see in a place of refreshment such ingenious and beautiful decorations in the style of the new art as in Miss Cranston's shop in Buchanan Street. Indeed, so general in the city is this belief that it has caused the Glasgow man of the better sort to coin a new adjective denoting the height of beauty... 'It's quite Kate Cranston-ish !' "&lt;ref name= G1901/&gt;

Kate Cranston expanded her first tearoom to take over the whole building at 114 Argyle Street and commissioned Walton to design a new more modern interior, which opened in 1898. Walton's work included fireplaces, stencilled wall murals and stained glass panels for the doors. In the luncheon room the murals and door panels had a rose pattern theme. The furniture was designed by Mackintosh, introducing for the first time his characteristic high-backed chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSE01206&amp;t=2&amp;urltp=searchq.php%3Fqsearch%3Dcranston%26amp%3Bstart%3D0%26amp%3Bend%3D20%26amp%3Bft%3D36%26amp%3Bl%3Dy | title = Glass panel by George Walton | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 Kate Cranston gave Mackintosh the opportunity to redesign an entire room, at the Ingram Street tearoom. He had just recently married the artist [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]], and together they created the White Dining Room, including a hallway opening onto the street and divided off by a wooden screen with [[Stained glass|leaded glass]] panels, giving those entering glimpses into the room itself. His fame was spreading, and in 1902 ''[[The Studio (magazine)|The Studio]]'' wrote of "Miss Cranston, whose tea-rooms, designed by Mr. Mackintosh, are reckoned by some of the pilgrims to Glasgow as one of the sights of the city."&lt;ref name=glasgowmuseums/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;&lt;ref name=willowtearooms&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.willowtearooms.co.uk/mackintosh.htm | title = Mackintosh % Kate Cranston | publisher = The Willow Tearooms | accessdate = 5 May 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060414201559/http://www.willowtearooms.co.uk/mackintosh.htm | archivedate = 14 April 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Willow Tearooms===
{{main|Willow Tearooms}}
[[Image:Room de Luxe waitresses.jpg|thumb|left|Miss Cranston's waitresses, seen in the Room de Luxe of the Willow Tea Rooms.]]
Next Kate Cranston gave Mackintosh the major commission for an entire building in Sauchiehall Street, again in collaboration with his wife Margaret MacDonald on designs for the interiors. Behind a strikingly simple new façade this building provided three interlinked main tearooms at the ground floor and on a first floor gallery, with steps from that leading up a further half-storey to the famous "Room de Luxe" stretching the width of the building above the main entrance and front tearoom.

In a humorous review of the new tearoom for the [[Glasgow Evening News|Glasgow ''Evening News'']] titled ''Erchie in an Art Tea Room'', [[Neil Munro (Hugh Foulis)|Neil Munro]] described the "Room de Looks": 
::::::"The chairs is no like ony ither chairs ever I clapped eyes on, but ye could easy guess they were chairs, and a' roond the place there's a lump o' looking-gless wi' purple leeks pented on it every noo and then."&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;

In 1905 ''[[Dekorative Kunst]]'' featured a special issue about the Willow Tea Rooms written by [[Hermann Muthesius]] who advised that "Today any visitor to Glasgow can rest body and soul in Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms and for a few pence drink tea, have breakfast and dream that he is in fairy land."&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;

===Further projects===
[[Image:Cranston's exhibition cafe.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Menu design by [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald Mackintosh]].]]
Although the Willow Tearooms completed her chain, and remains the most famous of her tea rooms, Kate Cranston carried out several more projects, and Mackintosh provided increasingly innovative designs. In 1904 she commissioned him to carry out the redecoration and design of new furniture for the mansion of ''Hous'hill'' in [[Nitshill]] which was home to herself and her husband John Cochrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSB00285&amp;t=2&amp;urltp=searchq.php%3Fqsearch%3Dcranston%26amp%3Bstart%3D0%26amp%3Bend%3D20%26amp%3Bft%3D36%26amp%3Bl%3Dy | title = Househill (Hous'hill) | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSE01088&amp;t=2&amp;urltp=searchq.php%3Fqsearch%3Dcranston%26amp%3Bstart%3D0%26amp%3Bend%3D20%26amp%3Bft%3D36%26amp%3Bl%3Dy | title = Furniture from Hous'hill | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackintosh carried out further work on the Argyle Street tearoom in 1906 to design a basement conversion to form ''The Dutch kitchen''. He did further redesigns for rooms in the Ingram Street tearooms, creating the ''Cloister Room'' and the ''Chinese Room'' in 1911. The latter provides an exotic fantasy, with bright blue finished timber screens incorporating a cashier's kiosk, elaborate door lintels and dark blue finished furniture, all in Mackintosh's version of an oriental style.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

In the same year Kate Cranston provided temporary "Exhibition Cafes" at the ''Scottish International Exhibition'', apparently set up and designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, though nothing is now known of his scheme for this. The menu card designed by [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald Mackintosh]] shows the name for the tearooms, ''[[Cockade|The White Cockade]]'', but makes no visual connection with this reference to [[Jacobitism]]. It gives credit for supply of cakes to Miss Cranstons Bakery, 292 St Vincent St., Glasgow.&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSA05208 | title = Kate Cranston | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Nathaniel | last= Harris | authorlink= | year= 1996 | title= The Life and Works of Rennie Mackintosh | edition= | publisher= Parragon Book Service Ltd. | location= Avonmouth | isbn=0-7525-1445-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mackintosh, Willow Tearooms Interior Study, 1917.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Design for ''The Dug Out''.]]
In 1916 Kate opened ''Cranston's Cinema De Luxe'' in an entertainment complex designed for her by the architect [[James Miller (architect)|James Miller]], occupying the third floor of a six-storey building in Renfield Street, Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSA00322 | title = Classic Cinema | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917 Mackintosh carried out his last commission for Kate Cranston, and indeed one of his last architectural works to be constructed, with the design of an extension of the Willow Tea Rooms into the basement of the building next door to create ''The Dug Out'' in a style that anticipated [[Art Deco]].&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;&lt;ref name=pocketguide/&gt;

Kate Cranston was greatly distressed when her husband died in 1917. She sold off her tea rooms and other businesses, and withdrew from public life. She had no children, and when she died in 1934 her will left two-thirds of her estate to the poor of Glasgow.&lt;ref name=famousscots/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:Room de Luxe2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Room de Luxe of the Willow Tearooms today.]]
Even though Kate Cranston had sold her tea rooms off, the name ''Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms'' long remained a byword for quality and for memories of Glasgow's heyday at the turn of the century. By 1938 tea rooms at 43 Argyll Arcade, 28 Buchanan Street, Renfield Street and Queen Street were being run by ''Cranston's Tea Rooms Ltd.'' They went into liquidation in 1954 and their premises were sold on for other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/cranston.html | title = Records of Cranston's Tea Rooms Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland | publisher = Archives Hub | accessdate = 5 May 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120723010038/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/cranston.html | archivedate = 23 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Willow Tearooms were renamed, then in 1928 they were sold on to Daly's department store who incorporated the premises into their shop, keeping the Room de Luxe in operation as the department store tea room.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

''Miss Cranston's Tearooms'' on Ingram Street continued in use as catering facilities from 1930 for ''Cooper's &amp; Co.'', then in 1950 the rooms came into the ownership of Glasgow City Council and were used for storage and a souvenir shop. In 1971 the furnishings were removed into storage when the building was demolished, and they are now the only original set of Mackintosh tearoom interiors to survive. Ownership was transferred to Glasgow Museums in 1978, and after a further period of storage restoration work began in 1993. The ''Ladies' Luncheon Room'' was exhibited three years later, and the ''Chinese Room'' and ''Cloister Room'' have since been restored. The Glasgow Museums website reports that they are "currently assessing what will be needed to research and preserve the Charles Rennie Mackintosh interiors of the Ingram Street Tearooms for future public display."&lt;ref name=glasgowmuseums/&gt; and prospective plans now exist to install at least some of the interiors at the new V&amp;A museum in Dundee.

[[Image:The Willow Tearooms Glasgow.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The restored Willow Tearooms building.]]
While Mackintosh's reputation was eclipsed by the 1920s, he was later recognised as a pioneer of [[modern architecture]], particularly in terms of the exterior of the Willow Tea Rooms. In the 1960s a resurgence of interest in [[Art Nouveau]] brought him international fame, and the furniture and designs he and his wife created for Kate Cranston are now extremely valuable.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

When Daly's closed, the Willow Tea Rooms were restored to an approximation of their original appearance. Catering reopened in the Room de Luxe, later extending to the recreated Tea Gallery, and was so successful that the business opened a new tearoom on the first floor of a building in Buchanan Street, near the original Buchanan Street and Ingram Street tearooms, fitted out with replicas of the White Dining Room and the Chinese Room from the Ingram Street tearoom. Confusingly, it trades under the name of ''The Willow Tea Rooms'', as this now appears to be more familiar to visitors than Miss Cranston's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.willowtearooms.co.uk/buchanan.htm | title = The Willow in Buchanan Street | publisher = The Willow Tearooms | accessdate = 5 May 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060414201720/http://www.willowtearooms.co.uk/buchanan.htm | archivedate = 14 April 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Commons category|Willow Tearooms}}
However, these new tearooms draw renewed attention to the contribution Kate's patronage made to Mackintosh's work, and the impact she had on the social life of Glasgow is still remembered in popular books such as ''Tea at Miss Cranston's''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Anna | last= Blair | authorlink= | year= 1985 | title= Tea at Miss Cranston's | edition= | publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn | location= London | isbn=0-85683-081-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continuing interest in Miss Cranston is also reflected in the prices realised for items associated with her tearooms; for example ₤940 for six pieces of cutlery stamped Miss Cranston's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIX PIECES OF CUTLERY designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for Miss Cranston's Tearooms, circa 1905|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=3908334|website=www.christies.com|publisher=Chirisite's|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, it was announced that Cranston would feature on a design for [[The Royal Bank of Scotland £20 note]] to be circulated in 2020, the first woman other than [[Queen Elizabeth II]] to be depicted on a [[Banknotes of Scotland|banknote of that denomination in that country]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/17001564.glasgow-pioneer-kate-cranston-honoured-on-new-20-note/|title=Glasgow pioneer Kate Cranston honoured on new £20 note|work=[[Evening Times]]|author=Caroline Wilson|date=23 October 2018|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (images of [[Nan Shepherd]] had been on a £5, [[Mary Somerville]] and [[Mary Slessor]] on a £10 and [[Elsie Inglis]] on a £50 in the past,&lt;ref name="Scotsman2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/new-rbs-bank-notes-to-feature-nan-shepherd-and-mary-somerville-1-4108245|title=New RBS bank notes to feature Nan Shepherd and Mary Somerville|date=25 April 2016|work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while notes issued by English banks had already featured [[Elizabeth Fry]], [[Florence Nightingale]] and [[Jane Austen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/bbc-journalist-mocked-for-saying-jane-austen-first-woman-on-bank-notes-a3634951.html|title='What about the Queen?': BBC journalist mocked for saying Jane Austen is first woman on bank notes |work=[[Evening Standard]]|author=Harriet Pavey|date=14 September 2017 |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De Tijd''''' ({{IPA-nl|də ˈtɛit|lang}}, ''The Times'') is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[newspaper]] that mainly focuses on business and economics. It is printed on salmon pink paper since May 2009, following the example of its colleagues ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[Het Financieele Dagblad]]'', ''[[Financial Times Deutschland|FT Deutschland]]'' and many more. 

==History and profile==
Established under the name of '''''De Financieel-Economische Tijd''''' (''"The Financial Economical Times"'') in 1968,&lt;ref name=bpress&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgium Titles |url=http://www.business-press.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=13 |work=Business Press |accessdate=4 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226003329/http://www.business-press.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=13 |archivedate=26 December 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyu&gt;{{cite web|title=European News Resources|url=http://guides.nyu.edu/content.php?pid=74313&amp;sid=704214|work=NYU Libraries|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003 the paper was renamed as ''De Tijd''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pieter Maeseele|title=On news media and democratic debate: Framing agricultural biotechnology in Northern Belgium|journal=The International Communication Gazette|date=2011|volume=73|issue=1-2|url=http://gaz.sagepub.com/content/73/1-2/83.full.pdf+html|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''De Tijd'' is owned by De Persgroep (50%) and Rossel (50%).&lt;ref name=bpress/&gt; The current [[editor-in-chief]] of ''De Tijd'' is Stephanie De Smedt. It is published in [[Dutch language]].&lt;ref name=nyu/&gt;

''De Tijd'' is a typical financial daily, covering economy and business, financial markets and national and international politics. The paper is the main information source for Belgian managers (CIM-survey 2009). It is published from Tuesday to Saturday&lt;ref name=bpress/&gt; with no Sunday or Monday edition. The weekend edition is enriched with two magazines:&lt;ref name=bpress/&gt; Netto, on personal finance, and Sabato on lifestyle. 

In March 2012 the paper began to be published in [[Berliner format]].&lt;ref name=ena/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New sizes for L'Echo and De Tijd|url=http://www.adnative.net/global/media-news-events/news-detail/?newsid=76186&amp;title=belgium-new-sizes-for-lecho-and-de-tijd#.VNPc02SsXRB|accessdate=5 February 2015|work=Adnative|date=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''De Tijd'' was named as the [[European Newspaper Award|Newspaper of the Year]] in the category of nationwide newspaper by the European Newspapers Congress in 2012.&lt;ref name=ena&gt;{{cite web|title=14th European Newspaper Award|url=http://www.editorial-design.com/13/e/Press_Release_14th_ENA.pdf|work=Editorial Design|accessdate=4 December 2014|format=Press Release|year=2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313051352/http://www.editorial-design.com/13/e/Press_Release_14th_ENA.pdf|archivedate=13 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mediafin ==
''De Tijd'' was established and financially supported by the [[Vlaams Economisch Verbond]]. In 2005, two major Belgian media conglomerates, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[De Persgroep]] which is the owner of ''[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]'' and ''[[De Morgen]]'' among others and the [[Walloon Region|Walloon]] [[Rossel (Belgium)|Rossel]] which is the owner of ''[[Le Soir]]'' among others purchased [[Uitgeversbedrijf Tijd]], the mother company of ''De Tijd'' and Editeco, the publishing company of ''[[L'Echo]]'', the [[French (language)|French]] counterpart. Both newspapers were integrated in the newly established [[Mediafin]], in which De Persgroep and Rossel each hold a stake of 50 percent.&lt;ref name=bpress/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Koen Panis et. al.|title=Does Media Cross-Ownership Translate into Cross-Promotion?|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2014|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2014.953780|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2014.953780|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both newspapers stayed independent, but they work in the same building at the historical site of [[Tour &amp; Taxis]] in [[Brussels]] since the merger.  Frederik Delaplace is editorial director of [[Mediafin]].

==Circulation==
The circulation of ''De Tijd'' was 59,144 copies and its market share was 4.7% in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Ward|title=A Mapping Study of Media Concentration and Ownership in Ten European Countries|url=http://77.87.161.246/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/A-Mapping-Study-of-Media-Concentration-and-Ownership-in-Ten-European-Countries.pdf|work=Dutch Media Authority|accessdate=12 August 2014|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circulation of the paper was 39,315 copies in 2008 and 36,569 copies in 2009.&lt;ref name=ifabc&gt;{{cite web|title=National newspapers total circulation|url=http://www.ifabc.org/site/assets/media/National-Newspapers_total-circulation_IFABC_09-07-12.xls|work=International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Circulations|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was 37,448 copies in 2010, 39,431 copies in 2011 and a total circulation of  41.065 (digital+print) in 2015.&lt;ref name=ifabc/&gt;

It reached 123.300 readers every day. ''De Tijd'' had an average market share of 6,4% in [[Flanders]].

{{Criminal defenses}}
In [[jurisprudence]], '''duress''' or '''coercion''' refers to a situation whereby a person performs an act as a result of violence, threat, or other pressure against the person. ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (6th ed.) defines duress as "any unlawful [[intimidation|threat]] or [[coercion]] used... to induce another to act [or not act] in a manner [they] otherwise would not [or would]". Duress is pressure exerted upon a person to coerce that person to perform an act they ordinarily would not perform. The notion of duress must be distinguished both from [[undue influence]] in the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]. In [[criminal law]], [[duress and necessity]] are different defenses.&lt;ref&gt;''[[People v. Unger]]'', 362 N.E.2d 319 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handbook on Criminal Law 381 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Duress has two aspects. One is that it negates the person's [[consent]] to an act, such as [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or the entering into a contract; or, secondly, as a possible [[defense (legal)|legal defense]] or justification to an otherwise unlawful act.&lt;ref name=Gaines&gt;{{cite book |last=Gaines |first=Larry |authorlink= |author2=Miller, LeRoy |title=Criminal Justice In Action: The Core |year=2006 |publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]] |location= |isbn=0-495-00305-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A defendant utilizing the duress defense admits to breaking the law, but claims that he/she is not [[Legal liability|liable]] because, even though the act broke the [[law]], it was only performed because of extreme unlawful pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pi1stclass.com/glossary.htm|title=1st Class Investigations Glossary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In criminal law, a duress defense is similar to a plea of guilty, admitting partial [[culpability]], so that if the defense is not accepted then the criminal act is admitted.

Duress or [[coercion]] can also be raised in an allegation of [[rape]] or other [[sexual assault]] to negate a defense of consent on the part of the person making the allegation.

==Discussion==
A defendant who raises a defense of duress has actually done everything to constitute the ''[[actus reus]]'' of the crime, and has the ''[[mens rea]]'' because they intended to do it to avoid some threatened or actual harm. Thus, some degree of [[culpability]] already attaches to the defendant for what was done. 

In criminal law, the defendant's motive for breaking the law is generally irrelevant unless a defendant is raising an [[affirmative defense]] allowed for by law. (Duress may or may not be allowed as an affirmative defence for some particular charge -- in particular, it is generally forbidden for [[murder]], and many jurisdictions also forbid it for [[sexual assault]]. ''[[Malum in se]]'' offences, generally, are less likely to recognise duress as a defence than ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' offences.)

A successful affirmative defence means not that a criminal act was justified, but that the act was not criminal at all. But if no affirmative defence of duress is available, then the duress may be considered as justifying a lighter [[sentence (law)|sentence]], typically in proportion to the degree of duress. If the duress is extreme enough, for example, the defendant might be found guilty of murder but given a minimal, or even trivial, sentence.

In some rare cases, a successful argument of duress -- even when not an affirmative defence -- might result in the jury [[Jury nullification|nullifying]] the charge by refusing to convict.

The basis of the defense is that the duress actually overwhelmed the defendant's will and would also have overwhelmed the will of a person of ordinary courage (a hybrid test requiring both subjective evidence of the accused's state of mind, and an objective confirmation that the failure to resist the threats was reasonable), thus rendering the entire behavior involuntary. Thus, the liability should be reduced or discharged, making the defense one of [[exculpation]].

The extent to which this defense should be allowed, if at all, is a matter of [[public policy]]. A state may say that no threat should force a person to deliberately break the law, particularly if this breach will cause significant loss or damage to a third person.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Alternatively, a state may take the view that even though people may have ordinary levels of courage, they may nevertheless be coerced into agreeing to break the law and this human weakness should have some recognition in the law.

A mutant of duress involves [[hostage]] taking, where a person is forced to commit a criminal act under the threat, say, that their family member or close associate will be immediately killed should they refuse (commonly known as a [[Tiger kidnapping]]).  This has been raised in some cases of [[ransom]], where a person commits theft or embezzlement under orders from a kidnapper in order to secure a family member's life and freedom.  However, duress is not a complete defense to all crimes.  For example, the general rule, both at common law and today, is that duress is never a defense to murder; that is, one is never justified in killing another innocent person even if one's own life has been threatened, although this part may be questioned when multiple people are threatened with death if the defendant does not kill a single or fewer people than threatened (such a situation is similar to the [[trolley problem]]).&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Anderson'', 8 Cal. 4th 767, 50 P.3d 368, 122 Cal. Rptr. 2d 587 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
For duress to qualify as a defense, four requirements must be met:&lt;ref name=Gaines /&gt;
# The threat must be of serious bodily harm or death
# The threatened harm must be greater than the harm caused by the crime
# The threat must be immediate and inescapable
# The defendant must have become involved in the situation through no fault of his own

A person may also raise a duress defense when force or violence is used to compel him to enter into a contract, or to discharge.

== In contract law ==
{{Contract law}}
''Duress'' in the context of contract law is a [[common law]] defence brought about when one of the parties to the contract enjoyed an ascendant position in relation to the other party and abused that position by subjecting the other to ''threats.'' A party who has entered into a contract under duress is entitled to rescind or set aside the contract, rendering it voidable (in equity).

Duress is a threat of harm made to compel someone to do something against their will or judgment; especially a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a manifestation of seeming assent by another person to a transaction without real volition. - Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004)

Duress in contract law falls into two broad categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4lawnotes.com/outlines/duress.htm|title=Duress : Introduction to Contracts Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical duress
* Economic duress&lt;ref&gt; See ''Pao On v Lau Yiu Long'' [1979] 3 All ER 65; [[Pao On v Lau Yiu Long]]; Applied in ''Con Ange v Calogo Bloodstock AG t/as Coolmore Australia'' [2012] NSWSC 666. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical duress===
====Duress to the person====
Professor Ronald Griffin, Florida Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College of Law, Orlando, FL, puts physical duress simply:  "Your money or your life."  
In ''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'' [1976] AC 104 [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1973/2.html BAILII]&lt;/ref&gt; a decision of the [[Privy Council]], Armstrong (defendant) sought to coerce Barton (plaintiff) into executing a deed relating to the sale of certain companies by threatening to have him murdered. While the plaintiff took the threats seriously, other business reasons existed for signing the contract. An innocent party wishing to set aside a contract for duress to the person need only prove that the threat was made and that it was a reason for entry into the contract. Furthermore, once it is established that the threat was made, the onus lies on the person who made the threat to prove that the threat made no contribution to the plaintiff's decision to enter the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Crescendo Management Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corp'' (1988) 19 NSWLR 40, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law took a narrow view of the concept of duress in that it was concerned with actual or threatened violence to the person or unlawful imprisonment. Equity, however, adopted a broader "fusion" view of what sort of pressure could constitute coercion for purposes of relief and has since prevailed. &lt;ref&gt;See J Paterson, A Robertson and A Duke, ''Principles of Contract Law'', (4th edn Thomson Reuters 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Duress to goods====
In such cases, one party refuses to release the goods belonging to the other party until the other party enters into a contract with them. For example, in ''Hawker Pacific Pty Ltd v Helicopter Charter Pty Ltd'' (1991) 22 NSWLR 298, the contract was set aside after Hawker Pacific's threats to withhold the helicopter from the plaintiff unless further payments were made for repairing a botched paint job.

===The elements of economic duress===

Economic duress is the use of unlawful economic pressure to compel a party to a contract to agree to demands which they would not have otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation (The Universe Sentinel) [1981] UKHL 9|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/9.html|website=Bailii|accessdate= 9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Wrongful or improper threat''': No precise definition of what is wrongful or improper.  Examples include: morally wrong, criminal, or tortious conduct; one that is a threat to breach a contract "in bad faith" or threaten to withhold an admitted debt "in bad faith".
#'''No reasonable alternative (but to accept the other party's terms)'''. If there is an available legal remedy, an available market substitute (in the form of funds, goods, or services), or any other sources of funds this element is not met.
#'''The threat actually induces the making of the contract'''. This is a subjective standard, and takes into account the victim's age, their background (especially their education), relationship of the parties, and the ability to receive advice.
#'''The other party caused the financial distress'''. The majority opinion is that the other party must have caused the distress, while the minority opinion allows them to merely take advantage of the distress.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} See ''Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation (The Universe Sentinel)'' [1981] UKHL 9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation (The Universe Sentinel) [1981] UKHL 9|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/9.html|website=Bailii|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insane duress==
In criminal law, when a person is found legally insane because they believed God ordered them to do the crime ("[[deific-decree]]"), one interpretation of the insanity is that they acted under a delusion of duress by God.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|615-625}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17171">{{main|Automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010}}

The Canadian auto industry is closely linked to the U.S., due to the [[Automotive Products Trade Agreement]] and later the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), and is in similar trouble.  Canada's 3,500 car dealers, which employ 140,000 people, told the federal and Ontario governments in mid-November they are at risk from the financial crisis; they are asking the national government to help out despite a record year{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} of sales.  Ottawa is considering providing financial aid to the Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three, and possibly auto parts companies as well. The auto industry argued that loan guarantees and other help would try to save tens of thousands of Canadian jobs threatened by the sudden drop in North American car sales. Chrysler Canada has asked for $1 billion in aid, making it the only Canadian arm of the Big Three to make a specific dollar request.

Industry analyst Anthony Faria criticized the labor contracts that [[Canadian Auto Workers]] then-president [[Buzz Hargrove]] negotiated with the [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big Three US automobile manufacturers]] in 2007, predicting that the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and currency would hit Canadian auto production especially hard. Faria noted that [[UAW]] president [[Ron Gettelfinger]] agreed to have the UAW's "all-in" wage, benefit and pension costs drop from a high of $75.86 per hour in 2007 to an average of about $51 per hour starting in 2010. By comparison, the CAW's cost per hour was $77 in 2007 and will rise to over $80 per hour by the end of the new contract. Faria said that Gettelfinger went into negotiations "with the right intention...Save jobs. The CAW strategy was to squeeze every dime out of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris Vander |last=Doelen |url=http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=63a938bc-58fa-4795-9ec4-10741d105193 |title=Thousands of CAW auto job losses predicted |work=The Windsor Star |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215053440/http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=63a938bc-58fa-4795-9ec4-10741d105193 |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hargrove was said to have "instilled backbone and an attitude that the union could always make the auto makers buckle at the bargaining table".&lt;ref name="business.theglobeandmail.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Derek Decloet |url=http://business.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090309.wdecloet0310/BNStory/robColumnsBlogs/home |title=reportonbusiness.com: Columns and Blogs |publisher=Business.theglobeandmail.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313035141/http://business.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090309.wdecloet0310/BNStory/robColumnsBlogs/home |archivedate=2009-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current union president [[Ken Lewenza, Sr.|Ken Lewenza]] has argued that labor is not responsible for the bankruptcy crisis facing the Big Three automakers, saying that his members would not make concessions part of any taxpayer-funded bailout. "We don't see this as us being the problem", Lewenza said, adding he would "absolutely not" accept any further cuts after losing tens of thousands of jobs in recent years. "We've suffered our share of pain."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5grcl5q0uPoqkOoWENxe22Q3dbqwg]{{dead link|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lawenza argued that the CAW agreed in 2007 to make concessions that will save the Big Three $900 million over three years.&lt;ref&gt;"Car dealers plead for government help," 
[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081121.wcdeals1121/BNStory/National/home ''The Canadian Press'' Nov. 21, 2008 online]; "Labour rates not a problem in auto industry: Lewenza," [http://www.edmontonsun.com/Business/News/2008/11/20/7474801.html Canadian Press, Nov. 20, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123013323/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081121.wcdeals1121/BNStory/National/home |date=November 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesman for the [[Canadian Taxpayers Federation]] has criticized the CAW's "no-concession" stance, saying that it only serves to strengthen the opposition to a taxpayer-funded bailout for the struggling Detroit Three automakers. The CTF further pointed out that "It is especially difficult to understand anyone asking for government help that refuses to do anything to help itself to begin with", since they "fail to realize they've existed at the substantial largesse of taxpayers for decades".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Grace |last=Macaluso |url=http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=c07f9882-2f99-4479-b067-831ac302129a |title=Lewenza 'petulant' child |work=The Windsor Star |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215051012/http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=c07f9882-2f99-4479-b067-831ac302129a |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly McParland, a columnist for the [[National Post]], has suggested that "if he won't give anything, he and his members are likely to lose everything." He also said that the problem facing the North American auto industry was borne equally by management and labor alike, criticizing labor for building up pay and benefits for themselves that was as unsustainable as it was enviable, while attacking management for its short-term strategy of selling gas-guzzling trucks and sales tactics (price cuts, rebates, free gas and cash-back schemes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kelly |last=McParland |url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2008/11/19/kelly-mcparland-stop-the-revolution-the-caw-wants-to-get-off.aspx |title=Kelly McParland: Stop the revolution, the CAW wants to get off |publisher=National Post |date=November 19, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-12 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CTF has opposed the proposed $3.5 CAD billion bailout for Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three, saying that it was an unfair financial burden on the average Canadian, as well as another excuse for the Detroit automakers to postpone much needed change. The CTF noted that federal and provincial governments spent $782-million in the past five years on the Big Three, saying "These have been a bottomless pit of requests for cash". Lewenza disagreed, saying that the bailout should be seen by Canadians as a loan that will be paid back when the country's economy is prosperous again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Linda |last=Nguyen |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=1073285 |title=Canadian taxpayers and auto union butt heads over bailout |agency=Canwest News Service |publisher=National Post |date=2008-12-13 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |df= }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, the government of Canada and the province of [[Ontario]] offered $3.3 billion in loans to the auto industry. Under the plan [[General Motors|GM]] will receive $3 billion and [[Chrysler]] will receive the rest. [[Ford]] only asked for a line of credit but will not be participating in the bailout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Austen |first=Ian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/business/worldbusiness/21canada.html?ref=business |title=Canada Agrees to Its Own Auto Industry Bailout |location=Canada |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAW negotiated a cost-cutting deal with General Motors Canada on March 8, 2009. The deal would extend the current contract for an additional year to September 2012, and preserves the current average assembly-worker base pay of about $34 an hour. It would eliminate a $1,700 annual "special bonus," and reduce special paid absences or "SPA days" from two weeks to one week a year, while maintaining vacation entitlements which range up to six weeks a year for high-seniority workers. The deal also introduce payments by members toward their health benefits - $30 monthly per family for workers and $15 a month for pensioners. Lewenza said it also would trim by 35 per cent company contributions to union-provided programs such as child care and wellness programs. Lewenza called the package a "major sacrifice." However, observers noted that the deal did not go far enough; DBRS analyst Kam Hon described it as "not material." Automotive industry consultant [[Dennis DesRosiers]] said that General Motors had missed the chance to slash labour costs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/CityandRegion/2009/03/09/8687446.html |title=London Free Press - City &amp; Region - GM missed the boat, auto analyst says |publisher=Lfpress.ca |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2009-05-01}}{{dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that bankruptcy was a looming threat, Ottawa and Queen's Park demanded cuts to the labour bill as a condition of the bailout, and that the deficit to the pension fund would prevent the CAW from striking.&lt;ref name="business.theglobeandmail.com"/&gt; He estimated the total hourly cost of a GM Canada worker, including benefits, is $75 to $78, and saying that "they [GM] got six or seven" when it should have been cut by $20. DesRosiers also said giving up cost-of-living increases is not significant when inflation is nearly non-existent and added that the 40-hour reduction in [[paid time off]] merely means "five fewer spa days." [[University of Toronto]] professor Joe D'Cruz calculated that it would save $148 million a year, though GM is seeking $6 billion in Canadian government support.

The agreement is contingent on Canada being allocated 20% of GM's North American, and getting billions of dollars in federal and provincial taxpayer support, which Lewenza stressed will be loans. However, some suggested that this would not be the final time that automakers would request a bailout.&lt;ref name="financialpost1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=1343240 |title=John Ivison: Automotive bailout must not be free ride |publisher=Financialpost.com |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2009-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402161023/http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=1343240 |archivedate=2009-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Dennis DesRosiers estimated that GM will go through its government loans in a couple of quarters, long before any recovery in the market. Furthermore, GM Canada president Arturo Elias had admitted to MP [[Frank Valeriote]] that GM had pledged all its assets worldwide to the U.S. government in order to secure the first [[tranche]] of a US$30-billion loan, leaving no assets to collateralize the $6 billion loan from the Canadian government. The Canadian Taxpayers' Federation noted that between 1982 and 2005, Ottawa handed out over $18.2 billion to corporations, of which only $7.1 billion was repayable, and only $1.3 billion was ever repaid.
&lt;ref name="financialpost2"/&gt;

Chrysler vice-chairman and president [[Thomas W. LaSorda]] (himself the son of a CAW official) and Ford's chief of manufacturing Joe Hinrichs said that the GM-CAW deal was insufficient, suggesting that they would break the CAW's negotiating pattern set by GM.

On March 31, 2009, the Canadian federal and Ontario governments jointly rejected the restructuring plans submitted by GM and Chrysler. This came a day after US President [[Barack Obama]] had rejected the plans of their parent companies. Both federal Industry Minister [[Tony Clement]] and Ontario Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]] suggested the CAW's initial deal was insufficient in cutting costs and the union had return to the bargaining table to make further concessions, in order to show that taxpayers' money is justified.

'''Emil Pathric William Christensen''' (born 14 June 1984 in [[Stockholm]]), known as '''HeatoN''', is an [[esports]] manager and former [[Sweden|Swedish]] professional ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' player, formerly playing as captain of the gaming team [[Ninjas in Pyjamas]] (NiP). HeatoN was the manager of NiP up until October 2018 when he decided to part ways with the organisation to focus on his own brand. He is widely considered one of the best ''Counter-Strike'' players of all time.

==Career==
The name HeatoN comes from a brand of equipment, which is now owned by [[CCM (ice hockey)|CCM]], he used when he played [[ice hockey]]. Emil's first hobby was ice hockey, but he retired because of an injury. A friend (CS player fRa1L, from RevolutioN) told him to try Counter-Strike. Christensen was part of the original Ninjas in Pyjamas team of 2001 which won the [[Cyberathlete Professional League]] World Championship that year. He and the other members of Ninjas in Pyjamas went on to become the foundation to the highly successful [[SK Gaming|SK Sweden]], one of the most successful teams in [[electronic sports]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcgames.gwn.com/news/story.php/id/2951 |title=pcgames.gwn.com |publisher=pcgames.gwn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213032116/http://pcgames.gwn.com/news/story.php/id/2951 |archivedate=13 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen led SK Gaming to the [[World Cyber Games]] Counter-Strike championship in 2003 and to 4th place in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcg.com/6th/tournament/2003/tm_match_medalist_cs.asp?sort=G041108114 |title=WCG Official Website |publisher=Wcg.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302124000/http://www.wcg.com/6th/tournament/2003/tm_match_medalist_cs.asp?sort=G041108114 |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcg.com/6th/tournament/2004/tm_match_single_cs.html |title=WCG Official Website |publisher=Wcg.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302124007/http://www.wcg.com/6th/tournament/2004/tm_match_single_cs.html |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HeatoN and NiP competed in the [[World Series of Video Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19618154/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/video-gamers-try-bust-lazy-boy-image/#.Vl0ZNXYrLIU|title=video-gamers-try-bust-lazy-boy-image|first=Will |last=Graves|date=July 5, 2007|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen was nominated for Best Counter-Strike Player of the Year in 2004, losing out to SK Gaming teammate, Tommy "potti'" Ingemarsson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esports-award.org/history/nominees2004/ |title=eSports Journalist Award :: |publisher=Esports-award.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223101106/http://www.esports-award.org/history/nominees2004/ |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected for the Global Gaming League European Counter-Strike All-Star team in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gotfrag.com/cs/story/28281/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313112337/http://www.gotfrag.com/cs/story/28281/ |date=13 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 2005 he and the rest of SK Sweden chose not to renew their contracts with SK Gaming and re-formed NiP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sk-gaming.com/scene/6874/ |title=Counter-Strike: The Ninjas Are Back |publisher=SK Gaming |date=1 January 2005 |accessdate=2013-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001115/http://www.sk-gaming.com/scene/6874/ |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then some of the NiP players moved back to SK Gaming but Christensen and others have stayed on at Ninjas in Pyjamas. NiP are now competing at professional LAN tournaments again, after a hiatus in which SpawN joined after HeatoN decided to take time off for personal reasons.

Christensen, along with the other members of Ninjas in Pyjamas, assisted in the design of the SteelSound 5H (USB) Headphones produced by [[SteelSeries]].

In December 2006 he travelled to New York and Dallas to provide support for his teammates as they competed in the [[World Series of Video Games]] (WSVG) world finals and CPL winter respectively. NiP were expected to be strong contenders in both tournaments, however bowed out uncharacteristically early.

In September 2007 HeatoN quit playing ''Counter-Strike'' to be coach of NiP but was then offered a chance to be a general manager for Stockholm in the [[Championship Gaming Series]] (CGS). HeatoN's CGS franchise was called the [[Stockholm Magnetik]] and had a ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'' team, one male and one female ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]'' player, a ''[[FIFA 08]]'' player, and two ''[[Forza Motorsport 2]]'' players.

After the CGS's folding in late 2008 Christensen moved to promote a [[computer hardware]] company named Qpad,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qpadusa.com/news/5/HeatoN_Signs_With_QPAD ]{{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from his native country Sweden, for the first part of 2009. Later in the year however, he left Qpad to join with his former teammate Abdisamad "SpawN" Mohamed in product development at ZOWIE GEAR which is a manufacturer of competitive gaming gear, founded late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zowiegear.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=2 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928010020/http://www.zowiegear.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=2 |date=28 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, ZOWIE GEAR announced HeatoN's first series of mice co-developed by himself called EC after player's initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zowiegear.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=130&amp;Itemid=2 |title=South America W2B |publisher=Zowie Gear |date= |accessdate=2013-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114215720/http://www.zowiegear.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=130&amp;Itemid=2 |archivedate=14 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012 ZOWIE GEAR announced a new version of the EC series, named the EC eVo series which features an improved optical sensor and was released in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zowiegear.com/component/content/article/216-introducing-the-ec-evo |title=Introducing the EC eVo |publisher=Zowie Gear |date= |accessdate=2013-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125064942/http://www.zowiegear.com/component/content/article/216-introducing-the-ec-evo |archivedate=25 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Christensen returned to Ninjas in Pyjamas and became the organization's manager.

In September 2015 Christensen and two other formers NiP owners were charged with misleading an [[Financial audit|auditor]] about Ninjas in Pyjamas AB's finances during its sale to [[Diglife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/counter-strike-nip-heaton/|title=Counter-Strike legend may face jail time|first=Jared|last=Wynne|website=The Daily Dot|date=September 29, 2015|accessdate=November 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111064032/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/counter-strike-nip-heaton/|archive-date=11 January 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen was found guilty of [[fraud]], and was sentenced pay a fine and perform [[community service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/heaton-sentenced-accounting-fraud/|title=Counter-Strike legend HeatoN guilty of carelessness in accounting fraud case, avoids jail time|first=Samuel|last=Lingle|website=The Daily Dot|date=October 30, 2015|accessdate=November 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111064032/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/heaton-sentenced-accounting-fraud/|archive-date=11 January 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 HeatoN became the first person inducted into the [[ESL Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/heaton-counter-strike-esports-hall-of-fame/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050356/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/heaton-counter-strike-esports-hall-of-fame/ |archive-date=30 June 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2777">'''Francis Bulkeley Johnson''' (1828–1887) was member of the [[Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.]] and member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]].

==Biography==
Johnson joined the [[Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.]] in 1861 and was later admitted as a partner in 1866 when James MacAndrew ceased to be with the company.

Johnson was appointed to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] on 17 May 1881, during [[William Keswick]] absent on leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hongkong Government Gazette|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1881/681451.pdf|date=21 May 1881|number=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also acted as [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaiian]] Consulate General and [[Kingdom of Denmark|Danish]] Consulate for William Keswick in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hongkong Government Gazette|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1881/681292.pdf|date=30 April 1881|number=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also Chairman of the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]] between 1882 and 1883.

During his service on the Legislative Council, he introduced the bill for the Tramways Ordinance for the construction of the [[Hongkong Tramways]] in 1881. The bill was subsequently passed in June 1883 and was operated in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hongkong Government Gazette|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1883/676075.pdf|date=16 June 1883|number=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, he was also appointed to the Commission of enquiring the alleged opium smuggling as well as other goods from Hong Kong into China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hongkong Government Gazette|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1883/674986.pdf|date=13 January 1883|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1883, the government enacted the Johnson's Wharves and Piers Ordinance to authorise Johnson to construct piers and wharfs in the [[Victoria Harbour]] for the Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hongkong Government Gazette|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1883/677545.pdf|date=20 December 1883|number=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulkeley Street in [[Hung Hom]] was named after him. His son, [[Charles Bulkeley Bulkeley-Johnson]] was a highly decorated British cavalry general who died in the [[First World War]].

==Early life==

Born in [[Borşa|Borșa]], [[Maramureş County|Maramureș County]], he graduated from a [[vocational school]] for [[auto mechanic]]s. He left [[Romania]] and settled as a refugee in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Australia.&lt;ref name="centrul"&gt;Centrul Român pentru Jurnalism de Investigaţii [http://www.crji.org/arhiva/e_020522.htm "Vasile Frank Timiş, the Mastermind Behind the 'Roşia Montană' Operation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623075309/http://www.crji.org/arhiva/e_020522.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst in Australia he was convicted of possession of heroin with intent to supply and fined A$27,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Career==

===Companies in Australia===

Timiș started his own transport company in Australia, which owned only one truck driven by himself. However, it went bankrupt in 1986 with debts of 15,806 AUD. According to [[Jurnalul Naţional|Jurnalul Național]], Timiș failed to declare this fact in the CV he published when he listed the company [[Gabriel Resources]] on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]], as required by law.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"&gt;Radu, Paul Christian, [[Jurnalul National]], [http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol.php?id=828 "Viaţa secretǎ a lui Vasile Frank Timiş"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115025127/http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol.php?id=828 |date=15 November 2006 }} 23 June 2005 [http://www.rosiamontana.org/documents/english/secretfrank2005.htm (English translation)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071202/http://www.rosiamontana.org/documents/english/secretfrank2005.htm |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, he became the CEO of Morwest Holdings Pty Ltd, the first of his gold mining businesses. Timiș and two Australian miners dug for six months for gold in a region called [[Mosquito Creek (Australia)|Mosquito Creek]], but the result was a failure. In the meantime, he founded another three companies: Riverdale Mining, Timis Corporation, and Carpathian Investments, together with Ioana Timiș and his sister, Ioana Majdik. However, these companies were liquidated by Timiș, and all creditors were paid in full.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"/&gt;

Another setback was Timiș' investment in Pneumatic Systems International Pty Ltd. In 2001, he quit his investment and kept only 11.6% of the company, administered via a new company, Regal Group Services, in the [[British Virgin Islands]] [[tax haven]]. According to an ex-manager of the company, in 2003, those shares were worth under $1,500 AUD.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"/&gt;

Regal Group Services changed its name and headquarters, and is currently listed on the London Stock Exchange as [[Regal Petroleum]]. This company is associated with a Romanian company, Global Mineral Resources, owned by a son of a former Romanian senator of the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]], [[Teodor Hăucă]], who used to be secretary of the Economic Commission of the Romanian Senate between 1996 and 2000.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"/&gt;

===Gabriel Resources===
{{main article|Gabriel Resources|Roşia Montană}}

In 1995, Timiș founded Gabriel Resources NL Australia, and in the autumn of the same year, the Romanian state-owned mining company "Regia Autonomă a Cuprului din [[Deva, Romania|Deva]]" (RAC) announced that it was searching for a partnership with a foreign company for the mining of [[precious metals]] from the [[tailings]] in [[Roşia Montană|Roșia Montană]] and [[Gurabarză-Brad]]. However, [[Jurnalul Naţional|Jurnalul Național]] claims that it has documents indicating a collaboration signed by RAC Deva and Gabriel Resources one day before the announcement was published, on 4 September 1995.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"/&gt; Also, RAC claimed it received several offers, including from another Australian company, Lycopodium Pty Ltd., but that company has denied RAC's claim.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"/&gt;

According to ASIC, in April 1996, Gabriel Resources NL had financial problems with its creditors, including the [[National Australia Bank]] Ltd, and Timiș started a new company after paying all creditors in full, Gabriel Resources Limited, registered in the Jersey tax haven. The mining contract was redirected to the new company.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"/&gt; Timiș had an 80% stake in the joint company. The Romanian Agency of Mineral Resources declared that the new contract was unfavourable to the Romanian state, but it was allowed by the Government after a parliamentary vote.&lt;ref name="catavencu"&gt;[[Academia Caţavencu]], [http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_20433-Frank-Timis-a-inhatat-aurul-din-Apuseni-printr-o-caruta-de-falsuri-iar-Tariceanu-a-inchis-ochii.htm "Frank Timis a inhatat aurul din Apuseni printr-o caruta de falsuri, iar Tariceanu a inchis ochii"] 19 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Timiș had access to various databanks of the Romanian research institutes of mineralogy and got data on the area. His company also hired relevant scientists and an ex-officer of the Topographic Department of the Romanian Ministry of Defence who mapped the area.&lt;ref name="catavencu"/&gt;

Gabriel Resources sent 80 tonnes of ore to a research lab in Australia to measure the gold content. The ore was high in gold, and the market value of Gabriel Resources soared to $75 million. Timiș obtained a $3 million loan from the [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|Rothschild]] bank in the United States. Between 1999–2000, the area being mined was increased from 12&amp;nbsp;km² to 22&amp;nbsp;km², and then to 42.8&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name="catavencu"/&gt;

The resulting project in [[Rosia Montana|Roșia Montana]] has been a source of much controversy, with local people lining up on both sides of the issue, and some national and international environmental groups joining the opposition. One source of controversy involved the method used for mining, [[gold cyanidation]], which causes pollution. The company hopes to eventually extract 300 tonnes of gold and 1600 tonnes of silver from the area but the project is currently on hold.

===Regal Petroleum===
{{main article|Regal Petroleum}}

Regal Petroleum, founded by Timiș in November 1996, was listed on the London [[Alternative Investment Market]] and owned some oil and gas resources in Romania and Ukraine. However, it became famous after the September 2003 acquisition of 60% of an oilfield located in [[Kavala]], Greece. The Regal board hoped that the company's survey team had found one of the largest oil deposits in Europe: up to a billion barrels. The oil was allegedly under so much pressure that it almost destroyed the drilling platform.&lt;ref name="SundayTimes"&gt;[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] 22 May 2005 [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/article134708.ece "Focus: The gusher"]&lt;/ref&gt;

This hype drove Regal's share price up to a peak of 509p, with the company's [[market value]] reaching £500m, making it one of the highest-valued companies of the Alternative Investment Market. Many private investors and respectable institutions (including [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Commerzbank]], Artemis and [[Schroders]]) invested more than £45m in the company. Days later, Timiș secretly agreed to sell the company's assets&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,3604,1510911,00.html "New Regal shock as ex-chairman's secret sell-off deal is revealed"] 21 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the resigned as chief executive of the company.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]], [http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,3604,1501503,00.html "Regal chairman resigns "] 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-2005, it was clear that Regal's oil field contained oil but not in commercial amounts. The flow rates were around 30 barrels a day and "deemed to be non-commercial".&lt;ref name="SundayTimes"/&gt; In a few hours, the stock fell by more than 60%, and as of June 2006, the share price was at 65p, less than 20% of the peak price. In 2010, the company was still worth about £200m, and had cash reserves of £80m,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citywire.co.uk/News/NewsArticle.aspx?VersionID=83185&amp;MenuKey=News.Home "Regal losses widen after 'difficult' year"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 27 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, Regal lost its Ukraine gas production license in a trial but got it back through appeal one year later.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]], [https://www.theguardian.com/oil/story/0,,1699352,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, an environmental group, Alburnus Maior, asked the Romanian Supreme Court, under the freedom of information laws, whether Timiș was under any investigations. The answer was that his name was linked with three dossiers investigated by the organised crime department. However, Timiș denied all the claims and no charges were ever filed.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Independent]], [http://www.rosiamontana.org/documents/english/press/indy2005.htm "Regal's Timis named in Romania organised crime investigation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071219/http://www.rosiamontana.org/documents/english/press/indy2005.htm |date=28 September 2007 }} 6 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Later queries to the Romanian administration on this subject were given the answer that there are no investigations concerning Timiș.&lt;ref&gt;[[Averea]], [http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_23909-Dosarele-lui-Frank-Timis-s-au-evaporat.htm "Dosarele lui Frank Timis s-au evaporat"] 6 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the collapse in the share price of this company, the Alternative Investment Market decided in 2006 to toughen regulations for companies in the natural resources sector and to hire experts who would prevent future bubbles followed by price fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Accountancy Age, [http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2158341/aim-recruits-beef-rules AIM recruits to beef up rules"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823174041/http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2158341/aim-recruits-beef-rules |date=23 August 2006 }} 15 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has, however, recently been given back licences that had been frozen by the government, and has begun to produce oil again.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===African Minerals (AMI.L, was Sierra Leone Diamond Corporation)===
In 2005, the Timiș Trust bought 30% of the shares of the Sierra Leone Diamond Corporation, via the Trust's Bermuda-registered Timis Diamond Corporation Limited. SLDC holds mineral rights over a third of the area of [[Sierra Leone]] in the northern part of the country,&lt;ref&gt;Awareness Times Newspaper, Sierra Leone [http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200575.shtml "Romanian buys more Sierra Leone Diamonds shares"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618183850/http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200575.shtml |date=18 June 2006 }}, 22 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; including some important diamond fields and the Tonkolili &amp; Marampa Iron Ore Projects. The company is also exploring for uranium at Lovetta, and for gold and base metals in the [[Sula Mountains]], Gori Hills and Nimini Hills. On 16 August 2007 the [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM]]-listed company was renamed African Minerals Limited (AMI.L) to reflect these other interests.,&lt;ref&gt;London Stock Exchange RNS, [http://www.londonstockexchange.com/LSECWS/IFSPages/MarketNewsPopup.aspx?id=1555088 Change of Name]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2010 AMI announced an initial Mineral Resource estimate of over 10 billion tonnes of iron ore (independently valued) at an average grade of 29.9% Total Iron in the Numbara and Simbili targets at Tonkolili.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.londonstockexchange.com/LSECWS/IFSPages/MarketNewsPopup.aspx?id=2081364&amp;source=RNS | title= 4.7 Billion Tonne Initial Resource Estimate Confirms Tonkolili Iron Ore Project As World Class | publisher=London Stock Exchange | last=African Minerals Limited | date=2 February 2009 | accessdate=2 February 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Timiș, who is executive chairman of the company, increased his shareholding to 34% in June 2006&lt;ref&gt;London Stock Exchange RNS, [http://www.londonstockexchange.com/LSECWS/IFSPages/MarketNewsPopup.aspx?id=1251501 Directors Share Dealings]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 29 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and to 34.6% (40,875,002 shares) in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;London Stock Exchange RNS, [http://www.londonstockexchange.com/LSECWS/IFSPages/MarketNewsPopup.aspx?id=1308488 Directors Share Dealings]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 29 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009|02}} the entire company was worth £45m (US$65m).

In 2015, Frank Timis together with then CEO Alan Watling and CFO Matthew Hird took African Minerals into administration. The company has been forced to sell its 75% share to Shandong Iron and Steel Group for a grossly undervalued sum. Half year results for AMI were impressive, the Company posted a quarterly production of 4mt – an improvement of 81% on the prior 3 months. In January 2014 AMI  hit its operating capacity for the first time, producing 5.3mt and exporting 4.6mt in the first quarter. Earnings for the Company were US$203m in 2013 compared with a US$26.5m in 2012. Despite the best efforts of the team and management, the continued downturn in iron ore prices, slowing global growth and China’s appetite and the Ebola crisis (which infected almost 15,000 and claimed 4,000 lives) left AMI exposed.  The downturn in iron ore prices from US$128.12 in January 2014 decreased rapidly over coming months reaching US$68 in December 2014 and US$63 in February 2015. This combined with the Ebola crises created a perfect storm for the beleaguered mining company. Shandong refused to release remaining funds (US$100m) and their lawyers Linklater’s recognised a perfect opportunity to take over buying 75% of AMI shares at a grossly undervalued price and through a process that was anything but transparent. The Board, management and Timis fought passionately to keep the company from going to administration, but given the perfect storm it was facing and like many other junior mining Companies then and since, there was no alternative but administration.
Timis lost all of his $450m investment as did the institution investors, shareholders and bond holders. AMI is now operating as Shan Steel under Chinese leadership.

=== African Petroleum ===
Timiș was formerly the non-executive chairman of African Petroleum, he stepped off the board and any role in Governance in African Petroleum in October 2014 and this remained a precondition of the subsequent and current listing on the Oslo Bors.

''For the art, see [[stained glass fusing]].''

'''Fusing''' is a type of [[manufacturing]] process for joining or terminating [[electromagnet|electrical magnet]] wire, that is coated with a varnish (film) type [[Electrical insulation|insulation]], to itself or some type of electrical terminal, without prior removal of the insulation. During the fusing process, the varnish film insulation is [[vaporize]]d automatically. The entire process takes between a quarter of a second to 50 seconds, depending upon the [[geometry]] of the wires being joined.

'''George Henry Birch''' (1862–1917) was an Australian businessman, best known for co-founding the [[Birch, Carroll &amp; Coyle]] cinema chain, with [[E. J. Carroll]], Dan Carroll and Virgil Coyle.

==Early life==
Birch was born in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull, Yorkshire]] in 1862,&lt;ref name=obit&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/53821756 Personal News], ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]'', 20 August 1917. Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; but migrated to Australia as a young man, where he commenced work as a customs officer at the [[Customs House, Rockhampton|Rockhampton Customs Department]] in Queensland.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Hotel management career==
After his marriage to Mary Ann Cannon on 3 October 1888&lt;ref&gt;Australia, Marriage Index (1788–1950), page 2245&lt;/ref&gt; Birch resigned from his customs job to begin a career managing hotels, beginning with the Grand Hotel&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/52272832 Advertising: The Grand Hotel, Emu Park], G.H. Birch, ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]'', 9 November 1888. Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; in the seaside village of [[Emu Park, Queensland|Emu Park]] with his wife.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

From 1892, Birch became the lessee of the Union Hotel and Theatre Royale in Rockhampton before taking over the [[Criterion Hotel, Rockhampton|Criterion Hotel]] from 1903.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Following his death in 1917, Birch's widow Mary successfully applied for a hotelier's licence&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/69807387 Licencing Court], ''[[The Capricornian]]'', 1 September 1917. Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; enabling her to continue managing the Criterion Hotel until 1922, when she transferred the licence to Henry Prior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/54022524 Notice of Application for Transfer of Licensed Victualler's License], ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]'', 13 May 1922. Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment career==
In 1909, Birch formed a partnership with Edward "E.J" Carroll&lt;ref&gt;[https://ozvta.com/entrepreneurs-a-f Entrepreneurs: George H. Birch], Australian Variety Theatre Archive. Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; who had been awarded the exhibition rights to show movies from J &amp; N Tait's Moving Pictures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/carroll-edward-john-5513 Carroll, Edward John(1868–1931)], A.F. Pike and Martha Rutledge, Australian Dictionary of Biography (Volume 7), 1979. Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Birch allowed Carroll to exhibit films at his hotels, forming the foundations of a fledgling business partnership with Carroll and his younger brother Dan Carroll, which ultimately led to the founding of Birch &amp; Carroll.

===Earl's Court===
In 1910, Birch acquired the site of a previous open-air cinema in Rockhampton which was originally established by brothers Harry and [[Ben Goodson]] the previous year.  When the Goodson brothers closed the site, Birch upgraded and expanded the site to accommodate 1500 patrons.  It was re-opened as "Earl's Court" on 24 September 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/53194198 Earl's Court], ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]'', 24 September 1910. Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the successful launch of Earl's Court, Birch &amp; Carroll continued their business partnership which included purchasing properties&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/53333008 Messrs Carroll &amp; Birch], ''The Morning Bulletin'', 1 May 1914. Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and managing live entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/53302195 Birch and Carroll's Vaudeville Company], ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]'', 13 June 1913. Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Birch and Carroll began a business relationship with Townsville hotelier Virgil Coyle when Townsville's Olympia Theatre opened under their joint direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/62550450 Olympia Pictures], ''[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]]'', 23 November 1912. Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Coyle's name was incorporated into the business name in 1923 when his Townsville theatres were added to the chain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/lifestyle/history/credits-roll-for-citys-openair-playhouse/news-story/04545a4841503ba055524ad8b94666dd Credits roll for city's open-air playhouse], Ian Frazer, ''[[Townsville Bulletin]]'', 1 February 215. Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his death in 1917, Birch's widow Mary, who was also a partner in the company, worked to ensure her late husband's vision of building a new enclosed theatre on the site was realised.&lt;ref name=Earls&gt;[https://queenslanddecoproject.com/2016/02/17/earls-court Earl's Court, Rockhampton: A Lost Art Deco cinema], 17 February 2016, Queensland Deco Project. Retrieved 26 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following negotiations, Birch Carroll &amp; Coyle announced plans for the new theatre in August 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/55986524 New Earl's Court Theatre: Construction Work To Start Shortly], ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]'', 10 August 1938. Retrieved 26 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the company engaged a Sydney-based architect of Art Deco cinemas to work alongside local Rockhampton architects, a seven-month project commenced costing £50,000.  The open air theatre was transformed into an Art Deco theatre consisting of a large barn-like enclosure with a hard-top roof and a stepped, brick façade lit with neon tubing.&lt;ref name=Earls/&gt; The new 2500-seat Earl's Court reopened on 19 July 1939, becoming one of the biggest single-floor cinemas in Australia.&lt;ref name=Earls/&gt;

Earl's Court was eventually further modernised into an air conditioned twin-cinema complex which continued operating until 2000.&lt;ref name=Earls/&gt; When Birch Carroll &amp; Coyle constructed the much larger multi-level six-cinema complex in North Rockhampton adjacent to [[Stockland Rockhampton|Rockhampton Shopping Fair]] in 1998, the company attempted to keep the older cinema in the city centre open.  However, it struggled against the newer complex and its popularity waned, making it unviable for the company.  When the old cinema closed, it ended a 90-year relationship between the site and the company.

Following the theatre's closure, [[St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Rockhampton|St Andrew's Presbyterian Church]] purchased the building and moved into the old theatre from their heritage-listed site.  The church continues to use the site for their regular Sunday services and as their main regional office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rockypc.org.au/find-us Rockhampton Presbyterian Church: Find Us], Rockhampton Presbyterian Church website. Retrieved 26 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wintergarden===
Following Birch's death in 1917, and after Coyle was officially incorporated into the company in 1923, the company opened a new theatre in Rockhampton, as part of a plan to add a network of Wintergarden theatres across Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qhatlas.com.au/content/regional-cinema Regional cinema], Denis Cryle, Queensland Historical Atlas, 3 November 2010.

Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; During the official opening ceremony, it was publicly remarked that the late George Birch, who was described as "Rockhampton's grand old picture man", had always wished that Rockhampton should have a picture theatre of the Wintergarden's kind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/55230089 An Impressive Opening with the "First Nighters"], ''The Morning Bulletin'', 13 January 1925. Retrieved 11 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

'''Sir Henry Yule Braddon''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|KBE|size=85%}} (27 April 1863 &amp;ndash; 8 September 1955) was an Australian diplomat, businessman and [[rugby union]] player who played for [[Otago Rugby Football Union|Otago]], [[New South Wales Rugby Union|New South Wales]] and [[All Blacks|New Zealand]]. The position he generally played in was [[Fullback (rugby union)|fullback]]. He is listed as the second [[All Black]] in playing order.&lt;ref name="AB profile"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://stats.allblacks.com/asp/Profile.asp?ABID=81 |title = Henry Braddon | last = Luxford | first = Bob | publisher = New Zealand Rugby Union | accessdate = 16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born on 27 April 1863 in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India to [[premier of Tasmania]], [[Edward Braddon|Sir Edward Braddon]]. He moved to [[Invercargill]] in 1882 on transfer with the [[Bank of Australasia]]. He played his club rugby for [[Invercargill Rugby Club (Blues)|Invercargill Rugby Club]] but his provincial rugby for [[Otago Rugby Football Union|Otago]] as the Invercargill-centred [[Southland Rugby Football Union]] did not split away from Otago until 1887. He was selected for the first New Zealand international team, and played in seven of the eight games in Australia in 1884 and is recognised as an Otago's first All Black despite playing in Invercargill at the time of his selection. Braddon later played for [[New South Wales Waratahs|New South Wales]] from 1888 until 1892.&lt;ref name="AB profile"/&gt;

Braddon had a commercial and political career in Australia, working for Dalgetys and representing Australia as Commonwealth Commissioner in the United States. He was appointed a member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] in 1917 and was an elected member of that body from 1934 to 1940.&lt;ref name="ADB profile"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/braddon-sir-henry-yule-143 |title=Braddon, Sir Henry Yule (1863–1955) |date=1979 |website=Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=32090 |date=19 October 1920 |page=10095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and died in the Sydney suburb of [[Woollahra, New South Wales|Woollahra]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="ADB profile"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Following the death of [[Henry Roberts (rugby union)|Henry Roberts]] in 1949, Braddon held the distinction of being the oldest living All Black.

A '''hire purchase''' (HP)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hire-purchase.asp|title=Hire Purchase|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2010-07-14|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, known as '''installment plan''' in North America, is an arrangement whereby a customer agrees to a contract to acquire an asset by paying an initial installment (e.g. 40% of the total) and repays the balance of the price of the asset plus interest over a period of time.  Other analogous practices are described as [[closed-end leasing]] or [[rent to own]].

The hire purchase agreement was developed in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 19th century to allow customers with a cash shortage to make an expensive purchase they otherwise would have to delay or forgo.  For example, in cases where a buyer cannot afford to pay the asked price for an item of property as a lump sum but can afford to pay a percentage as a [[Down payment|deposit]], a hire-purchase contract allows the buyer to hire the goods for a monthly [[renting|rent]]. When a sum equal to the original full price plus interest has been paid in equal installments, the buyer may then exercise an option to buy the goods at a predetermined price (usually a nominal sum) or return the goods to the owner.

If the buyer defaults in paying the installments, the owner may repossess the goods, a vendor protection not available with unsecured-consumer-credit systems. HP is frequently advantageous to  consumers because it spreads the cost of expensive items over an extended time period. Business consumers may find the different [[balance sheet]] and [[tax]]ation treatment of hire-purchased goods beneficial to their taxable income. The need for HP is reduced when consumers have collateral or other forms of credit readily available.

These contracts are most commonly used for items such as car and high value electrical goods where the purchasers are unable to pay for the goods directly.

==Standard provisions==
To be valid, HP agreements must be in writing and signed by both 
[[parties]]. They must clearly lay out the following information in a print that all can read without effort:
#a clear description of the goods
#the cash price for the goods
#the HP price, i.e., the total sum that must be paid to hire and then purchase the goods
#the deposit
#the monthly installments (most states require that the applicable interest rate is disclosed and regulate the rates and charges that can be applied in HP transactions) and
#a reasonably comprehensive statement of the parties' rights (sometimes including the right to cancel the agreement during a "cooling-off" period).
# The right of the hirer to terminate the contract when he feels like doing so with a valid reason.

==The seller and the owner==
If the seller has the resources and the legal right to sell the goods on credit (which usually depends on a licensing system in most countries), the seller and the owner will be the same person. But most sellers prefer to receive a cash payment immediately. To achieve this, the seller transfers ownership of the goods to a Finance Company, usually at a discounted price, and it is this company that hires and sells the goods to the buyer. This introduction of a third party complicates the transaction. Suppose that the seller makes false claims as to the quality and reliability of the goods that induce the buyer to "buy". In a conventional contract of sale, the seller will be liable to the buyer if these representations prove false. But, in this instance, the seller who makes the representation is not the owner who sells the goods to the buyer only after all the installments have been paid. To combat this, some jurisdictions, including [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], make the seller and the finance house jointly and severally liable to answer for breaches of the purchase contract.

===Implied warranties and conditions to protect the hirer===
The extent to which buyers are protected varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but the following are usually present:
#the hirer will be allowed to enjoy quiet possession of the goods, i.e. no-one will interfere with the hirer's possession during the term of this contract
#the owner will be able to pass [[Title (property)|title]] to, or ownership of, the goods when the contract requires it
#that the goods are of merchantable quality and fit for their purpose, save that exclusion clauses may, to a greater or lesser extent, limit the Finance Company's liability
#where the goods are let by reference to a description or to a sample, what is actually supplied must correspond with the description and the sample.

==The hirer's rights==
The hirer usually has the following rights:
#To buy the goods at any time by giving notice to the owner and paying the balance of the HP price less a rebate (each jurisdiction has a different formula for calculating the amount of this rebate)
#To return the goods to the owner—this is subject to the payment of a penalty to reflect the owner's loss of profit but subject to a maximum specified in each jurisdiction's law to strike a balance between the need for the buyer to minimize liability and the fact that the owner now has possession of an obsolescent asset of reduced value
#With the consent of the owner, to assign both the benefit and the burden of the contract to a third person. The owner cannot unreasonably refuse consent where the nominated third party has good credit rating
#Where the owner wrongfully repossesses the goods, either to recover the goods plus damages for loss of quiet possession or to damages representing the value of the goods lost.

==The hirer's obligations==

The hirer usually has the following obligations:
#to pay the hire installment
#to take reasonable care of the goods (if the hirer damages the goods by using them in a non-standard way, he or she must continue to pay the installments and, if appropriate, recompense the owner for any loss in asset value)
#to inform the owner where the goods will be kept.
#A hirer can sell the products if, and only if, he/she has purchased the goods finally or else not to any other third party.
it is pretty much similar to installment but the main difference is of ownership.

==The owner's rights==
The owner usually has the right to terminate the agreement where the hirer defaults in paying the installments or breaches any of the other terms in the agreement. This entitles the owner:
#to forfeit the deposit
#to retain the installments already paid and recover the balance due
#to repossess the goods (which may have to be by application to a Court depending on the nature of the goods and the percentage of the total price paid)
#to claim damages for any loss suffered.

==In Australia==
Hire purchases are commonly used by businesses (including [[company|companies]], [[partnership]]s and [[sole trader]]s) in [[Australia]] to fund the purchase of [[cars]], [[commercial vehicles]] and other business equipment.

Under [[Australian Taxation Office]] rules, businesses who account for [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] on an [[accrual basis accounting|accruals basis]] are entitled to claim an [[Input Tax Credit]] for all of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] contained in the purchase price of the goods on their next [[Business Activity Statement]].

Hire purchase is also commonly known as ''commercial hire purchase'' and ''corporate hire purchase'' (both abbreviated to ''CHP'') in Australia.

==In Malaysia==
Hire purchases agreement are commonly known as H.P agreement in [[Malaysia]] and it is used by [[financial institutions]] in [[Malaysia]] to fund the purchase of consumer goods, [[vehicles]] and other business equipment and industrial machinery.

In [[Malaysia]], the legislation governing hire purchase transactions is the Hire Purchase Act 1967, which came into force on 11 April 1968 after hire purchase became popular in the acquisition of expensive consumer goods such as [[cars]], business equipment and industrial machinery. Purchasing [[cars]] is the most common type of hire purchase agreement in [[Malaysia]] and the repayment could take up to 9 years from the date of agreement been executed.

'''Kurt Ove ''Håkan'' Buskhe''' (born 8 November 1963 in [[Örnsköldsvik]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] businessman, better known as the president and CEO of the Swedish aerospace and defence company [[Saab Group]], a role he has been in since September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 krav avgjorde Saabs val av vd |url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/4-krav-avgjorde-saabs-val-av-vd_4621635.svd|website=SvD.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Han blir ny Saabchef|url=http://www.privataaffarer.se/borsguiden/han-blir-ny-saabchef-1-104481|website=PivataAffärer.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Håkan Buskhe|url=http://www.di.se/amnen/buskhe-hakan/|website=di.se|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923214253/http://www.di.se/amnen/buskhe-hakan/|archivedate=2015-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this role, he is also the chairman of the board of directors of Sweden’s [[state-owned]]  logistics and transport company [[Green Cargo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hollander, Mats|title=Håkan Buskhe ny ordförande i Green Cargos styrelse |url=http://www.greencargo.com/sv/Pressrum/Nyheter/Nyhetsarkiv/Hakan-Buskhe-ny-ordforande-i-Green-Cargos-styrelse/ |website=Green Cargo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Buskhe was born in 1963 in the north-east of Sweden, in Örnsköldsvik. He attended [[Chalmers University of Technology]], where he earned a [[Master of Science]] degree in science and engineering, as well as a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in engineering, and a [[diploma]] in corporate management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Håkan Buskhe |url= http://www.europeanceo.com/profiles/hakan-buskhe-saab/ |website=EuropeanCEO.com|date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He began his career in the military, carrying out military service during the 1980s, where he worked as a weapons technician. This gave him a basic initiation into the world of arms and defence, the only such experience he would later take into his role at Saab. His first real career move was at a logistics company called Scansped where he joined in 1988 as assistant to the [[managing director]]. He rose through the ranks of this company and became head of EDP in 1990, where he was responsible for the implementation of a transport administration IT system across [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Håkan Buskhe |url= http://www.europeanceo.com/profiles/hakan-buskhe-saab/ |website=EuropeanCEO.com|date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, he moved to [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]], serving in various key senior logistics roles before he moved on to the electrical wholesale company Storel in 1998, where he eventually became managing director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Håkan Buskhe |url= http://www.europeanceo.com/profiles/hakan-buskhe-saab/ |website=EuropeanCEO.com|date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he became the CEO of logistics firm Schenker North, where he later became a board member in 2005.

In 2006, Bushke joined the [[Germany|German]] energy company [[E.ON]]’s Swedish division, E.ON Sverige, where he served as senior vice president before being appointed as president and CEO of the entire [[Nordic region]]. It was his successful time here that made his reputation as future candidate for Saab’s leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Håkan Buskhe |url= http://www.europeanceo.com/profiles/hakan-buskhe-saab/ |website=EuropeanCEO.com|date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Bushke was appointed as CEO of [[Saab Group]], with the chairman [[Marcus Wallenberg (born 1956)|Marcus Wallenberg]] choosing him for his breadth of expertise and focus on the high-tech field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Håkan Buskhe |url= http://www.europeanceo.com/profiles/hakan-buskhe-saab/ |website=EuropeanCEO.com|date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bushke is married with three daughters. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SWEDEN IS A MODEL: INTERVIEW WITH HÅKAN BUSKHE - THE CEO OF SAAB|url=http://saab.com/pt/air/gripen-fighter-system/gripen/gripen.com/Orgulho-de-ser-Brasileiro/Updates-news/filtered-stories/sweden-is-a-model/|website=Saab|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest daughter Katrine (b. 1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Sveriges befolkning 1990|year=2011|publisher=Svensk arkivinformation (SVAR), Riksarkivet|language=sv|isbn=978-91-88366-91-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; lives in Gothenburg.

{{Contract law}}
An '''invitation to treat''' (or '''invitation to bargain''' in the United States) is a concept within [[contract law]].&lt;ref&gt;It comes from the Latin phrase ''invitatio ad offerendum'' and means "inviting an offer".&lt;/ref&gt; In Andrew Burrows' words, an invitation to treat is

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...an expression of willingness to negotiate. A person making an invitation to treat does not intend to be bound as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom the statement is addressed."&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, A. (2009). Offer and Acceptance. A Casebook on Contract (2nd ed., pp. 5). Portland, OR, North America: Hart Publishing. (Original work published 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A contract is a legally binding voluntary agreement that is formed when one person makes an offer, and the other accepts it. There may be some preliminary discussion before an offer is formally made. Such pre-contractual '''representations''' are known variously as “invitations to treat”, “requests for information” or “statements of intention”.

True offers may be accepted to form a contract, whereas representations such as invitations to treat may not. However, although an invitation to treat cannot be accepted it should not be ignored, for it may nevertheless affect the offer. For example, where an offer is made in response to an invitation to treat, the offer may incorporate the terms of the invitation to treat (unless the offer expressly incorporates different terms). If, as in the ''Boots'' case (described below) the offer is made by an action without any negotiations—such as presenting goods to a cashier—the offer will be presumed to be on the terms of the invitation to treat.

==Case law==
Generally, [[advertisements]] are not offers but invitations to treat, so the person advertising is not compelled to sell. In ''[[Partridge v Crittenden]]'' [1968] 1 WLR 1204, a defendant who was charged with "offering for sale protected birds"—bramblefinch cocks and hens that he had advertised for sale in a newspaper—was ''not'' offering to sell them. Lord Parker CJ said it did not make business sense for advertisements to be offers, as the person making the advertisement may find himself in a situation where he would be contractually obliged to sell more goods than he actually owned.

In certain circumstances called [[unilateral contract]]s, an advertisement can be an offer; as in ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' [1893] 1 QB 256, where it was held that the defendants, who advertised that they would pay £100 to anyone who sniffed a smoke ball in the prescribed manner and yet caught influenza, were contractually obliged to pay £100 to whomever accepted it by performing the required acts.

A display of goods for [[contract of sale|sale]] in a shop window or within a shop is an invitation to treat, as in the ''Boots'' case,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd]]'' [1953] 1 QB 401 [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1953/6.html Bailii]&lt;/ref&gt; a leading case concerning supermarkets. The shop owner is thus not obliged to sell the goods, even if signage such as "special offer" accompanies the display. Also, in ''[[Fisher v Bell]]'' [1961] 1 QB 394, the display of a [[flick knife]] for sale in a shop did not contravene legislation which prohibited "offering for sale an offensive weapon". If a shop mistakenly displays an item for sale at a very low price it is not obliged to sell it for that amount.&lt;ref name="BBC News - 08Sep1999 - The Economy  Argos "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/441740.stm|title=Business: The Economy  Argos - an invitation to 'treat' |date=September 8, 1999 |publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For an offer to be capable of becoming binding on acceptance, the offer must be definite, clear, and objectively intended to be capable of acceptance.

In England, auctions are governed by the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] (as amended). Section 57(2) provides: “A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion by the fall of the hammer, or in other customary manner. Until the announcement is made any bidder may retract his bid”. S. 57(3) provides further: “An auction sale may be subject to a reserve price”. However, if the auction is held ''"without reserve"'' then the auctioneer is obliged to sell to the highest bidder.&lt;ref&gt;Warlow v Harrison (1859) 1 E &amp; E 309&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry v Davies (Heathcote Ball &amp; Co.) [2000] 1 WLR 1962&lt;/ref&gt; It is implicit from ''[[Payne v Cave]]'' (1789),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Payne v Cave]]'' (1789) 3 TR 148&lt;/ref&gt; an early case concerning auctions, that each bid is deemed to expire when others make higher bids; but some auctioneers (such as [[eBay]]) have lawfully amended this presumption so that, should a higher bidder withdraw his bid, they may accept a lower one.

The [[Call for bids|tender]] process is a debated issue. In the case of ''[[Spencer v Harding]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Spencer v Harding]]'' (1870) LR 5 CP 561&lt;/ref&gt; the defendants offered to sell stock by tender, but the court held that there was no promise to sell to the highest bidder, merely an invitation for offers which they could then accept or reject at will. In ''exceptional'' circumstances an invitation for tenders may be an offer, as in ''[[Harvela Investments Ltd v Royal Trust of Canada (CI) Ltd|Harvela Investments v Royal Trust of Canada]]'' [1986]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harvela Investments Ltd v Royal Trust of Canada (CI) Ltd]]'' [1986] AC 207&lt;/ref&gt; where the court held that because defendants had made clear an intention to accept the highest tender, then the invitation to tender was an offer accepted by the person making the highest tender. The ''Harvela'' case also made it clear that "referential bids"&lt;ref&gt;(eg: “$2,100,000 or $101,000 in excess of any other offer which you may receive, whichever is the higher”, as in the Harvela case)&lt;/ref&gt; are void as being "[[public policy|contrary to public policy]] and [[Unsportsmanlike conduct#Examples|not cricket]]".

'''Jorge Rosenblut Ratinoff''' (7 July 1952) is a [[Chile]]an engineer, academic, businessman and consultant, and the former president of [[Endesa (Chile)|ENDESA]], the Latin American branch of the Italian-based ENEL Group.

Rosenblut is a vocal supporter of the [[Pacific Alliance]] and has written extensively on the subject. In 2013 Rosenblut wrote a guest post for the [[Financial Times]] online edition in which he expressed his conviction that the [[Pacific Alliance]], of which Chile is a member, represents a "seismic shift in Latin American integration" by standing together "in what promises to be a historic breakthrough for the region".&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/04/08/guest-post-the-pacific-alliance-and-why-it-matters/#axzz2RlotCvvb The Financial Times Online, 8 April 2013, 19:08 o`clock]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloggingsbyboz.com/2013/04/can-pacific-alliance-remain-relevant.html Blogginsbyboz.com, 8 April 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/07/04/opinion/1372957345_468021.html El Pais Online, 6 July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; During a speech in Washington DC, also in April 2013, Rosenblut described the Pacific Alliance as "a route to join the league of highly developed nations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernpulse.com/_blog/Clippings/post/the-pacific-consensus-why-the-pacific-alliance-is-both-vital-and-fragile/ Southern Pulse Online, 20 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenblut studied at the [[Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera]] and then went on to study industrial [[civil engineering]] at the [[University of Chile]], where he then continued his academic activities after he had graduated.&lt;ref name="diariofinancierio"&gt;[[Diario Financiero|Diario Financiero (Santiago)]], 9 November 2007, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diariofinancierio2"&gt;[[Diario Financiero|Diario Financiero (Santiago)]], 13 December 2002, p.122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quepasa"&gt;[[Qué Pasa (magazine)|Qué Pasa (Santiago)]], 31 December 2005, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, he studied for a master's degree in Public Administration at [[Harvard University]] in the United States, where he had travelled to be with his then wife, Liora Haymann.&lt;ref name="diariofinancierio2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quepasa"/&gt;

He was working at the [[World Bank]] in North America when he received a call from [[Edgardo Boeninger]], who invited Rosenblut to work with him in the [[Ministry General Secretariat of the Presidency]]  (Spanish: ''[[Ministerio Secretaría General de la Presidencia]]''), specifically as the Head of the Inter-ministerial Division.&lt;ref name="quepasa"/&gt;

His first foray into the world of business came in 1994, as undersecretary of telecommunications in Chile, when he got the multicarrier off the ground following challenging negotiations with the major companies including [[Telefónica Chile|CTC]], [[ENTEL Chile|Entel]] and [[Telex-Chile]].&lt;ref name="diariofinancierio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diariofinancierio2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quepasa"/&gt; He was subsequently one of those closest to [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], who named him general undersecretary to the President’s office, second to [[Genaro Arriagada]].&lt;ref name="quepasa"/&gt;

Political differences with certain members of the governing [[Concert of Parties for Democracy]] (Spanish: ''[[Concertación]] de Partidos por la Democracia'') brought about his move to the private sector after almost seven years in the Public Sector.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;His main disputes were with [[Genaro Arriagada|Arriagada]] himself, the Minister of Defense [[Edmundo Pérez Yoma]], and the undersecretary of public works, [[Guillermo Pickering]]. The latter two men are accused of having made derogatory comments (they are alleged to have talked privately of a ''jewish troika'') against three Jewish members of the Government, one of whom was Rosenblut. Additionally, the then member of parliament [[Juan Carlos Latorre]] accused him of "challenging, obstructing or preventing" the passing of various draft bills that were supposedly detrimental to some businessmen.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, he started his business Development of Strategic Projects (Spanish: ''Desarrollo de Proyectos Estratégicos'') which became his centre of operations in Chile.&lt;ref name="quepasa"/&gt;

Through this work he became close to economic groups in the country, becoming president of [[Chilectra]] in the year 2000.&lt;ref name="elmercurio"&gt;[http://diario.elmercurio.cl/detalle/index.asp?id={d0be002f-f18d-40d8-9597-9c13019ae6da} El Mercurio (Santiago), 17 December 2009, p.B10]&lt;/ref&gt;

Determined to make the most of the business opportunities opened up by the [[Free Trade Agreement (FTA)]] with the United States, he started up a branch of his consultancy firm in Miami in 2002, this time under the name Strategies and Business Development.&lt;ref name="quepasa"/&gt; In Miami, he also founded the Real Estate Development firm Terra Group with Patricio Kreutzberger, son of [[Don Francisco (television host)|Mario Kreutzberger]], along with the architecture firm Archiplan, with brothers Jaime and Ignacio Hernández, Raimundo Onetto, Argentinian Manuel Grosskopf and Cuban-American businessman Pedro Martin.&lt;ref name="diariofinancierio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quepasa"/&gt; Rosenblut was Vice-Chairman at Terra Group, which focused on developing High Rise Buildings, until he left the business in 2009.  The demand generated by these projects led him to settle in Miami at the beginning of 2004.&lt;ref name="diariofinancierio"/&gt;

In 2005 he was a fundraiser and one of the main contacts linking socialist candidate – and future [[President of Chile|president]] – [[Michelle Bachelet]] with the business world.&lt;ref name="quepasa"/&gt;

In 2009, after almost a decade at the head of [[Chilectra]] he took on the presidency of [[Endesa (Chile)|Endesa]].&lt;ref name="elmercurio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.cl/jorge-rosenblut-asume-como-presidente-del-directorio-de-endesa-chile/noticias/2009-12-17/212225.html La Nación online, 17 December 2009, 20.18 o'clock]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://latercera.com/contenido/743_210144_9.shtml La Tercera online, 17 December 2009, 17.22 o'clock]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economiaynegocios.cl/noticias/noticias.asp?id=70369 Emol, 17 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, as president of Endesa, Rosenblut said that Chile "must double its energy network in the next ten years". He has also stated his belief in the importance of generating a higher percentage of energy through [[renewable energy]] sources to reduce Chile’s dependence on imported oil, specifically through the building of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power stations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.cl/gobierno-y-empresarios-llaman-a-lograr-desarrollo-energetico/noticias/2012-09-29/160902.html La Nación online, 29 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with La Tercera newspaper in 2012 Rosenblut repeated his conviction that the concept of CALL (Competitive, Abundant, Clean (Spanish: Limpia) and Local) is key to the future of Chile's energy policy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latercera.com/noticia/negocios/2012/11/655-492940-9-presidente-de-endesa-chile-palabras-de-ex-ministro-allamand-no-dejan-de.shtml La Tercera online, 12 November 2012, 16:35 o'clock]&lt;/ref&gt; an opinion that he has voiced publicly on previous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6252926 Vimeo, 24 August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Mr. Rosenblut was named one of the "100 Most Powerful Businessmen in Latin America" by Latin Business Chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinbusinesschronicle.com/app/article.aspx?id=6409 Latin Business Chronicle, 23 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Mr. Rosenblut left ENDESA and is living full-time in Miami where he works as a business consultant and frequent lecturer and writer on Latin American affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efe.com/efe/english/business/head-of-chile-s-enersis-steps-down-amid-probe-political-contributions/50000265-2653193 Head of Chile's Enersis steps down amid probe of political contributions]&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''Bulgaria''', the '''[[law of obligations]]''' is set out by the Obligations and Contracts Act (OCA). According to art. 20a OCA contracts shall have the force of a law for the parties that have concluded them.

==  I. General Part ==

{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}

== Contract ==

In [[Bulgaria]] the contract is one of the prerequisites for the development of obligatory relations. The term contract refers to a bilateral legal transaction, which consists of two declarations of intent (offer and acceptance) hat must be linked to each other and match in their contents. A contract is considered concluded from the moment in which the acceptance reaches the offeror (art. 14 OCA). The parties conclude the contract, because they have as their object the occurrence of certain legal consequences. In accordance with art. 9 OCA. the parties may determine the content of the contract insofar as it does not contravene the mandatory provisions of the law and good morals. In Bulgaria, the separation principle and the abstraction principle do not apply. In contracts for the transfer of ownership to generically certain things, ownership passes when the goods are determined by agreement between the parties and in the absence of such agreements - at handover. As for ownership transfer contracts and contracts of establishing or transferring some other property right over a specific chattel, the transfer or the establishment shall occur by virtue of the contract itself and shall not require that the chattel be delivered.
(according to art. 24 OCA).

===   Form of Contract ===

The OCA provides that contracts of ownership transfer and those of establishing other property rights on immovable property must be executed through a notarial deed.

== Invalidity ==

Contracts that violate legal requirements or show other legal deficits are invalid. Regarding invalid contracts, there are two subgroups to distinguish: void contracts and voidable contracts.

=== Voidable contracts ===

Initially, voidable contracts are contract that are valid and binding unless avoided or declared void by a party to them on the grounds prescribed by the law. General legal provisions regarding these grounds are provided in the Bulgarian Obligations and Contracts Act (OCA); specific legal provisions are (inter alia) contained in the Family code, the Law on Protection of Competition and the Inheritance law. Invalidation may be claimed only by the party in whose interest the law allows such invalidation. A contract subject to invalidation may be ratified by the party entitled to demand its invalidation, by way of an instrument in writing which should indicate the grounds for invalidation.
A contract shall also be ratified where the party entitled to demand its invalidation voluntarily performs it, in whole or in part, being aware of the grounds for invalidation.
A contract which is subject to invalidation on grounds of extreme necessity may not be ratified. According to art. 27 OCA a contract may be subject to invalidation of the following grounds:
* Legal incapacity – if a contract is concluded by incapable persons or by their representatives not respecting the specific legal provisions for representation;
* According to Article 28 of the Act, a material mistake may cause the cancellation of the contract. If the contract has been concluded with regard to a specific person being one of the parties to it (intuitu personae) a mistake concerning this person may render the contract void.
* Fraud - According to Article 29 of the Act, a fraud may cause the cancellation of the contract under the condition that one party has been deceived maliciously to enter into the contractual relationship. If the fraud has been induced by a third party, the deceived party may request the cancellation of the contract if the other party knew or ought to have known of the fraud.
* A contract may be cancelled if one of the contracting parties concluded the contract out of reasonable fear induced by threats from the other party or third person.
* Incapacity to comprehend one’s own actions - If a person capable of acting is enabled to comprehend his own actions while concluding a contract, the contract may be cancelled.
* Stringent necessity - The contract is voidable as well if it has been concluded under stringent necessity and under apparently unfavorable conditions for one of the parties. The court may cancel the contract completely or in the future. If the other party offers to compensate the damages, the contract may remain in force.

=== Void contracts ===

According to the concept of void contracts used by the Bulgarian lawmakers these contracts should be regarded as if they had never been concluded. The void contracts are those which have no legal effect because of their defectiveness from their conclusion and where a conformation is usually not possible. Contracts contravening or circumventing the law, as well as contracts infringing good morals, including contracts on inheritance that does not exist as yet, shall be null and void. Null and void shall also be those contracts that have an impossible subject, as well as the contracts which lack either consent or a form prescribed by law, or grounds. Fictitious contracts are also null and void. The grounds shall be presumed to exist until otherwise proved.

=== Partial invalidity ===

The invalidity of few clauses does not render the entire contract void given that the clauses may be replaced by binding prescriptions of the law or if the transaction is supposed to have been concluded even without the void clauses.
If the contract is declared invalid, each party must pay back what he has received from the other party.

=== Reinterpretation ===

If an invalid contract complies with the requirements of another legal transaction, the former is valid and considered transformed in the latter given that the parties would have agreed to conclude the latter.

==  Representation ==

The representation is governed by art. 36-43 OCA. The Representation is a legal institution referring to legal actions of one person (agent) on behalf of another (principal) whereby the principal has to bear the consequences resulting from the agent’s legal actions. here are two forms of representation to be distinguished: voluntary representation – here, the representation is wanted and organized by the principal; and the second form is obligatory representation imposed by the law – in this case the law itself requires representation by certain persons.

=== Formation ===

* declaration of intent made by a private person:
- from the principal’s unilateral declaration of intent (authorisation), e.g. his last will
- a contract.
* Formation of representation power by an enactment:
- If the representation power arises from an administrative act, e.g. if the administrative act is appointed by a guardian that hereby obtains actual authority
- from a court decision
- from a child’s birth (parents obtain the actual authority for their child).

=== Preconditions for a successful representation ===

#  The agent must deliver an own declaration of intent. To guarantee the declaration of intent delivered by the agent, he must be capable of acting.
#  The agent must deliver the declaration of intent in the name of the principal. He must make obvious that he is acting in someone else’s name.
#  The agent must have powers of representation and act within these powers. If the agent and the person he negotiates with reach an agreement to the detriment of the principal, the contract shall not be binding on the latter. If several persons have been authorised to exercise the same right to act, each of them may perform the act by himself unless something else is provided by the authorisation.
#  In several cases, where strictly personal legal actions are required (marriages, wills etc.) agency is inadmissible as in these cases the legal actions are decided by the personal estimation of the person.

=== Termination ===

The representation is cancelled in the following cases:
* with the death of the agent or principal;
* with the dissolution of the legal entity;
* with the incapacitation of the agent or principal;
* with the withdrawal of the representation powers;
* with the adoption;
* regarding the guardianship over persons placed under disability: with the cancellation of the guardianship etc.

== Default ==

=== Debtor’s default ===

If for the performance of an obligation a time limit has been fixed, the debtor is in default when he is unable to meet the obligation within this time limit. If there is no date fixed for the performance, the debtor is in default after the creditor’s request for performance. If the obligation arose due to a tort action, the default for the payment of the damages occurs without a request, from the date of the tort.
If the debtor is in default, he must pay damages even if the performance becomes impossible for reasons for which he is not responsible unless he can prove that the creditor would have suffered the loss/damage also in case of a timely performance.
The damages due to a default encompass the suffered damages as well as any lost profit, provided that the suffered damage is directly linked to the default and the profit could be expected under the contract. If the debtor did not act in good faith, he is liable for all direct and indirect damages.

=== Creditor’s default ===

According to Article 95 of the law of obligations and contracts, the creditor defaults if he does not accept the delivery/performance offered by the debtor or if he does not cooperate when this is required for the fulfillment of the obligation.

== Transfer of claim ==

=== Assignment ===

According to Article 99 of the Bulgarian law of obligations and contracts, a creditor may transfer his claims, provided that neither the law, a contract or the nature of the claim dictates otherwise. he transferred claim including the prerogatives, the remuneration and all other additions as well as the accrued interest passes on to the new creditor, unless something else is appointed. The old creditor must inform the debtor about the transfer of claim and hand over all present documents regarding the claim to the new creditor. Besides, the creditor must confirm the transfer in writing. The transfer is effective regarding third parties and the debtor from the day that the debtor gets informed by the old creditor. Regarding the transfer of claim for consideration, the old creditor is liable for the validity of the claim at the time of the transfer. The old creditor is only liable for the debtor’s ability to pay if he pledged himself to and only to the amount that he obtained by transferring the claim.

=== Stepping in as co-debtor ===

With the approval of creditor and/or debtor, an obligation may also be joined by a third person as co- debtor. If the creditor agreed to the joining, it may not be cancelled or modified without his consent. The principal debtor and the co-person are jointly and severally liable toward the creditor. The debtor may be substituted by third parties only with the explicit consent of the creditor. The substituted debtor is relieved from the liability towards the creditor. The securities given by third parties expire if they do not agree on serving the new creditor. Pledges and mortgages that have been given to the first creditor remain effective. The new debtor may plead against the creditor any defenses of the former debtor arising from the transferred legal relationship.

==  Unlawful Acts ==

The definition of the term unlawful acts can be derived from art. 45 OCA – if a person causes guiltily damage to another person, they must redress it. In all cases of tort guilt is presumed until proven otherwise.  This provision applies to all natural persons. The legal entities are liable in accordance with art. 49 OCA as principal. The subject of the tort act must be a person with legal capacity to be held liable for tort action. That is why A person lacking the capacity to understand or control his actions shall not be liable for the damage he has caused while in such a state unless he himself has faultily caused his lack of capacity (47 OCA). The legal capacity shall be evaluated in each particular case – for majors as well as for minors. In cases of self-defence the liability is excluded. It is supposed that the tortfeasor’s actions are not unlawful per se. However, in cases of stringent necessity, the created damage has to be repaired – even if the actions were not culpable, the result is unlawful.
The OCA provides for several cases of liability in case of unlawful acts:

=== Responsibility of persons with legal duty to care for incapable persons ===

The person with legal duty to care for incapable persons (e.g. teachers) is liable for damage caused by the person unable to act, unless the occurrence of the damage could not have been prevented.

=== Responsibility of parents (art. 48 OCA) ===

Parents and adoptive parents that exercise parental rights are liable for the damage caused by their minor children living with them. The guardian is liable for damage caused by his ward living with him.The abovementioned persons are not liable if they were unable to prevent the occurrence of the damage.

=== Responsibility of the principal ===

The principal is liable for the damage caused by his commissary while performing the imposed work. This legal provision is not applicable regarding contracts for work – there the person performing the work is personally liable. The principal may exercise his right on action for recourse/claim towards the commissary.

=== Responsibility for damage caused by items ===

The owner and supervisor of items are jointly and severally liable for damage caused by items of any kind. If the damage was caused by animals, the owner/supervisor is liable even if the animal ran away or got lost. Dangerousness per se or other specific characteristics of the item are not required.The owner and the supervisor are liable regardless of their personal fault; their behaviour must not be unlawful or culpable. If they prove that the damage was caused by a force majeure, by actions of third parties or by the actions of the aggrieved party, they do not carry responsibility.

== Unjustified enrichment ==

A person is obliged to return whenever that person has obtained something without legal basis or if the legal basis did not occur or has ceased later on (art. 55). What has been performed regarding moral obligations may not be claimed back.

===  Return ===

If a specific item is to be returned the recipient owes its yields as well at the time of the request. If the item that is to be returned vanishes after the request or if the recipient affected the item or used it up, knowing that he owns it without legal basis or, if the revenues he obtained from the item were higher, he is obligated to pay compensation. If the item has vanished, has been affected or used up before the time of the request, the recipient only has to compensate what he availed excluding the yields. Where restitution is owed by a person of legal incapacity only what has been used to his benefit may be claimed from him. Excluding the cases named above, each person that obtained something from someone without legal basis must pay the enrichment until the state of impoverishment. This right is justified if no other claim to defend the impoverished person is present.

===  Repayment of another person’s obligation in accordance with art. 56 OCA ===

If a person pays another person’s obligation by mistake, he has the right to claim it back from the creditor unless the latter one renounced the document or repayment of the obligation in good faith. In the latter case, the person that paid the obligation receives the creditor’s rights.

== Offsetting ==

If two persons owe each other money or similar and replaceable goods, it is possible for them to offset/to balance their mutual outstanding debts with each other under condition of maturity and solvency of both debts. The counterparty must be notified about the offsetting. When making an offset of a claim no time limits or conditions may be imposed, except for the condition that the offsetting shall be taken into account only in case the claim is brought to court. The two reciprocal claims shall be considered as extinct to the amount of the lower one as of the day on which the offsetting could have been made. The offsetting is also possible after prescription of one of the claims, if it would have been admissible before the expiry of the limitation period. If the debtor agreed to an assignment of the debt, he may not offset his obligation with the assigned one regarding his old creditor. Claims that are not subject to forcible execution and claims ensuing from wilful wrongful acts and claims for taxes cannot be set-off without the creditor's consent.

== Reconsideration (art. 107 OCA) ==

If the debt is renewed with another one with the creditor’s consent, the debt may be reconsidered. In these instances, the securities of the old debt remain in force if their providers have given their consent.

== Waiver ==

The claim may be waived if the creditor renounces his claim by a contract with the debtor.

== Limitation ==

The term „limitation“ describes a specific time period, after whose expiry the legal entity loses the right to assert and legally enforce his claims.

===  Limitation periods ===

The limitation period starts with the maturity of the claim. If agreed that the claim becomes due after request, the limitation period starts with the moment that the liability has been stated. Regarding tortious compensation claims, the limitation period starts from the point in time of acquiring knowledge of the offender. Regarding compensation claims on grounds of default, the limitation period starts with the day that the contractual penalty has been calculated. The general rules concerning the limitation are contained in the Bulgarian law of obligations and contracts but there exist special regulations providing shorter limitation periods and other regulations that differ from the general rules:
* 5-year limitation period – according to art. 110 after the expiry of 5 years, all claims without legally provided limitation period prescribe;
* 3-year limitation period - According to Article 111 of the law, the following claims prescribe after 3 years have passed:
a) claims derived from an employment relationship, if there is no other limitation period provided;
b) damage compensation claims and contractual penalties in case of non-performance of a contract;
c) claims derived from tenancies, interests and other regular payments;
* 1-year limitation period - Regarding sales of immovable property with defects, the limitation period is one year as well;
* 6-month limitation period - A limitation period of 6 months is provided regarding claims for defects of movable property and other claims provided by the commercial law. 
Agreements regarding a shortening or extension of fixed limitation periods as well as such regarding the renunciation of the limitation before it expired, are ineffective.

=== Suspension of the limitation period ===

The time between the occurrence of reasons for the suspension and their disappearance is not included, hence the remaining limitation period continues.
The limitation period is suspended:
* between children and their parents whereby parents exercise their parental rights;
* between guardian and child for the duration of the guardianship;
* between spouses;
* regarding claims of persons whose assets are administrated by law or by an order of the court, against the administrator during the time of administration;
* regarding claims for damages of legal entities against their manager during the time of their appointment;
* regarding claims raised by minors or mentally immature persons for the time that they do not have a legal representative or guardian and 6 months starting from the time that a guardian has been appointed or the legal incapacity has been fixed;
* for the duration of a trial regarding the claim.

=== Interruption of the limitation period ===

If a limitation period has been interrupted, a new limitation period begins. If the claim has been defined by the court, the limitation period is always 5 years. The limitation is interrupted when the debtor’s claim is approved; when an action has been brought to court or in case of an appeal against the conciliation procedure; if the action or the appeal has been dismissed, the limitation period is uninterrupted; when enforcement procedure has been started. What has been performed to fulfil a claim barred by the statute of limitation cannot be reclaimed even if it has been performed due to ignorance of the limitation.

== Joint several liability ==

Joint several liability exists when two or more parties are liable for one obligation. The creditor can demand the obligation in full amount from either party but he has only one cause of action. The persons who are liable for the obligation are called joint several debtors. The joint several liability is settled in art. 121 – 127 from the Obligations and Contracts Act (OCA). Joint liability can come into being: 
* by law;
* from a contract (e.g. in case of a guarantee contract the guarantor undertakes an obligation before another's creditor to be liable for the performance of the other's obligation)

=== Effects of the joint several liability ===

The absolute effect means that one juristic act affects all joint several debtors in the same way. For example, the creditor can demand the obligation in full amount from either party. The performance from one several liability debtor affects also the others and the creditor cannot refuse it without being in default. In this case the creditor will be in default towards all joint several liability debtors.
The autonomy of the different obligations undertaken by the joint several liability debtors is the reason for one juristic act that affects some of the obligations not have any effect on the others. This hypothesis is described by the term “relative effect of the joint several liability”. The obligations of the joint several debtors might have different due dates. As a rule the default of the debtor worsens his financial situation. That is why the default of one of the joint several liability debtors does not have any harmful consequences for the others. Another rule that can describe the relative effect of the joint several liability is that when the performance becomes impossible and only one of the debtors is responsible for that, the creditor may claim from the latter full damages. The limitation period also have a relative effect.
If one of the joint several liability debtors to have performed in full amount to the creditor for him to have a regress claim against his co-debtors but only for him to have paid more than his share.

== Guarantee ==

The guarantee agreement obliges the guarantor to be personally responsible for the fulfillment of obligations/liabilities of the main debtor. The guarantee has to be confirmed in writing. Subject of the guarantee can be only existing obligations. It may be issued for parts of the debtor’s obligation or under more favorable conditions. The guarantor and the main debtor are jointly liable. The guarantor remains obliged under the given guarantee if the creditor has claimed payment from the debtor within 6 months after the due date of payment.

== Pledge ==

In Bulgaria it is possible that for safeguarding a claim, a pledge is created on movable property or the claim itself. The right of pledge is an accessory right – it appears and disappears with the transfer of the safeguarded claim.

=== Pledge on movable property ===

The pledge agreement is only effective if the pledged object is handed over to the creditor. The only obligation of the creditor is to store the pledged object until the full repayment of the secured claim. He may not benefit from the pledge, unless there is an agreement for that.

=== Pledge on claims ===

Only claims that are able to be transferred may be pledged. The contract of pledge regarding a claim may not be set against third parties if the pledge has not been displayed towards the debtor. The pledger is obliged to hand over the documents verifying the pledged claims (if existing) to the pledge. The creditor is obliged to perform any necessary actions serving its maintenance, e.g. collecting the interest and also the principal sum.

== Mortgage ==

According to Article 149 of the Bulgarian Obligations and Contracts Act, a mortgage on real property may be established to secure a claim. According to Article 149 of the Bulgarian law of obligations and contracts, a mortgage on real property may be established to secure a claim.

=== Creation of the mortgage ===

The mortgage shall be created through registration in the Property Register on the grounds of a contract or by operation of law. It may be established only on separately specified properties and for a specific sum of money.
A mortgage by operation of law:

#  in favour of the alienator of immovable property - on the alienated property as security for his claims under the contract, and
#  in favour of the co-partitioners to whom a supplementing of the share is due - on immovable property left in the share of a co-partitioner who is liable for the supplementing of the share.
The creation of a mortgage is invalid if either the mortgage contract or the application for creation of a mortgage by operation of law or the deed pursuant to which it is filed does not specify the identity of the creditor or the owner or the debtor, or does not specify the identity of the property or the secured claim or the amount of the sum the mortgage is created for. A creditor whose claim is secured by a mortgage is entitled to be satisfied preferentially from the mortgaged property's price, whoever its owner might be. The right to a preferential satisfaction also applies to the income from the property from the date on which the owner must give account of such income under forcible execution pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure.

=== Deletion of the mortgage ===

The deletion of a mortgage is only possible with the creditor’s consent – in a notarized form, or on the basis of an effective court ruling. The deletion shall be made upon an application with the deed of consent or a copy of the effective court ruling attached thereto. It shall be made through entering a note in the lot of the mortgaged property. The deletion extinguishes the mortgage.

== II. Special Part ==

{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}

== Purchase ==
With the conclusion of a purchase contract, the seller obligates himself to transfer property or rights to the purchaser; the purchaser obligates himself to pay the agreed amount of money. The expenses related to the contract and all costs related to the transfer of the property are to be borne by the purchaser, except the purchase of estates where the expenses are divided equally. The risk of accidental loss passes to the purchaser upon the moment that the parties agreed upon the goods resp. upon the moment of transfer.

=== Obligations of the seller ===

The seller is obliged to transfer the sold property/right to the purchaser. In the moment of the sale, the property must be transferred including its yields.

=== Sale of an object resp. an object for which third parties have rights ===

If the sold object belongs completely to the ownership of a third party, the purchaser is entitled to dissolve the sale according to the regulations of Article 87 of the Bulgarian Obligations and Contracts Act.

=== The seller’s liability for defects ===

The seller is liable for defects in the sold object that substantially reduce the value or the suitability for its required use. The seller is also liable if the defect was unknown to him. Any agreements that exempt the seller from his liability are void.

=== The purchaser’s rights regarding the liability for defects ===

In cases that the seller is liable according to Article 139 of the law of obligations and contracts, the purchaser may return the object and demand the reimbursement of the price paid and of the expenses related to the sale. Regarding the non-performance of the obligations, he is entitled to a claim for compensation according to the general provisions.

=== The purchaser’s obligations ===

The purchaser is obliged to pay the agreed price and to receive the object. The payment is to be made in the moment and at the place that the object is transferred. If the sold object produces yields or other revenues, the purchaser owes interest on the price from the day of the transfer, even if the price is not due.

==  Donation ==

The donation is a bilateral contract with the immediate and gratuitous assignment of an object performed by the giver in favour of the donee (who must accept the donation).

=== Types of contracts ===

There are 3 types of donation contracts to be distinguished:
#  indifferent donation – usual case,
#  donation by obligation – due to moral obligations,
#  donation by decency.
The significance of this division becomes apparent in respect of the donation’s revocation: Donations made due to moral obligations or decency may not be revoked.

=== Formal requirements ===

According to Article 226 OCA, the promise of donation is not binding – consequently, pre-contracts regarding donations are void. Concerning the formal requirements, there are two types of donations to be distinguished: the formal donation and the donation issued by hand (resp. Article 225 (2) of the law of obligations and contracts). Regarding the donation of real estate, the validity requires a notarial certification; regarding the donation of mobility the form is eased: only the notarial certification of the signatures is required; regarding the donation of securities, the respective form of transfer must be maintained.

=== Revocation of donations ===

The revocation of donations due to ingratitude of the donee is provided in Article 227 OCA.

The first group encompass the general civil law termination grounds: upon mutual consent of the contracting parties; termination due to a contractual breach by one of the parties; due to objective impossibility of performance, etc. Article 236 of OCA provides the expiration of the term as ground for the termination of timely limited rental relationships.

== Loan ==

=== Effects of the contract ===

The borrower’s primary obligation is to return the money/goods.

=== End of the contract ===

The loan agreement may be concluded for a specific period and is terminated with its expiration. Same applies accordingly if the contract has been concluded for a specific purpose.

If not agreed otherwise, the contractor is obliged to perform the work on his own account. The contract for manufacture is always a legal relationship in return for payment.

=== Obligations and rights of the contractor ===

If not agreed otherwise, the contractor is obligated to perform the work on his own account.The contractor is obligated to perform the work in a way that it is suitable to its usual or contractually provided use.The contractor that performs the work using his own material is liable for its quality. The person ordering the work is entitled to check the performance of the contract at any time, provided he does not disturb the contractor.

=== Rights and obligations of the customer ===

* demand a gratuitous supplementary performance within an adequate period of time;
* demand the reimbursement of costs that arose with the rework or the reduction of the remuneration.
In cases of significant deviations from the agreed condition or defects that unfit the work for the usual usage or the contractually provided purpose, the customer is entitled to cancel the contract.

== Mandate contract ==

The commissioner assumes the obligation to perform on behalf of the client the acts for which he is commissioned by the client (art. 280). The mandate is a unilateral and, according to its definition, gratuitous contract. Though, it is possible payment to be agreed (resp. article 286 of OCA).

'''Literary property''' is a term used in [[publishing]] to refer to works generally covered by [[copyright]] but also an associated set of [[property rights]] that go far beyond what courts have historically permitted to be claimed as [[copyright infringement]].

The [[Writers Guild of America]], for instance, uses this term exclusively to refer to works registered with its [[WGA script registration service]], so as not to restrict the claims it or its users can make regarding their rights.

==Narrower than "intellectual property"==
Since it applies only to literary works and not technological or social constructs such as are covered by [[patent]] or [[trademark]] law, the term is much narrower in scope than the hotly contested term "[[intellectual property]]" sometimes used to refer to all non-physical works in which property rights are recognized.

==Differences between literary property and other non-physical property==
Among other differences, in literary works a very specific concept of [[:wikt:attribution|attribution]] is a critical part of the work itself - works tend to become markedly less valued or more valued based upon who originated or created it, which is simply not the case for [[invention]]s or [[brand name]]s.  Also, most countries recognize [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] that are not [[alienable]] from the work, that is, a purchaser of rights in the work does not have the right to relabel it as if someone else had written it.  While the USA does not recognize moral rights, it does have complex de facto standards such as the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]] which are actually more demanding and rigorous in specific industries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="732">'''Maker-checker''' (or Maker and Checker, or 4-Eyes) is one of the central principles of [[authorization]] in the [[information system]]s of financial organizations.The principle of maker and checker means that for each [[transaction processing|transaction]], there must be at least two individuals necessary for its completion. While one individual may create a transaction, the other individual should be involved in confirmation/authorization of the same. Here the segregation of duties plays an important role. In this way, strict control is kept over system software and data, keeping in mind functional division of labor between all classes of employees.

'''Mark Albion''' (born April 3, 1951) is an American [[business theorist]], social entrepreneur and author of values-based business literature.

== Biography ==
Albion received his post-secondary degrees from [[Harvard University]], including a BA in [[Economics]], a joint MA/MBA and a joint PhD/DBA in [[Business Economics]] from [[Harvard University]] and [[Harvard Business School]].  He wrote his undergraduate thesis under the direction of [[Janet Yellen|Professor Janet L. Yellen]], who became the 15th chair of the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]] in 2014. During his graduate studies, Albion was mentored by [[John Lintner|Professor John V. Lintner]], whose work was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1990. His doctoral thesis, which received the AMA's award for Best Doctoral Dissertation of 1981, was written under the supervision of [[Michael Porter|Professor Michael Porter]].

From 1982 to 1988, Albion served as an assistant professor and then as an associate professor at [[Harvard Business School]], where he taught MBA [[retail management]] and [[marketing]] classes, and developed the classroom material to introduce the personal computer into the MBA curriculum. He focused on Harvard doctoral programs and helped create joint doctoral programs with other Harvard schools. He was featured by [[60 Minutes]] as one of the top young (under 40) business-school professors in the country.

In 1986, his mother's battle against [[Fallopian tube cancer|cancer]] prompted Albion to reflect upon his goals and the role of business in alleviating poverty and suffering. That year, he connected with responsible business leaders who in 1987 formed the [[Social Venture Network]] (SVN). In the summer of 1988, Albion left [[Harvard Business School]] to develop a community of service-minded [[MBA]]s. In the ensuing thirty years, he made over 625 speaking trips to universities and their business schools to build a network for students interested in transforming enterprise to create a world of more social and economic justice, serving as Faculty Founder of what is today called [[Net Impact]]. Coupled with his subsequent involvement with U.S. Congress and officially the United Nations on how to educate socially responsible young leaders, Business Week dubbed Albion as "the savior of b-school souls."

From 2009 to 2010, Albion served in the Office of the President at [[Babson College]] to help integrate social values and sustainability into the college, and founded the inaugural [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public|AshokaU]] Changemaker Campus Team.

In 2011, Albion co-founded with neuroscientist Dr. Mrim Boutla,  [http://www.mtmc.co More Than Money Careers], which provides an e-learning, self-leadership career platform to help students, alums and professionals get clear, connected and hired for well-paying social impact jobs that fit their values. As of 2014, the company had 52 university clients and had won several awards for its ed-tech platform, including Ashoka's Cordes Innovation award in 2013.

Albion is heavily involved in interfaith religious events, as a teacher and participant, and most significantly  in adult Jewish education, earning a two-year degree from Hebrew College in 2002. 
Albion became a prominent representative used by the Jewish Reform Movement's adult education Meah program 2003–2007.

Professional recognitions, selected:

* In 2010, Albion received from the [[Indiana University]] the National Entrepreneur of the Year Award in recognition for his contributions to [[social entrepreneurship]], [[social innovation]] and [[sustainable business]].
* Trust Across America – 2011–2013 Top 100 Thought Leaders in Trustworthy Business Behavior.&lt;ref name="Trust Across America"&gt;[http://www.trustacrossamerica.com/offerings-thought-leaders.shtml Trust Across America - 2010 TOP 100 THOUGHT LEADERS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fast Company's Fast Pack 50.
* World Business Fellow.
* New York Times Best Selling author.
* One of the Public Faces for Reform Jewish "Meah" program, 2003-7.

=== Net Impact ===
In 1988, Albion began speaking at U.S. business schools about purposeful careers with social impact. In 1993, Faculty Founder Albion and a few other [[Social Venture Network|SVN]] members launched with 13 MBA students ''Students for Responsible Business (SRB)''. SRB was renamed [[Net Impact]] in 1999. The leading global non-profit organization empowers a new generation to use their careers to drive transformational change in the workplace and the world.  With Liz Maw as CEO since 2004, [[Net Impact]] currently supports over 300 autonomous volunteer-run chapters and a membership base of over 100,000,&lt;ref name="About Net Impact"&gt;[http://www.netimpact.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=353#2 About Net Impact&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with programs and networking events centered on topics such as [[corporate social responsibility]], [[social entrepreneurship]], [[social enterprise]] management, [[nonprofit]] management, [[social intrapreneurship]], [[international development]], and [[environmental sustainability]], attended by millions of students and young professionals each year.

=== Speeches ===
Since 1986, Albion has given over 625 speeches at [[business school]]s and universities on 5 continents. His work in helping successful leaders achieve positive social and environmental change through business principles was featured in numerous publications, including [[BusinessWeek]] (where in 1997 he was dubbed ‘the savior of business school souls'),&lt;ref name="The MBA Gospel According to Mark"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/1997/20/b352783.htm The MBA Gospel According to Dr. Mark | BusinessWeek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;"The Green MBA" for Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability ([[LOHAS]]),&lt;ref name="The Green MBA"&gt;[http://www.lohas.com/green-mba The Green MBA | LOHAS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;"[https://www.forbes.com/sites/annefield/2012/10/09/mark-albion-on-net-impact-its-accomplishments-and-the-triple-bottom-line/ Forbes: Mark Albion on Net Impact and Its Accomplishments]", "[http://www.fastcompany.com/38647/living-or-life/ Fast Company: Mark Albion-A Living or a Life?]"  and "[http://www.fastcompany.com/73148/mark-albion/ Mark Albion-Build Brand You Columnist]".

On October 3, 2015, Albion gave a TEDx Talk at the 150th anniversary of the private school he attended, [http://www.stmarksschool.org St. Mark's School] in Southboro, MA. That talk was entitled [https://milq.com/bead/tedx/1733 "The Paradox of Achievement"] with the central message that achievement should be based in love not be a vehicle to get love.

=== United Nations ===
Between 1995 and 1996, Albion was tasked by the [[United Nations]] to lead a research team to uncover key success factors to develop young socially responsible global leaders.  He presented the results of this research in an official speech to the [[United Nations]] in 1996, which led to his first personal mentorship meeting with [[Mother Teresa]] (Saint Teresa of Calcutta).

=== The Good Life Parable ===

Special Oscar recognition in 2013.

=== Writings ===
Albion is the author of several books concerning living a life of service, discussing leaving what you know to find what you love (''Making a Life, Making a Living'') ([[New York Times]] Best Seller), imbedding what you love into your career (''More Than Money: Questions Every MBA Should Answer''), and developing the skills needed to scale your passion and serve others (''True to Yourself''). In addition, Albion published dozens of columns in publications such as UNREASONABLE.is,  [[Aish.com]] and [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]], as well as over 160, 4000-word monthly newsletters.&lt;ref name=Albion&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Albion|url=http://unreasonable.is/author/markalbion/|website=http://www.unreasonable.is|publisher=Unreasonable Group|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About The Speaker|url=http://www.cps.neu.edu/student-resources/graduation/graduation-faq.php|website=http://www.cps.neu.edu|publisher=Northeastern University|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Published from 1996 to 2008, Albion's newsletters was subscribed to by millions of readers across 87 countries. Albion lives in [[Dover, Massachusetts]] with his wife Joy. They have two daughters.&lt;ref name="Making a Life"&gt;[http://www.makingalife.com Making a Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several themes run through Albion’s writings:
*Don’t get really good at what you don’t want to do – Many times, we are told that we are good at something, and that’s that, we keep doing it even though we might be passionate by something completely different.
*Know how YOU measure success - Examining your personal definition of what you value and how you measure a "good life" is critical to determining how to spend your one and only life.
*Money doesn't talk, it swears - Any life plan must include how you come to terms with money and how much is enough; while we are spiritual beings, we live in physical, material form that must be acknowledged.
* Live a life, not a resume - What you believe is your safest career move may be your riskiest. What is safe is following what you believe is your destiny; what is more risky is selling out for money and power that takes you in another direction.
*Don’t live a deferred life plan – When considering career changes, we always find reasons to delay.  But after making a change, most professionals wish they had done it sooner.
*Surround yourself with a community of love - Professionals that are happiest at work often say it is because of their relationships with colleagues and clients.  At business schools, We primarily practice analytical skills, not relationship building skills. However, don’t forget the importance of a community of respect and friendship for personal and professional fulfillment and success.
*Look not at the masses, but at the one - Impact is not about numbers, it's not about size. It is about improving the world one person, one soul, at a time.
*Plant trees under whose shade you will never sit – Including unreachable goals to our lives add meaning to our life and energy to our work as they connect us with something bigger than ourselves.

In 2017 he was convicted [[Trial in absentia|in absentia]] in Russia for allegedly stealing money from Aeroflot, but his extradition from Britain had been denied.

==Biography==
===Early life===
In 1972, Nikolai Glushkov graduated from the Moscow [[Peoples' Friendship University of Russia|Peoples' Friendship University]] with a degree in physics. In 1981, he completed the [[All-Russian Academy of Foreign Trade|Academy of Foreign Trade]] with a degree in economics.

=== His Aeroflot job, arrests, trials, and convictions===
Glushkov had been AvtoVAZ's Finance Chief until he left his job in autumn 1995 and was appointed as Deputy General Director of [[Aeroflot]] on request from [[Yevgeny Shaposhnikov]] in February 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Godfather of the Kremlin: The Decline of Russia in the Age of Gangster Capitalism |last=Klebnikov |first=Paul |isbn=0-15-601330-4 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alexander Goldfarb (biologist)|Alexander Goldfarb]], he found that the airline company worked as a "cash cow to support international spying operations":&lt;ref name="dissident"&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Death of a Dissident|Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB]] |last=Goldfarb |first=Alex |last2=Litvinenko |first2=Marina |date=2007 |publisher=The Free Press |isbn=1-4165-5165-4 |author-link=Alexander Goldfarb (biologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3,000 people out of the total workforce of 14,000 in Aeroflot were [[Federal Security Service|FSB]], [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]], or [[Main Intelligence Directorate|GRU]] officers. All proceeds from ticket sales were distributed to 352 foreign bank accounts that could not be controlled by the Aeroflot administration.  Glushkov closed all these accounts and channeled the money to Swiss company called Andava in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="dissident" /&gt; He also sent a bill and wrote a letter to SVR director [[Yevgeny Primakov]] and FSB director [[Mikhail Barsukov]], asking them to pay the salaries of their intelligence officers in Aeroflot in 1996.&lt;ref name="dissident" /&gt; Both Glushkov and [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Berezovsky]] were the main [[shareholder]]s of Andava at that time.&lt;ref name="rian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rian.ru/spravka/20071122/89057348.html |title=Aeroflot case. What Berezovsky is accused of? |date=2007-11-22 |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] |lang=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, a Forbes article claimed that Glushkov was convicted of theft in 1982.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1996/1230/5815090a.html#92687067562d |title=Godfather of the Kremlin? |date=6 March 2003 |work=Forbes |access-date=2018-06-17 |language=en |orig-year=Dec. 30, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glushkov and Berezovsky sued Forbes for libel in the United Kingdom, with the ruling coming down against the publisher.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/nikolai-glushkov-who-was-russian-businessman-murdered-strangled-vladimir-putin-boris-berezovsky-a8260261.html|title=Who was the exiled Russian businessman murdered in London?|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glushkov was arrested in December 2000 by Russian law enforcers and charged with channeling money through his accounting center ''Andava''. He was a business partner and close friend of [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], who from November 2000 resided in Britain; Berezovsky had to give up his ownership of the [[Channel One Russia|ORT]] TV channel&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=January 3, 2001 |title=ORT Officials Accused of Contraband and Evading Customs Tariffs |url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=24&amp;issue_id=1931&amp;article_id=17910 |journal=MONITOR |issue=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122183938/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=24&amp;issue_id=1931&amp;article_id=17910 |archive-date=2006-11-22 |via=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; transferred them to [[Roman Abramovich]]'s [[Gazprom Neft|Sibneft]]) in exchange for the promise to release Glushkov, which was not fulfilled.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.ru/HISTORY/FELSHTINSKY/naslednik.txt |title=Владимир Прибыловский, Юрий Фельштинский.

In April 2001 [[Andrey Lugovoy]] organized an "escape" of Glushkov from a hospital where he was kept by authorities. According to Glushkov, that was a set-up by FSB. He had no intention to escape and "was walking in his slippers to the hospital gate to go home for the night, with his guards' knowledge, as he had done a few days earlier".&lt;ref name="dissident" /&gt;

During his trial, Glushkov was incarcerated in [[Lefortovo Prison]]. He was cleared of the original fraud and money laundering charges by the court in March 2004, but found guilty of attempted escape and "abuse of authority"&lt;ref name="dissident" /&gt; and sentenced to 3 years and 3 months of imprisonment. Glushkov was released in the courtroom, since he had already served his sentence in the pre-trial detention center. However, the Moscow City Court rejected the verdict and returned the case for new consideration. In 2006, the Savelovsky District Court terminated the prosecution of Glushkov, but gave him a two years of suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://graniru.org/Events/Crime/m.268403.html |title=Не своя смерть: Британская полиция расследует смерть Глушкова как убийство |date=16 March 2018 |trans-title=Not my own death: British police investigates death of Glushkov as murder |lang=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emigration to UK and extradition request ===
Gluskov emigrated to the UK and received [[Right of asylum|political asylum]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="bbcconter" /&gt; The Russian state resumed his criminal prosecution. In 2017, during a trial ''in absentia'' in Russia, Glushkov was sentenced to eight years in prison for allegedly stealing $123 million from Aeroflot.&lt;ref name=guardianmarch2018 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20170303/277922666.html | title=Prosecutor again seeks 8 years in jail for Aeroflot ex-manager in embezzlement case | author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; | date=2017-03-03 | website=www.rapsinews.com | publisher=Russian Legal Information Agency | access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK refused to extradite him to Russia.&lt;ref name="cnnfoundead" /&gt;

=== Death ===
On 13 March 2018, friends of Glushkov revealed that he had been found dead the night before in his home in [[New Malden]], London. His death was initially treated by police as unexplained. His death came a week after the [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]] in [[Salisbury]], which along with his reputation as a critic of the Putin government, was said to be the reason for putting the [[Counter Terrorism Command]] in charge of the investigation.&lt;ref name="bbcconter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43385998|title=Counter-terror police investigate death|date=13 March 2018|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnfoundead"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/13/europe/nikolai-glushkov-russia-intl/index.html |title=Russian emigre Nikolai Glushkov found dead in London home|date=13 March 2018|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glushkov reportedly feared being on Putin's hit list and expected to be a likely target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/russian-exile-nikolai-glushkov-feared-12183797|title=Russian exile feared he was on Putin's hit-list five years before his death|first=Natalie|last=Evans|date=14 March 2018|publisher=|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the subsequent post-mortem his body was found to have marks consistent with [[Strangling|strangulation]] on the [[neck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/13/russian-businessman-close-associate-ofboris-berezovsky-found/|title=Putin enemy found dead in London eight days after Skripal poisoning, as counter-terror police launch investigation|first1=Robert|last1=Mendick|first2=Hayley|last2=Dixon|first3=Roland|last3=Oliphant|first4=Tom|last4=Ball|first5=Helena|last5=Horton|first6=Patrick|last6=Sawer|first7=Gordon|last7=Rayner|date=13 March 2018|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=14 March 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnfoundead" /&gt; On 16 March 2018, the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] stated they were now treating his death as murder. However, they stated that "at this stage there is nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury".&lt;ref name="BBC160318"/&gt; Counter-terrorism investigators maintain a lead role in the investigation. The Russian Embassy in London has requested a meeting with the head of Scotland Yard over its investigation into the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/16/police-launch-inquiry-over-death-of-nikolai-glushkov|title=Police launch murder inquiry over death of Nikolai Glushkov|last=Booth|first=Robert|last2=Harding|first2=Luke|date=2018-03-17|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17|last3=Roth|first3=Andrew|last4=Wintour|first4=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported after his death that Glushkov may have been poisoned by two Russian men five years earlier. A paramedic said that he treated Mr Glushkov in [[Bristol]] in 2013 after he had collapsed in his room. He had been sharing drinks with two men from Moscow the night before at the [[Grand Hotel (Bristol)|Grand Hotel]] in [[Bristol]] and believed he had been poisoned with champagne.  The paramedics found him with multiple carpet burns of his body and an unusual heart rhythm which they could not recognise&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45455464|title=Murdered Russian 'believed he was poisoned'|date=2018-09-08|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born on June 23, 1835 into a family of modest means in [[Tong'an District|Tong'an]], [[Zhangzhou]] in [[Fujian]], a southern province of [[Qing dynasty|Imperial China]], Oei Tjie Sien was the sixth son of Oei Tjhing In.&lt;ref name="Coppel (1989)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coppel |first1=Charles A. |title=Liem Thian Joe's Unpublished History of Kian Gwan |journal=Southeast Asian Studies |date=September 1989 |volume=27 |issue=No 2 |url=https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/56365/1/KJ00000131514.pdf |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoshihara (1989)" /&gt; According to family tradition, the elder Oei was a petty government official, but the colonial Indonesian historian [[Liem Thian Joe]] suggested that the family was of peasant origin.&lt;ref name="Koo (2011)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Koo |first1=Hui-Lan |title=Hui-Lan Koo, Madame Wellington Koo: An Autobiography |date=2011 |publisher=Literary Licensing, LLC |isbn=9781258034108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DFUXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=koo+hui+lan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioicK89dbeAhXQdysKHYh5BcsQ6AEIKDAA |accessdate=15 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coppel (1989)" /&gt; 

Regardless, his father ensured that the younger Oei received a classical Chinese education.&lt;ref name="Yoshihara (1989)" /&gt; This could have given Oei Tjie Sien a respectable career as a teacher or minor bureaucrat; but he participated instead in the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850-1864) against the then reigning Qing Dynasty.&lt;ref name="Setiono (2008)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Setiono |first1=Benny G. |title=Tionghoa Dalam Pusaran Politik |date=2008 |publisher=TransMedia |location=Jakarta |isbn=9789797990527 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CH0p3zHladEC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=%22oei+tjie+sien%22+(1835)&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKiKPYvtbeAhWbA3IKHSOFDFAQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22oei%20tjie%20sien%22%20(1835)&amp;f=false |accessdate=15 November 2018 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the rebellion, he rose up the ranks and was put in charge of logistics.&lt;ref name="Setiono (2008)" /&gt;

===Life and career in colonial Indonesia===
Avoiding the Qing government's suppression of the rebels, Oei left his first wife in China and fled in 1858 to [[Semarang]], [[Central Java]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] or today's [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="Yoshihara (1989)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Setiono (2008)" /&gt; Aged only 23, Oei's Indonesian career began as a [[Door-to-door|door-to-door]] peddler of diverse goods, from chinaware to rice.&lt;ref name="Setiono (2008)" /&gt; Once financially independent, Oei married a locally-born ''[[Peranakan]]'' woman, [[Tjan Bien Nio]] (1839-1896), who came from a middle-class merchant family.&lt;ref name="Setiono (2008)" /&gt; Together, the couple slowly built their business and had, among others, three sons: Oei Tiong Ham, [[Oei Tiong Bing]] and Oei Tiong Tjhian.&lt;ref name="Setiono (2008)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haryono (2017)" /&gt; They also had four daughters: Siok Nio, Bok Nio, Thiem Nio and Koen Nio.&lt;ref name="Haryono (2017)" /&gt; By a concubine, Oei also had a fourth son, Oei Tiong An.&lt;ref name="Haryono (2017)" /&gt; Oei sent his sons to a traditional Chinese school, where they mostly learned the [[Chinese classics]] and some rudimentary arithmetics.&lt;ref name="Dick, Sullivan &amp; Butcher (1993)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Setiono (2008)" /&gt;

By 1863, Oei and his business partner, Ang Thay Liang, had accumulated enough capital to establish a ''[[kongsi]]'' or business partnership, named 'Kian Gwan', which was then registered with the colonial authorities.&lt;ref name="Dick, Sullivan &amp; Butcher (1993)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dick |first1=Howard |last2=Sullivan |first2=Michael |last3=Butcher |first3=John |title=The Rise and Fall of Revenue Farming: Business Elites and the Emergence of the Modern State in Southeast Asia |date=1993 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781349228775 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmSwCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA273&amp;dq=%22oei+tjie+sien%22+%22ang%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnz4T7ytbeAhVDfSsKHRQyBnAQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22oei%20tjie%20sien%22%20%22ang%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=15 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new company dealt in both Chinese products, such as tea, herbs and silk, as well as in Indonesian commodities, including rice, sugar, tobacco and gambier.&lt;ref name="Dick, Sullivan &amp; Butcher (1993)" /&gt; Kian Gwan prospered in the economic boom that followed the Agrarian Law of 1870, which opened up agricultural land in Java to private capital.&lt;ref name="Dick, Sullivan &amp; Butcher (1993)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rush (2007)" /&gt; 

Oei's newfound wealth secured him an official pardon from the Qing government in 1874, and the prestige of landownership in 1878 through his acquisition of the ''[[particuliere land]]'' or private domain of Simongan, an estate of 1,300 hectares outside Semarang.&lt;ref name="Dick, Sullivan &amp; Butcher (1993)" /&gt; As ''landheer'' or landlord of Simongan, Oei - unlike his Jewish predecessor - allowed access free of charge to the venerable Chinese shrine of [[Sam Poo Kong]], located on the estate.&lt;ref name="Dick, Sullivan &amp; Butcher (1993)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Setiono (2008)" /&gt; The new landlord's generosity endeared him to the local Chinese community.&lt;ref name="Setiono (2008)" /&gt; Oei also obtained the Dutch colonial government's permission in 1880 to move from Semarang's Chinese quarter to Simongan, where - away from business - he lived the more prestigious lifestyle of a landlord and scholar, laying out a garden and his family graveyard, and eventually in retirement, tending to his lotuses.&lt;ref name="Dick, Sullivan &amp; Butcher (1993)" /&gt; Despite their wealth, noted Howard Dick, Oei's family was still 'one step removed from the peranakan aristocracy ([[Cabang Atas|cabang atas]])'.&lt;ref name="Dick, Sullivan &amp; Butcher (1993)" /&gt; 

In 1884, Oei arranged for his eldest son and chosen successor, Oei Tiong Ham, to marry [[Goei Bing-nio]], the fourth daughter of a Cabang Atas family that had been prominent in Semarang for over a century.&lt;ref name="Ong (2003)"&gt;{{cite book |title=Power, Politics, and Culture in Colonial Java |date=2003 |publisher=Metafor Pub. |location=Jakarta |isbn=9789793019116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=CD9yAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=ong+hok+ham+curtain&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q= |accessdate=15 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Setiono (2008)" /&gt; The younger Oei sealed his family's social ascent with a hallowed appointment in 1886 to the government position of ''[[Kapitan Cina|Luitenant der Chinezen]]''.&lt;ref name="Rush (2007)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Setiono (2008)" /&gt; This high-ranking post of the Chinese officership gave Oei not only the deference of the Chinese community, but also significant legal and political jurisdiction over them under the Dutch colonial system of [[Indirect rule|indirect rule]].&lt;ref name="Lohanda (1996)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lohanda |first1=Mona |title=The Kapitan Cina of Batavia, 1837-1942: A History of Chinese Establishment in Colonial Society |date=1996 |publisher=Djambatan |location=Jakarta |isbn=9789794282571 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKlwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=kapitan+cina&amp;dq=kapitan+cina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi43aTv2dbeAhXFK48KHVmVAf0Q6AEIKDAA |accessdate=15 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, with his family on the rise, Oei Tjie Sien retired to his lotuses at Simongan, where he died was buried in 1900 at the age of 65.&lt;ref name="Rush (2007)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Setiono (2008)" /&gt;

===Legacy and descendants===
All four of Oei's daughters married into Cabang Atas families.&lt;ref name="Haryono (2017)" /&gt; Likewise, apart from Oei Tiong Tjhian who died young, all three of Oei's sons were elevated to the Chinese officership.&lt;ref name="Haryono (2017)" /&gt; His eldest, Luitenant Oei Tiong Ham, was further raised to the post of ''Kapitein der Chinezen'' in 1891, then to the honorary title of ''Majoor-titulair der Chinezen'' in 1901, the highest rank attainable to a Chinese subject in the Dutch East Indies.&lt;ref name="Haryono (2017)" /&gt; The elder Oei's second son, Oei Tiong Bing, was appointed a Luitenant in 1892, then a Kapitein in 1901; in 1903, he became the [[List of Kapitan Cina|Majoor der Chinezen of Semarang]], head of the city's colonial Chinese bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Haryono (2017)" /&gt; The two Majoors' half-brother, Oei Tiong An, was appointed to the post of Luitenant der Chinezen of [[Salatiga]], Central Java in 1925, a post he held until the abolition of the Chinese officership in 1935.&lt;ref name="Haryono (2017)" /&gt;      

Oei Tjie Sien's grandsons, [[Oei Tjong Hauw]] and [[Oei Tjong Tjay]], eventually succeeded their grandfather and father, as heads of Kian Gwan from 1924 until 1961, and played an important role in the political and economic history of modern Indonesia and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="Yoshihara (1989)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coppel (1989)" /&gt; Oei Tjie Sien's granddaughter, the international socialite [[Oei Hui-lan]], married the pre-communist Chinese statesman and diplomat [[V. K. Wellington Koo]], and briefly acted as [[First Lady of the Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Suryadinata (2012)" /&gt;

Kian Gwan, the company founded by Oei Tjie Sien, became the largest conglomerate in Southeast Asia in the early decades of the twentieth century, and retained that position until the [[nationalization]] of its Indonesian arm in 1961 by Indonesian [[Sukarno|President Sukarno's]] left-leaning government.&lt;ref name="Yoshihara (1989)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coppel (1989)" /&gt; The company's Indonesian branch survives as [[Rajawali Nusantara Indonesia]], one of [[State-owned Enterprise of Indonesia|Indonesia's largest state-owned enterprises]]; Kian Gwan's branches in The Netherlands, and Thailand survive to this day on a more modest scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sejarah Rajawali Nusantara Indonesia |url=http://www.rni.co.id/id/profil-lembaga/tentang-ptrajawali-nusantara-indonesia |website=Rajawali Nusantara Indonesia |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kian Gwan"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kian Gwan |url=http://www.kiangwan.com/ |website=Kian Gwan |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process flowsheeting''' is the use of computer aids to perform steady-state heat and mass balancing, sizing and costing calculations for a [[chemical process]]. It is an essential and core component of [[process design]].

The process design effort may be split into three basic steps
* [[Chemical synthesis|Synthesis]]
* [[Analysis]] and
* [[Optimization]].

== Synthesis ==

Synthesis is the step where the structure of the flowsheet is chosen. It is also in this step that one initializes values for [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] which one is free to set.

== Analysis ==

Analysis is usually made up of three steps
* Solving heat and  material balances
* Sizing and costing the equipment and
* Evaluating the economic worth, safety, [[operability]] etc. of the chosen [[flow sheet]]

== Optimization ==

Optimization involves both structural optimization of the flow sheet itself as well as optimization of parameters in a given flowsheet. In the former one may alter the equipment used and/or its connections with other equipment. In the later one can change the values of parameters such as temperature and pressure. Parameter Optimization is a more advanced stage of theory than process flowsheet optimization.

== Plant design project ==

The first step in the sequence leading to the construction of a process [[plant]] and its use in the manufacture of a product is the conception of a process. The concept is embodied in the form of a "flow sheet". [[Process design]] then proceeds on the basis of the flow sheet chosen. [[Physical property]] data are the other component needed for process design apart from a flow sheet. The result of process design is a [[process flow diagram]], PFD. Detailed [[engineering]] for the project and vessel specifications then begin. Process flowsheeting ends at the point of generation of a suitable PFD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Westerberg|first=A. W.|title=Process Flowsheeting|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge Universities Press|isbn=0-521-22043-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General purpose flowsheeting programs became usable and reliable around 1965-1970.

{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}

'''Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy''' (''DEBEIS''), or informally '''Business Secretary''', is a cabinet position in the [[United Kingdom government]]. The office is responsible for the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] (formerly the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] and previous to that the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]]. The [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|secretary of state]] was, until July 2016, also [[President of the Board of Trade]] when that position was transferred to the newly created post of [[Secretary of State for International Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/secretary-of-state-for-international-trade|title=Secretary of State for International Trade and President of the Board of Trade - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During the government of [[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]], the then President of the Board of Trade [[Edward Heath]] was given in addition the job of '''Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development'''. This title was not continued under [[Harold Wilson]], but when Heath became Prime Minister in 1970 he decided to merge functions of the Board of Trade and the [[Minister of Technology|Ministry of Technology]] to create the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]. The head of this department became known as '''Secretary of State for Trade and Industry''' and also retained the title of [[President of the Board of Trade]].

When [[Harold Wilson]] re-entered office in March 1974, the office was split into the [[Department of Trade]], the [[Department of Industry]] and the [[Department of Prices and Consumer Protection]], resulting in the creation of three new positions: '''Secretary of State for Industry''', '''Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection''', and '''Secretary of State for Trade'''. The title President of the Board of Trade became the secondary title of the Secretary of State for Trade. In 1979 the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection was abolished by the incoming [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative government]] and its responsibilities were reintegrated into the Department of Trade. In 1983 the offices of trade and industry were remerged and the title of Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was recreated. When [[Michael Heseltine]] held this office, he preferred to be known by the older title of President of the Board of Trade, and this practice was also followed by [[Ian Lang]] and [[Margaret Beckett]]. Heseltine's decision to reuse the old title caused some comment and it was discovered that the Board of Trade had not in fact met since the mid-nineteenth century.

Under [[Gordon Brown]]'s premiership there were two renamings of the role and three re-alignments of responsibility. In his first cabinet of 2007, he called the post '''Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform'''. In this change, the [[Better Regulation Executive]] was added to the department but the [[Office of Science and Innovation]] was lost. In 2008, the title remained the same but responsibility for energy was lost. In 2009, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills was merged into the existing department and the post became '''Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills'''.

In July 2016, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Theresa May]] decided to merge the [[Department for Energy and Climate Change]] into this department with the responsibilities for post-19 education and skills being returned to the [[Department for Education]] resulting in the position being renamed to '''Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy'''. At the same time the post of [[President of the Board of Trade]] was  transferred to the newly created post of [[Secretary of State for International Trade]].

† — Primarily referred to as President of the Board of Trade, and not as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry

†† — [[Alan Johnson]] was initially announced on 6 May 2005, after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|general election]], as being "Secretary of State for Productivity, Energy and Industry and President of the Board of Trade", but after just a week, on 13 May, it was declared that the new title would not be used, after widespread derision of the new name, because the abbreviation for Johnson's title, Productivity, Energy and Industry Secretary, would have been "PENIS"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Alan Johnson|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1492289/Profile-Alan-Johnson.html|publisher=The Telegraph |date=18 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sunday Trading Act 1994''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] governing the right of [[Retailing|shops]] in [[England and Wales]] to trade on a Sunday. Buying and selling on Sunday had previously been illegal, with exceptions, under the [[Shops Act 1950]].

==Background==
Following the defeat of the [[Shops Bill 1986]], which would have enabled widespread Sunday trading, compromise legislation was introduced in July 1994 in [[England and Wales]], coming into force on 26 August 1994,&lt;ref name="si-1994-1841"/&gt; allowing shops to open, but restricting opening times of larger stores i.e. those over {{convert|280|m2|sqft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} to a maximum of six hours, between 10am and 6pm only. Large retail park shops usually open 11am-5pm, with supermarkets more usually choosing 10am-4pm. In central [[London]], for example on [[Oxford Street]], many shops choose to open from midday to 6pm. This includes large 24-hour supermarkets, which meant that supermarkets have to close on Saturday night to allow six continuous hour shopping within an allotted time.

However, some of the stores open half an hour earlier to allow people to "browse", but do not allow sales before the allotted time. Deliveries to the large stores are not permitted to be loaded or unloaded before 9am. Large shops were excluded from opening on Easter Sunday and Christmas Day (when it fell on a Sunday), but the [[Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004]] made it illegal for large shops to open on Christmas Day whichever day of the week it fell on.

Shops in [[Scotland]], where Sunday trading had always been generally unregulated, retained the right to open at any time. However the right for workers in Scotland to refuse to work on a Sunday was later conferred by the [[Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003]]. [[Northern Ireland]] has separate laws governing Sunday opening.

The Sunday Trading Bill had met with considerable opposition from the [[Lord's Day Observance Society]] and other groups such as the [[Keep Sunday Special]] campaign, a coalition body which includes the shopworkers' [[trade union]] [[USDAW]]. USDAW finally agreed to support 6 hour Sunday trading in return for a promise that Sunday working would be strictly voluntary. This decision played an important role in encouraging many Labour MPs to back the bill in a free vote. They asked for a guarantee of premium pay but the Government's position was that that was a matter for negotiation between shopworkers or their unions and their employers and the Act as passed says nothing about the rate of pay for Sunday working.

==2012 suspension==
In the run up to the 2012 Olympic Games, the Sunday Trading (London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games) Act 2012 was passed stipulating that Sunday trading laws would be suspended by the government on eight weekends from 22 July during the Olympics and Paralympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18942729 | title=London 2012: Sunday trading laws suspended for Olympics | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=BBC News | date=22 July 2012 | accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a temporary measure, and the relaxation expired at the end of the summer.

==Ongoing debate==
The debate over Sunday trading laws was reignited in 2014, when a comres poll commissioned by newly formed grassroots organisation 'Open Sundays' revealed that 72% of people believe they should be able to shop whenever is convenient to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.retail-week.com/topics/retail-surgery/should-sunday-trading-hours-be-reformed/5058898.article&lt;/ref&gt; The debate gained further political traction in May of the same year, when [[Philip Davies]] MP tabled five amendments to the Deregulation Bill which aimed at abolishing or liberalising the current Sunday trading laws.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/stores/mp-tables-amendments-to-scrap-or-ease-sunday-trading-rules/357559.article&lt;/ref&gt; Although these amendments were ultimately rejected,&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140623/debtext/140623-0003.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the debate is continuing to receive attention, with Davies appearing on the BBC's Daily Politics on 2 July 2014 and labelling the current regulations as "completely absurd and unjustifiable". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b048s6ds/daily-politics-02072014&lt;/ref&gt;

It was proposed in the July 2015 Budget that the Sunday trading laws might be relaxed and shops over  {{convert|280|m2|sqft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} be able to open longer. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33421315&lt;/ref&gt; However this proposal was defeated in a House of Commons vote.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35768674&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exemptions==
Some categories of large shops are exempt from the Sunday Trading Act 1994:

*Airport shops
*Pharmacies
*Goods from exhibition stalls
*Farm shops that sell their own produce (including fishmongers)
*Petrol filling stations
*Railway stations
*Motorway service stations

Small shops with a floor area of under and up to 280 square metres (3,000 square feet) may open if they wish to.

'''Syed Mokhtar Shah bin Syed Nor Albukhary''' is a [[Malaysia|Malaysian]] [[Businessperson|businessman]], [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]]. He is the founder of the Albukhary Foundation, an international non-profit charity organization that focuses on social development. 

==Early life==
Syed Mokhtar Albukhary was born on 12 December 1951, the third child of Syed Nor and Sharifah Rokiah in Kampung Hutan Keriang, Alor Setar Kedah. His family traces its roots to Central Asia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/825941389|title=Syed Mokhtar Albukhary : a biography|last=Premilla,|first=Mohanlall,|others=PrinAd Sdn Bhd|isbn=9789674158064|location=Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia|oclc=825941389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Syed Mokhtar moved to [[Johor Bahru]] where he spent the next 6 years before returning to [[Alor Setar]] where he attended [[St. Michael's Institution]]. While still schooling, he got involved in his father’s [[cattle]] business.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Not long after, an outbreak of [[Foot-and-mouth disease]] collapsed thecompany. This led to Syed Mokhtar abandoning his studies a few months prior to completing his Secondary 5, as his family could not afford to pay for his examination fees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7912">'''Thomas North Whitehead''' (31 December 1891, [[Cambridge|Cambridge, England]] – 22 November 1969, [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]) was an early English [[human relations]] theorist and researcher, best known for ''The Industrial Worker'', a two-volume statistical analysis of the [[Hawthorne effect|Hawthorne experiments]].{{r|gillespie}} He worked as a professor at [[Harvard University]] and [[Radcliffe College]], and in the British [[Foreign Office]] during World War II.

== Early life and education ==
Whitehead was the son of the prominent English philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and was known as "North" to his family.{{r|lowe}} He read [[economics]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],{{r|crimson}} earning a B.A. in 1913. He then did graduate studies in [[mechanical engineering]] at [[University College London]].{{r|witzel}}

== Government service ==
Whitehead served as an army officer in France and East Africa during World War I, taking a leave from his graduate studies to do so. On the completion of his studies in 1920 after the war, he began working for the Admiralty, and remained there until his 1931 move to Harvard.{{r|witzel}}

During World War II, he again took a leave, this time from his professorship at Harvard, to work as an expert on American relations in the British [[Foreign Office]].{{r|crimson|witzel}} In 1940, before America entered the war, he advised [[Winston Churchill]] that American isolationism would not be a permanent obstacle, and after the Pearl Harbor attacks he communicated a message of solidarity to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{r|stinnett}}
It was also Whitehead's suggestion that Churchill compare America's proposed [[Lend-Lease]] policy to the [[Magna Carta]], and that one of the original copies of the Magna Carta then on display in America be made into a more permanent gift to seal the deal.{{r|hermiston}} However, this proposal fell through because the British government did not own any of the four surviving copies of the Magna Carta.{{r|kirka}}

== Academia ==
Whitehead joined the [[Harvard Business School]] in 1931, following his father who had moved to Harvard in 1924. He stayed at Harvard for the rest of his career except for a leave of absence during World War II. After the war, Whitehead ran the [[Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration]], a business program for women at [[Radcliffe College]], keeping also his appointment at Harvard. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1952. When Harvard's business school began admitting women in 1955, he returned to a full-time position at Harvard.{{r|crimson|witzel}} He remained at Harvard until his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Harvard Crimson'' gives his retirement date as 1963, while the ''Encyclopedia of History of American Management'' dates it to 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
Whitehead's work ''The design and use of instruments'', published in 1934, was primarily written while he was still at the Admiralty. It prefigures the care in accurate measurement that Whitehead put into his work on the Hawthorne experiments. In this, Whitehead's "golden rule" was to "never measure more than is absolutely necessary".{{r|claus}}

The [[Hawthorne effect|Hawthorne experiments]] studied worker productivity at a [[Western Electric]] factory. They were originally intended to study the effects of lighting on productivity, but instead determined that workers reacted positively to the changing conditions of the experiment, and that their productivity decreased again when the experiment ended.{{r|gillespie}}
Whitehead, following the lead of [[Jean Piaget]], took the approach of carefully documenting the behavior of a small sample of workers over a long period of time.{{r|claus}}
His analysis of the Hawthorne experiments used rigorous statistics to argue "that personal and social relationships had been the dominant factors" in these effects.
His work has been criticized as "complex and poorly presented", with unoriginal ideas "expressed in infuriatingly vague prose". Nevertheless, his work is important as the only original mathematical analysis of the experimental data and the only complete record of the entire run of the experiments.{{r|gillespie}}

Besides his work on the Hawthorne experiments, Whitehead is known for pioneering the development of the fields of human relations, [[organizational behavior]], and [[human resource management]], and for his 1936 book ''Leadership in a Free Society'' on the structure and organization of human activity.{{r|witzel}}

'''''Tom Clancy's ruthless.com''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]] based on [[Tom Clancy's Power Plays]] novel "ruthless.com". It was published [[1998 in video gaming|in 1998]] by [[Red Storm Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/tomclancysruthlesscom/index.html Gamespot entry]&lt;/ref&gt; ''ruthless.com'' puts the player in the position of CEO of a new [[software company]].  The game features a campaign mode, six different scenarios of varying difficulty, and a multiplayer option.

== Overview ==
This is a game of economic intrigue and corporate maneuvering. As the new CEO of a software company, players must scheme and strategize, form and break alliances, undertake sometimes criminal actions and do whatever it takes to get the company to the top and keep it there.

Playing in a board-game-like environment, players can choose to play any of six individual scenarios or a full campaign. The scenarios each have fundamentally different parameters. Players at an advanced point in the action with opposing corporations already established and a small history already in place.

The campaign is more freeform and the player with only one building and three departments with no immediate opponents. While objectives vary for the scenarios, in the campaign game the player must control seventy-five percent of the market for four turns.

Setting up a game involves determining how long is it going to last—between 20, 40 or 60 turns. You also choose the level of AI you wish to play against, novice, intermediate or expert. Lastly, players can set their own difficulty level that indicates how far they can go into debt before losing (bankruptcy). On the easy setting, players can incur debt up to $10,000, medium $5,000 and hardest $2,500.

Other selections include naming the corporation and selecting a CEO. Each CEO has a unique benefit that he or she brings with labels like "Talented," "Whiz Kid" or "Banker." These benefits add, as examples, five percent per level to all computer points generated (Whiz Kid) or let you go twice as deep in debt before becoming bankrupt and losing the game (Banker).

Gameplay in Tom Clancy's ruthless.com is turn-based. Each turn, you gives CEO two orders, choosing from the Corporate, R&amp;D, Marketing, Admin, Human Resources, Acquisitions, Legal, Security and Computer groups. Each group contains action orders such as "build new department" and "build new product" in the Corporate group, "executive training" in the Admin group and "assassinate executive" in the Security group.

At the end of each round, players get a comparative report that informs them on any newsworthy events such as how well (or how poorly) each company's stock prices are doing and any tragedies or executive promotions. As chosen executive(s) (you can hire more as the game progresses) gain experience, they're considered higher-level and sometimes gain additional traits (bonuses like the ones they start out with—as a Banker, Whiz Kid and so on).

Each round players attempt to acquire a larger portion of the market (represented by tiles on the game board). Doing this involves carrying out executive orders and negotiating to acquire the start-up companies that occasionally pop up around the game board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.cnet.com/Tom-Clancy-s-Ruthless-com-demo-entire-zipped-game-file/3000-2119_4-10246395.html Game synopsis by Gil Shif at Allgame.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The game takes place on a map that represents the market share of all the competing companies.  Each player in the game is a CEO of a software company.  Legal, security, and computer attacks are common in the game.  Competition comes from the fight over market shares (map squares).  A CEO builds their initial buildings and puts their product into the market.  Once on the market a product's quality will determine its dominance in the market.  Dominance in the market provides income to build additional buildings, bid for takeovers, or launch different kinds of attacks against the competitors.

== Reception ==
[[GameSpot]] reviewed the game in 1999, awarding 6.3 out of 10. Main criticisms included the shortness of the campaign, limited scenarios and lack of replayability. However, the multiplayer mode was deemed "about as much fun as turn-based multiplayer games can be". The graphics were also highlighted, with a well designed interface and inventive visuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/tomclancysruthlesscom/review.html?sid=2532860&amp;om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gsupdates&amp;tag=updates;title;1 Review] at Gamespot&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Game Revolution]], the game was awarded a B+. The gameplay, multiplayer mode and interface were praised, while the main criticisms included the start difficult and the "poorly explained manual".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/tom-clancys-ruthlesscom Review] at Gamerevolution&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Primary sources|date=April 2011}}

The '''twelve leverage points to intervene in a system''' were proposed by [[Donella Meadows]], a scientist and system analyst focused on environmental limits to economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Meadows |first=Donella |date=2008 |title=Thinking in Systems: A Primer |publisher=[[Chelsea Green Publishing]] |page=145-165 |isbn=978-1-60358-055-7 |author-link=Donella Meadows }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The leverage points, first published in 1997, were inspired by her attendance at a [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) meeting in the early 1990s where she realized that a very large new system was being proposed but the mechanisms to manage it were ineffective.

Meadows, who worked in the field of [[systems analysis]], proposed a scale of places to intervene in a [[system]].  Awareness and manipulation of these levers is an aspect of [[self-organization]] and can lead to [[collective intelligence]].

Her observations are often cited in [[energy economics]], [[green economics]] and [[human development theory]].

She started with the observation that there are levers, or places within a [[complex system]] (such as a firm, a city, an economy, a living being, an [[ecosystem]], an [[ecoregion]]) where a "small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything" (compare: constraint in the sense of [[Theory of Constraints]]).

She claimed we need to know about these ''shifts'', where they are and how to use them. She said most people know where these points are instinctively, but tend to adjust them in the wrong direction. This understanding would help solve global problems such as [[unemployment]], [[hunger]], [[economic stagnation]], [[pollution]], [[resources depletion]], and [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] issues.

Meadows started with a 9-point list of such places, and expanded it to a list of ''twelve leverage points'' with explanation and examples, for systems in general.

She describes a [[system]] as being in a certain state, and containing a [[Stock and flow|stock]], with inflows (amounts coming into the system) and outflows (amounts going out of the system). At a given time, the system is in a certain perceived state. There may also be a [[goal]] for the system to be in a certain state. The difference between the current state and the goal is the discrepancy.

{{quote|For example, one might consider a [[lake]] or reservoir, which contains a certain amount of water. The inflows are the amount of water coming from rivers, rainfall, drainage from nearby soils, and waste water from a local industrial plant. The outflows might be the amount of water used up for irrigation of nearby cornfield, water taken by that local plant to operate as well as the local camping site, water [[evaporating]] in the [[atmosphere]], and trickling surplus water when the reservoir is full.

Local inhabitants complain about the water level getting low, pollution getting higher, and the potential effect of hot water release in the lake on life (in particular, the fish).

This is the difference between the perceived state (pollution or low water level) and the goal (a non-polluted lake).}}

==Leverage points to intervene in a system==
The following are in increasing order of effectiveness.

=== 12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards) ===

Parameters are points of lowest leverage effects. Though they are the most clearly perceived among all leverages, they rarely change behaviors and therefore have little long-term effect.

{{quote|For example, climate parameters may not be changed easily (the amount of rain, the [[evapotranspiration]] rate, the temperature of the water), but they are the ones people think of first (they remember that in their youth, it was certainly raining more). These parameters are indeed very important. But even if changed (improvement of upper river stream to canalize incoming water), they will not change behavior much (the debit will probably not dramatically decrease).}}

=== 11. The size of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows ===

A [[wiktionary:Buffer|buffer]]'s ability to stabilize a system is important when the stock amount is much higher than the potential amount of inflows or outflows.  In the lake, the water is the buffer:  if there's a lot more of it than inflow/outflow, the system stays stable.

{{quote|For example, the inhabitants are worried the lake fish might die as a consequence of hot water release directly in the lake without any previous cooling off.

However, the water in the lake has a large [[heat capacity]], so it's a strong thermic buffer. Provided the release is done at low enough depth, under the [[thermocline]], and the lake volume is big enough, the buffering capacity of the water might prevent any extinction from excess temperature.}}

Buffers can improve a system, but they are often physical entities whose size is critical and can't be changed easily.

=== 10. Structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport network, population age structures)===

A system's structure may have enormous effect on operations, but may be difficult or prohibitively expensive to change. Fluctuations, limitations, and bottlenecks may be easier to address.

{{quote|For example, the inhabitants are worried about their lake getting polluted, as the industry releases chemical pollutants directly in the water without any previous treatment. The system might need the used water to be diverted to a [[Industrial wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plant]], but this requires rebuilding the underground used water system (which could be quite expensive).}}

=== 9. Length of delays, relative to the rate of system changes ===

Information received too quickly or too late can cause over- or underreaction, even oscillations.

{{quote|For example, the city council is considering building the wastewater treatment plant. However, the plant will take 5 years to be built, and will last about 30 years. The first delay will prevent the water being cleaned up within the first 5 years, while the second delay will make it impossible to  build a plant with exactly the right capacity.}}

=== 8. Strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the effect they are trying to correct against===

A [[negative feedback]] loop slows down a process, tending to promote stability. The loop will keep the stock near the goal, thanks to parameters, accuracy and speed of information feedback, and size of correcting flows.

{{quote|For example, one way to avoid the lake getting more and more polluted might be through setting up an additional levy on the industrial plant based on measured concentrations of its effluent.  Say the plant management has to pay into a water management fund, on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on the actual amount of waste found in the lake; they will, in this case, receive a direct benefit not just from reducing their waste output, but actually reducing it enough to achieve the desired effect of reducing concentrations in the lake.  They cannot benefit from "doing damage more slowly" -- only from actually helping.  If cutting emissions, even to zero, is insufficient to allow the lake to naturally purge the waste, then they will still be on the hook for cleanup.  This is similar to the US "Superfund" system, and follows the widely accepted "polluter pays" principle.}}

=== 7. Gain around driving positive feedback loops===

A [[positive feedback]] loop speeds up a process. Meadows indicates that in most cases, it is preferable to slow down a positive loop, rather than speeding up a negative one.

{{quote|The [[eutrophication]] of a lake is a typical feedback loop that goes wild. In a eutrophic lake (which means well-nourished), lots of life can be supported (fish included).

An increase of [[nutrient]]s will lead to an increase of productivity, growth of [[phytoplankton]] first, using up as much nutrients as possible, followed by growth of [[zooplankton]], feeding up on the first ones, and increase of fish populations. The more available nutrients there are, the more productivity is increased. As plankton organisms die, they fall to the bottom of the lake, where their matter is degraded by decomposers.

However, this degradation uses up available [[oxygen]], and in the presence of huge amounts of organic matter to degrade, the medium progressively becomes [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] (there is no more oxygen available). In time, all oxygen-dependent life dies, and the lake becomes a smelly anoxic place where no life can be supported (in particular no fish).}}

=== 6. Structure of information flow (who does and does not have access to what kinds of information)===

[[Information flow (disambiguation)|Information flow]] is neither a parameter, nor a reinforcing or slowing loop, but a loop that delivers new information. It is cheaper and easier to change information flows than it is to change structure.

:For example, a monthly public report of water pollution level, especially nearby the industrial release, could have a lot of effect on people's opinions regarding the industry, and lead to changes in the waste water level of pollution.

=== 5. Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints)===

Pay attention to rules, and to who makes them.

{{quote|For example, a strengthening of the law related to chemicals release limits, or an increase of the tax amount for any water containing a given pollutant, will have a very strong effect on the lake water quality.}}

=== 4. Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure===

[[Self-organization]] describes a system's ability to change itself by creating new structures, adding new negative and positive feedback loops, promoting new information flows, or making new rules.

{{quote|For example, microorganisms have the ability to not only change to fit their new polluted environment, but also to undergo an evolution that makes them able to biodegrade or bioaccumulate chemical pollutants. This capacity of part of the system to participate in its own [[eco-evolution]] is a major leverage for change.}}

=== 3. Goal of the system ===
Changing goals changes every item listed above: parameters, feedback loops, information and self-organization.

{{quote|A city council decision might be to change the goal of the lake from making it a free facility for public and private use, to a more [[ecotourism|tourist]] oriented facility or a [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] area. That goal change will effect several of the above leverage points: information on water quality will become mandatory and legal punishment will be set for any illegal effluent.}}

=== 2. Mindset or paradigm that the system &amp;mdash; its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters &amp;mdash; arises from ===

A societal paradigm is an idea, a shared unstated assumption, or a system of thought that is the foundation of complex social structures. Paradigms are very hard to change, but there are no limits to paradigm change. Meadows indicates paradigms might be changed by repeatedly and consistently pointing out anomalies and failures in the current paradigm to those with open minds.

:''A current paradigm is "Nature is a stock of resources to be converted to human purpose". What might happen to the lake were this collective idea changed ?''

=== 1. Power to transcend paradigms===

Transcending paradigms may go beyond challenging fundamental assumptions, into the realm of changing the values and priorities that lead to the assumptions, and being able to choose among value sets at will.

{{quote|Many today see Nature as a stock of resources to be converted to human purpose.  Many Native Americans see Nature as a living god, to be loved, worshipped, and lived with.  These views are incompatible, but perhaps another viewpoint could incorporate them both, along with others.}}

The '''Publicly Owned Enterprise''' ({{lang-de|Volkseigener Betrieb}}; abbreviated '''VEB''') was the main legal form of industrial enterprise in [[East Germany]]. They were all publicly owned and were formed after [[Nationalisation#Germany|mass nationalisation]] between 1945 and the early 1960s, and the handing back in 1954 of some 33 enterprises previously taken by the [[Soviet Union]] as [[War reparations|reparations]].

The managing director of a VEB was called a plant or works manager (German: ''Werkleiter'', ''Werkdirektor'' or ''Betriebsdirektor''). He or she was assisted by the first secretary of the factory party organisation (''Betriebsparteiorganisation'') of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]], and the chairman of the factory trade union (''Betriebsgewerkschaftsleitung''). Subordinate to them were roles such as "Chief Accountant" and "Technical Director".

VEBs were initially [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]] into units called Associations of Publicly Owned Enterprises (''Vereinigung Volkseigener Betriebe'', VVBs). A VVB existed in most major industries, to consolidate production and reduce waste. They had all been replaced by 1979 with the ''[[Combine (enterprise)|VEB Kombinate]]'', or VEB Group, which integrated the VEBs much more closely than the largely administrative VVBs. Under this system, the term 'Kombinate' was frequently dropped and the term "VEB" usually implied the group rather than the individual factory. The organisation of all state enterprises was the responsibility of the State Planning Commission.

VEBs often had company sports teams, and played an important role in the promotion of sports.

In 1989, VEBs employed 79.9% of the East German workforce. After [[German reunification]] and the introduction of the market economy in 1990, the ownership of around 8,000 publicly owned enterprises passed to [[Treuhand]], the [[Trust company|trust agency]] which oversaw the privatization of GDR state property.

An honorary name was frequently added to the firm's actual name, for example, VEB Kombinat Chemische Werke "[[Walter Ulbricht]]" [[Leuna]]. This was a [[socialist emulation]] incentive towards fulfillment and overfulfillment of production quotas. Many Germans, as a form of mild protest against the nationalization of private businesses, nicknamed the VEBs ''Vati's ehemaliger Betrieb'', which translates to "Daddy's old business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = „VEB-GmbH“: „Vatis ehemaliger Betrieb — geklaut mit besonderer Höflichkeit“.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5122">In [[Germany|German]] [[corporate governance]], a '''''Vorstand''''' is the [[executive board]] of a [[corporation]] ([[public limited company]]). It is hierarchically subordinate to the [[supervisory board]] (''Aufsichtsrat''),&lt;ref name=Charkham&gt;{{cite book|title=Keeping Good Company: A Study of Corporate Governance in Five Countries|author=Jonathan P. Charkham|pages=14&amp;ndash;21|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-828987-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as German company law imposes a two-tier [[board of directors]].

German law confers executive powers on the executive board as a body. It is expected to act collectively and collegially. Unlike the [[Committee#Executive committee|executive committee]] (''aka'' operating committee or executive council) of a [[United States|US]] or [[United Kingdom|UK]] company, the executive board is not an adjunct of the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] (managing director). In contrast to [[Japan]]ese corporate governance, the German executive board has real decision-making power. It is, by law, the managing body of a company and cannot be instructed by any [[legal person]], be they natural or artificial, to act in such a way as to harm the business. Executive board members are personally liable for accepting any such instructions.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

The specific scope of an executive board's duties varies from business to business. (A group of companies may each have their own individual executive boards, for example). The president of the executive board (i.e., the CEO) and the position's role are determined by the supervisory board. German law permits, but does not require, executive board members to elect a president/CEO from among their number.  There are no specific legal requirements regarding the CEO's role, or even for the title given to the holder of the CEO position, although in practice the most common title is simply ''Vorstandsvorsitzender'', literally, "''Vorstand'' chairman". A noticeable minority refer to their CEOs as ''[[wikt:Sprecher|Sprecher]]'' (lit., "[[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]"), implying that the CEO is no more than ''[[primus inter pares]]''&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;; probably the best-known example for a company which uses this terminology is [[Deutsche Bank]].

The exact relationship between the CEO and the other executive officers depends on the company's type, how it was founded, and indeed the individual personalities of the people involved.  A family business could, for example, have a strong CEO who is a member of the founding family and exercises a great deal of power over the rest of the board.  In other companies, executive officers may hold themselves accountable to the executive board as a whole and not at all accountable to the CEO as an individual.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

The relationships among executive officers can vary too. It is common practice for board members to be senior executives with specific areas of functional responsibility. However, the law requires that they oversee the activities of their fellow officers, since they are still personally liable for any failings outside their specific departments/subdivisions.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt; Each board member has one vote.  Decisions are ''never'' escalated, when there is a lack of [[consensus]], to the supervisory board. Executive board meetings are commonly held on a weekly basis and can last up to a whole day.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

Formally, the power to appoint executive officers to the board lies with the supervisory board, which can appoint officers with a two-thirds majority vote of approval, or a simple majority if multiple rounds of voting are required in order to reach a decision.  Since up to 50% of the supervisory board members are delegates of the employees (or even external trade union representatives, for details see [[Co-determination in Germany|Mitbestimmung]]), this prevents employees from blocking the appointment of executive officers to the executive board.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

Executive officers have a certain degree of [[job security]], which is partly a preventative measure aimed at ensuring that executive boards are not dominated and that they are not "packed" with hand-picked appointees. Officers are usually appointed for the maximum statutory term—5 years. Removal must be for good cause, such as serious [[Breach of duty in English law|breach of duty]], and is subject to the supervisory board's veto. When an executive officer's ability to perform his duties is diminished due to old age, it is customary for him to serve out the remainder of his term but with a deputy to help perform his duties. Neither the shareholders nor the executive board can compel an officer to retire, whereas the supervisory board can.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

Commonly, the CEO receives between 30% and 50% greater salary than that of the other executive officers. An officer's remuneration usually comprises 65% basic salary, and 35% that is equally split between annual bonuses and benefits.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;
