      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5129">'''Luis Alfonso Robelo Callejas''' (born October 11, 1939), a [[Nicaraguan]] [[businessman]], was the founder of the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Movement]] (MDN).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ameringer | first = Charles D. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Political Parties of the Americas, 1980s to 1990s: Canada, Latin America... | publisher = Greenwood Press | year = 1992 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-313-27418-5| page = 465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the "moderates" on the five-members [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] that the [[Sandinista]]s claimed would rule Nicaragua following the overthrow of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]]. However, Robelo found that the real power lay with the FSLN National Directorate.

After resigning from the Junta on April 22, 1981, Robelo went into exile in 1982. He brought his MDN into [[Edén Pastora]]'s rebel [[Democratic Revolutionary Alliance]]. Later, he split with Pastora, and joined the [[United Nicaraguan Opposition]] (UNO) with [[Arturo Cruz]], and [[Adolfo Calero]] of the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]]. After UNO's collapse, he joined the directorate of the new [[Contras|Contra]] umbrella group, the [[Nicaraguan Resistance]].

During the political turmoil, Robelo's first marriage, to Indiana Cardenal Caldera, ended in divorce. They had four children: Indiana Margarita, Luis Alfonso (who died at a year and a half old), Eliza, and Alejandra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.euram.com.ni/pverdes/entrevista/indiana_cardenal_caldera.htm |title=Indiana Cardenal Caldera |access-date=2008-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108013130/http://www.euram.com.ni/pverdes/entrevista/indiana_cardenal_caldera.htm |archive-date=2008-01-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remarried a Costa Rican.

Following the [[Esquipulas Peace Agreement|Esquipulas accord]], President [[Oscar Arias]] of Costa Rica announced in January 1988 that Contra leaders could no longer live in his country. With his pregnant wife opposing a move from Costa Rica, he resigned from the directorate in early February.

The post-Sandinista government of [[Violeta Chamorro]] appointed Robelo to be ambassador to Costa Rica. In 1993, he was taken hostage during a standoff at the embassy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Former member of the RN Directorate.  Politician, businessman.  Born in Leon on October 11, 1939.  Earned a degree in chemical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Troy, N.Y.) in 1961.  Rector of the University of Central America 1970-1972 and President of the Nicaraguan Chamber of Commerce until 1975.  He then headed the Nicaraguan Development Institute, long active in the development of independent agricultural and small business cooperatives.  Following the assassination of La Prensa editor [[Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal|Pedro Joaquin Chamorro]], Robelo cofounded the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement, a social-democratic political party of businessmen, industrialists, and professionals opposed to the Somoza regime.  A leader and main spokesman for FAO working openly against the Somoza regime, he was arrested and publicly labeled a "subversive" by Somoza.  After the revolution Robelo was one of the five members of the original 1979 post-Somoza junta.  Resigned in April 1980 because of the Marxist tendencies in the FSLN-dominated government and the growing Cuban influence in the country.  Became President of the Democratic Coordinating Board.  Harassed by the FSLN after his resignation from the junta and detained by the Sandinistas when he sought to travel abroad in 1982, he was finally forced into exile later that year, and his property was confiscated.  In 1982, he joined with Edén Pastora and others in founding the ARDE, seeking to achieve the original democratic goals of the revolution.  Robelo was elected to the Nicaraguan Resistance Directorate in May 1987.  Resigned from the RN Directorate in January 1988.

The '''American Academy of Financial Management''' (AAFM) was a US-based board of standards, certifying body, and accreditation council focused on the finance sector and management professionals.&lt;ref name= "WSJ2004"&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109883075169856486 | title = Is Your Wealth Manager Certifiable? | journal = The [[Wall Street Journal]] | date = October 27, 2004 | page = D1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was criticized in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' as having low requirements for the [[Professional certification|credentials]] it confers&lt;!--in 2004 only the "Chartered Wealth Manager", in 2010 it first cites "numerous designations, including the CAM, CMA, CPM, CTEP and CWM" and then the "master financial professional"--&gt; and for excessive claims of links to other associations and industry experts.&lt;ref name="WSJ2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ2010" /&gt;

==History==
The AAFM was founded in 1996 through a merger of the American Academy of Financial Management &amp; Analysts (AAFMA) and the Founders Advisory Committee of the Original Tax and Estate Planning Law Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aafm.us/faq.html|title= American Academy of Financial Management FAQ|accessdate= December 6, 2010 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101202071302/http://www.aafm.us/faq.html| archivedate = December 2, 2010 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In January 2015, the AAFM sold its intellectual property to the Global Academy of Finance &amp; Management &amp;ndash; the logo for which is the same as that of the AAFM with different letters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafm.us/Global-American-Academy-of-Financial-Management.html "Home"] GAFM website&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; and the International Board of Certification Standards, which now awards the AAFM's certifications in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gafm.org/press.html "Press"] GAFM website&lt;/ref&gt; According to the GAFM website, George Mentz, the founder of the AAFM, is also the founder of GAFM/IBS brands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafm.us/board.html "Board"] GAFM website&lt;/ref&gt; In some other countries, such as India, a rump of the AAFM still operates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aafmindia.co.in/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The AAFM offered multiple professional membership, certifications, and designations. Members had to have come through one of the AAFM-recognized university programs or through a government-recognized executive educational program, although the board waived these requirements in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aafm.us/requirements.html | publisher = American Academy of Financial Management | title = Requirements | accessdate = December 6, 2010 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101202065459/http://www.aafm.us/requirements.html | archivedate = December 2, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAFM board has never directly provided training, but has recognized hundreds of approved providers. &lt;ref&gt;http://aafm.us/ACBSP-Alliance-MentzLetter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certifications/designations==
The AAFM awarded a number of its own designations, including chartered asset manager (CAM), chartered market analyst (CMA), chartered portfolio manager (CPM), chartered trust and estate planner (CTEP), chartered wealth manager (CWM), and master financial professional (MFP).&lt;ref name="WSJ2010" /&gt;

Some of these designations were available to anyone with an accredited degree or license in finance, investments, securities, economics, or accounting upon payment of a fee.&lt;ref name = "WSJ2010" /&gt; CWM certification normally involved about 80 hours of online study, although holders of certain professional designations, such as a [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA) or [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA), needed only to take a test and pay a fee; and anyone with sufficient professional experience could skip the test and get the designation by only paying fees.&lt;ref name="WSJ2004" /&gt; Those with a degree that involved at least some business coursework could also take an AAFM certification course, pay a fee, and receive an MFP.&lt;ref name = "WSJ2010" /&gt;

==Recognition==
According to the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA) eight designations were "offered and recognized by the issuing organization" (i.e., AAFM).&lt;ref name="FINRA"&gt;[http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_cam CAM] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727162742/http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_cam |date=July 27, 2014 }},[http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_rfs RFS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727161636/http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_rfs |date=July 27, 2014 }},[http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_MFP MFP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814022727/http://www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/ProfessionalDesignations/DesignationsListing/DesignationDetails/pc_MFP |date=August 14, 2014 }},[http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_CWM CWM] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083953/http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_CWM |date=August 19, 2014 }} ,[http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_CTEP CTEP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083057/http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_CTEP |date=August 19, 2014 }} ,[http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_CMA CMA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083942/http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_CMA |date=August 19, 2014 }} ,[http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_CPM CPM] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083731/http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_CPM |date=August 19, 2014 }}  ,[http://www.finra.org/investors/toolscalculators/professionaldesignations/designationslisting/designationdetails/pc_FAD FAD]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  FINRA does not state on these pages that they, or anyone else, recognises them.&lt;ref name="FINRA" /&gt; FINRA does state that it does not approve or endorse any professional credential or designation listed on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = August 21, 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and evidence ==
In October 2010, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' published an article detailing the use of questionable credentials by financial advisors that discussed the AAFM extensively.&lt;ref name="WSJ2010"&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703927504575540582361440848 | title = Is Your Advisor Pumping Up His Credentials? | newspaper = The [[Wall Street Journal]] | date = October 16, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The article noted that the AAFM included among its Global Board of Academic Advisors &amp; Professors several individuals who had never given their permission to be listed as board members. The article criticized the practice of many standards boards, AAFM included, of awarding credentials without requiring applicants to undergo any sort of assessment or examination, quoting the AAFM's founder, George Mentz, as evidence of this practice.

A claim on the AAFM website that it had a special affiliation with both the [[CFA Institute]] and the [[Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. (CFP Board)|CFP Board]], which administer [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] and [[Certified Financial Planner]] certificate programs, respectively, was rebutted by representatives of both organizations in the article. The CFP Board said that the AAFM had once helped provide continuing education for CFPs, but that it hasn't done so since 2006.&lt;ref name="WSJ2010" /&gt; Some of the individuals listed in a board of advisors told the WSJ they had no idea they were listed and hadn't agreed to it.&lt;ref name="WSJ2010" /&gt;

The AAFM has countered that individuals listed on its board of advisors did consent to be listed, posting emails from two individuals on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://aafm.us/wsj.html | publisher = American Academy of Financial Management | title = Recognized by Wall Street Journal Again}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also posted to its website part of the signature page of a document agreeing that the Association for Investment Management Research (the precursor to the CFA Institute) would not contest the AAFM's trademarks, with the signature itself blanked and replaced with the type-written statement, "Signed by Sharon Glover, who must have been Jeannie Andersons Boss at the time" [''sic''].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://aafm.us/CFAlegalagreementgloveranderson.JPG | format = JPEG | title = CFA Contract | publisher = AAFM}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  What appears to be a version of the same faxed agreement can be found on the GAFM website, with a signature by "Sharon Glover" and the handwritten information "VP &amp; Assoc. General Counsel 1/5/04".&lt;ref&gt;[http://aafm.us/AIMRTrademarkEfaxAgreementJan2004.pdf Copy of fax from C. Jeannie Anderson, Esq., Associate General Counsel, AIMR to Mr. George Mentz, AAFM, dated January 5, 2004] GAFM website&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arbitration Act 1996''' ([http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1996/ukpga_19960023_en_1 c 23]) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] which regulates [[arbitration]] proceedings within the jurisdiction of [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/4-502-1378?service=arbitration|title=Arbitration procedures and practice in the UK (England and Wales): overview|publisher=Practical Law|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kluwerlawonline.com/abstract.php?id=408189|author=Hong-lin Yu|title=Five Years On: A Review of the English Arbitration Act 1996|publisher=(2002) 19 Journal of International Arbitration, Issue 3|page=209–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/files/england-25789.pdf|title=Arbitration - England &amp; Wales|publisher=[[Norton Rose Fulbright]]|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1996 Act only applies to parts of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/23/section/2 Arbitration Act 1996, section 2]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Scotland the rules governing arbitrations are found in schedule 7 of the [[Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990]] and are based upon the UNCITRAL Model Law.

==Overview==
England and Wales is one of the very few developed jurisdictions in the world which has consciously elected not to follow the [[UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration]].  This is a position which has been subject to criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.luiss.it/694/1/lembo-20100713.pdf|title=The 1996 UK Arbitration Act and the UNCITRAL Model Law - a contemporary analysis|author=Sara Lembo|date=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General duty of the tribunal==
[[Image:LCIA.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[London Court of International Arbitration]].]]
The Act mandates that the general duty of the [[arbitral tribunal]] is to:&lt;ref name=s33&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/23/section/33 Arbitration Act 1996, section 33]&lt;/ref&gt;
# act fairly and impartially as between the parties, giving each party a reasonable opportunity of putting his case and dealing with that of his opponent, and
# adopt procedures suitable to the circumstances of the particular case, avoiding unnecessary delay or expense, so as to provide a fair means for the resolution of the matters falling to be determined.
The various subsequent provisions relating to the conduct of arbitrations are largely pinned upon this overriding duty.  The legislation specifies that "The tribunal shall comply with that general duty in conducting the arbitral proceedings, in its decisions on matters of procedure and evidence and in the exercise of all other powers conferred on it."&lt;ref name=s33 /&gt;

Subject to that overriding duty, the tribunal has broad discretion in relation to matters of procedure and evidence.  The legislation provides that "It shall be for the tribunal to decide all procedural and evidential matters, subject to the right of the parties to agree any matter."&lt;ref name=s34&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/23/section/34 Arbitration Act 1996, section 34]&lt;/ref&gt;

Procedural and evidential matters include:&lt;ref name=s34 /&gt;
# when and where any part of the proceedings is to be held;
# the language or languages to be used in the proceedings and whether translations of any relevant documents are to be supplied;
# whether any and if so what form of written statements of claim and defence are to be used, when these should be supplied and the extent to which such statements can be later amended;

# whether and to what extent the tribunal should itself take the initiative in ascertaining the facts and the law; and
# whether and to what extent there should be oral or written evidence or submissions.

The Act also imposes a duty on the parties to "do all things necessary for the proper and expeditious conduct of the arbitral proceedings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/23/section/40 Arbitration Act 1996, section 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stay of legal proceedings==
If any legal proceedings are commenced against a party which are subject to an arbitration agreement, then the party may apply to the court for a stay of those legal proceedings, and the Act provides that the court "shall grant a stay unless [it is] satisfied that the arbitration agreement is [[void (law)|null and void]], inoperative, or incapable of being performed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/23/section/9 Arbitration Act 1996, section 9]&lt;/ref&gt;  However this provision does not apply to a domestic arbitration agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/23/section/86 Arbitration Act 1996, section 86]&lt;/ref&gt;  In such cases the court has a wider discretion whether or not to grant a stay including whether there are "other sufficient grounds" for not requiring the parties to abide by the arbitration agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Note in particular in relating to consumer contracts, in {{cite bailii|litigants=Mylcrist Builders Ltd v Buck|year=2008|court=EWHC|num=2172}} the High Court held that a clause in a consumer contract submitting all disputes to arbitration were not enforceable under the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]].  {{cite web|url=https://www.ashurst.com/publication-item.aspx?id_Content=4009|publisher=Ashurst|title=Compulsory arbitration clause in consumer contract not binding on the consumer; right of access to courts should be reserved|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusion of the courts==
[[File:Royal_courts_of_justice.jpg|thumb|upright=1.591|The [[Royal Courts of Justice]].]]
Section 69 permits an appeal on a point of law to a court unless the parties have agreed to exclude that right.&lt;ref name=s69&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/23/section/69 Arbitration Act 1996, section 69]&lt;/ref&gt;  But the right to bring an appeal may only be exercised either with the agreement of the other party, or with the leave of the court.  An agreement by the parties to dispense with the requirement to give reasons for the tribunal's award is treated as an agreement to exclude the court's jurisdiction to hear an appeal on a point of law.&lt;ref name=s69 /&gt;

==Challenging the award==
Under the Act there are broadly only two ways in which an [[arbitration award]] may be challenged (apart from appeal on a point of law):
* Challenging the substantive jurisdiction under section 67; or
* Seeking to set aside the award for serious irregularity under section 68.

The Act defines serious irregularity as one or more of the following which the court considers has caused or will cause "substantial injustice" to the applicant:
# failure by the tribunal to comply with section 33 (general duty of tribunal);
# the tribunal exceeding its powers (otherwise than by exceeding its substantive jurisdiction);
# failure by the tribunal to conduct the proceedings in accordance with the procedure agreed by the parties;
# failure by the tribunal to deal with all the issues that were put to it;
# any arbitral or other institution or person vested by the parties with powers in relation to the proceedings or the award exceeding its powers;
# uncertainty or ambiguity as to the effect of the award;
# the award being obtained by fraud or the award or the way in which it was procured being contrary to public policy;
# failure to comply with the requirements as to the form of the award; or
# any irregularity in the conduct of the proceedings or in the award which is admitted by the tribunal or by any arbitral or other institution or person vested by the parties with powers in relation to the proceedings or the award.

==Recognition of foreign awards==
Recognition of foreign awards is addressed in Part III of the statute.

Section 99 provides that Part II of the [[Arbitration Act 1950]], which deals with enforcement of non-[[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention]] awards shall continue to apply to such awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/23/section/99 Arbitration Act, section 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the part deals with the enforcement of awards from contracting states to the New York Convention.  Those provisions broadly replicate the architecture of the Convention, and provide that such an award shall only be refused on the ground specified in the Convention, specifically:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/23/section/103 Arbitration Act 1996, section 103]&lt;/ref&gt;
# that a party to the arbitration agreement was (under the law applicable to him) under some incapacity;
# that the arbitration agreement was not valid under the law to which the parties subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made;
# that he was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case;
# that the award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration (but see subsection (4));
# that the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, with the law of the country in which the arbitration took place;
# that the award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, it was made; or
# if the award is in respect of a matter which is not capable of settlement by arbitration, or if it would be contrary to [[public policy]] to recognise or enforce the award.

'''Željko Ražnatović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Жељко Ражнатовић}}, {{IPA-sh|ʐêːʎko raʐnâːtoʋit͡ɕ|pron}}; 17 April 1952 – 15 January 2000), better known as '''Arkan''' (Аркан), was a Serbian [[career criminal]] and commander of a paramilitary force in the [[Yugoslav Wars]], called the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]]. He was on [[Interpol]]'s most wanted list in the 1970s and 1980s for robberies and murders committed in a number of countries across Europe, and was later indicted by the UN for [[crimes against humanity]] for his role during the wars. Ražnatović was up until his death the most powerful crime boss in the Balkans. He was assassinated in January 2000, before his trial could take place.

==Early life==
Željko Ražnatović was born in [[Brežice]], a small border town in [[Styria (Slovenia)|Slovenian Styria]], [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]]. His father, [[Veljko Ražnatović]], served as a decorated officer in the [[SFR Yugoslav Air Force]], earning high rank for his notable [[World War II]] involvement on the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisan]] side, and was stationed in Slovenian Styria at the time of Željko's birth.&lt;ref&gt;Miloš Milikić Mido – ''Za naše nebo — Monografija prve klase letača Vazduhoplovnog učilišta 1945-1947''. Belgrade 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent part of his childhood in [[Zagreb]] (SR Croatia) and [[Pančevo]] (SR Serbia), before his father's job eventually took the family to the Yugoslav capital of [[Belgrade]] (SR Serbia), which Ražnatović considered his hometown. His father was born in [[Cetinje]] (SR Montenegro), a descendant of the Ražnatović brotherhood, and had taken part in the Yugoslav liberation of [[Priština]] in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Željko Ražnatović Arkan - život u trileru (16) Crna Gora moja otadžbina|date=31 January 2000|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/02/01/srpski/F00013101.shtm|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ražnatović grew up in Belgrade&lt;ref name=svedok70322&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svedok.rs/index.asp?show=70322|title=Internet Svedok - 916 |publisher=Svedok.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with three older sisters in a strict, militaristic household with regular beatings administered by his father. In a 1991 interview he recalled: "He didn't really hit me in a classical sense, he'd basically grab me and slam me against the floor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dada Vujasinovic|url=http://www.dadavujasinovic.com/Arkan.htm|title=Ratnik ogrezao u svetosavlju|publisher=duga|date=8 April 1994|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth, Ražnatović aspired to become a pilot, as his father had been. Due to the highly demanding and significant positions of his parents, there appeared to be very little time in which a bond was able to be established between parents and children. His parents eventually divorced during his teenage years.&lt;ref name=svedok70322/&gt;

Ražnatović was arrested for the first time in 1966 after snatching women's purses around [[Tašmajdan]],&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština"&gt;{{cite web|author=Filip Svarm|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=906970|title=Arkanova ostavština|publisher=Vreme.com|date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; spending a year at a juvenile detention center not far from Belgrade. His father then sent him to the seaside town of [[Kotor|Kotor (in Montenegro)]] to join the [[Yugoslav Navy]], but Ražnatović had other plans, ending up in Paris at the age of 15. In 1969 he was arrested by French police and shipped home, where he was sentenced to three years at the detention center in [[Valjevo]] for several burglaries. During this time he organized his own gang in the prison.&lt;ref name=svedok70322/&gt;

In his youth, Ražnatović was a [[ward (legal)|ward]] of his father's friend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=La3sAAAAMAAJ|title=Danas - Google Boeken|publisher=Books.google.com|date=18 December 2009|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2014}} the Slovenian politician and Federal Minister of the Interior, [[Stane Dolanc]].&lt;ref name=PIC/&gt; Dolanc was chief of the secret police and a close associate of the Yugoslav president, [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]].

Whenever Ražnatović was in trouble, Dolanc helped him, allegedly as a reward for his services to the Yugoslav secret state police ([[UDBA]]), as seen in the escape from the Lugano prison in 1981. Dolanc is quoted as having said: "One Arkan is worth more than the whole UDBA."&lt;ref name=PIC&gt;{{cite book|title=Partners in Crime: The Risks of Symbiosis Between the Security Sector and Organized Crime in Southeast Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMGxXQpfvWUC&amp;pg=PA42|year=2004|publisher=CSD|isbn=978-954-477-115-7|pages=42–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal career==
===Western Europe===
In 1972, aged 20, he migrated to Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština"/&gt; Abroad, he was introduced to and kept contact with many well-known criminals from Yugoslavia such as [[Ljubomir Magaš|Ljuba Zemunac]], [[Ranko Rubežić]], [[Đorđe Božović|Đorđe "Giška" Božović]], [[Goran Vuković]], et al., all of whom were also occasionally contracted by the Yugoslav secret service, and all of whom were since assassinated or otherwise killed. He took the nickname "Arkan" from one of his forged passports. On 28 December 1973 he was arrested in Belgium following a bank robbery, and was sentenced to ten years in prison.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština"/&gt;

He managed to escape from the [[Verviers]] prison on 4 July 1979.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština"/&gt; Although Ražnatović was apprehended in the Netherlands on 24 October 1979, the few months he was free were enough for at least two more armed robberies in Sweden and three more in the Netherlands. Serving a seven-year sentence at a prison in [[Amsterdam]], he pulled off another escape on 8 May 1981 after someone slipped him a gun. Wasting no time, more robberies followed, this time in Germany, where after less than a month of freedom he was arrested in Frankfurt on 5 June 1981 following a jewellery store stickup. In the ensuing shootout with police he was lightly wounded, resulting in his placement in the prison hospital ward, where looser security allowed him to escape again only four days later, on 9 June, supposedly by jumping from the window, beating up the first bystander and stealing his clothing before disappearing.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština"/&gt;

His final European arrest occurred in [[Basel]], Switzerland during a routine traffic check on 15 February 1983. However he managed to escape again within months, this time from [[Thorberg Castle|Thorberg]] prison on 27 April. It is widely speculated that Ražnatović was closely affiliated with the Yugoslav security service [[UDBA]] throughout his criminal career abroad.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština"/&gt;

He had convictions or warrants in Belgium (bank robberies, prison escape), the Netherlands (armed robberies, prison escape), Sweden (20 burglaries, 7 bank robberies, prison escape, attempted murder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/9903/31/kosovo5.html|title=Aftonbladet nyheter: Kriget om Kosovo|publisher=aftonbladet.se|date=31 March 1999|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[West Germany|Germany]] (armed robberies, prison escape), Austria, Switzerland (armed robberies, prison escape), and Italy.

===Return to Yugoslavia===
Ražnatović returned to Belgrade in May 1983, continuing his criminal career by opening a number of illegal businesses. In November 1983, six months after his return, a bank in Zagreb was robbed with the robbers leaving a rose on the counter – allegedly Ražnatović's signature from his Western European robberies.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština" /&gt; As a result, two federal policemen, members of the Secretariat of Internal Affairs' (SUP) Tenth department, showed up in civilian clothing looking for Arkan at his mother's apartment on 27 March Street in Belgrade.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština" /&gt;

Ražnatović was not there, so his mother called him and said that two unknown males waited for him.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština" /&gt; He showed up with a revolver and proceeded to shoot and wound both policemen – he shot the first one on the spot and the other while trying to flee the scene. Arkan was detained immediately, however, barely 48 hours later he was released. The occurrence made it clear to all observers that he enjoyed protection from the political elite. He spent the mid-1980s running a disco club, "Amadeus", together with Žika Živac and Tapi Malešević. Located in the [[Tašmajdan]] neighbourhood, the club was reportedly another perk of their contractual work for the security service.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština" /&gt;

Furthermore, Arkan could be seen riding around Belgrade in his pink [[Cadillac]] and gambling on [[roulette]] in casinos all over the country, from Belgrade and nearby [[Pančevo]] to [[Sveti Stefan]] and [[Portorož]].&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština" /&gt; Following a game of poker in a private apartment at Ive Lole Ribara Street, [[Bečići]], an elevator altercation started with a tenant from the apartment building. Arkan reportedly broke the man's arm after beating him with a gun. He couldn't avoid being charged this time and the trial saw an interesting exchange between him and the judge – during the pre-session identification Arkan stated he was employed by the Secretariat of Internal Affairs. When this was challenged by the prosecutor, Arkan produced a document about a mortgage loan that he obtained from the Federal State Security for his house at Ljutice Bogdana Street. He ended up receiving a six-month sentence, which he served at the Belgrade Central Prison.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština" /&gt;

==Yugoslav Wars==
===Early===
Only days after the Croatian elections in 1990, Ražnatović, who was the leader of the ''[[Delije]]'' (football club [[Red Star Belgrade]]'s Ultras), was present at the away game against Croatian side [[Dinamo Zagreb]] at [[Stadion Maksimir]] on 13 May 1990, a match that ended in the infamous [[Dinamo–Red Star riot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dalje.com/en-sports/video--day-when-maksimir-stadium-went-up-in-flames/257791 |title=VIDEO: Day When Maksimir Stadium Went up in Flames |publisher=Dalje.com |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=1 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301221046/http://dalje.com/en-sports/video--day-when-maksimir-stadium-went-up-in-flames/257791 |archivedate=1 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ražnatović and the Delije, consisting of 1,500 people, were involved in a huge fight with the [[Bad Blue Boys|home team's football hooligans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/5707-football-is-war.html|title=Football is War|publisher=Tol.org|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 1990, as the political situation in Yugoslavia became tense (see [[Log Revolution]]), Ražnatović created a paramilitary group named the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]]. Ražnatović was the supreme commander of the unit, which was primarily made up of members of the ''Delije'' and his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Football Hooligans, and War|author=Ivan Čolović|publisher=Central European University Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2017}}

In late October 1990, Ražnatović traveled to [[Knin]] (in Croatia) to meet representatives of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], a Serb break-away region that sought to remain in [[FR Yugoslavia]], as opposed to the Croatian government that seceded. On 29 November 1990, Croatian police arrested him at the Croatian-Bosnian border crossing [[Dvor na Uni]], along with local Dušan Carić, and Belgraders Dušan Bandić and Zoran Stevanović. His entourage was sent to [[Sisak]], and was charged with conspiracy to overthrow the newly-formed Croatian state. Ražnatović was sentenced to 20 months in jail. He was released from Zagreb's [[Remetinec prison]] on 14 June 1991. It has been claimed that the Croatian and Serbian governments agreed on a 1,000,000 [[Deutsche Mark]] settlement for his release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hrvatska za Arkana dobila milion maraka|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/01/18/srpski/H00011704.shtm|work=Glas-javnosti|publisher=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}} (in Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1991, Ražnatović stayed for some time at the [[Cetinje monastery]], with Metropolitan [[Amfilohije Radović]]. His group of men, fully armed, were allowed to enter the monastery, where they served as security.&lt;ref name=ENOVINE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-novine.com/srbija/srbija-licnosti/32577-Zvijer-bezdana.html|title=Zvijer iz bezdana |publisher=e-novine.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/74645/Kozaci-ne-obezbedjuju-manastir|title=Kozaci ne obezbeđuju manastir|publisher=Blic.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His group traveled from Cetinje to the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]]. On his return from Dubrovnik, he was again a guest at Cetinje.&lt;ref name=ENOVINE/&gt;

===War===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
The Serb Volunteer Guard, commonly known as "Arkan's Tigers", was organized as a paramilitary force supporting the Serb armies, set up in a former military facility in [[Erdut]]. The force, led by Arkan and [[Milorad Ulemek|Legija]], consisted of a core of 200 men and perhaps totaled no more than 500 to 1,000, but was much feared.&lt;ref&gt;Vasic, "Yugoslav Army" p. 134; UN experts ''Final Report'' par. 92, 139&lt;/ref&gt; It saw action from mid-1991 until late 1995, and was supplied and equipped privately, by the reserves of the Serbian police force, and through capturing enemy arms.

When war in Croatia broke out, the unit was active in the [[Vukovar]] region. After the Bosnian War broke out in April 1992 the unit moved between the Croatian and Bosnian fronts. In Croatia, it fought in various areas in [[SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]] (Serbian Krajina). Arkan reportedly had a dispute over military operations with Krajina leader [[Milan Martić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/108/t108-4.htm|title=Vreme News Digest Agency No 108|publisher=Scc.rutgers.edu|date=18 October 1993|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bosnia, the unit notably fought in battles in and around [[Zvornik]], [[Bijeljina]] and [[Brčko (city)|Brčko]], mostly against Bosniak and Bosnian Croat paramilitary groups.

In late 1995 his troops fought in the area of [[Banja Luka]], [[Sanski Most]] and [[Prijedor]]. In October 1995 he left Sanski Most, as the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Army]] reclaimed the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/vt2/sanskimost/u_spomen_/u_spomen_na_ubijene_sanjane.htm|title=U spomen na ubijene Sanjane|publisher=Angelfire.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ražnatović personally led most of the operations, and rewarded his most efficient officers and soldiers with ranks, medals and eventually products of lootings. Several younger soldiers were rewarded for their actions in and around [[Kopački Rit]] and [[Bijelo Brdo, Croatia|Bijelo Brdo]]. Ražnatović reportedly sent one of his most trusted men, Radovan Stanišić, to Italy to start a relationship with [[Camorra]] boss [[Francesco Schiavone]]. According to [[Roberto Saviano]], Schiavone eased arms smuggling to Serbia by stopping the Albanian mobsters' blocking of weapons routes, and helped money transfer into Serbia in the form of humanitarian aid [[Sanctions against Serbia|amid the international sanctions]]. In exchange the Camorra acquired companies, enterprises, shops and farms in Serbia at optimal prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giugenna.com/2003/07/13/roberto-saviano-scampia-erzegovina|title=Roberto Saviano. "Scampia-Erzegovina"|author=Giuseppe Genna|publisher=Giugenna.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war fame==
Ražnatović came to serve as a popular icon for both Serbs and their enemies. For some Serbs he was a patriot and folk hero, while serving as a target of hatred and fear to their enemies.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Arkan became an untouchable criminal figure in Belgrade and all of the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but it was very hard to prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the postwar period after the [[Dayton agreement]] was signed, Ražnatović returned to his interests in sport and private business. The Serb Volunteer Guard was officially disbanded in April 1996 with the threat to be reactivated in case of war emergency. In June of that year he took over a second division soccer team [[FK Obilić Belgrade|FK Obilić]] which he soon turned into a top caliber club, even winning the [[First League of FR Yugoslavia 1997-98|1997/98]] [[Serbian Superliga|Yugoslav league]] championship. According to a book by [[Franklin Foer]], ''[[How Soccer Explains the World|How Football Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization]]'', Ražnatović threatened players on opposing teams if they scored against [[FK Obilić Belgrade|Obilić]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This threat was underlined by the thousands of veterans from his army that filled their home field, chanting threats, and on occasion pointing pistols at opposition players during matches. One player told the British football magazine ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' that he was locked in a garage when his team played [[FK Obilić Belgrade|Obilić]]. Europe's football governing body, [[UEFA]], considered prohibiting Obilić from participation in continental competitions because of its connections to Ražnatović. In response to this, Ražnatović stepped away from the position of president and gave his seat to his wife [[Svetlana Ceca Ražnatović|Ceca]]. In a 2006 interview, [[Dragoslav Šekularac]] (who was coach of Obilić while Arkan was with the club) said claims that Arkan verbally and physically assaulted Obilić players were false.&lt;ref name="Get out of here, I am Sekularac by Prvoslav Vujcic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanbookcircle.com/get-out-of-here-i-am-sekularac-by-prvoslav-vujcic.html|author=[[Prvoslav Vujčić]], ''[[Urban Book Circle]]''|title=Get out of here, I am Šekularac|accessdate=28 October 2013|date=1 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ražnatović was a chairman of the Yugoslav Kickboxing Association. 

==Kosovo War and NATO bombing==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
According to chief judge [[Richard May (judge)|Richard May]] from the United Kingdom, the [[ICTY]] issued an indictment against Ražnatović on 30 September 1997 for war crimes of [[genocide]] against the Muslim population, [[crimes against humanity]] and grave breaches of the [[Geneva convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ark-ii970930e.htm|title=Tpiy|publisher=Un.org|date=5 March 2007|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrant was not made public until 31 March 1999, a week after the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] had begun, as intervention in the [[Kosovo War]] (1998–99). Ražnatović's indictment was made public by the UN court's chief prosecutor [[Louise Arbour]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In the week before the start of NATO bombing – as the [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet talks]] collapsed – Ražnatović appeared at the Hyatt hotel in Belgrade, where most Western journalists were staying, and ordered all of them to leave Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karon|first=Tony|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,22121,00.html|title=Serbs Unplug CNN|publisher=TIME|date=25 March 1999|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the NATO bombing, Ražnatović denied the war crime charges against him in interviews he gave to foreign reporters. Ražnatović accused NATO of bombing civilians and creating refugees of all ethnicities, and stated that he would deploy his troops only in the case of a direct NATO ground invasion. After the [[U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]], which killed three journalists and led to a diplomatic row between the United States and the [[People’s Republic of China]], the [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade#Observer.2FPolitiken investigation|British ''Observer'' and Danish ''Politiken'' newspapers claimed]] the building might have been targeted because the office of the Chinese [[military attaché]] was being used by Ražnatović to communicate and transmit messages to his paramilitary group, the Tigers, in Kosovo. As neither paper offered any proof for this claim it was largely ignored by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/koSovo/press/b990508a.htm|title=Morning Briefing|accessdate=25 October 2009|date=8 May 1999|publisher=NATO Press Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkan showed a small rubber part of the [[1999 F-117A shootdown|downed F-117A]], which he had as "a souvenir", to Western journalists during the NATO bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MOGU DA POLOMIM F-117A: Evo kako je ARKAN uništio ponos Amerike i "nevidljivi" bombarder!

==ICTY indictment==
In March 1999, the Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) announced that Ražnatović had been indicted by the Tribunal, although the indictment was only made public after his assassination. According to the indictment Ražnatović was to have been prosecuted on 24 charges of [[crimes against humanity]] (Art. 5 ICTY Statute), grave breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]] (Art. 2 ICTY Statute) and violations of the [[laws of war]] (Art. 3 ICTY Statute), for the following acts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/zeljko_raznjatovic/ind/en/ark-ii970930e.pdf|title=Ražnatović: Initial Indictment|format=PDF|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Forcibly detaining approximately thirty-five Muslim Bosnian men in an inadequately ventilated room of about five square metres in size, withholding from them food and water, resulting in the deaths of two men.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Assassination==
[[File:Continental Hotel Belgrade.jpg|thumb|left|Hotel Intercontinental]]
Ražnatović was assassinated, on Saturday, 15 January 2000, 17:05 [[GMT]], in the lobby of Belgrade's elite [[Hotel Beograd InterContinental|InterContinental Hotel]], a location where he was surrounded by other hotel guests. The killer, Dobrosav Gavrić, a 23-year-old junior police mobile brigade member, had ties to the underworld and was on sick leave at the time. He walked up alone toward his target from behind. Ražnatović was sitting and chatting with two  friends and, according to BBC Radio, was filling out a betting slip. Gavrić waited for a few minutes, calmly walked up behind the party, and rapidly fired a succession of bullets from his [[CZ-99]] pistol. Ražnatović was shot in his left eye and lapsed into a coma on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/01/17/arkan.killing|title=Breaking, World, Business, Sports, Entertainment and Video News|publisher=Archives.cnn.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/605172.stm|title=Serbian warlord shot dead|publisher=BBC News|date=15 January 2000|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His bodyguard Zvonko Mateović put him into a car, and rushed him to a hospital, but he died on the way.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1069219|title=Arkan Dead|publisher=NPR|date=15 January 2000|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his widow, [[Ceca (singer)|Svetlana]], Ražnatović died in her arms as they were driving to the hospital. His companions Milenko Mandić, a business manager, and Dragan Garić, a police inspector, were also shot to death by Gavrić, who in turn was shot and wounded by Mateović. A female bystander was seriously wounded in the shootout as well. After complicated surgery, Gavrić survived, but was disabled and confined to a wheelchair as the result of a spinal wound.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Arkanov grob.jpg|thumb|right|Arkan's grave]]
A memorial ceremony in Ražnatović's honour was held on 19 January 2000 with writer [[Branislav Crnčević]], [[Yugoslav Left]] (JUL) official [[Aleksandar Vulin]], singers [[Oliver Mandić]], [[Toni Montano]], and [[Zoran Kalezić]], along with the entire first team of [[FK Obilić]] with club director Dragoslav Šekularac in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1188784 Šta je ostalo od Arkanove garde]; Vreme.com, 10 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Željko Ražnatović was buried at the [[Novo groblje, Belgrade|Novo groblje (New Cemetery)]] in Belgrade with military honours by his volunteers and with [[funeral rite]]s on 20 January 2000. Around 10,000 people attended the funeral.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Trials===
Dobrosav Gavrić pleaded innocent but was convicted and sentenced to 19 years in prison. His accomplices received from 3 to 15 years each, after a year-long trial in 2002. However the district court verdict was overturned by the Supreme Court because of "lack of evidence and vagueness of the first trial process". A new trial was conducted in 2006, ending on 9 October 2006 with guilty verdicts upheld for Gavrić as well as his accomplices, Milan Đuričić and Dragan Nikolić. Each man was sentenced to 30 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mondo.rs/a47127/Info/Srbija/Sedam-godina-od-ubistva-Arkana.html Sedam godina od ubistva Arkana]; mondo.rs, 15 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories===
{{speculation|section|date=May 2016}}
[[National Public Radio (United States)|NPR]] reported that Arkan simply knew too much when war crimes trials were becoming a reality for the Milošević regime.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; Former French Intelligence Officer Pierre-Henri Bunel suggested that "the executors of the political dirty work for the White House", who may have used Ražnatović as a puppet, were fearful of the disclosure of revelations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politiquedevie.net/Etats-Unis/AlQuaidaPHBunel.htm|title=La naissance d'Al Quaïda - Pierre-Henri Bunel|publisher=Politiquedevie.net|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bunel corroborates his claim by indicating that "...&amp;nbsp;c'est justement parce qu'on ne le cherche pas où il faudrait qu'on ne trouve pas l'ennemi public numéro 1 du moment". Ražnatović was, as stated above, on Interpol's Most Wanted list for nearly two decades.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Personal life==
Željko Ražnatović fathered nine children by five different women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tomislav Nikolić|url=http://www.kurir-info.rs/clanak/crna-hronika/kurir-29-06-2008/ameri|title=Ameri - Kurir|publisher=Kurir-info.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207131354/http://kurir-info.rs/clanak/crna-hronika/kurir-29-06-2008/ameri|archive-date=7 February 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His eldest son Mihajlo was born in [[Gothenburg]], in 1975, from a relationship with a Swedish woman. In 1992, 17-year-old Mihajlo decided to move to Serbia to live with his father. During this time the teenager was photographed wearing the uniform of his father's paramilitary unit during the Yugoslav Wars and according to a Swedish tabloid report the youngster participated in combat operations in [[Srebrenica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/de-skulle-avratta-srebrenica-fangar|title=De skulle avrätta Srebrenica-fångar|publisher=Expressen.se|date=11 July 2005|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mihajlo has since lived in Belgrade where he played for the [[KHK Crvena zvezda|Red Star Belgrade ice-hockey club]] off and on between 2000 and 2009, also representing Serbia-Montenegro on the national team level between 2002 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?statsleague=NLA&amp;player=69700&amp;team=&amp;year=&amp;status=&amp;leagueid=&amp;season=|title=Mihajlo Raznatovic|publisher=Eliteprospects.com|date=10 March 1975|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he also ran a sushi restaurant in Belgrade called Iki Bar and dated Macedonian pop singer [[Karolina Gočeva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/stara_arhiva/zabava/57157/Srecan-sam-sa-Karolinom|title=Stara arhiva|publisher=Blic.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Serbia after that.

In 2013 he was in the news in Serbia again following the conclusion of a court case that had dragged on since 2005 over Ražnatović's failure to meet the repayment terms on a [[Serbian dinar|RSD]]1.1 million [[car loan]] he took out in 2002 from [[Komercijalna banka|Komercijalna Banka]]. After continually failing to meet his monthly payments, the bank wanted the loan paid off in full in August 2005, and two years later took him to court. In June 2010 he was ordered to pay RSD3.3 million based upon the interest on the original loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alo.rs/vesti/51754/Sud_jurio_Arkanovog_sina_u_Cecinoj_vili |title=Stari ALO! - Sud jurio Arkanovog sina u Cecinoj vili! |publisher=Alo.rs |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825222656/http://www.alo.rs/vesti/51754/Sud_jurio_Arkanovog_sina_u_Cecinoj_vili |archivedate=25 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the verdict stated he owed the bank RSD2.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alo.rs/vesti/aktuelno/arkanov-sin-mora-da-vrati-tri-miliona-dinara/15286|title=Arkanov sin mora da vrati tri miliona dinara!|publisher=Alo.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkan also fathered two other children out of wedlock.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Ražnatović's first wife was Natalija Martinović, a Spanish language professor, with whom he had four children. Their divorce became official in December 1994. All four children decided to carry their mother's surname.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
[[File:Ceca2006.png|thumb|Arkan's best known wife [[Svetlana Ražnatović|Ceca]], famous Serbian [[turbo-folk]] singer]]
Since 1993, Ražnatović had been involved with folk singer [[Svetlana Ceca Ražnatović|"Ceca"]], 21 years his junior. Their lavish wedding ceremony on 19 February 1995 occurred as a day-long media production carried live on [[RTV Pink|TV Pink]] with different locations and changes of clothing (at different points of the ceremony Ražnatović alternated between [[World War I]] Serb military uniform and traditional Montenegrin attire). Ceca bore him two more children.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In June 1994, sometime after her separation from Ražnatović, Natalija Martinović and their four children left Yugoslavia and moved to [[Athens, Greece]], where Ražnatović bought them an apartment in the suburb of [[Glyfada]]. After Ražnatović's death, Martinović disputed his [[Will (law)|will]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/11/30/srpski/R00112702.shtm|title=Glas-javnosti (30 November 2000), a|publisher=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/12/02/srpski/R00120101.shtm|title=Glas-javnosti (2 December 2000)|publisher=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that Ceca, his second wife, doctored it. In May 2000, she sued Ceca over Ražnatović's assets, including the villa at Ljutice Bogdana Street in which he and Ceca lived (and where Ceca continues to reside), claiming it was built with funds from a bank loan Martinović and Ražnatović took out in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/11/30/srpski/R00112701.shtm|title=Glas-javnosti (30 November 2000), b|publisher=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court eventually ruled against Martinović.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=416198|title=Portret savremenika - Svetlana Ceca Raznatovic: Zitije sa pevanjem i pucanjem|publisher=Vreme.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court agreed with her assertions that the villa was built with money from a 1985 bank loan taken out by her and Ražnatović, but ruled she had forfeited any rights in future division of that asset when she signed the property over to Ražnatović in 1994 before moving to Greece.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 2012, Ražnatović's son by his first wife, Vojin Martinović, again accused Ceca of falsifying Ražnatović's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alo.rs/vesti/44988/Ceca_je_lazirala_Arkanov_testament |title=Stari ALO! - Ceca je lažirala Arkanov testament! |publisher=Alo.rs |accessdate=1 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622075756/http://www.alo.rs/vesti/44988/Ceca_je_lazirala_Arkanov_testament |archivedate=22 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Ražnatović's former associate [[Borislav Pelević]] said that the villa at Ljutice Bogdana Street was not mentioned in Ražnatović's will as he had already signed it over to his second wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Hronika/192456/Cecine-vile-nema-u-Arkanovom-testamentu|title=Cecine vile nema u Arkanovom testamentu!|publisher=Vesti-online.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the 2008 [[Serbian language|Serbian]] film ''[[The Tour (film)|The Tour]]'', a group of Serbian actors go on a tour in war-torn Bosnia. Among other factions, they meet an unnamed paramilitary unit wearing insignia similar to those of the Serb Volunteer Guard. Unit's commander (played by [[Sergej Trifunović]]) is obviously based on Ražnatović.
* In the 2014 Serbian docu-drama series ''Dosije: Beogradski klanovi'', one of the episodes tells the story of Ražnatović.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''''Beach Life''''' (known as '''''Spring Break''''' in North America) is a [[Business simulation game|business strategy]] [[video game]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] developed by [[Deep Red Games]]. The game was published by [[Eidos Interactive]] and released on September 6, 2002. In the game, players assume the role of a manager for an island holiday resort. As vacationers enjoy their stay at the resort, players must build, employ, and finance the right lodging, entertainment, and shopping establishments to please the clients and their individual needs.

== Gameplay ==
''Beach Life'' is a [[business simulation game]] in the same vein as ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]'' and ''[[Rollercoaster Tycoon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/springbreak/review.html ''Spring Break'' review] from ''[[GameSpot]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, the player manages an [[Ibiza]]-style holiday resort, complete with themed clubs, bars, and surf shops. Through learning what their guests want from their stay, different kinds of attractions and food and drink establishments can be built to satisfy their needs and make more money. Staff can be hired to help facilitate this, such as cleaners, mechanics, and security guards.

Gameplay options themselves come in two forms: the Scenario mode and the Sandbox mode. In Scenario mode, the player works their way through island after island, completing a number of set objectives in each. Their progress on a resort can be hampered by hazards such as shark attacks and thunderstorms, all while they build attractions and cater to the needs of the guests. Once they have beaten a level in Scenario mode, they can unlock it in Sandbox mode. Sandbox mode is essentially a "free-play" mode, where there are no objectives, unlimited time and more building options.

== Audio ==
The game's soundtrack consists of twelve licensed tracks from genres ranging from chillout to dance music, and changes tone throughout the day. For example, calming music tends to play during the daytime, while more lively dance and [[trance music|trance]] music comes on at night to fit the [[nightclub]] atmosphere. The music can be changed in-game via a music player located in the bottom right of the screen. Additionally, users can add music from their own collection to the game by copying music files into the game's soundtrack folder.

== Development ==
''Beach Life'' was developed by [[Deep Red Games]], a studio which had developed the critically well-received ''[[Monopoly Tycoon]]'' soon before the release of ''Beach Life''.&lt;ref name="pcgamer200112"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Rob|date=December 2001|title=''Spring Break''|journal=[[PC Gamer]]|volume=8|issue=12|pages=22|issn=1080-4471|oclc=31776112}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attending a press presentation on the game, ''[[PC Gamer]]'''s editor-in-chief Rob Smith was impressed with ''Beach Life''{{'s}} isometric graphics and compared them to ''[[Commandos 2: Men of Courage]]''. The game was initially slated for a spring 2002 release but was not released until September 2002.&lt;ref name="pcgamer200112"/&gt;

== Reception ==
Critically, the game was not very well received, with reviewers rarely giving over 70%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/springbreak/review.html?mode=web ''Spring Break'' for PC reviews] from ''[[GameSpot]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This was mainly due to a perceived unoriginality in the core gameplay mechanics, which do strikingly resemble most other business management sims. The original idea of resort management is often dismissed as being gimmicky.

However, the game is not without a wide fanbase, who appreciate the kooky sense of humor that the game has and its youthful, energetic spin on business management compared to most other games of the same genre.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6392">'''Benjamin Hauwanga''', commonly known as '''B.H.''', (born 24 September 1961 in [[Tsumeb]], [[Oshikoto Region|Oshikoto]])  is a [[Namibia]]n businessman. His parents separated while he was a young boy; his mother single-handedly raised him, although his father visited the family regularly. He has eight siblings.

He was fascinated with business at a very young age; as a child he sold indigenous food after school to contribute to the household income while his mother worked as a [[domestic worker]]. As with every business, money is the key and the main objective: Whenever he got, he used the change to buy sweets and resold them at school to get more money and increase cash-flow.

At the age of nine, he started cleaning yards and got paid weekly. This was a great incentive for him but later he realized that the money coming in weekly was not enough to buy enough stock to satisfy the demand for the product (sweets) at school. He arranged to receive the money month-end; that improved the cash-flow and the stock levels. As the cash-flow improved, he bought a bicycle to extend his operations. The bicycle took him three years to pay off.

His first shop was a cardboard-box in front of his mother's house in the black township, called "the Location".

Mr Watyako Mumbala from Elim Omunda gwambala he is a founder of Wamu Group of Companies

==Business career==
Hauwanga opened his first spares shop in [[Ongwediva]], selling car parts. He grew this business from suppliers in [[Windhoek]] and [[Johannesburg]] and then to the world. He has several operations around the country and has expanded into neighboring [[Angola]]. His operations in Angola are property development; he has completed several projects in Angola.

Benjamin "BH" has branches of the BH Group of Companies across [[Namibia]] with branches in [[Kavango Region|Kavango]], [[Oshana]], [[Omusati]], [[Khomas]] and [[Ohangwena]].

Benjamin Hauwanga joins an elite group of Namibian businessmen in owning a private plane. His Beechcraft 55 Baron aircraft is believed to have cost around N$3 million. He says he bought it to improve the logistical dimensions of his business operations. He bought it from Rami Barnes, a South African entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?option%3Dcom_content%26do_pdf%3D1%26id%3D3688 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327081013/http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=3688 |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hauwanga is the owner of the Bennies Entertainment Park and Lodge in [[Ongwediva]].

==Controversies==
In 2008, Hauwanga was involved in a legal saga with another prominent businessman, [[Harold Pupkewitz]]. The legal showdown that erupted was over money that the BH businesses claim to have lost in non-existent orders and deliveries from Pupkewitz: the amount of money in discussion was N$4 947 250.60. The dispute arose from payments that BH Motor Spares alleges to have made to Pupkewitz for goods that they had neither ordered nor received from the motoring mogul. BH claims that Pupkewitz invoiced and collected money for the orders. The sum of N$4 947 250.60 is accordingly due, owing and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff which sum, the defendant, despite demand, fails and/or refuse to pay to the plaintiff.

Hauwanga was represented by Sisa Namandje law firm while Pupkewitz was represented by the Lorentz Hangula Inc. law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?option%3Dcom_content%26do_pdf%3D1%26id%3D2280 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327081031/http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=2280 |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, BH was also involved in a scandal with the grandson of the former president [[Sam Nujoma]]. Joseph Nakanyala, grandson of Nujoma, tried to extort Hauwanga by using Nujoma's cell phone in June purporting to be the former president. In SMSs, Nakanyala threatened to kill Hauwanga if he did not give him money. Nakanyala was caught red-handed by the police while stealing a briefcase with money from Nujoma's residence and he later claimed that Hauwanga had sent him.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Through thorough investigations it was concluded that Nakanyala made all the stories up in an attempt to extort Hauwanga. Nakanyala withdrew his claims and publicly apologized to Hauwanga through lawyer Sisa Namandje.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In a statement signed by Nakanyala, he acknowledged having made these allegations saying: "I had no basis and right at the time of making such allegations to accuse Mr Benjamin Hauwanga. I acknowledge and recognize that the allegations I made have injured the good reputation and name of Mr Hauwanga, and I unconditionally and unreservedly apologize to him , his family, friends and all those who have been affected and inconvenienced by the false allegations I made" the statement reads further. The two shook hands and embraced warmly after Nakanyala finished reading his apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?option%3Dcom_content%26do_pdf%3D1%26id%3D5345 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327081041/http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=5345 |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Borile''' makes retro-modern bicycles and motorcycles in [[Padova]], [[Italy]], such as the B500CR, "a modern day interpretation of how a [[BSA Gold Star]] would look if it were produced today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Schvetz |first=Yossef |title=Borile B500CR A Screamin' Italian Single With Soul |url=http://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/borile-b500cr-16106.html |date=2001-03-19 |publisher=Motorcycle.com |quote= Umberto chose a smart way to get the powerful and lightweight engine he wanted for his thumper. Using the cylinder head, cylinder, piston and crankshaft from the GM speedway engine, he got around the problem of developing a totally new engine from scratch.  If you are not familiar with the GM engine, do not worry. Unless you follow speedway racing closely, there is little chance that you might have heard about it. Italy's GM have been producing world championship winning engines for a few decades.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Borile's technically advanced yet aesthetically vintage motorcycles are at the center of a marked retro wave during the first decade of the 21st century.  Early Boriles were handmade, limited-production creations, but later models are mass-produced.

A '''brochure''' is an informative paper document (often also used for advertising) that can be folded into a template, [[pamphlet]] or [[Folded leaflet|leaflet]]. A brochure can also be a set of related unfolded papers put into a pocket folder or packet. Brochurest are promotional documents, primarily used to introduce a [[company]], [[organization]], [[Product (business)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] and inform prospective customers or members of the public of the benefits. 

Brochures are distributed in many different ways: as newspaper inserts, handed out personally, by mail or placed in brochure racks in high traffic locations especially in tourist precincts. They may be considered as [[grey literature]]. &lt;ref name="UysalFesenmaier2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Muzaffer Uysal|author2=Daniel Fesenmaier|title=Communication and Channel Systems in Tourism Marketing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jtTYXLB71wkC&amp;pg=PA112|date=12 November 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-58697-2|pages=11 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Arizona Limited brochure 1940.jpg|thumb|A 1940s brochure advertising the train, Arizona Limited]]
A brochure is usually folded and only includes summary information that is promotional in character. A booklet is usually several sheets of paper with a cardstock cover and bound with staples, string or plastic binding. In contrast, a single piece of unfolded paper is usually called an insert, [[Flyer_(pamphlet)|flyer]] or bulletin.

==Varieties==
[[File:Folding.svg|thumb|1: letter/C tri-fold, 2: gate tri-fold, 3: roll/double gate fold, 4: accordion z-fold, 5: double (parallel) fold, 6: double right-angle / French fold]]
Brochures available in electronic format are called ''e-brochures''. This format has the added benefit of unlimited distribution and cost savings when compared to traditional paper brochures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebrochuresforeveryone.co.uk/ebrochures/ebrochure-benefits.php|title=eBrochure benefits - eBrochures For Everyone (Page Turning Catalogues and Brochures)|last=Everyone|first=Webs For|website=www.ebrochuresforeveryone.co.uk|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common types of single-sheet brochures are the ''bi-fold'' (a single sheet printed on both sides and folded into halves) and the ''tri-fold'' (the same, but folded into thirds). A bi-fold brochure results in four panels (two panels on each side), while a tri-fold results in six panels (three panels on each side).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brochuredesignservice.com/Brochures.aspx|title=Types of Brochures - Brochure Types|website=www.brochuredesignservice.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [http://www.renaissancebrochure.com/content/deciding-brochure-design-structure-binding-and-folding brochure fold arrangements] are possible: the accordion or "z-fold" method, the "c-fold" method, etc. Larger sheets, such as those with detailed maps or expansive photo spreads, are folded into four, five, or six panels. When two card fascia are affixed to the outer panels of the z-folded brochure.

Booklet brochures are made of multiple sheets most often [[saddle-stitch]]ed, stapled on the creased edge, or [[perfect bound]] like a [[Paperback|paperback book]], and result in eight or more panels.

==Editing and design==
Brochures and leaflets are carefully edited to promote an organization or business, to sell a service or product, raise awareness or to champion a cause. Editors will be clear who they are trying to reach and define their target audience. They will also be conscious of skillful layout and design aimed at attracting the attention of their readers.&lt;ref name="Spencer-Thomas 2010"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Designing Leaflets and Brochures | last = Spencer-Thomas | first = Owen | work = [[Owen Spencer-Thomas]] | date = 2018 | accessdate = 2018-02-13 | url = http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/media-tips/designing-a-leaflet/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printing==
Brochures are often printed using [[four-color process]] on thick, glossy paper to give an impression of quality. Businesses may print small quantities of brochures on a [[computer printer]] or on a [[Digital printing|digital printer]], but [[offset printing]] turns out higher quantities at a lower cost per unit.

Compared with a flyer, a brochure usually uses [[Paper density|higher-quality paper]], more color, and is folded.

'''Don Cameron MBE''' BSc MA MIEE D.Eng  [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society|FRSGS]] (born 1939) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[hot air balloon|balloonist]], and later founder of [[Cameron Balloons]], the world's largest hot air balloon manufacturer.

==Early life and career==

Born in [[Glasgow]] in 1939, Cameron went to [[Allan Glen's School]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cameronballoons.co.uk/faq/historyofcameronballoons&lt;/ref&gt; and then went on to study [[aeronautical engineering]] at the [[University of Glasgow]], graduating in 1961. In 1963 he obtained a master's degree at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[United States]]. He then joined the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]]. Cameron developed Britain's first modern [[hot air balloon]] entitled ''[[Bristol Belle]]'' which flew for the first time at [[Weston on the Green]] in [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]] on 9 July 1967. In 1968 Cameron and Leslie Goldsmith founded Omega Balloons which constructed ten balloons, before the company split into [[Cameron Balloons]] and Western Balloons in 1970.

[[Cameron Balloons]] of [[Bristol]], England, was formed by Cameron in 1971 - five years after he constructed his first balloon. The new company was based in [[Cotham, Bristol]] where a total of twenty nine balloons were made in the basement of the property. 1971 also saw Cameron build ''Golden Eagle'', a balloon designed specifically to fly across the [[Sahara]] to shoot a film for [[Jack Le Vien]].

In 1978 his attempt to make the premier [[Atlantic]] crossing by balloon ended when bad weather forced his heated [[helium]] balloon ''Zanussi'' down after a 2,000 mile flight from Canada. It was piloted by Cameron and Christopher Davey. They left [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] on 26 July 1978, covered 1,780 miles, and ditched on 30 July 1978 in the [[Bay of Biscay]] only 110 miles from [[France]] after a tear developed in the balloon. The two planned a second attempt, but discarded their plans when the ''[[Double Eagle II]]'' successfully made a [[transatlantic flight]] three weeks later. Cameron and Davey were awarded the Gold Medal of the [http://royalaeroclub.co.uk/medals-and-awards.php?title=&amp;id=54 Royal Aero Club] in the same year.
 
Never averse to technical challenges, Cameron went on to write computer programmes to design specially shaped balloons.

Cameron has received the gold, silver and bronze medals of the British [[Royal Aero Club]] for his ballooning achievements which include being the first man to cross the [[Sahara]] and the [[Alps]] by hot-air balloon, and making the first flight between the UK and the former USSR in 1990.

His dream came true in 1992 when he flew a balloon of his own design from [[Bangor, Maine]], [[United States|U.S.]] to [[Portugal]] and took second place in the first ever [[transatlantic balloon race]].

In 1999, [[Breitling Orbiter]] 3, built by [[Cameron Balloons]], made the first non-stop flight round the world.

Don Cameron is one of the few [[aeronauts]] to be awarded the [[Harmon Trophy]], as the 'World's Outstanding Aviator' in 1999

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19849">'''Edge-notched cards''' or '''edge-punched cards''' are an obsolete technology used to store a small amount of binary or logical data on paper [[index cards]], encoded via the presence or absence of notches in the edges of the cards.{{sfn|Casey|1958}} The notches allowed efficient [[sorting]] and selecting of specific cards matching multiple desired criteria, from a larger number of cards in a paper-based [[database]] of information. In the mid-20th century they were also known by commercial names such as Cope-Chat cards, E-Z Sort cards, and McBee Keysort cards.{{sfn|Casey|1958|p=v}}

== Overview ==
[[File:Edge-notched_card.jpg|thumb|Edge-notched card used as a library card. Edges not notched here.]]
[[File:Randlochkarte2.jpg|thumb|A notched card showing two levels of notching.]]
[[File:McBee card notcher.jpg|thumb|Hand tool for notching cards.]]
Edge-notched cards are a manual data storage and manipulation technology used for specialized data storage and cataloging applications through much of the 20th century. An early instance of something like this methodology appeared in 1904.{{sfn|Casey|1958|p=4}} While there were many variants, by the mid-20th century a popular version consisted of {{convert|5|by|8|inch|adj=on|cm}} [[paperboard]] cards with holes punched at regular intervals along all four edges, a short distance in from the edges. The center of the card might be blank space for information to be written, or contain a pre-printed form, or contain a [[microform]] image in the case of edge-notched [[aperture card]]s.{{sfn|Ellsworth|1951}}{{sfn|Cady|1999|p=182}}

To record data, the paper stock between a hole and the nearest edge was removed by a special notching tool. The holes were assigned a meaning dependent upon a particular application. For example, one hole might record the answer to a yes/no question on a survey, with the presence of a notch meaning "yes". More-complex data was encoded using a variety of schemes, often using a [[superimposed code]] which allows more distinct categories to be coded than the number of holes available.

To allow a visual check that all cards in a deck were oriented the same way, one corner of each card was beveled, much like [[Herman Hollerith|Hollerith]] [[punched card]]s. Edge-notched cards, however, were not intended to be read by machines. Instead, they were manipulated by passing one or more slim needles through selected holes in a group of cards. As the needles were lifted, the cards that were notched in the hole positions where the needles were inserted would be left behind as rest of the deck was lifted by the needles. Using two or more needles produced a [[logical and]] function. Combining the cards from two different selections produced a [[logical or]]. Quite complex manipulations, including [[sorting]] were possible using these techniques.

Before the widespread use of computers, some [[public libraries]] used a system of small edge-notched cards in paper pockets in the back of library books to keep track of them.{{sfn|Kilgour|1939}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An old library book card |url=http://plakboek.livejournal.com/149106.html |website=plakboek.livejournal.com |accessdate=2011-03-29}} An example of an edge-notched library card.&lt;/ref&gt; Edge-notched cards were also used for course scheduling in some high schools and colleges during the same era.{{sfn|Anderson|Van Dyke|1963}}

==Needle cards==
'''Needle cards''' (another term for edge-notched cards) are [[index card]]s with text, written by hand or typewriter, that have a line of prepunched holes along one or more sides. By cutting or punching away (notching out) the paper between a hole and the edge of the card, the card is associated with a category. By putting long [[knitting needle]]s through certain holes in a deck of such cards, lifting and shaking gently, cards that belong to a combination of categories can be selected. This tool is less useful for data sets larger than 10,000 records.{{sfn|Kent|Geer|1961|p=273}}

Affectionately referred to as "The Knitting Needle Computer", these [[database]]-like systems were popular sometime in the 1960s and 1970s. Science teachers may still use these as a teaching tool for [[relational database]]s.  Indexed card systems can be made with [[index card]]s and a [[hole punch]].

In her book ''Parti-colored Blocks for a Quilt'', writer [[Marge Piercy]] described how she used needle cards instead of a notebook: {{Quote|I keep neither a journal nor a notebook. I have a memory annex which serves my purposes. It uses edge-notched cards. Edge-notched cards are cards which have holes around the borders as opposed to machine punch cards which are punched through the body. The cards are sorted with knitting needles. I have a nice sophisticated system which I call the "General Practitioner."{{sfn|Piercy|1982}}}}

'''Efficient Consumer Response''' ('''ECR''') is a joint trade and industry body working towards making the grocery sector as a whole more responsive to consumer demand and promote the removal of unnecessary costs from the supply chain.&lt;!--But WHERE? What status? Further down, there's a European version ...--&gt;

There are four focus areas under ECR: [[demand management]], [[supply management (procurement)|supply management]], enablers and integrators, which are intended to be addressed as an integrated set. These form the basis of the ECR Global Scorecard.

==ECR Community==
In September 2016, ECR Community replaced ECR Europe as the focal point for consumer goods retailers and manufacturers to work together for the benefit of consumers across Europe. Owned and managed by the ECR National Associations, which span Europe and the international ECR Shrink and On Shelf Availability group. These associations are supported by over 1,800 retailers, manufacturers and service providers.

==ECR Europe==
ECR Europe was launched in 1994. With its headquarters in Brussels, the organization works in co-operation with national ECR initiatives in most European countries. Participation in projects at European and national levels is open to companies in the grocery and [[Fast-Moving Consumer Goods]] sectors – including retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, suppliers, brokers and third-party service providers such as logistics operators. 

Every year ECR Europe organizes projects where companies from Europe explore new areas of working together. The results of these projects are published and there is an annual ECR Europe conference.

'''Enkeltpersonforetak''' (ENK) is a type of [[sole proprietorship]] in [[Norway]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The company is considered part of the personal assets of the owner, who holds the full juridical and economic [[Legal liability|liability]] of the company. The sole proprietorship entity holds a number of advantages, such as that there is no minimum [[Shareholders' equity|equity]], requirements for [[auditing]] or registration fee at the [[Brønnøysund Register Centre]]. Sole proprietorships do not have to have the two or three letter corresponding company type in the official company name. Instead they are required to have the [[surname]] of the proprietor somewhere in the company name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bedin.no/php/d_emneside_eng/cf/hApp_102/hPKey_1613/hParent_17/hDKey_2 | title=Self-employed Business | publisher=Ministry of Trade and Industry | date=3 March 2008 | accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs''' is a European mobility scheme initiated by the [[European Union]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erasmus-entrepreneurs.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; which gives new or aspiring entrepreneurs an opportunity to get a first-hand, practical coaching from experienced entrepreneurs running [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|small and medium-sized businesses]] (SMEs) in one of the 28 [[European Union member states|EU Members States]] or in other countries part of the [https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/cosme_en COSME] programme. 

The programme helps new and host entrepreneurs to develop relevant skills for managing and expanding their own business.

The duration of the stay abroad can be between one and six months.  The European Union provides some financial support to the new entrepreneurs for their stay abroad.

Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs is financed by the [[European Commission]] and operates with the help of intermediary organisations&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erasmus-entrepreneurs.eu/page.php?cid=5&lt;/ref&gt; competent in business support, coordinated by a Support Office&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erasmus-entrepreneurs.eu/page.php?pid=016&lt;/ref&gt; (currently run by [[EUROCHAMBRES]]).  

By February 2017, more than 4,500 exchanges &lt;ref&gt;http://www.erasmus-entrepreneurs.eu/press/EYE_Programme_statistics_(January_2017)_58a61ff0b9417.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; have been established and over 15,000 applications&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erasmus-entrepreneurs.eu/press/EYE_Programme_statistics_(January_2017)_58a61ff0b9417.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; have been received

== Aim of the programme ==

Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs aims at fostering the entrepreneurial spirit and cross-border trade in Europe by facilitating exchange of knowledge, experience and networking between entrepreneurs intending to start a business or having just started one, and experienced entrepreneurs by working alongside each other.
The programme also aims at guiding businesses on how to overcome market and business obstacles, so that they can make the most of the [[European Single Market]].
Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs in a nutshell:

* It offers new entrepreneurs the opportunity to learn from an experienced entrepreneur who is running a small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) in another participating country,
* It enables the exchange of experience between new and experienced entrepreneurs,
* It facilitates access to new markets and the search for potential business partners,
* It enhances networking between entrepreneurs and between SMEs,
* It allows experienced entrepreneurs to develop new commercial relations and find out more about opportunities in another EU country.

== History and development of Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs ==

In 2007, the European Parliament introduced a new budget line entitled "Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs”. The European Commission then started to design the Pilot Project with the aim of supporting mobility periods abroad for recently established and nascent entrepreneurs, with a view to improving their skills and fostering the cross-border transfer of knowledge and experience between entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/entrepreneurship/support_measures/erasmus/feasability.htm |title=Enterprise and Industry - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2008-06-13 |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508000301/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/entrepreneurship/support_measures/erasmus/feasability.htm |archivedate=2009-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs comes under the [[Small Business Act for Europe]] which considers this initiative a key contribution “to create an environment within which entrepreneurs and family businesses can thrive and entrepreneurship is rewarded”. It currently falls under Programme for the Competitiveness of enterprises and SME's (COSME) 2014-2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/cosme/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/cosme/supporting-entrepreneurs_en&lt;/ref&gt; 

Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs is to a certain extent similar to the well-known [[Erasmus Programme]] for students as is a mobility action which addresses a particular target group. However, it is also clearly different: whereas the existing Erasmus programme in higher education enhances student-to-university relationships, the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs focuses on [[business-to-business]] relationships.

The '''Founder's Pie Calculator''' is a tool for distributing [[Share (finance)|shares]] when starting a [[business venture]]. It was first described in an article by Frank Demmler, who is an Adjunct Teaching Professor of Entrepreneurship at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tepper.cmu.edu/our-faculty-and-research/about-our-faculty/faculty-profiles/fd0n/demmler-l|title=L. Frank Demmler|website=Tepper School of Business|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/fd0n/index.html|title=Frank Demmler's Home Page|last=|first=|date=|website=www.andrew.cmu.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to popular notion, the shares are not distributed equally (because "it's fair") but using a system of 5 important aspects of any business venture, assigning a relative weight to them and then rating the founders in each of these aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/fd0n/35%20Founders'%20Pie%20Calculator.htm|title=Cutting Up the Founder’s Pie|website=www.andrew.cmu.edu|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Globalization''' [[-ise vs -ize|or]] '''[[wiktionary:globalisation#English|globalisation]]''' is the process  of [[foreign relations|interaction]] and integration between people, companies, and governments [[world]]wide. Globalization has grown due to advances in [[transportation]] and [[communication]] technology. With increased global interactions comes the growth of international [[trade]], [[idea]]s, and [[culture]]. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, [[wiktionary:conflict|conflicts]] and [[diplomacy]] are also large parts of the [[history of globalization]], and modern globalization.

Economically, globalization involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology, and data.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;Albrow, Martin and Elizabeth King (eds.) (1990). ''Globalization, Knowledge and Society'' London: Sage. {{ISBN|9780803983236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlbrowKing1990"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Martin |last1=Albrow|first2=Elizabeth |last2=King|title=Globalization, knowledge, and society: readings from International sociology|url={{google books|id=lfe1AAAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}|year=1990|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-0-8039-8323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALso, with the expansions of global markets liberalize the economic
activities of exchange of goods and funds. Removal of Cross-Border Trades barriers has made formation of
Global Markets more feasible. [https://ijbssnet.com/journals/Vol_2_No_23_Special_Issue_December_2011/36.pdf. ''Globalization and its Impacts on the World Economic Development''.]  The [[steam locomotive]], [[steamship]], [[jet engine]], and [[container ship]]s are some of the advances in the means of [[transport]] while the rise of the [[telegraph]] and its modern offspring, the [[Internet]] and [[mobile phone]]s show development in [[telecommunication]]s infrastructure. All of these improvements have been major factors in globalization and have generated further [[interdependence]] of [[Economy|economic]] and cultural activities around the globe.&lt;ref name="Imagining"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elon.edu/e-web/predictions/150/1830.xhtml | title=Imagining the Internet | publisher=Elon University School of Communications | work=History of Information Technologies | accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stever_1972"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stever | first1 = H.

Though many scholars place the [[History of globalization|origins of globalization]] in [[modernity|modern times]], others trace its history long before the [[Europe]]an [[Age of Discovery]] and voyages to the [[New World]], some even to the third millennium BC.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GL-H-10"&gt;{{cite web |title=Globalization and Global History |page=127 |url=http://58.192.114.227/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20110522/20110522005012939.pdf |accessdate=3 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale globalization began in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H.|first=O'Rourke, Kevin|last2=G.|first2=Williamson, Jeffrey|date=1 April 2002|title=When did globalisation begin?|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/6/1/23/540507|journal=European Review of Economic History|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023|issn=1361-4916|pages=23–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the connectivity of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly. The term ''globalization'' is recent, only establishing its current meaning in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=Steger|first2=Manfred B.|author-link2=Manfred Steger|date=|year=2014|title=A Genealogy of globalization: The career of a concept|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rglo20/11/4|journal=Globalizations|volume=11|issue=4|pages=417–34|doi=10.1080/14747731.2014.951186|pmid=|access-date=|via=|last1=James|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul James (academic)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: [[trade]] and [[Financial transaction|transactions]], [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[investment]] movements, [[Human migration|migration]] and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"&gt;International Monetary Fund .

[http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/ib/2000/041200to.htm 12 April 2000: IMF Publications.]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, environmental challenges such as [[global warming]], cross-boundary [[water pollution|water,]] [[air pollution]], and [[overfishing|over-fishing]] of the ocean are linked with globalization.&lt;ref name="Bridges2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridges|first=G.|title=Grounding Globalization: The Prospects and Perils of Linking Economic Processes of Globalization to Environmental Outcomes|journal=Economic Geography|year=2002|volume=78|pages=361–86|doi=10.2307/4140814|issue=3|ref=harv|jstor=4140814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalizing processes affect and are affected by [[business]] and [[Employment|work]] organization, economics, socio-cultural resources, and the [[natural environment]].

The term ''globalization'' derives from the word ''globalize'', which refers to the emergence of an international network of economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=globalization|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest known usages of the term as a noun was in a 1930 publication entitled ''Towards New Education'', where it denoted a holistic view of human experience in education.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50297775?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Globalization&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|date=September 2009|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'globalization' had been used in its economic sense at least as early as 1981, and in other senses since at least as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/06levitt.html | title=Theodore Levitt, 81, Who Coined the Term 'Globalization', Is Dead | date=6 July 2006 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=Feder, Barnaby J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Levitt is credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later half of the 1980s. Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations. Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and [[empire]] across [[Asia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] from the 15th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G. (ed.). (2004). ''Globalization in World History.''

Due to the complexity of the concept, various research projects, articles, and discussions often stay focused on a single aspect of globalization.&lt;ref name="GCSP"&gt;Al-Rodhan, R.F. Nayef and Gérard Stoudmann. (2006). [http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf Definitions of the Globalization: A Comprehensive Overview and a Proposed Definition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119215401/http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] [[Martin Albrow]] and Elizabeth King define globalization as "all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society."&lt;ref name="Albrow" /&gt; In ''The Consequences of Modernity'', [[Anthony Giddens]] writes: "Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide [[social relation]]s which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony. (1991). ''The Consequences of Modernity'' Cambridge: Polity Press. p. 64. {{ISBN|9780745609232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Roland Robertson]], professor of sociology at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and an early writer in the field, described globalization as "the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization : social theory and global culture|last=Robertson|first=Roland|publisher=Sage|year=1992|isbn=0803981872|edition= Reprint.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Global Transformations'', [[David Held]] and his co-writers state:
{{quote|text=Although in its simplistic sense globalization refers to the widening, deepening and speeding up of global interconnection, such a definition begs further elaboration. ... Globalization can be on a continuum with the local, national and regional. At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions. Globalization can refer to those spatial-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents. Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term. ... A satisfactory definition of globalization must capture each of these elements: extensity (stretching), intensity, velocity and impact.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David; Goldblatt, David; McGrew, Anthony; Perraton, Jonathan (1999). ''Global Transformations'' Cambridge: Polity Press. {{ISBN|9780745614984}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=|}}

Held and his co-writers' definition of globalization in that same book as "transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions—assessed in terms of their extensity, intensity, velocity and impact—generating transcontinental or inter-regional flows" was called "probably the most widely-cited definition" in the 2014 [[Pankaj Ghemawat|DHL Global Connectiveness Index]].&lt;ref name="DHL"/&gt;

Swedish journalist Thomas Larsson, in his book ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'', states that globalization:
{{quote|is the process of world shrinkage, of distances getting shorter, things moving closer. It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact, to mutual benefit, with somebody on the other side of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Thomas. (2001). ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'' Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute. p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1930865150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines globalization with a more direct and historically contextualized emphasis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Globalization is the extension of social relations across world-space, defining that world-space in terms of the historically variable ways that it has been practiced and socially understood through changing world-time.&lt;ref name=James2005&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2005 | last=James |first=Paul | title=  ‘Arguing Globalizations: Propositions Towards an Investigation of Global Formation’ | url= https://www.academia.edu/5246805/Arguing_Globalizations_Propositions_Towards_an_Investigation_of_Global_Formation | journal= Globalizations | volume= 2 | issue=  2 | pages=193–209 | doi=10.1080/14747730500202206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Manfred Steger]], professor of [[global studies]] and research leader in the [[Global Cities Institute]] at [[RMIT University]], identifies four main empirical [[dimensions of globalization]]: economic, political, cultural, and [[Ecology|ecological]]. A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four. The ideological dimension, according to Steger, is filled with a range of [[Norm (social)|norms]], claims, beliefs, and narratives about the phenomenon itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last=Steger|first=Manfred|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955226-9|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Steger stated that the concept of globalization "emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of '[[Community of practice|communities of practice]]' ([[Étienne Wenger|Wenger]], 1998): academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians."&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;{{Rp|424}} They note the term was used "in education to describe the global life of the mind"; in [[international relations]] to describe the extension of the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]]; and in journalism to describe how the "American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt; They have also argued that four different forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions.&lt;ref name=James2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=‘Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies’|url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113/Levels_of_Subjective_Globalization_Ideologies_Imaginaries_Ontologies|journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|volume=12|issue=1–2|author1=Manfred B. Steger|author2=Paul James}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people. A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and [[Polity|polities]], including [[Imperialism|imperial]] agents. Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of [[Commodity|commodities]] and other objects of exchange. He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization. James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how, today, the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of [[refugee]]s and [[Immigration|migrants]] are increasingly restricted, while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most [[Deregulation|deregulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|title=‘Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens’|url=https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens|journal=Citizenship Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=208–23|doi=10.1080/13621025.2014.886440|pmid=|access-date=|via=|last1=James|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] popularized the term [[The World Is Flat|"flat world"]], arguing that [[Global trade|globalized trade]], [[outsourcing]], [[supply chain|supply-chaining]], and political forces had permanently changed the world, for better and worse. He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. "The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention". ''Emerging: A Reader.'' Ed. Barclay Barrios. Boston: Bedford, St. Martins, 2008. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] defined "economic globalization" as the opening and deregulation of [[Commodity market|commodity]], [[Capital market|capital]], and [[Labour economics|labor markets]] that led toward present [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization. He used "political globalization" to refer to the emergence of a transnational [[élite]] and a phasing out of the [[nation-state]]. Meanwhile, he used "cultural globalization" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture. Other of his usages included "[[Ideology|ideological]] globalization", "[[Technology|technological]] globalization", and "social globalization".&lt;ref&gt;Fotopoulos, Takis. (2001). "Globalization, the reformist Left and the Anti-Globalization 'Movement.'"

Lechner and Boli (2012) define globalization as more people across large distances becoming connected in more and different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner,  Frank J. and John Boli (eds.) (2011). ''The Globalization Reader.'' New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Globophobia" is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the [[balloon phobia|fear of balloons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henwood|first1=Doug|title=Beyond Globophobia|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/beyond-globophobia|work=[[The Nation]]|date=1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Ross|title=Globophobia|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/12049/globophobia-17/|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=20 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor=George Ritzer|editorlink=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XKnmvRATtfAC|page=16}}|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of globalization}}
{{See also|Timeline of international trade}}

There are both [[Proximate and ultimate causation|distal and proximate causes]] which can be traced in the historical factors affecting globalization. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Rourke |first=Kevin H. |first2=Jeffrey G. |last2=Williamson |year=2002 |title=When Did Globalization Begin? |journal=European Review of Economic History |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=23–50 |doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaic===
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The 13th century world-system, as described by [[Janet Abu-Lughod]]]]
{{Main|Archaic globalization}}

Archaic globalization conventionally refers to a phase in the history of globalization including globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly the 1600s. This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and [[State (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.&lt;ref name="M 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how [[Western world|Western states]] have adapted and implemented learned principles from the [[Eastern world|East]].&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and certain parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own [[Production (economics)|production]] and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt;

Also posited is a "multi-polar" nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, where [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of [[industrial production]] and [[Output (economics)|economic output]], archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal [[China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans Köchler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], 17th-century Japanese [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]]]]

The German [[Economic history|historical economist]] and sociologist [[Andre Gunder Frank]] argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the third millennium [[Common Era|B.C.E.]]  This archaic globalization existed during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]], when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture that reached from [[India]] to [[Spain]], including [[Alexandria]] and the other [[Alexander the Great|Alexandrine]] cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of [[import]]ing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade. Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09"&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. (1998). ''ReOrient: Global economy in the Asian age.''

Trade on the [[Silk Road]] was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China, [[South Asian history|Indian subcontinent]], [[Persia]], Europe, and [[Arabia]], opening long-distance political and economic interactions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and [[religion]]s, [[syncretic]] philosophies, and various technologies, as well as [[disease]]s, also traveled along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people, such as refugees, artists, craftsmen, [[Missionary|missionaries]], robbers, and envoys, resulted in the exchange of religions, art, [[language]]s, and new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/legacy-silk-road | title = The Legacy of the Silk Road | publisher = Yale Global | date = 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
{{Main|Proto-globalization}}

"[[Early modern period|Early modern]]-" or "proto-globalization" covers a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800. The concept of "proto-globalization" was first introduced by [[historian]]s [[A. G. Hopkins]] and [[Christopher Bayly]]. The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high "modern globalization" in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G., ed., 2003. Globalization in World History. New York City, NY: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-97942-3}} pp. 4–5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s, and later the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire]]s. In the 17th century, world trade developed further when [[Chartered company|chartered companies]] like the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602, often described as the first [[multinational corporation]] in which [[stock]] was offered) were established.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, K.N. (1965\1999). ''The English East India Company: The Study of an Early Joint-stock Company 1600–1640 (Vol. 4).'' London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of [[expansionism]], the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the rise of newfound commodities—most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s concept of the [[Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process. European, [[Muslim]], Indian, [[Southeast Asia]]n, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.

===Modern===
According to economic historians Kevin H. O'Rourke, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, and Guillaume Daudin, several factors promoted globalization in the period 1815-1870:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-economic-history-of-modern-europe/trade-and-empire/BE789F27408634F4749D61F013897C04|title=Trade and empire (Chapter 4) - The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|pages=100–101|language=en|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars brought in an era of relative peace in Europe.
* Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.
* New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States, and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires.
* A gradual move towards greater liberalization in European countries.
During the 19th century, globalization approached its form as a direct result of the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] allowed [[standardization|standardized]] production of household items using [[economies of scale]] while rapid [[population growth]] created sustained [[demand]] for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transport significantly and [[railroads]] made inland transportation cheaper. The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; More nations embraced [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] such as in [[Scramble for Africa|Africa]] and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]]. The invention of [[shipping container]]s in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/how-the-invention-of-a-box-changed-our-world/2006/06/11/1149964409162.html%0A|title=How the invention of a box changed our world – Business – smh.com.au|last=Gittins|first=Ross|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], work by politicians led to the agreements of the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], in which major governments laid down the framework for [[International monetary systems|international monetary policy]], commerce, and finance, and the founding of several [[international institution]]s intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering [[trade barrier]]s. Initially, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process. Exports nearly doubled from 8.5% of total gross world product in 1970 to 16.2% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | title = World Exports as Percentage of Gross World Product | publisher=[[Global Policy Forum]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712023541/http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | archivedate = 12 July 2008 | accessdate =11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the [[Doha Development Round]] of trade negotiation. Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 [[South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement]].

Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to [[middle class]]es in [[developed countries]]. [[Open skies]] policies and [[low-cost carrier]]s have helped to bring [[Competition (economics)|competition]] to the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between different countries. More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location. This included accounting, software development, and engineering design.

[[Student exchange program]]s became popular after [[World War II]], and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.&lt;ref name=varghese/&gt;

''Globalization: The Essentials.''  NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[revolutions of 1989]] and subsequent [[liberalization]] in many parts of the world resulted in a significant expansion of global interconnectedness. The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process. In the period between 1965 and 1990, the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled. Most migration occurred between the [[Developing country|developing countries]] and [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs).&lt;ref name =Saggi2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saggi | first1 = Kamal | year = 2002 | title = Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and International Technology Transfer: A Survey | url = | journal = World Bank Research Observer | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 191–235 | doi = 10.1093/wbro/17.2.191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy.

Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-[[border]] movement of goods, services, technology, and capital.&lt;ref name="Joshi, Rakesh Mohan 2009"&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2009) International Business, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-568909-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as [[tariff]]s, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing [[economic integration]] between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, T: "Year 12 Economics", p. 9. Tim Riley Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality. Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace. Economic globalization also includes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864808614|title=International business: competing in the global marketplace|last=Hill|first=Charles W.

Current globalization trends can be largely accounted for by developed economies integrating with less developed economies by means of [[foreign direct investment]], the reduction of trade barriers as well as other economic reforms, and, in many cases, [[immigration]]. more apparently, before the phase of Globalization, United States of America was a dominant country which held the essential economic power in world export. But after the advent of
globalization, Germany, Japan, South Korea and China have significantly become serious counterparts by challenging the position of America. [https://ijbssnet.com/journals/Vol_2_No_23_Special_Issue_December_2011/36.pdf. ''Globalization and its Impacts on the World Economic Development

A [[free-trade area]] is the region encompassing a [[trade bloc]] whose member countries have signed a [[Free trade|free-trade]] agreement (FTA).

If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an [[open border]].
Arguably the most significant free-trade area in the world is the [[European Union]], a [[Political union|politico]]-[[economic union]] of [[Member state of the European Union|{{EUnum}} member states]] that are primarily located in [[Europe]]. The EU has developed [[European Single Market]] through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states.

[[Trade facilitation]] looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximise efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives.

Global trade in services is also significant.

[[William I. Robinson]]'s theoretical approach to globalization is a critique of Wallerstein's World Systems Theory.  He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s.  Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|journal=International Sociology|volume=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One important aspect of Robinson's globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global.  This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six different countries, each contributing to a part of the production process.

{{Main|Cultural globalization}}

Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Paul|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, [[popular culture]] media, and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B. Steger, eds, [https://uws.academia.edu/PaulJames Globalization and Culture: Vol. 4, Ideologies of Globalism], Sage Publications, London, 2010.  {{Cite book|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|last1=Inda|first1=Jonathan|last2=Rosaldo|first2=Renato|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|chapter=Introduction: A World in Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-cultural communication]] is a field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavour to communicate across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.

[[Cultural diffusion]] is the spread of [[culture|cultural]] items—such as [[idea]]s, [[fashion|styles]], [[religion]]s, [[technology|technologies]], [[contact linguistics|languages]] etc.
Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities. For example, [[sushi]] is available in Germany as well as Japan, but [[Disneyland Paris|Euro-Disney]] outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for "authentic" French pastry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v25n3/globalization.pdf |title=Globalization and Culture |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |last2=Barber |first2=Benjamin |journal=Cato Policy Report |date=May–June 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India].

Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture, particularly via the Internet and satellite television.

Religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, [[evangelism|evangelists]], imperialists, and traders. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and more recently sects such as [[Mormonism]] are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins.&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Elizabeth. 2005.

The term globalization implies transformation. Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments. Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Thomas. 2004.

Music has an important role in economic and cultural development during globalization. Music genres such as [[jazz]] and [[reggae]] began locally and later became international phenomena. Globalization gave support to the [[world music]] phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. (2002.)

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, David and Keneth Gloag. 2005. Musicology: The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the [[European Union]]'s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.

Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to [[Westernization]] or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/04/11/why-do-we-need-religion-in-a-globalized-world/|title=Why do we need religion in a globalized world?|date=11 April 2018|work=Aleteia — Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture|access-date=12 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, globalization may ultimately reduce the importance of [[nation state]]s. [[Supranational]] institutions such as the [[European Union]], the [[WTO]], the [[G8]] or the [[International Criminal Court]] replace or extend national functions to facilitate international agreement.&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could ultimately lead to a [[global union]], based on the [[European Union]] model.&lt;ref name="mcclintock1"&gt;John McClintock (2010). "The Uniting of Nations: An Essay on Global Governance (3rd ed. revised and updated)". Publisher: P.I.E. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intergovernmentalism]] is a term in [[political science]] with two meanings. The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by [[Stanley Hoffmann]]; the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Multi-level governance]] is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy.  It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.

Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states. [[Multiple citizenship]], also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or  dual nationality, is a person's [[citizenship]] status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one [[Sovereign state|state]] under the laws of those states.

Increasingly, [[non-governmental organization]]s influence public policy across national boundaries, including [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian aid]] and [[International development|developmental efforts]].&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Accion International]], the Acumen Fund (now [[Acumen Fund|Acumen]]) and the [[Echoing Green]] have combined the [[business model]] with [[philanthropy]], giving rise to business organizations such as the [[Global Philanthropy Group]] and new associations of philanthropists such as the [[Global Philanthropy Forum]].  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Vaccine-Delivery|title=Vaccine Delivery|work=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hudson Institute]] estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at [[US$]]59 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/2012IndexofGlobalPhilanthropyandRemittances.pdf ''The Index of Global Philanthropy and Remittances 2012''.

As a response to globalization, some countries have embraced [[isolationism|isolationist]] policies. For example, the [[North Korea]]n government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.&lt;ref name=nkr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/2008-exodus.htm |title=North Korean Refugees NGO |publisher=Northkoreanrefugees.com |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhcr&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,PRK,4562d8cf2,487ca236c0,0.html |title=UNHCR Freedom in the World 2008 – North Korea |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dimensions==
Scholars also occasionally discuss other, less common dimensions of globalization, such as [[environmental globalization]] (the internationally coordinated practices and regulations, often in the form of international treaties, regarding environmental protection)&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"&gt;{{cite book|first=Karl S. |last=Zimmerer|title=Globalization &amp; New Geographies of Conservation|url={{google books|id=UdLK-UGj7YkC|page=1|plainurl=yes}}|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-98344-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[military globalization]] (growth in global extent and scope of security relationships).&lt;ref name="Krishnan2016"&gt;{{cite book|first=Armin |last=Krishnan|title=War as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting|url={{google books|id=1ymrCwAAQBAJ|page=PA157|plainurl=yes}}|date=3 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00049-5|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: [[economic globalization]], [[cultural globalization]] and [[political globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"/&gt;

===Movement of people===
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Scheduled [[airline]] traffic in 2009]]
An essential aspect of globalization is movement of people, and state-boundary limits on that movement have changed across history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James| first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens | url= https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens | journal= Citizenship Studies | volume=  18 | issue=  2 | pages= 208–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. For example, travel across the [[Atlantic ocean]] used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Boustan, Adain May . "Fertility and Immigration." UCLA. 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable.

[[Tourism]] is travel for pleasure. The developments in technology and transport infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.&lt;ref name="Barom2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]] |journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |date=January 2013 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228162347/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Travel visa|visa]] is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country. Some countries – such as those in the [[Schengen Area]] – have agreements with other countries allowing each other's citizens to travel between them without visas. The [[World Tourism Organization]] announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/travel/visa-requirements-for-tourism-eased-around-the-world-says-un-agency-365446391.html Visa requirements for tourism eased around the world, says UN agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |title=Visa Openness Report 2015 January 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123123959/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immigration]] is the international movement of people into a destination [[country]] of which they are not natives or where they do not possess [[citizenship]] in order to settle or reside there, especially as [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] or [[Naturalization|naturalized]] citizens, or to take-up [[employment]] as a [[migrant worker]] or temporarily as a [[foreign worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/immigration|title=immigration|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigration| title=immigrate|publisher=Merriam-Webster, In.|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCUK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's who: Definitions|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy_research/the_truth_about_asylum/the_facts_about_asylum|first=|last=|publisher=Refugee Council|location=London, England|year=2016|access-date= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[International Labour Organization]], {{as of|2014|lc=y}} there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside their country of origin for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development. For example, [[freedom of movement for workers in the European Union]] means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.
[[File:BorisOC2010.jpg|thumb|right|2010 [[London Youth Games]] opening ceremony.

''[[Financial Times]]''. 1 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in [[international education]].  More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many [[international student]]s now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.&lt;ref name="gribble"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gribble | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Policy options for managing international student migration: the sending country's perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 25–39 | doi=10.1080/13600800701457830}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contributions that [[foreign student]]s make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to [[immigration]] and visa policies and procedures.&lt;ref name="varghese"&gt;Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[transnational marriage]] is a [[marriage]] between two people from different countries. A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to [[citizenship]] and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships.
In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.

===Movement of information===
{{See also|Internet}}
{{Internet users by region}}
Before electronic communications, long-distance communications relied on [[mail]]. Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century. The [[electric telegraph]] was the first method of instant long-distance communication. For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean. The first [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866. The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.

The [[Internet]] has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries. For example, [[Facebook]] is a [[social networking service]] which has more than [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|1.65 billion monthly active users]] {{as of|2016|3|31|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Facebook-Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Info – Facebook Newsroom|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization can be spread by Global journalism which provides massive information and relies on the internet to interact,  "makes it into an everyday routine to investigate how people and their actions, practices, problems, life conditions etc. in different parts of the world are interrelated. possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Berglez |date=2008 |title=WHAT IS GLOBAL JOURNALISM? |journal=Journalism Studies |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=845–858 &lt;!--was originally "5" but that's confusing--&gt; |doi=10.1080/14616700802337727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{See also|List of globalization-related indices}}

One index of globalization is the ''KOF Index of Globalization'', which measures three important dimensions of globalization:  economic, social, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch/ | title=KOF Index of Globalization | publisher=The KOF Swiss Economic Institute | work=ethz.ch | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[A.T.

Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as [[trade]], [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI), [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[portfolio investment]], and [[income]].  However, newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms, including variables related to political, social, cultural, and even environmental aspects of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vujakovic | first1 = Petra | year = 2010 | title = How to Measure Globalization?

==Support and criticism==
{{See also|Criticisms of globalization}}
Reactions to processes contributing to globalization have varied widely with a history as long as extraterritorial contact and trade. [[philosophy|Philosophical]] differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[social movements]].  Proponents of [[economic growth]], [[economic expansion|expansion]] and [[economic development|development]], in general, view globalizing processes as desirable or necessary to the well-being of human [[society]].&lt;ref name=Sen1970&gt;Sen, Amartya K. (1970).  ''Collective choice and social welfare.'' San Francisco, CA: Holden-Day.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonists view one or more globalizing processes as detrimental to social well-being on a global or local scale;&lt;ref name=Sen1970 /&gt; this includes those who social or [[natural environment|natural]] [[sustainability]] of long-term and continuous economic expansion, the social [[structural inequality]] caused by these processes, and the [[Colonialism|colonial]], [[Imperialism|imperialistic]], or [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[ethnocentrism]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[cultural appropriation]] that underlie such processes.

Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures. [[Xenophobia]] is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia|title=Definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia|title=Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]], including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs. They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the [[Gini coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20238991~menuPK:492138~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html|title=Poverty Analysis – Measuring Inequality|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Happy Planet Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happyplanetindex.org/ |title=The Happy Planet Index |publisher=Neweconomics.org |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to a "multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation"&lt;ref name="The Hidden Connections"&gt;{{cite book | last = Capra | first = Fritjof | year = 2002 | title = The Hidden Connections | publisher=Random House | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-385-49471-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they claim are the [[unintended consequences]] of globalization. Others point out that, while the forces of globalization have led to the spread of western-style democracy, this has been accompanied by an increase in inter-ethnic tension and violence as free market economic policies combine with democratic processes of universal suffrage as well as an escalation in militarization to impose democratic principles and as a means to conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorrells, Kathryn. Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion on globalization===

A 2005 study by Peer Fiss and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior. In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"&gt;Fiss, Peer and Hirsch, Pal: "The Discourse of Globalization: Framing and Sensemaking of an Emerging Concept. American Sociological Review, February 2005. vol. 70 no 1: 29–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999. This increase occurred during a period when the total number of articles concerning globalization nearly doubled.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;

A number of international polls have shown that residents of Africa and Asia tend to view globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America. In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably.&lt;ref&gt;"Africans and Asians Tend to View Globalization Favorably. Europeans and Americans are More Skeptical". World Public Opinion.org. 7 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC found that 50% of people believed that economic globalization was proceeding too rapidly, while 35% believed it was proceeding too slowly.&lt;ref name=bbc08&gt;{{cite web| title = Widespread Unease about Economy and Globalization – Global poll| author = BBC World Service| date = 2008| accessdate = 24 March 2015| url = http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173226/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| archivedate = 3 September 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Philip Gordon stated that "a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects." The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Philip. 2004. [http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace "Globalization: Europe's Wary Embrace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191739/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace|date=29 June 2011}}. Yale Global, 1 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In a Danish poll in 2007, 76% responded that globalization is a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1684528,00.html Why Denmark Loves Globalisation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiss, ''et al.'', surveyed US opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis of 2007]]. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.&lt;ref name="ip08"&gt;Greg Ip: "The Declining Value Of Your College Degree", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, {{as of|1998|lc=y}} there was a perception in Japan that the economy was "Small and Frail". However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as ''[[internationalization]]'' and ''globalization'' to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi. 1998. "Japan," ''Domestic Adjustments to Globalization''; (ed, Charles E. Morrison and Hadi Soesastro), Tokyo: Japan center for International Exchange, 1998, pp. 76–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"/&gt; Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism. Opponents consider governments as agents of [[neo-colonialism]] that are subservient to [[multinational corporations]].&lt;ref name="visuality.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shoa |first=S.

The literature analysing the economics of free trade is extremely rich with extensive work having been done on the theoretical and empirical effects.

In the book ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government [[Political corruption|corruption]]; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as [[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; [[protectionism]]; and geographic barriers.&lt;ref name="The End of Poverty"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sachs | first = Jeffrey | year = 2005 | title = The End of Poverty | publisher=The Penguin Press | location = New York, New York | isbn = 1-59420-045-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bhagwati | first = Jagdish | title = In Defense of Globalization | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | location = Oxford, New York | url =| isbn =978-0195330939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist.

The flow of migrants to advanced economic countries has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge. An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"/&gt; Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization. Technological innovations (or technological transfer) is conjectured to benefit most the developing and least developing countries (LDCs), as for example in the adoption of [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref name="Saggi2002" /&gt;

There has been a rapid economic growth in Asia after embracing [[market orientation]]-based economic policies that encourage private [[property rights]], free enterprise and competition. In particular, in East Asian developing countries, [[GDP]] per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url= http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2003|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist [[Martin Wolf]] says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]] in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.&lt;ref name="Wolf2004"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|author= Martin Wolf|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0300102529|accessdate= 6 April 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510120230/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|archivedate= 10 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]]. Thus, despite seemingly unequal [[distribution of income]] within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth among post-1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.&lt;ref name="DDollar"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dollar, David|author2=Kraay, Aart|title=Trade, Growth, and Poverty|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|work=Finance and Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic [[interdependence]] promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web |title=Globalisation promotes peace
|first1=Ju Hyun |last1=Pyun |first2=Jong-Wha |last2=Lee |date=21 March 2009 |url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/globalisation-promotes-peace}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea had been very powerful during the globalization of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and was a central doctrine of [[classical liberals]] of that era, such as the young [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Roy Harrod]], ''[[The Life of John Maynard Keynes]]'', Macmillan, 1951; [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006. Keynes had colourfully described the globalization before World War I in ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'', Macmillan, 1919, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some opponents of globalization see the phenomenon as a promotion of corporate interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Laurence|last=Lee|title=WTO blamed for India grain suicides|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2ED53A8B-1058-49CF-B9FF-3D96639456D1.htm|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=17 May 2007|accessdate=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that the increasing autonomy and strength of [[corporate entity|corporate entities]] shapes the political policy of countries.&lt;ref name="The Corporation"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bakan | first = Joel | authorlink =Joel Bakan | year = 2004 | title = The Corporation | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-7432-4744-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"&gt;{{cite book | last = Perkins | first = John | authorlink = John Perkins (author)| year = 2004 | title = Confessions of an Economic Hit Man | publisher=Berrett-Koehler | location = San Francisco, California | isbn = 1-57675-301-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They advocate global institutions and policies that they believe better address the moral claims of poor and working classes as well as environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/index.php?cd_language=2&amp;id_menu= |title=Fórum Social Mundial |publisher=Forumsocialmundial.org.br |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic arguments by [[fair trade]] theorists claim that unrestricted free trade benefits those with more [[Leverage (finance)|financial leverage]] (i.e. the rich) at the expense of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epi.org/publication/webfeatures_viewpoints_nafta_legacy_at10/|title=NAFTA at 10|work=Economic Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization allows corporations to [[outsource]] manufacturing and service jobs from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits.&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"/&gt; Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually [[agricultural production]]s. Larger countries often subsidize their [[Agricultural subsidy|farmers]] (e.g., the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.&lt;ref name="Hurst E.

===Global democracy===
{{Main|Democratic globalization}}

'''Democratic globalization''' is a movement towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]] that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO), political cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker [[David Held]]. Advocates of [[democratic globalization]] argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building [[International political economy|global political institutions]]. Dr. [[Francesco Stipo]], Director of the United States Association of the [[Club of Rome]], advocates unifying nations under a [[world government]], suggesting that it "should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations. A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacor.org/archive/index.html |title=USACOR.org |publisher=USACOR.org |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a [[direct election|directly elected]] [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche|first=Douglas|title=The Case for a United Nations  Parliamentary Assembly|url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|publisher=The World Federalist Movement–Institute for Global Policy|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531054746/http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global civics===
{{Main|Global civics|Multiculturalism}}
{{See also|Global citizenship}}

Global civics suggests that [[civics]] can be understood, in a global sense, as a [[social contract]] between [[Global citizenship|global citizens]] in the age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World citizen]] has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional [[geopolitical]] divisions derived from national [[citizenship]]. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in [[Socrates]], whom [[Plutarch]] quoted as saying: "I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcitizens.org.au|title=World Citizens Association Australia|work=World Citizens Association Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and [[nuclear proliferation]].&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary?

Baha'i-inspired author Meyjes, while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness, warns of globalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Language and Universalization: a ‘Linguistic Ecology’ Reading of Bahá’í Writ | first = Gregory Paul | last = Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes) | title = The Journal of Bahá’í Studies | publisher = Association for Bahá’í Studies | series = | volume =Volume IX (1) | year =1999 | location = Ottawa | pages = 51–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cloak for an expeditious economic, social, and cultural Anglo-dominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization. He proposes a process of "[[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalization]]" as an alternative.

[[Cosmopolitanism]] is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single [[community]] based on a shared [[morality]]. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmopolitan|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmopolitan?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect. For instance, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, "Cosmopolitan Patriots," Critical Inquiry 23, no. 3 (Spring, 1997): 617–639.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian philosopher [[Marshall McLuhan]] popularized the term ''[[Global village (term)|Global Village]]'' beginning in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan and Bruce R. Powers (17 September 1992) The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st century . Oxford University Press: 17 September 1992&lt;/ref&gt; His view suggested that globalization would lead to a world where people from all countries will become more integrated and aware of common interests and shared humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Roger.

===International cooperation===
'''Military cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– Past examples of international cooperation exist. One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see [[START I]], [[START II]], [[START III]], and [[New START]]) and the establishment of [[NATO]]'s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the [[G8]] Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/brookings-audit/international-cooperation-stepping-stone-world-government |title=International cooperation as a stepping-stone to a world government &amp;#124; Global Policy Journal – Practitioner, Academic, Global Governance, International Law, Economics, Security, Institutions, Comment &amp; Opinion, Media, Events, Journal |publisher=Global Policy Journal |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the [[Montreal Protocol]], in order to stop ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"/&gt;

In ''The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy'', [[Christopher Lasch]] analyzes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html |title=The treachery of the lites Elite sense of irresponsibility |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-03-10 |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.
Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The de-nationalisation of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as "world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of  national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have "withdrawn from common life".
Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. 
However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

D.A. Snow et al. contend that the [[anti-globalization movement]] is an example of a [[new social movement]], which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D. A., Soule, S. A., &amp; Kriesi, H. (2004). The Blackwell companion to social movements. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the [[Battle of Seattle (1999)|Battle of Seattle]] in 1999, where there were protests against the World Trade Organization's Third Ministerial Meeting. All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8).&lt;ref name="stwr.org"/&gt; Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.

===Opposition to capital market integration===
{{Main|Anti-capitalist movements}}
[[File:Worldbank protest jakarta.jpg|thumb|World Bank Protester, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]

Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises.  Increasing integration of these [[financial market]]s between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invested Interests: The Politics of National Economic Policies in a World of  Global Finance|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry A.|journal=[[International Organization]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|issn=1531-5088|volume=45|issue=4|year=1991|pages=425–51|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033178|jstor=2706944|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of [[human rights]] issues  are especially disturbed by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South").{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Anti-corporatism and anti-consumerism===
{{Main|Anti-corporatism|Anti-consumerism}}

[[Corporatism|Corporatist]] ideology, which privileges the rights of corporations ([[Legal personality|artificial or juridical persons]]) over those of [[natural person]]s, is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2001/09/01/corporatism-goes-global | title=Corporatism Goes Global | author=Ottaway, Marina | journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations | volume=7 | issue=3 | date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books ([[Naomi Klein]]'s 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'', for example) and films (''e.g. [[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' &amp; ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus]]'') popularizing an [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] [[ideology]] to the public.

A related contemporary ideology, [[consumerism]], which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lived effects of the Contemporary Economy: Globalization, Inequality, and Consumer Society. | author=Storper Michael | journal=Public Culture | year=2000 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=375–409 | doi=10.1215/08992363-12-2-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of [[consumer education]] into school [[curriculum|curricula]]. Social activists hold materialism is connected to [[Big-box store|global retail merchandizing]] and [[supplier convergence]], [[war]], greed, [[anomie]], [[crime]], environmental degradation, and general social [[malaise]] and discontent. One variation on this topic is activism by ''postconsumers'', with the strategic emphasis on moving ''beyond'' addictive consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Collective dissonance and the transition to post-consumerism | author=Cohen,  Maurie J. | journal=Futures |date=July 2013  | volume=52 | pages=42–51 | doi=10.1016/j.futures.2013.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global justice and inequality===

[[File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Differences in national income equality around the world as measured by the national [[Gini coefficient]], 2014]]

The global justice movement is the loose collection of individuals and groups—often referred to as a "[[movement of movements]]"—who advocate [[fair trade]] rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, "A Movement of Movements", New York: Verso, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement is often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are [[anti-globalization]], insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power.&lt;ref&gt;della Porta, D. 2005. "The Social Bases of the Global Justice Movement: Some Theoretical Reflections and Empirical Evidence from the First European Social Forum." Civil Society and Social Movements Programme Paper No. 21.Geneva: UNRISD (United Nations Research Institute for Social Development).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is based in the idea of [[social justice]], desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and [[solidarity]], the values of human rights, and the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Education and Social Justice By J.

Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) include: [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], [[Red Cross]], [[Free The Children]] and [[CARE International]]. They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.

====Social inequality====
{{Main|Social inequality|International inequality}}

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally.  Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name="WEF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak [[trade union|labor unions]]: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever-growing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in high-cost areas. Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline.&lt;ref name="Hurst E. Charles P.41"/&gt; They also cite an increase in the exploitation of [[child labour|child labor]]: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them. Examples include [[quarry]]ing, salvage, and farm work as well as trafficking, bondage, forced labor, prostitution and pornography.&lt;ref name="Edmonds_Pavcni"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pavcnik | first = Nina |date=September 2005 | title = Child Labor in the Global Economy | journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–220 | doi = 10.1257/0895330053147895 | last2 = Pavcnik | first2 = Nina | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often participate in the workforce in [[precarious work]], including [[export-oriented employment]].  Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women's access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]] remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state's role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seguino|first1=Stephanie|last2=Grown|first2=Caren|date=November 2006|title=Gender equity and globalization: macroeconomic policy for developing countries|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1081–104|doi=10.1002/jid.1295|ref=harv|author-link1=Stephanie Seguino|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.4614}} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf Pdf version – via the World Bank.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the intersectionality of gender, race, class, and more remain overlooked when assessing the impact of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|last=Lourdes|first=Benería|others=Berik, Günseli,, Floro, Maria|isbn=9780415537483|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=903247621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study published by the IMF posited that [[neoliberalism]], the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has been "oversold", with the benefits of neoliberal policies being "fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries" and the costs, most significantly higher income inequality within nations, "hurt the level and sustainability of growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foroohar |first=Rana |date=June 3, 2016 |title=Globalization's True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts|url=http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/|work=TIME|location= |access-date=July 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-global governance===
{{Main|Global governance}}

Beginning in the 1930s, opposition arose to the idea of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the [[World Federalist Movement]] (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul. (2006.) ''The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations.'' New York: Harper Collins. {{ISBN|978-0375501654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the [[League of Nations]] and, later, the [[United Nations]].

===Environmentalist opposition===
[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation]] of the [[Madagascar]] Highland Plateau has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western [[river]]s.]]
{{Main|Environmentalism}}
{{See also|Global warming|Climate change|Deforestation}}

[[Environmentalism]] is a broad philosophy, ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ideology.html |title=Ideology and Sustainability |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald Bailey from the February 2002 issue |url=http://reason.com/archives/2002/02/01/debunking-green-myths |title=Debunking Green Myths |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Gibson. Environmentalism: Ideology and Power. Nova Science Pub Inc. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and social movement regarding concerns for environmental [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as [[global warming]], [[climate change]], global [[water supply]] and [[Water crisis|water crises]], inequity in [[energy consumption]] and [[energy conservation]], transnational [[air pollution]] and pollution of the [[world ocean]], [[overpopulation]], world [[habitat]] [[sustainability]], [[deforestation]], [[biodiversity]] and [[species extinction]].

One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Nicholas. (2002). ''Global Ethics and Environment''. Routledge Science. {{ISBN|978-0415197359}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of" environmental [[apartheid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J., and John Boli. 2012. ''The Globalization Reader'', 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0470655634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], the director and founder of Local Futures/[[International Society for Ecology and Culture]], criticizes globalization in many ways. In her book ''[[Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh|Ancient Futures]]'', Norberg-Hodge claims that "centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization." She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norberg-Hodge|first=Helena|title=Ancient futures : learning from Ladakh|year=1992|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0871566435|edition= Sierra Club Books paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related area of concern is the [[pollution haven hypothesis]], which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see [[Race to the bottom]]).&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

== Food security ==
{{Main|Food security}}
The globalization of food production is associated with a more efficient system of food production. This is because crops are grown in countries with optimum growing conditions. This improvement causes an increase in the world's food supply which encourages improved food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5160e.pdf|title=Food Security and International Trade Unpacking disputed narratives|last=Clapp|first=J|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway's limited crop range advocates globalization of food production and availability. The northern-most country in Europe requires trade with other countries to ensure population food demands are met. The degree of self-sufficiency in food production is around 50% in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Flaten and Hisano, 2007. Food Security Policy in a Food Importing Country: The Case of Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hacı Sabancı''' (25 June 1935 &amp;ndash; 26 June 1998), a member of the second generation of the renowned [[Sabancı family]], was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] businessman and [[philanthropist]].

He was born in the [[Talas, Turkey|Akçakaya village]] of [[Kayseri Province]] as the third son of [[Hacı Ömer Sabancı]], who founded Turkey's second largest industrial and financial conglomerate, [[Sabancı Holding]]. 

Hacı went to school and spent most of his life in [[Adana]]. After dropping out of the secondary school, he started his career in the family-owned automobile dealing and cotton exporting companies. He later served at several top management posts in different companies of Sabancı Holding. He was also president of the board of trustees of Sabancı Foundation VakSA.

==Family==
He married Özcan in 1959. They had two sons, [[Ömer Sabancı|Ömer]] in 1959 and [[Mehmet Sabancı|Mehmet]] in 1963, and a daughter, Demet. [[Mehmet Sabancı|Mehmet]] died of a heart attack in 2005.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Death==
Hacı Sabancı died on 26 June 1998, the day after his 63rd birthday, in [[İstanbul]] after a two-year struggle against [[lung cancer]]. He was laid to rest in Adana next to his murdered brother [[Özdemir Sabancı|Özdemir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=-25914|newspaper=[[Hürriyet]]|title=Adanalı ‘Hacı Ağa’yı uğurladı|language=Turkish|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Hugo Moyano''' (born January 9, 1944) is an Argentine labour leader and Secretary General of the [[CGT (Argentina)|CGT]], the nation's largest trade union, from 2004 to 2012. A schism developed within the CGT during 2012, and Moyano was thus elected to head the CGT's dissident faction.&lt;ref name=cronista&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cronista.com/we/CGT-dividida-un-escenario-con-mas-perdedores-que-ganadores-20120713-0013.html|title=CGT dividida: un escenario con más perdedores que ganadores|work=Cronista Comercial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also is the president of [[Club Atlético Independiente|Club Atletico Independiente]], one of the biggest football clubs in the country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1707689-hugo-moyano-presidente-independiente|title=Hugo Moyano arrasó en las elecciones y es el nuevo presidente de Independiente - canchallena.com|website=canchallena.lanacion.com.ar|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and treasurer of the [[Argentine Football Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infobae.com/2016/04/01/1801315-segura-designo-hugo-moyano-protesorero-la-afa|title=Segura designó a Hugo Moyano protesorero de la AFA {{!}} Torneo de Primera División - Playfutbol|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and times ==

===Early life and career===
Moyano was born in [[La Plata]], in 1944. His family settled in seaside [[Mar del Plata]] early in his childhood, and he entered the labour force in his teens as an employee of ''Expresos y Mudanzas'', a local moving company. He was elected shop steward in 1962, and soon became a leader in the Mar del Plata local of the Teamsters' Union, a member of the [[CGT (Argentina)|CGT]] labour federation. Moyano was elected head of the local in 1972.&lt;ref name=fedcam&gt;[http://www.fedcam.org.ar/trayectoria.htm Federación Nacional de Trabajadores Camioneros: Hugo Moyano] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married three times: to Olga Mariani (with whom he had two sons), to Patricia Villares (four children), and to Liliana Zulet (a daughter).&lt;ref name=tragedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/tragedia-golpeo-Moyano-murio-hijos_0_584941556.html|title=La tragedia golpeó una vez más a Moyano: murió uno de sus hijos|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moyano reached an agreement with the right-wing National University Round Table (CNU) to jointly establish the Peronist Union Youth (JSP), in 1973. Moyano's entry into politics was made amid fast-growing tensions between the far left and far right fringes of [[Peronism]], shortly after the end of its political banning. A staunch opponent of the Peronist left, he joined the JPRA, a rightist counterpart to the influential, left-wing [[Peronist Youth]] (JP); both the JSP and JPRA maintained close links with [[José López Rega]] (head of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]]).&lt;ref name=pagina&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-89423-2007-08-09.html ''Página/12'': Vínculos con la Alianza Anticomunista] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The keystone of Peronist support, the CGT, became one of the targets of the [[Dirty War]] following the [[March 1976 coup]], however: union activity was banned and thousands of their members "[[Desaparecidos|disappeared]]." Restrictions were later eased, and the CGT was reconstituted under beer workers' leader [[Saúl Ubaldini]] in 1980. Moyano was named head of the CGT's Mar del Plata delegation, and was arrested during numerous demonstrations against the regime's [[José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz|economic policies]].&lt;ref name=fedcam/&gt; After these policies' collapse in 1981 and the loss of the [[Falklands War|Falklands (Malvinas) War]] the following year, [[Argentine general election, 1983|general elections]] were called for 1983, ahead of which Moyano was named head of the Mar del Plata chapter of the late Juan Perón's [[Justicialist Party]].&lt;ref name=fedcam/&gt;

===Trade union leadership===

Elections at the [[Buenos Aires Province]] Teamsters' Union in 1984 resulted in Moyano's promotion as Adjunct Secretary General and in 1987, he was elected Secretary General of the union. A Peronist sweep in the [[Argentine legislative election, 1987|September 1987 mid-term elections]] sent Moyano to the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] (Lower House of Congress) for the Province of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name=fedcam/&gt;
[[File:Cristina, Moyano y Evita.jpg|left|thumb|210px|President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] and Hugo Moyano share the stage beneath an image of former First Lady [[Eva Perón]]. The alliance of Moyano and [[Kirchnerism]] was a centerpiece of Argentine political life during her first term.]]
He stepped down from Congress following his first term in 1991 to assume the Speakership of the National Teamsters' Union, and was elected their Adjunct Secretary General in 1992. He assumed chairmanship of the union's health plan on that occasion and, in April, established the ''15 de Diciembre'' Teamsters' Mutual Association. Like many in the CGT, he became increasingly distanced from President [[Carlos Menem]], who was elected in 1989 as a Peronist and on a populist platform; but had adopted [[free-market economics]] since, and by 1995 presided over an unemployment rate of 18% and stagnant wages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://todo-argentina.net/historia/democracia/menem2/1996.html Todo Argentina: 1996] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Teamsters' Union helped lead a series of [[general strike]]s in 1996, though under the banner of the "Argentine Workers' Movement" (MTA) - a dissenting, intransigent faction within the CGT.&lt;ref name=fedcam/&gt;

An August 1997 meeting of the Transport Workers' Confederation of the [[Mercosur]] Common Market area resulted in Moyano's election as their Secretary General; this was followed by a November 1998 election as Vice President of the Transport Workers' Section for the Latin America Committee of the [[International Transport Workers' Federation|ITF]], in [[London]].&lt;ref name=fedcam/&gt;

Aside from shows of force like the 1996 general strikes, however, the CGT's leadership remained generally conciliatory with the anti-labour Menem for the sake of the Justicialist Party, whose defeats in the [[Argentine legislative election, 1997|October 1997 mid-term elections]] bode poorly for their chances in 1999 (elections they went on to lose).&lt;ref&gt;[http://todo-argentina.net/historia/democracia/menem2/index.html Todo Argentina: 1995-99] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moyano's rapproachment with the CGT's pragmatic Secretary General during the late 1990s, Rodolfo Daer, was again strained in the year 2000, when President [[Fernando de la Rúa]]'s plans to make Argentina's labour laws more flexible led to a new schism within the CGT, and in March, Moyano led the MTA as one of two major breakaway unions.&lt;ref name=fedcam/&gt;

The collapse of de la Rúa's government in late 2001 made way for the parliamentary selection of former Buenos Aires Province Governor [[Eduardo Duhalde]], whose alliance to Moyano helped lead to the gathering of most of the CGT under a trio of Moyano, Susana Rueda of the Nurses' Union and José Luis Lingieri of the Water Works Union; a reunited CGT elected Moyano Secretary General in July 2004.  Benefiting from a close alliance with the administrations of [[Néstor Kirchner|Néstor]] and [[Cristina Kirchner]], Moyano leveraged his role as head of the Council on Salaries (an officially sanctioned advisory board) to secure a stronger collective bargaining position and frequent increases in the minimum wage, while opposing [[Shock therapy (economics)|restrictive economic policy]] proposals.&lt;ref name=fedcam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telam.com.ar/vernota.php?tipo=N&amp;dis=27&amp;sec=3&amp;idPub=152398&amp;id=223759 ''TELAM'': Enfriar la economía significa congelar los salarios] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The labour leader was shaken by the November 2007 murder of Abel Beroiz, the longtime treasurer for the Teamsters' Union and a close adviser of Moyano's. The arrest of his presumptive assassin the following March yielded information on a possible plot against Moyano, and the case remains pending in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2008/03/14/noticia_0047.html ''Perfil'': Caso Beroiz] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector]] over a planned hike in export taxes, Moyano proposed the creation of a "CGT-TV" and a related radio station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telam.com.ar/vernota.php?tipo=N&amp;dis=27&amp;sec=2&amp;idPub=152398&amp;id=224033 ''Telam'': La CGT busca tener su propio medio de comunicación] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-standing differences with Restaurant Workers' leader [[Luis Barrionuevo]] led to a new, July 2008 schism within the CGT, whereby Barrionuevo led 40 unions into a "Blue-and-White CGT." Moyano secured his reelection as CGT head, however, and retained the support of 134 unions, including most of the larger ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1028750 ''La Nación'': Se fracturó la CGT tras la reelección de Moyano] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teamsters' Union, by then headed by the CGT leader's son Pablo Moyano, staged a blockade of Buenos Aires distribution plants operated by ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' and ''[[La Nación (Buenos Aires)|La Nación]]'', the nation's two leading newspapers, on November 6, 2009. Relations between the government (allied to Moyano) and the news media had become strained in the preceding months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/11/06/um/m-02035391.htm ''Clarín'' (11/6/2009)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The labour leader's numerous business interests, as well as those of his wife, Liliana Zulet de Moyano, and other family members, later came under growing media and judicial scrutiny. The Prosecutor General of [[Switzerland]], Erwin Beyeler, reportedly requested copies of court files in March 10, 2011, related to [[money laundering]] investigations of the Moyanos, and in response, the labour leader threatened to call a [[general strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urgente24.info/noticias/val/5594/suiza-pide-informacion-judicial-sobre-moyano-y-el-declara-un-paro-nacional.html|title=Suiza pide información judicial sobre Moyano y él declara un paro nacional|publisher=''Urgente24''|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722145544/http://www.urgente24.info/noticias/val/5594/suiza-pide-informacion-judicial-sobre-moyano-y-el-declara-un-paro-nacional.html|archivedate=2011-07-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ambassador of Switzerland to Argentina, Johannes Matyassy, clarified that the Swiss investigation was limited to Ricardo Depresbiteris, proprietor of the Covelia [[garbage truck|waste transport]] company, and that no files pertaining to the Moyanos had been requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiempo.elargentino.com/notas/lavado-de-dinero-moyano-y-su-familia-no-estan-bajo-investigacion|title=Lavado de dinero: "Moyano y su familia no están bajo investigación"|publisher=''Tiempo Argentino''|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322033310/http://tiempo.elargentino.com/notas/lavado-de-dinero-moyano-y-su-familia-no-estan-bajo-investigacion|archivedate=2011-03-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moyano, his wife, his son Pablo Moyano, and other relatives and associates were later implicated by the Office of Economic Crimes and Money Laundering (PROCELAC) in four cases of [[racketeering]] totaling over 570 million pesos (US$100 million) involving Teamster Union accounts and three Moyano family [[shell corporations]] located in the same [[Florida Street]] address; the cases were formally submitted to prosecutors in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiempo.infonews.com/2013/09/16/argentina-109493-la-causa-que-mas-complica-a-hugo-moyano-a-su-mujer-y-a-su-hijo-pablo.php|title=La causa que más complica a Hugo Moyano, a su mujer y a su hijo Pablo|work=Tiempo Argentino|date=September 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918060739/http://tiempo.infonews.com/2013/09/16/argentina-109493-la-causa-que-mas-complica-a-hugo-moyano-a-su-mujer-y-a-su-hijo-pablo.php|archivedate=September 18, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moyano lost his second wife and a son due to health problems during 2011.&lt;ref name=tragedia/&gt; His support for President [[Cristina Kirchner]] dimmed during her [[Argentine general election, 2011|reelection campaign]], when the president refused Moyano's demands to have more CGT officials included in the [[Front for Victory]] [[party list]] for Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1372791-cristina-y-moyano-grieta-o-precipicio|title=Cristina y Moyano: ¿grieta o precipicio?|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned his executive posts within the [[Justicialist Party]], including that of President of the [[Buenos Aires Province]] chapter, in February 2012 following a two-year tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-187252-2012-02-09.html|title=Moyano le ratificó su renuncia a Scioli|publisher=''Página/12''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moyano's alliance with the Kirchner administration effectively ended with a series of strikes called by the Trucking Workers' Union (led by his son, Pablo) during June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.com/2012/06/20/politica-26434-moyano-se-corrio-del-modelo-y-del-sentido-del-proyecto.php|title=Moyano se corrió del modelo y del sentido del proyecto|work=InfoNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration's decision to file legal charges and levy fines against the Truckers' Union for failing to abide by labour dispute mediation requirements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/104150/truckers-strike-govt-takes-legal-action-against-moyanos-fuel-shortage-reported|title=Truckers' strike|work=Buenos Aires Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by Moyano's own call for a 10-hour [[general strike]] on June 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/104163/cgt-to-join-teamsters-strike-demonstration|title=CGT to join Teamsters' strike, demonstration|work=Buenos Aires Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; This break with the administration caused a schism within the CGT, whereby most of the larger unions rallied behind Steelworkers' Union (UOM) leader [[Antonio Caló]], who was elected Secretary General of the Official CGT in October 2012 while Moyano continued to lead the now Dissident CGT in a loose alliance with Barrionuevo and Pablo Micheli of the Dissident CTA.&lt;ref name=cronista/&gt;

'''International Standards For Phytosanitary Measures No. 15''' ('''ISPM 15''') is an [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures|International Phytosanitary Measure]] developed by the [[International Plant Protection Convention|International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC)]] that directly addresses the need to treat wood materials of a thickness greater than 6mm, used to ship products between countries.  Its main purpose is to prevent the international transport and spread of disease and insects that could negatively affect plants or ecosystems.
ISPM 15 affects all wood [[packaging]] material ([[pallet]]s, [[crate]]s, [[dunnage]]s, etc.) requiring that they be debarked and then heat treated or fumigated with [[methyl bromide]] and stamped or branded,&lt;ref&gt;[http://brandingirons.com/pr_3.html Branding IPPC Tools]&lt;/ref&gt; with a mark of compliance. This mark of compliance is colloquially known as the "wheat stamp".

The Revision of ISPM No. 15 (2009) under Annex 1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revision of ISPM No. 15 Regulation of Wood Packaging Material in International Trade (2009)|url=https://www.ippc.int/servlet/BinaryDownloaderServlet/133703_E.pd.pdf?filename=1240490152156_ISPM_15_Revised_2009_E.pdf&amp;refID=133703}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires that wood used to manufacture ISPM 15 compliant Wood Packaging must be made from debarked wood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discussion of Debarked vs. Bark Free Wood|url=http://tcrllc.com/ispm_15_bark_restriction_debarked_bark_free_clarification.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to be confused with bark free wood.  ISPM 15 was updated to adopt the bark restriction regulations proposed by the European Union in 2009.  Australia held out for approximately one year with more stringent bark restrictions before conforming July 1, 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia Announces its adoption of ISPM 15|url=http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/import/general-info/ian/10/18-2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627200106/http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/import/general-info/ian/10/18-2010|archivedate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debarked wood packaging===
[[File:يوسفي مغربي.jpg|thumbnail|Wooden crate of clementines (mandarins) from Morocco, showing the ISPM 15 logo in the lower left corner (MA for Morocco, from the French "Maroc") in 2010.]]
Wood packaging materials must be debarked prior to being heat treated or fumigated to meet ISPM 15 regulations.  The debarking component of the regulation is to prevent the re-infestation of insects while lumber is sitting to be manufactured, or even after it has been manufactured.
The official definition for debarked lumber according to the ISPM 15 Revision (2009) is:

''"Irrespective of the type of treatment applied, wood packaging material must be made of debarked wood. For this standard, any number of visually separate and clearly distinct small pieces of bark may remain if they are: - less than 3 cm in width (regardless of the length) or - greater than 3 cm in width, with the total surface area of an individual piece of bark less than 50 square cm."''

===Argument for bark removal===
What are the post treatment levels of infestation (with and without bark) compared with pre-treatment levels?
Overall, from the studies presented there is either:
a) no significant difference between infestation levels of treated and untreated wood; or
b) differences identified are related to the species of insect which may prefer treated or untreated wood.
Supporting information from a North American study (IFQRG 2005-27) is summarised in the Table below &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examination of Phytosanitary Issues related to Bark on Wood Packaging Material and ISPM 15 Treatments|url=http://www.forestry-quarantine.org/analysis-%20Bark-ISPM15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Data are numbers of beetles per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;):

===ISPM Marking===
[[File:ISPM 15 logo US MB mark.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sample ISPM logo showing the MB for methyl bromide treatment of the wood.]]
*IPPC certification symbol.
*XX: represents the two letter ISO country code or [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code (e.g. AU for Australia, US for United States, NZ for New Zealand, GB for United Kingdom).
*00: represents the unique certification number issued to NPPOs (regulating agencies that oversee the individual wood packaging manufacturers). Inclusion of this certification number ensures that the wood packaging material can be traced back to the NPPO/auditing agency.
*1111: represents the unique certification number issued to the treatment provider and/or manufacturer.  Inclusion of this certification number ensures that the wood packaging material can be traced back to the treatment provider and/or the manufacturer.
*YY: represents the treatment applied to the wood packaging material:
**HT is the code for heat treatment to a minimum of {{convert|56|C}} for a minimum of 30 minutes
**MB is the code for methyl bromide fumigation.
*DUN: represents the code for when the solid wood material is used for dunnage.  The "DUN" Dunnage code is not applied to manufactured wood packaging, only loose lumber/timbers to help secure products being shipped.

The ISPM 15 compliant stamp may include further information as producers and suppliers may choose to include additional information for identification purposes.

==Internationally accepted types of treatment ==

*HT (Heat Treatment) - The wood needs to be heated until its core reaches 56&amp;nbsp;°C for at least 30 minutes.
** Steady Heat Treatment (HT): Standard procedure conducted in heating chambers;
** Kiln-dried (KD): Similar to the standard HT, but it also requires moisture's standards;
** Mobile Heat Treatment (HT): Heat treatment conducted in heating chambers installed in trucks. Allows the treatment to be done anywhere.
** Portable Chamber Process (PCP - HT): Heat treatment conducted in portable chambers made of thermal fabric. Allows the treatment to be done anywhere, but with lower costs. The process' patent requirement belongs to the Brazilian company Fitolog Pest Control;
** Fast Container Connector (FCC - HT): Heat treatment conducted directly in containers by a mobile heating unit. Its a simplified variation of PCP. Ideal for ports and terminals.
**MB (Methyl Bromide) - Requires to completely fill an area with gaseous pesticide (methyl bromide). 
** Container Fumigation: The container where the wooden packaging is placed is completely filled with Methyl Bromide. After a 24-hour quarantine, the container is aerated and the wood/cargo is released;
** Tent Fumigation: The wooden packaging is covered with a specific type of tent, sealed to the ground with weight. The tent is completely filled with methyl bromide. After a 24-hour quarantine, the tent is removed and the wood/cargo is released;

'''Jack Baskin''' is a philanthropist, engineer, and businessman in [[California]], especially near [[Silicon Valley]]. He is the founder of the [[Jack Baskin School of Engineering]] at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-17/news/mn-59659_1_uc-santa-cruz|title=Developer Jack Baskin Gives $5 Million for UC Santa Cruz Engineering School|first=Associated|last=Press|date=17 May 1997|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the founding members of the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz, and director the Peggy &amp; Jack Baskin Foundation with his wife, Peggy Downes Baskin.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.baskinfoundation.org/board-of-directors/jack-baskin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born on September 20, 1919 in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]], Baskin is the son of a watchmaker who immigrated with his wife to the [[United States]] in 1908. For his early education, Baskin attended school in a one-room schoolhouse through the eighth grade with 30 other students. When it came time for Baskin to seek a college education, it was in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], and so his family worked to save money to pay for his tuition. He would eventually study [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Colorado]], the first in his family to have a college education. Afterward, Baskin pursued his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at [[New York University]], earning the degree in 1940.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.ucsc.edu/oncampus/currents/97-05-19/bio1.htm|title=Jack Baskin biography: 05-19-97|website=www1.ucsc.edu|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following college, Baskin entered his first job in engineering, being paid $28 per week, today being valued at around almost $500, or $70 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/result.php?year_source=1940&amp;amount=28&amp;year_result=2018|title=Measuring Worth - Result in Table|website=www.measuringworth.com|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this same period, Baskin served as an [[aeronautical engineer]] in [[World War II]]. Three years after the war in 1948, he moved west and earned his California Professional Engineers License, eventually becoming a [[general contractor]] in [[Southern California]], especially in the newly-popular suburbs of [[Los Angeles]]. Baskin would go on from there to work in engineering, real estate, and philanthropy, eventually setting in [[Santa Cruz, California]], where he still lives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
Originally, Baskin moved to Los Angeles to pursue contracting, as well as working near [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. Baskin created and was president of Jack Baskin, Inc. (incorporated 1948) which became one of the five property management firms approved by both the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] and the [[California Housing Finance Agency]]. Baskin's roots in real estate date back to the 1950s, when he built small residential projects in [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]] with $5,000 in [[venture capital]]. After building seven schools for the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]], Jack Baskin, Inc. built houses in Los Angeles and Orange County. Baskin also built his own home during this period in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Eventually, the offices of Jack Baskin, Inc. were moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] when the company entered into an agreement with the City of [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] Redevelopment Agency to build 600 apartments for low-income families.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This project included the construction of the 14-story Marina Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bridgehousing.com/properties/senior/solano/vallejo/marina-tower|title=Marina Tower {{!}} BRIDGE Housing|website=bridgehousing.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower housed the headquarters of Jack Baskin, Inc. until its closing in 1999.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1967, Baskin worked in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] in order to construct a 300-unit development for cooperative housing in San Francisco's [[Western Addition, San Francisco|Western Addition]], the [[San Lorenzo, California|San Lorenzo]] Park Apartments, and [[Watsonville, California|Watsonville's]] Independence Square.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1999, due to Baskin's own retirement, Baskin, Inc. was dissolved and its offices closed after operating for 50 years. Baskin's remaining real estate holdings were transferred to the Baskin Family Trust where they are still today, managed by SAR Asset Management, Inc. in [[Aptos, California|Aptos]]. Since this time, Jack and his wife Peggy Downes Baskin have lived in Santa Cruz.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2006, he was inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-28/awards-baskin.asp|title=Jack Baskin chosen for Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame|website=currents.ucsc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
Baskin's charities include various local Santa Cruz establishments such as the Dominican Hospital of Santa Cruz, [[Cabrillo College]], [[Long Marine Laboratory|Seymour Marine Laboratory]], and the University of California, Santa Cruz. In 1997, he established a grant of $5 million used to build the Jack Baskin School of Engineering which opened in 1999.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/archive/98-99/06-99/engineering.htm|title=UC Santa Cruz: Engineering building named for Baskin|website=www1.ucsc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional grants of $500,000 in 2002 and $1 million in 2003 bring his current total contributions to the Jack Baskin School of Engineering to over $8 million.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These donations helped to finance programs for [[computer engineering]], [[the arts]], the Institute of Marine Sciences, [[Shakespeare Santa Cruz]], an endowed chair in [[psychology]], and scholarships in [[literature]]. Baskin also served as [[Chairman|chair]] of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation for two years and remains a [[trustee]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Baskin is a [[Emeritus|director emeritus]] of the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz, as well as one of its founding members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfscc.org/AboutUs/OurBoard.aspx|title=Our Board - About Us - Community Foundation Santa Cruz County|website=www.cfscc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he pledged $1.25 million to the Foundation in order to acquire a site in Aptos where their headquarters would be built. Once the headquarters was completed in 2010, it was named the Jack &amp; Peggy Baskin Center for Philanthropy, in honor of its donors. In January 2008, the Baskins also established the Peggy &amp; Jack Baskin Foundation, initially funded with their gift of $2 million.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He controlled more than 100 companies in the diversified portfolio of the "Santo Domingo Group." He was listed by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as one of the wealthiest men in the world, and the second-wealthiest in Colombia, with a fortune of $8 billion [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]].&lt;ref name="forbes2008"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Julio-Mario-Santo-Domingo_YNZG.html |author= |work=[[Forbes]]|date=2008-03-05 |title=Billionaires: Julio Mario Santo Domingo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder of a philanthropic foundation, named to honor his father, that benefits Colombia's social development.

==Early life==
Julio Mario Santo Domingo was born on 16 October 1923 in [[Panama City]], [[Panama]], to Julio Mario Santo Domingo Santo Domingo and Beatriz Pumarejo de Vengoechea, the youngest of their four children; his older siblings were Beatriz Alicia, Cecilia, and Luis Felipe. His father was a banker, described as austere and disciplined, who made a fortune buying companies weakened during the [[Great Depression]]; his mother, from a rich and influential family, was [[first cousin]] of [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]] who was twice [[President of Colombia]]. He grew up in [[Barranquilla]] and later attended the exclusive [[Gimnasio Moderno]] in [[Bogotá, D.C.]], ultimately culminating his [[Secondary education|secondary studies]] at the [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]]; he later attended [[University of Virginia]] before transferring to [[Georgetown University]], but did not finish his degree.&lt;ref name="forbes2006"/&gt;

==Ambassadorship==
On 26 May 1980, [[President of Colombia|President]] [[Julio César Turbay Ayala]] appointed Santo Domingo to be the first [[Ambassador of Colombia to China]]. He presented his [[Letters of Credence]] to [[Ulanhu]], Vice Chairman of the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]], in [[Beijing]] on 17 February 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Summary of world broadcasts: Far East, Part 3 |author=[[BBC Asian Network]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2HVAAAAMAAJ |agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |newspaper= |publisher=[[BBC Monitoring]] |location=[[Caversham Park]] |issn= |oclc=10807079 |date=1981-02-27 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santo Domingo Group==

'''Leverett Samuel Lyon''' (Dec. 11, 1885 - 1959) was an American economist, lawyer and business executive, known for his works on education, government, marketing,&lt;ref name="NHE 1959"&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1249370 A Pioneer in Marketing...Leverett Samuel Lyon]," by N.H. Engle, ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. XXIV, No.1, July, 1959. p.67&lt;/ref&gt; and economic life, and particularly on the [[National Recovery Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Skocpol, Theda, and Kenneth Finegold. "State capacity and economic intervention in the early New Deal." ''Political Science Quarterly''(1982): 255-278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fligstein, Neil]]. ''The transformation of corporate control.'' Harvard University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Born in [[Sollitt, Illinois]] to Edward Payson Lyon and Charlotte Rose, Lyon obtained his Law degrees at [[Beloit College]], and at the [[Chicago-Kent College of Law]] in 1915. At the [[University of Chicago]] he obtained his BA in 1910, his MA in 1919 and his PhD in 1921&lt;ref&gt;''Who's who in the Midwest.'' Vol. 4. (1954) p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt; with the thesis, entitled "A functional approach to social-economic data."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Printing Office. ''A List of American Doctoral Dissertations Printed in the US.'' 1922. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1916 to 1929 Lyon taught economics at the [[University of Chicago]], at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]], where he was also Dean of the School of Commerce and Finance from 1923 to 1925, and at the [[Brookings Institution|Robert Brookings Graduate School of Economics and Government]]. In 1929 he left the academia and joined the American centrist think tank the [[Brookings Institution]], where he was executive vice-president from 1932 to 1939.

In 1939 he moved to the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry, where he served as its chief executive officer from until his retirement in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6rb855f Lyon, Leverett Samuel, 1885] at SNAC, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Lyon is noted for his early work "Our Economic Organization," (1921) co-authored with [[Leon C. Marshall]], which is considered "an excellent brief analysis of the American economic structure,",&lt;ref name="NHE 1959"/&gt; for his 1922 "Education for Business," and for his pioneering work in the field of marketing. According to Engle (1919):
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was during his years at Brookings that his greatest contributions to marketing emerged from his tireless research. Between 1925 and the inception of the New Deal such fundamental contributions to marketing literature as the following flowed from his pen.&lt;ref name="NHE 1959"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His most notable publications in the field of marketing were ''Salesmen in Marketing Strategy'' (1926), the ''Hand-to- Mouth Buying'' (1929), ''Some Trends in the Marketing of Canned Foods'' (1930), ''Advertising Allowances'' (1932), and ''The Economics of Free Deals'' (1933).&lt;ref name="NHE 1959"/&gt;

He is the stepfather of a businessman, Mirco Martins.

==Political career==
In 1999, Vicente was appointed as head of Sonangol.&lt;ref name=Homme/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt; In that key post, he presided over the most important sector of the Angolan economy and was considered a close associate of President [[José Eduardo dos Santos]].&lt;ref name=Homme/&gt; During his time in charge of the company, oil production increased dramatically.&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt; He routinely traveled abroad, acquiring "an excellent reputation from the international business community".&lt;ref name=Ex/&gt; Vicente was appointed as a member of the Political Bureau of the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), the ruling party, in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africaintelligence.com/AEM/who-s-who/2010/01/06/manuel-vicente,77688837-ART "Manuel Vicente"], ''Africa Energy Intelligence'', number 619, Africa Intelligence, 6 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A September 2011 report in ''Novo Jornal'' claimed that dos Santos intended for Vicente to be his successor.&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt; The report was followed by a flurry of speculation.&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa-confidential.com/article-preview/id/4148/Vicente_to_succeed_Dos_Santos "Vicente to succeed Dos Santos?"], ''Africa Confidential'', volume 52, number 18, 9 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Vicente was, however, reappointed for another term at the head of Sonangol in December 2011, briefly tempering the speculation.&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt;

President dos Santos appointed Vicente as Minister of State for Economic Coordination on 30 January 2012;&lt;ref name=Homme/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/pt_pt/noticias/politica/2012/0/5/Presidente-Republica-nomeia-ministro-Estado-Coordenacao-Economica,c6a801f0-14b9-4791-90b4-8007f8274c9d.html "Presidente da República nomeia ministro de Estado da Coordenação Económica"], Angola Press Agency, 30 January 2012 {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco de Lemos José Maria]] succeeded Vicente at Sonangol.&lt;ref name=Homme/&gt; In line with earlier speculation, the move was generally interpreted by observers as suggesting that dos Santos was positioning Vicente as his eventual successor.&lt;ref name=Homme/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt; It appeared that Vicente's government post would give him a great deal of authority in managing the economy, and it would bolster Vicente's credibility and experience given that he had previously only been involved in the oil industry.&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt; Nevertheless, it was believed that some other leading figures in the ruling party were skeptical about Vicente, given his relative inexperience in politics, and could be trying to resist the President's efforts to position him for the succession.&lt;ref name=Homme/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oilman/&gt;

[[Agence France-Presse]] reported in February 2012, citing an MPLA source, that Vicente would have the second spot on the MPLA's candidate list for the 2012 election, behind dos Santos, and would become [[Vice-President of Angola]] after the election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gMM8fcD-SoSYfkYZ4BpqqKOfaydQ?docId=CNG.298ed147731872d4e6278091cab9c895.921 "Angola's Dos Santos to seek new term: party source"], Agence France-Presse, 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As anticipated, the MPLA Central Committee designated President dos Santos as head of the MPLA party list and Vicente as the second candidate on the list on 13 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/politica/2012/5/24/President-Eduardo-dos-Santos-leads-party-list,b7b248c1-41a9-4c17-b7f2-883b9f8c3ed6.html "President Eduardo dos Santos leads party's list"], Angola Press Agency, 13 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The MPLA won the election, and Vicente took office as Vice President on 26 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/politica/2012/8/39/Manuel-Vicente-inaugurated-Vice-president-Republic,6eeef65d-2009-485c-a9c1-52e4c7eb619e.html "Manuel Vicente inaugurated as Vice-president of Republic"], Angola Press Agency, 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 Manuel Vicente participated, representing the Angolan Head of State, in the [[United States–Africa Leaders Summit]], an initiative of the American president, [[Barack Obama]], held in Washington DC under the theme "Investing in the future of Africa."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/politica/2014/7/31/Vice-President-attends-Africa-summit,91a709b3-4da4-4b55-bd75-3e4897100913.html Vice President attends US/Africa summit], Angolan Press Agency, August 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuel Vicente was present at the 69th [[General Assembly of the United Nations]], which took place in September 2014 in [[New York City]]. The Angolan Vice-President defended a reform in the [[UN Security Council]], which, according to him, should “be more in line with the international context and reflect an equal geographical representation through the increase in the number of permanent members”, namely by including an African country. In his speech, the Angolan Vice-President also approached issues such as the resurgence of armed conflicts and the religious fundamentalism in some African countries, as well as the importance of disarmament and the combating of drug and human trafficking and transnational organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observador.pt/2014/09/29/angola-quer-africa-em-permanencia-conselho-de-seguranca/ Angola quer África em permanência no Conselho de Segurança] Observador (29-09-2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Manuel Vicente was distinguished with the "Sirius Award" by the multinational corporation [[Deloitte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/politica/2014/10/48/Vice-president-gets-Sirius-Award,9b143885-bc73-4e5c-a4e7-0dd995bb0be5.html Vice President gets Sirius Award] Angola Press Agency, November 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the MPLA chose [[João Lourenço]], the Minister of Defense and Vice-President of the MPLA, as the party's top candidate and therefore its presidential candidate for the [[Angolan legislative election, 2017|2017 election]]. Lourenço, and not Vicente, was thus expected to succeed dos Santos as President.&lt;ref&gt;Herculano Coroado, [https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN13S06T?sp=true "Angola's Dos Santos not up for re-election in 2017 -party document"], Reuters, 3 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In June 2017, a Portuguese court ruled that Vincente should face trial over bribery allegations brought against him by a prosecutor in February 2017 after accused of bribing a magistrate with $810,000 in order to shelve investigations into his deals at an oil company named [[Sonangol Group]] which he headed between 2009 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/06/22/angolan-vice-president-must-face-portuguese-corruption-charges-court-rules/|title=Angolan Vice President should face Portuguese corruption charges: court rules|publisher=Africanews|date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mehmet Uluğ''' (13 Nisan 1959 – 20 Kasım 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/kultur-sanat/25165261.asp Mehmet Uluğ, hayatını kaybetti]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Turkey|Turkish]] businessman, promoter and music curator. He is best known as the founder of Turkey’s leading concert, festival and live show company Pozitif, record label [[Doublemoon]] and music club [[Babylon Istanbul|Babylon]].

== Early life ==
Uluğ was born in [[Istanbul]] as the eldest of two children of Semra Uluğ and Şahap Uluğ. Uluğ graduated from [[Robert College]] in 1978 after being educated at Yeşilköy Primary School and British High School. Uluğ attended Clemson [[University]] in the United States of America, completing his educational life in 1984 with an undergraduate and graduate degree in [[Electronic engineering|Electronic Engineering]].

== Career ==

Uluğ worked in [[Baltimore]] as a research engineer between 1984 and 1987. In 1988 moved from the US and after a 6-month-long trip to the [[Far East]], he returned to Turkey. Dreaming of building a bridge between [[Jazz|jazz music]] and [[Music of Turkey|Turkish music]] listeners and adding a new dimension to Istanbul’s very static cultural state, Uluğ chose to march in a more unconventional path than building a career in engineering.
 
In 1988, Uluğ founded Turkey’s biggest music and event company Pozitif along with his highschool friend Cem Yegül. In 1989, Uluğ’s brother, Ahmet Uluğ joined this duo forming the partnership that continued for 25 years until Mehmet Uluğ’s death.
 
Beginning from its early years, Pozitif was one of the important building blocks in Turkey’s music and artistic event arena. Being the leader in transforming Istanbul’s cultural scene with its events, Pozitif team organized Turkey’s biggest and most inclusive festivals such as Akbank Jazz Festival, Blues Festival, One Love Festival and [[Rock'n Coke|Rock’n Coke]]. Uluğ’s dream festival Cappadox was brought to life one year after his death, in [[Kapadokya]].
 
Aside from the festivals, in the period of Uluğ’s management, Pozitif team brought together the Turkish audience with many megastars like [[U2]], [[Rihanna]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], world renown shows like [[Cirque du Soleil|Cirque Du Sloeil]] and the avant garde artists of the alternative world [[Patti Smith]], [[Cecil Taylor]] and [[John Zorn]].
 
Uluğ’s most important venture under the framework of Pozitif was to establish -the most known club to be- Babylon. Being a very uninhabited neighbourhood in the year the club was founded (1999), Asmalımescit rapidly transformed into a lively district with the leadership of Babylon. From the day Babylon opened its doors, the club welcomed many local and international artists from various disciplinaries. Uluğ carried his passion for “good music” with the help of Babylon to [[Alaçatı]] and [[Çeşme]] leading the foundation of Babylon Çeşme and Babylon Alaçatı. Uluğ contributed to the organization of Babylon Soundgarden Festival, publishing of Babylon Magazine and Radio Babylon.
 
Another enterprise of Uluğ was the creation of the independent record label Doublemoon Records with the Pozitif team in 1998. With the aim of bringing together music from different roots, Uluğ worked on 13 important albums as the executive producer and published more than 50 albums with his partners.

== Early life and education ==

Mubarak Muyika was born  in [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western Province]], [[Kenya]],&lt;ref name="africame"/&gt; and has one brother.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} His father was the [[district]] [[commissioner]] of [[Siaya District|Siaya]], a senior [[civil service|civil servant]], who died when Mubarak was 2, and mother a high school teacher who died when he was 11.&lt;ref name="africame"/&gt; Muyika was raised by his mother's sister and her husband in the suburbs of [[Nairobi]].&lt;ref name="africame"/&gt;

While a student at [[Friends School Kamusinga]], Muyika won two awards in Kenya's national [[science fair]], the annual Kenya Students Congress on Science and Technology:

In the fair's 48th edition in 2010, he won for a technical [[whitepaper]] titled '''Kahunic infra-photo surveyor''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', which was presented as a [[computer]] talk, and was ranked first in that category. Muyika's whitepaper was based on [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[MySQL]] and [[C++]] dependencies, [[infra-red]] and [[laser]] [[Ray (optics)|rays]], and customized ray emitters to identify objects concealed behind concrete and wood, among other uses, by use of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Mubarack science congress.jpg|thumb|Muyika receiving a national award in the Kenya Students Congress on Science and Technology 2011.]]

In the fair's 49th edition the following year, Muyika won for a database he developed to manage the flow of petrol and movement of oil tankers.&lt;ref name="africame" /&gt; The project's original name in the fair was ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Techno Fibre System''&lt;nowiki/&gt;',&lt;ref name="2011congress"&gt;National Council For Science and Technology Conference Proceedings (2012) {{cite web|url=http://tum.ac.ke/assets/research/sec_sti/CONFERENCE%20PROCEEDINGS%20FIRST%20ST&amp;I%20WEEK.pdf|title=National Council For Science &amp; Technology|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628074149/http://tum.ac.ke/assets/research/sec_sti/CONFERENCE%20PROCEEDINGS%20FIRST%20ST&amp;I%20WEEK.pdf|archive-date=28 June 2018|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was also referred to as '''Enhanced petrol tracker''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'.&lt;ref name="africame" /&gt; It was presented as a computer [[Exhibit (educational)|exhibit]] in the [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] category, and although Muyika was recognized as the best student in the category,&lt;ref name="africame"/&gt; the project was ranked third nationally in the category.&lt;ref name="2011congress"/&gt;

He graduated from Friend's School Kamusinga in 2011.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Investor-shuns-Harvard-to-pursue-tech-dream/-/1248928/1976952/-/12p6bopz/-/index.html/|title=Investor Shuns Harvard to pursue tech dreams|author=Simon Ciuri|work=[[Business Daily Africa]]|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

His adoptive parents operated a small book publishing and distribution company, Acrodile Publishers. Using online resources and technical experience gained in earlier years, Muyika built a better [[Website]] for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Okafor|first=Lovelyn|url=http://www.konnectafrica.net/mubarak-muyika/|title=Meet Mubarak Muyika, The Young Web Pro That is Set to Change The World.|date=29 April 2014|work=Konnect Africa|access-date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Muyika founded Hype Century Technologies &amp; Investments Limited, a company focused on website creation and webhosting. The following year, for his work in HypeCentury, he received the Anzisha Prize for young entrepreneurs, from the [[African Leadership Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anzishaprize.org/fellows/mubarack-muyika/|title=Celebrating Africa's Youngest Entrepreneurs - Mubarack Muyika|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muyika sold HypeCentury to Wemps Telecoms in a six figure deal in May 2013.&lt;ref name="Daily Nation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harvard"/&gt; By the time of the sale Hypecentury had 14 employees and was handling over 700 companies with 1400 domains.&lt;ref name="harvard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wempstelecoms"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hypecentury Acquired by Wemps Telecoms|url=http://wempstelecoms.co.ke/hypecentury-acquired-by-wemps-telecoms/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331202428/http://wempstelecoms.co.ke/hypecentury-acquired-by-wemps-telecoms/ |dead-url=yes |website=Wemps Telecoms |archive-date=31 March 2016|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; HypeCentury has since rebranded and is a fully owned subsidiary of Wemps Telecoms.&lt;ref name="wempstelecoms"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hypecentury Technologies &amp; Investments Limited|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/hypecentury-corporaton/|url-access=registration|website=LinkedIn|access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2013, Muyika founded Zagace in Nairobi with proceeds from the sale of HypeCentury, with additional funding from investors.&lt;ref name="linkedin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zagace|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/zagace-ltd?trk=parent-company_org_title|url-access=registration|website=LinkedIn|access-date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thefounder"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thefounder.co.ke/meet-20-year-old-mubarak-shunned-harvard-scholarship-pursue-entrepreneurship/|title=Meet 20 year old Mubarak who shunned Harvard scholarship to pursue entrepreneurship|date=11 August 2017|work=TheFounder Magazine|access-date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zagace has since raised a number of [[Angel investor|angel investments]] from various investors.&lt;ref name="forbes2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=Tom |title=Meet the Investor: Toro Orero, DraperDarkFlow |url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2016/04/meet-the-investor-toro-orero-draperdarkflow/ |website=Disrupt Africa |accessdate=30 July 2018 |date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2021">'''Linear management''' is the application of reductionism to management problems, often relying on the ability to predict, engineer and control outcomes by manipulating the component parts of a business (organization, operation, policy, process and so on). [[Business process reengineering]] (BPR) is a popular example of linear management at work. The key defining characteristic of linear management is that order is imposed – usually from above.

However, many{{Who|date=July 2009}} argue that such an approach – treating organizations as machines to be engineered in this way – simply doesn't work. Businesses are too complex and too unpredictable. The results of many BPR projects in the 1990s suggests that this argument might be correct.

'''Nonlinear management''' (NLM) is a superset of management techniques and strategies that allows order to emerge by giving organizations the space to self-organize, evolve and adapt, encompassing [[Agile software development|Agile]], [[Evolutionary Project Management|"evolutionary"]] and [[Lean manufacturing|"lean"]] approaches, [[Flextime plan|flextime]], [[time banking]], as well as many others. Key aspects of NLM, including holism, evolutionary design or delivery, and self-organization are diametrically opposite to linear management thinking.

'''Northern bleached softwood kraft''' ('''NBSK''') is the paper industry's benchmark grade of [[wood pulp|pulp]]. Market NBSK is produced mainly in Canada and the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] countries. Some NBSK is also produced in north-western United States and in Russia. NBSK [[Futures contract|futures]] are traded on the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]].

==Properties==
This [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] grade is very diverse. All NBSK pulps have long fibers and is often used as reinforcement pulp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Nanko | first = Hirko |author2=Button, Allan |author3=Hillman, Dave | title = The World of Market Pulp | publisher = WOMP, LLC | year = 2005 | location = Appleton, WI, USA | pages = 10–13 | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 0-615-13013-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBSK from [[British Columbia]] is mainly from Lodgepole Pine, with a significant amount of White Spruce. [[Western Red Cedar|Redcedar]], [[douglas fir]], [[Tsuga|hemlock]], and [[larch]] make up a smaller portion of the chip furnish.  NBSK is known for having longer fiber lengths and larger fiber diameter than anywhere else in the world due to very long growing season and mild climate.

NBSK from [[Siberia]] is made from [[pine]], spruce and [[european larch]] and tend to be shorter and thinner than other NBSK pulps due to the short growing season. The larch makes up about 15% of the wood furnish and gives a rather coarse fiber that makes Siberian NBSK less desirable as reinforcement pulp.

The only single species NBSK is of plantation [[Radiata pine]] from New Zealand, [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]]. It has good brightness and cleanliness that is appreciated in [[printing and writing paper]]s.

NBSK from [[Scandinavia]] is only from [[scots pine]] and [[norway spruce]] in the normal mix 7:3. The mix might vary much with the season as norway spruce grows on wetter lands that is easier accessed in the winter when the ground is frozen.

==Applications==
The most common use of NBSK is as reinforcement fibres when making [[paper]] or as raw material for [[kraft paper]]. It is also used in [[tissue paper]].

== History ==
[[File:Charlespfizer.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Charles Pfizer]]
Pfizer was founded in 1849 by German-American [[Charles Pfizer]] and his cousin [[Charles F. Erhart]] from [[Ludwigsburg]], Germany. They launched the chemicals business Charles Pfizer and Company from a building at the intersection of Harrison Avenue and Bartlett Street&lt;ref name="Citycyclopedia"&gt;Kenneth T. Jackson. ''The Encyclopedia of New York City''. The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; September 1995. P. 895. {{ISBN|978-0-300-05536-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], where they produced an antiparasitic called [[santonin]]. This was an immediate success, although it was the production of citric acid that really kick-started Pfizer's growth in the 1880s. Pfizer continued to buy property to expand its lab and factory on the block bounded by Bartlett Street, Harrison Avenue, Gerry Street, and Flushing Avenue. Pfizer's original administrative headquarters was at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan.&lt;ref name="Citycyclopedia"/&gt;

By 1906, sales totaled $3.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Pfizer|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/charles_pfizer|publisher=Pfizer|accessdate=9 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510151810/http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/charles_pfizer|archivedate=May 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War I caused a shortage of [[calcium citrate]] which Pfizer imported from Italy for the manufacture of citric acid, and the company began a search for an alternative supply. Pfizer chemists learned of a fungus that ferments sugar to citric acid, and they were able to commercialize production of citric acid from this source in 1919, and the company developed expertise in fermentation technology as a result. These skills were applied to the mass production of the antibiotic [[penicillin]] during World War II in response to the need to treat injured Allied soldiers; most of the penicillin that went ashore with the troops on [[D-Day]] was made by Pfizer.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite newsgroup | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2014/07/16/a-plan-for-big-pharma-involvement-in-superbug-rd/ | title=A Plan For Big Pharma Involvement In Superbug R&amp;D | date=2014-07-16 | accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penicillin became very inexpensive in the 1940s, and Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. They discovered [[oxytetracycline|Terramycin (oxytetracycline)]] in 1950, and this changed the company from a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer developed a drug discovery program focusing on in vitro synthesis in order to augment its research in fermentation technology. The company also established an animal health division in 1959 with an {{convert|700|acre|km2 |adj=on}} farm and research facility in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]].

By the 1950s, Pfizer had established offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. In 1960, the company moved its medical research laboratory operations out of New York City to a new facility in Groton, Connecticut. In 1980, they launched [[piroxicam|Feldene (piroxicam)]], a prescription anti-inflammatory medication that became Pfizer's first product to reach one billion dollars in total sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pfizer Inc: Exploring Our History 1951–1999|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/1951-1999|publisher=Pfizer}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s and 1990s, Pfizer Corporation growth was sustained by the discovery and marketing of Zoloft, Lipitor, Norvasc, Zithromax, Aricept, Diflucan, and Viagra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/07/19/companies/pfizer/|title=Pfizer to pay $20M federal fine; posts 2Q results - Jul. 19, 1999|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000–2010 ===
In this decade, Pfizer grew by mergers, including those with [[Warner–Lambert]] (2000), [[Pharmacia]] (2003), and [[Wyeth]] (2009).

In 2003, the company acquired [[Esperion Therapeutics]] for $1.3 billion (later selling the unit in 2008), protecting Lipitor from [[ETC-216]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmunos/2015/11/30/pfizer-does-not-need-a-merger-it-needs-a-rebellion/#63d5153e21d6|title=Pfizer Does Not Need A Merger, It Needs A Rebellion|first=Bernard|last=Munos|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Pfizer announced it would acquire Meridica for $125 million.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2005, the company made a number of acquisitions: Vicuron Pharmaceuticals for $1.9 billion, Idun for just less than $300 million and finally Angiosyn for $527 million.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On June 26, 2006, Pfizer announced it would sell its Consumer Healthcare unit (manufacturer of [[Listerine]], [[Nicorette]], [[Visine]], [[Sudafed]] and Neosporin) to [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] for $16.6&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/money/archives/articles/2006/6/26/082230.cfm |date=June 26, 2006 |title=Johnson &amp; Johnson to Buy Pfizer Unit |accessdate=July 19, 2007 |publisher=MoneyNews.com }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="investor_dec_2006"&gt;{{cite press release| url = http://www.investor.jnj.com/releaseDetail.cfm?releaseid=223093| title = Johnson &amp; Johnson Completes Acquisition Of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare| publisher=[[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]| date = 20 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_dec_2006"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/business/27johnson.html| title = Johnson &amp; Johnson Buys Pfizer Unit for $16.6&amp;nbsp;billion| first=Stephanie | last=Saul| date = 27 June 2006| work=The New York Times |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of [[torcetrapib]], a drug that increases production of [[high density lipoprotein|HDL]], or "good cholesterol", which reduces [[low density lipoprotein|LDL]] thought to be correlated to heart disease, was cancelled in December 2006. During a Phase III clinical trial involving 15,000 patients, more deaths occurred in the group that took the medicine than expected, and a sixty percent increase in mortality was seen among patients taking the combination of torcetrapib and Lipitor versus Lipitor alone. Lipitor alone was not implicated in the results, but Pfizer lost nearly $1&amp;nbsp;billion developing the failed drug and the market value of the company plummeted afterwards.&lt;ref name="NYT_2006"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/health/05pfizer.html?oref=slogin |title=Pfizer Shares Plummet on Loss of a Promising Heart Drug |author1=Berenson, Alex |author2=Pollack, Andrew |date=5 December 2006 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berenson 20061203"&gt;{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Berenson |title=Pfizer Ends Studies on Drug for Heart Disease |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/health/03pfizer.html?_r=1&amp;th&amp;emc=th&amp;oref=slogin |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In September 2009, Pfizer pleaded guilty to the illegal marketing of the arthritis drug [[Valdecoxib#2009 settlement for off-label uses promotions|Bextra]] for uses unapproved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and agreed to a $2.3 billion settlement, the largest health care fraud settlement at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/03/business/03health.html "Pfizer pays $2.3 billion to settle marketing case"], ''The New York Times,'' September 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A July 2010 article in ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'' reported that Pfizer was seeing more success in its battle against makers of [[counterfeit]] prescription drugs by pursuing civil lawsuits rather than criminal prosecution. Pfizer has hired customs and narcotics experts from all over the globe to track down fakes and assemble evidence that can be used to pursue civil suits for [[trademark infringement]]. Since 2007, Pfizer has spent $3.3&amp;nbsp;million on investigations and legal fees and recovered about $5.1&amp;nbsp;million, with another $5&amp;nbsp;million tied up in ongoing cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett |first=Simeon |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_29/b4187021988297.htm |title=Pfizer: Civil Suits for Drug Counterfeiters |work=BusinessWeek |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2013, Pfizer told The [[Associated Press]] it would begin selling Viagra directly to patients via its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pfizer to sell Viagra online, in first for Big Pharma: AP|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-500395_162-57582958/pfizer-to-sell-viagra-online-in-first-for-big-pharma-ap/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warner–Lambert acquisition==
Pfizer acquired [[Warner–Lambert]] in 2000 for $111.8&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref&gt;Pfizer, [http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/pfizer_warner_lambert.jsp 2000: Pfizer joins forces with Warner–Lambert], accessed April 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; at the time, created the second largest pharmaceutical company in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-the-7-biggest-mergers-of-all-time-2017-5/#6-warner-lambert-warms-up-to-pfizer-89-billion-2|title=Here are the 7 biggest mergers of all time|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner–Lambert was founded as a [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] drug store in 1856 by William R. Warner. Inventing a tablet-coating process gained Warner a place in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Parke–Davis was founded in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] in 1866 by Hervey Parke and George Davis. Warner–Lambert took over Parke–Davis in 1976, and acquired [[Wilkinson Sword]] in 1993 and Agouron Pharmaceuticals in 1999. 

====Pharmacia acquisition====
In 2002, Pfizer merged with [[Pharmacia]]. The merger was again driven in part by the desire to acquire full rights to a product, this time Celebrex ([[celecoxib]]), the [[COX-2 selective inhibitor]] previously jointly marketed by [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company|Searle]] (acquired by Pharmacia) and Pfizer. In the ensuing years, Pfizer carried out a massive restructuring that resulted in numerous site closures and the loss of jobs including [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]], Indiana; [[Holland, Michigan|Holland]], Michigan; [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], Connecticut; [[Brooklyn]], New York; [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], UK; and [[Puerto Rico]].

Pharmacia had been formed by a series of mergers and acquisitions from its predecessors, including Searle, [[Upjohn]] and [[SUGEN]].

Searle was founded in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], in April 1888. The founder was Gideon Daniel Searle. In 1908, the company was incorporated in [[Chicago]], Illinois. In 1941, the company established headquarters in Skokie, Illinois. It was acquired by the [[Monsanto Company]], headquartered in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, in 1985.

The Upjohn Company was a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm founded in 1886 in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], by Dr. [[William E. Upjohn]], an 1875 graduate of the [[University of Michigan]] medical school. The company was originally formed to make friable pills, which were specifically designed to be easily digested.  Greenstone was founded in 1993 by Upjohn as a generics division.&lt;ref name=PT2008/&gt; In 1995, Upjohn merged with Pharmacia, to form [[Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn]]. Pharmacia was created in April 2000 through the merger of Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn with the Monsanto Company and its G.D. Searle unit. The merged company was based in Peapack, New Jersey. The agricultural division was spun off from Pharmacia, as Monsanto, in preparation for the close of the acquisition by Pfizer.&lt;ref name="urlPharmacia to Spin Off Monsanto Stake, Less Than 2 Years After Firms Merger Wall Street Journal 28nov01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/Monsanto-Pharmacia-SpinOff.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415082118/http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/Monsanto-Pharmacia-SpinOff.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 15, 2013|title=Pharmacia to spin-off Monsanto stake, less than 2 years after firms' merger|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=mindfully.org|date=November 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SUGEN, a company focused on [[protein kinase]] inhibitors, was founded in 1991 in [[Redwood City, California]], and acquired by [[Pharmacia]] in 1999. The company pioneered the use of ATP-mimetic small molecules to block [[signal transduction]]. After the Pfizer merger, the SUGEN site was shut down in 2003, with the loss of over 300 jobs, and several programs were transferred to Pfizer. These included [[sunitinib]] (Sutent), which was approved for human use by the FDA in January 2006, passed $1&amp;nbsp;billion in annual revenues for Pfizer in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/files/annualreport/2010/financial/financial2010.pdf |title=Pfizer 2010 annual financial review, p 25. |format=PDF |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related compound, SU11654 ([[Toceranib]]), was also approved for [[Cancer in dogs|canine tumors]], and the [[ALK inhibitor]] [[Crizotinib]] also grew out of a SUGEN program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-05/pfizer-drug-targets-gene-flaw-to-shrink-lung-tumors-update1-.html |title=Pfizer Drug Targets Gene Flaw to Shrink Lung Tumors (Update1) |work=Businessweek |accessdate=July 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711122156/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-05/pfizer-drug-targets-gene-flaw-to-shrink-lung-tumors-update1-.html |archivedate=July 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the new Pfizer made Greenstone (originally established as a division of Upjohn) its generic division, and its focus turned to selling [[authorized generics]] of Pfizer's products.&lt;ref name=PT2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|title=Greenstone LLC - A Successful Business Model|url=http://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/supplement/2008/supp_2008-08/supp_2008-08_006|publisher=Pharmacy Times|date=August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hensley|first1=Scott|title=Pfizer to Make Generic Version of Its Zoloft|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115154467879893805|work=Wall Street Journal|date=29 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Pfizer announced 275 job cuts at the Kalamazoo manufacturing facility. Kalamazoo was previously the world headquarters for the Upjohn Company.&lt;ref name="urlPfizer plant in Michigan to cut 275 - FiercePharma"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/pfizer-plant-michigan-cut-275/2008-07-15 | title = Pfizer plant in Michigan to cut 275 – FiercePharma | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wyeth acquisition====
On January 26, 2009, after more than a year of talks between the two companies, Pfizer agreed to buy pharmaceuticals rival [[Wyeth]] for a combined US$68&amp;nbsp;billion in cash, shares and loans, including some US$22.5&amp;nbsp;billion lent by five major [[Wall Street]] banks. The deal cemented Pfizer's position as the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, with the merged company generating over US$20&amp;nbsp;billion in cash each year, and was the largest corporate merger since [[AT&amp;T]] and [[BellSouth]]'s US$70&amp;nbsp;billion deal in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/business/26drug.html Pfizer Agrees to Pay $68&amp;nbsp;billion for Rival Drug Maker Wyeth] By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and DUFF WILSON. January 26, 2009. ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The combined company was expected to save US$4&amp;nbsp;billion annually through streamlining; however, as part of the deal, both companies must repatriate billions of dollars in revenue from foreign sources to the United States, which will result in higher tax costs. The acquisition was completed on October 15, 2009, making Wyeth a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.&lt;ref name=PfizerWyeth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/investors/shareholder_services/wyeth_transaction.jsp |title=Wyeth Transaction |publisher=Pfizer |accessdate=October 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019062550/http://www.pfizer.com/investors/shareholder_services/wyeth_transaction.jsp |archivedate=October 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The merger was broadly criticized. [[Harvard Business School]]'s Gary Pisano told [[The Wall Street Journal]], "the record of big mergers and acquisitions in Big Pharma has just not been good. There's just been an enormous amount of shareholder wealth destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://industry.bnet.com/pharma/1000627/the-pfizer-wyeth-deal-worst-case-scenario/ The Pfizer–Wyeth Deal Worst-Case Scenario] By Jim Edwards | January 23, 2009 – BNET&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts said at the time, "The Warner–Lambert and Pharmacia mergers do not appear to have achieved gains for shareholders, so it is unclear who benefits from the Wyeth–Pfizer merger to many critics."&lt;ref name="Matthew"&gt;Matthew Karnitschnig, &amp; Jonathan D.

====King Pharmaceuticals acquisition====
In October 2010, Pfizer agreed to buy [[King Pharmaceuticals]] for $3.6&amp;nbsp;billion in cash or $14.25 per share: an approximately 40% premium over King's closing share price October 11, 2010.&lt;ref name="htanna"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pfizer to buy King Pharma for $3.6&amp;nbsp;billion in cash|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1216434820101012|agency=Reuters |accessdate=October 12, 2010 | date=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011–present===
In February 2011, it was announced that Pfizer was to close its UK research and development facility (formerly also a manufacturing plant) in [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], Kent, which at the time employed 2,400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12335801 |work=BBC News | title=Pfizer to close UK research site | date=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2014, Pfizer has a reduced presence at the site;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/research/science_and_technology/rd_locations/uk_sandwich|title=Sandwich UK - Pfizer: One of the world's premier biopharmaceutical companies|work=pfizer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also has a UK research unit in [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/research/science_and_technology/rd_locations/uk_cambridge|title=Cambridge, UK|work=pfizer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 2012, the FDA approved a Pfizer pill for a rare type of [[leukemia]]. The medicine, called Bosulif, treats [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML), a blood and [[bone marrow]] disease that usually affects older adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA approves Pfizer leukemia drug |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/04/us-pfizer-leukemia-idUSBRE88314720120904 |publisher= Reuters|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the company announced it would acquire Innopharma for $225&amp;nbsp;million, plus up to $135&amp;nbsp;million in milestone payments, in a deal that expanded Pfizer's range of generic and injectable drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/pfizer-to-acquire-innopharma-for-up-to-360m/81250112/?kwrd=pfizer%20acquire|title=GEN - News Highlights:Pfizer to Acquire InnoPharma for Up to $360M|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 2015, the company announced it would acquire a controlling interest in [[Redvax]] for an undisclosed sum. This deal expanded the company's vaccine portfolio targeting human [[cytomegalovirus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/pfizer-buys-redvax-boosting-vaccine-portfolio/81250760/|title=GEN - News Highlights:Pfizer Buys Redvax, Boosting Vaccine Portfolio|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, the company announced it would restart its collaboration with [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] surrounding the phase III trial of [[Tanezumab]].

====Attempted AstraZeneca acquisition====
In April 2014, it was reported that Pfizer had reignited a $100&amp;nbsp;billion takeover bid for the UK-based [[AstraZeneca]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/28/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-idUSBREA3R0H520140428| title=Pfizer chases AstraZeneca for potential $100 billion deal | author=Ben Hirschler | publisher=Reuters | date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brozak|first=Steve|title=No Longer King Of The North, Pfizer Looks To Recapture Crown|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenbrozak/2014/04/30/no-longer-king-of-the-north-pfizer-looks-to-recapture-crown/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sparking political controversy in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27309849 ''Cameron and Miliband clash over Pfizer deal''], BBC News, May 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27344465 ''US politicians raise questions over Pfizer bid''], BBC News, May 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 2014, a "final offer" of £55 a share was rejected by the AstraZeneca board, which said the bid was too low and imposed too many risks.

====Attempted Allergan acquisition====
{{main article|Allergan, Plc}}
On November 23, 2015, Pfizer and [[Allergan, Plc]] announced their intention to merge for an approximate sum of $160&amp;nbsp;billion, making it the largest pharmaceutical deal ever, and the third largest corporate merger in history. As part of the deal, the Pfizer CEO, Ian Read, was to remain as CEO and chairman of the new company, to be called "Pfizer plc", with Allergan's CEO, Brent Saunders, becoming president and chief operating officer. As part of the deal, Allergan shareholders would receive 11.3 shares of the company, with Pfizer shareholders receiving one. The terms proposed that the merged company would maintain Allergan's [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] domicile, resulting in the new company being subject to [[corporation tax]] at the Irish rate of 12.5%--considerably lower than the 35% rate that Pfizer paid at the time.&lt;ref name="BBC_23_nov_2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34900344|title=Pfizer seals $160bn Allergan deal to create drugs giant|work=BBC News |accessdate=24 November 2015 |date=23 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was to constitute a [[reverse merger]], whereby Allergan acquired Pfizer, with the new company then changing its name to "Pfizer, plc".&lt;ref name="Genegnews_2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/pfizer-to-acquire-allergan-for-160b/81252011/|title=Pfizer to Acquire Allergan for $160B|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg_22_Nov_2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-22/pfizer-allergan-said-to-be-close-to-150-billion-merger|title=Pfizer and Allergan to Combine With Joint Value of $160 Billion|author=Cynthia Koons|date=November 22, 2015|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="premier_2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierbiopharmaleader.com/en/media/press-releases/pfizer-and-allergan-to-combine/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20151123173226/http://www.premierbiopharmaleader.com/en/media/press-releases/pfizer-and-allergan-to-combine/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-11-23|title=Disclaimer - PremierBiopharmaLeader|work=premierbiopharmaleader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, subject to certain conditions: US and EU approval, approval from both sets of shareholders, and the completion of Allergan's divestiture of its generics division to [[Teva Pharmaceuticals]] (expected in the first quarter of 2016).&lt;ref name="Genegnews_2015"/&gt; On April 6, 2016, Pfizer and Allergan announced they would be calling off the merger after the Obama administration introduced new laws intended to limit [[corporate inversion|corporate tax inversions]] (the extent to which companies could move their headquarters overseas in order to reduce the amount of taxes they pay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/business/dealbook/pfizer-allergan-merger.html?_r=0 | title=Pfizer and Allergan Call Off Merger After Tax-Rule Changes | work=New York Times | date=6 April 2016 | accessdate=6 April 2016 | author=Bray, Chad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pfizer Consumer Healthcare====
In October 2017, reports emerged that Pfizer were undertaking a strategic review of their Consumer Healthcare division, with possible results ranging from a partial or complete spin-off or a direct sale&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer_reviewing_strategic_alternatives_for_consumer_healthcare_business&lt;/ref&gt; with the divestment expected to raise in the region of $15 billion for one of the largest Over-the-Counter businesses in the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pfizer-divestiture-exclusive/exclusive-pfizer-to-launch-consumer-health-sale-in-november-sources-idUSKBN1CU2RW&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reckitt Benckiser]] expressed interest in bidding for the division earlier in October&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/reckitt-benckiser-s-still-keen-a-pfizer-otc-buy-but-can-it-afford-one&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Sanofi]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/glaxosmithkline-s-eyeing-pfizer-s-otc-unit-but-will-a-buy-imperil-its-dividend&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] also being linked with bids for the business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/sanofi-j-j-could-join-gsk-reckitt-20b-bidding-war-for-pfizer-otc-report&lt;/ref&gt; On March 22, Reckitt Benckiser pulled out of the deal, a day later GlaxoSmithKline also pulled out.&lt;ref&gt;https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-pfizer-divestiture-glaxosmithkline/gsk-pulls-out-of-20-billion-race-for-pfizer-consumer-assets-idUKKBN1GZ0WG&lt;/ref&gt;

Key current and historical Pfizer products include:

* [[Atorvastatin]] ([[Drug nomenclature#Publication policies for nonproprietary and proprietary names|trade name]] Lipitor), a [[statin]] for the treatment of [[hypercholesterolemia]]. Lipitor was developed by Pfizer legacy company Warner-Lambert and first marketed in 1996.&lt;ref name="FDA_Lipitor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.DrugDetails |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although atorvastatin was the fifth drug in the class of [[statins]] to be developed, clinical trials showed that atorvastatin caused a more dramatic reduction in [[LDL-C]] than the other statin drugs. From 1996 to 2012 under the trade name Lipitor, atorvastatin became the world's best-selling drug of all time, with more than $125 billion in sales over approximately 14.5 years.&lt;ref name="url_Crain_2011" /&gt; Lipitor alone "provided up to a quarter of Pfizer Inc.'s annual revenue for years."&lt;ref name="url_Crain_2011"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20111228/HEALTH_CARE/111229902 | title = Lipitor becomes world's top-selling drug | date = 28 December 2011 | publisher = Crain's New York Business via Associated Press |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Prevnar]] (13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine) is a vaccine for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal infections. The introduction of the original, 7-valent version of the vaccine in 1999 led to a 75% reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections among children under age 5 in the United States. An improved version of the vaccine, providing coverage of 13 bacterial variants, was introduced in early 2010. As of 2012 the rate of invasive infections among children under age 5 has been reduced by an additional 50%.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;
* [[Norvasc]] (amlodipine), an [[antihypertensive]] drug of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker class. Amlodipine is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], a list of the most important medication needed in a basic [[health system]].&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Warner–Lambert]], which merged with Pfizer in 2000, used activities not usually associated with sales promotion, including [[continuing medical education]] and [[Medical research|research]], sponsored articles about the drug for the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study results, to promote gabapentin.

===Brigham Young University===
Controversy arose over the drug "Celebrex". [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) said that a professor of chemistry, Dr. [[Daniel L. Simmons]], discovered an enzyme in the 1990s that would later lead towards the development of Celebrex. BYU was originally seeking 15% royalty on sales, which would equate to $9.7 billion. The court filings show that a research agreement was made with [[Monsanto]], whose pharmaceutical business was later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a better aspirin. The enzyme that Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems, which Celebrex is used to reduce those issues. A battle ensued, lasting over six years, because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give him credit or compensation while Pfizer claims it had met all obligations regarding the Monsanto agreement. This culminated in a $450 million amicable settlement without going to trial. Pfizer said it would take a $450 million charge against first quarter earnings to settle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/health/pfizer-settles-lawsuit-involving-1429314.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601055014/http://www.ajc.com/health/pfizer-settles-lawsuit-involving-1429314.html|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation in which Pfizer was not a party===
Pfizer was discussed as part of the [[Kelo v. New London]] case that was decided by [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 2005.  In February 1998 Pfzer announced it would build a research facility in  [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], Connecticut, and local planners, hoping to promote [[economic development]] and build on the influx of jobs the planned facility would bring to the town, created a plan that included seizing property to redevelop it under [[eminent domain]], and local residents sued to stop the seizure.  The case went to the Supreme Court, and with regard to Pfizer, the court cited a prior decision that said: "The record clearly demonstrates that the development plan was not intended to serve the interests of Pfizer, Inc., or any other private entity, but rather, to revitalize the local economy by creating temporary and permanent jobs, generating a significant increase in tax revenue, encouraging spin-off economic activities and maximizing public access to the waterfront”.&lt;ref name=Kelo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-108.ZO.html|title=Kelo V.

==Environmental record==
Between 2002 and 2008, Pfizer reduced its greenhouse emissions by 20%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/pfizer-commended-leadership-addressing-climate-change-third-consecutive-year |title=Pfizer Commended For Leadership In Addressing Climate Change For Third Consecutive Year - FierceBiotech |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and committed to reducing emissions by an additional 20% by 2012. In 2012 the company was named to the [[Carbon Disclosure Project]]'s Carbon Leadership Index in recognition of its efforts to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-archive-detail/pfizer_recognized_by_carbon_disclosure_project_for_carbon_performance |title=Pfizer Recognized by Carbon Disclosure Project for Carbon Performance &amp;#124; Pfizer: One of the world’s premiere biopharmaceutical companies |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pfizer has inherited Wyeth's liabilities in the [[American Cyanamid]] site in Bridgewater, New Jersey. This site is highly toxic and an EPA declared Superfund site. Pfizer has since attempted to remediate this land in order to clean and develop it for future profits and potential public uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.gov/dep/srp/community/sites/pi/american_cyanamid_fs.pdf|title=American Cyanamid Superfund Site|date=December 2011|work=The State of New Jersey|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sierra Club and the Edison Wetlands Association have come out in opposition to the cleanup plan, arguing that the area is subject to flooding, which could cause pollutants to leach. The EPA considers the plan the most reasonable from considerations of safety and cost-effectiveness, arguing that an alternative plan involving trucking contaminated soil off site could expose cleanup workers. The EPA's position is backed by the environmental watchdog group CRISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/activisits_say_epa_fix_for_pol.html |title=Activists say EPA $204M fix for polluted American Cyanamid property will not permanently resolve problem &amp;#124; NJ.com |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2002, a chemical explosion at the Groton plant injured seven people and caused the evacuation of over 100 homes in the surrounding area.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/23/AR2006052301305_pf.html The tempest]. ''[[The Washington Post]]''. May 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political lobbying==
Pfizer is a leading member of the [[U.S. Global Leadership Coalition]], a Washington D.C.-based coalition of over 400 major companies and NGOs that advocates for a larger International Affairs Budget, which funds American diplomatic, humanitarian, and development efforts abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usglc.org/about/our-coalition |title=U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, Global Trust members |publisher=Usglc.org |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pfizer is one of the single largest lobbying interests in United States politics. For example, in the first 9 months of 2009 Pfizer spent over $16.3&amp;nbsp;million on lobbying US congressional lawmakers, making them the sixth largest lobbying interest in the US (following Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which ranked fourth but also represents many of their interests). A spokeswoman for Pfizer said the company “wanted to make sure our voice is heard in this conversation” in regards to the company's expenditure of $25&amp;nbsp;million in 2010 to lobby health care reform.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbrook, R., 2009. [http://healthcarereform.nejm.org/?p=2358 Lobbying, Campaign Contributions, and Health Care Reform] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610045933/http://healthcarereform.nejm.org/?p=2358 |date=June 10, 2010 }}  New England Journal of Medicine. 361(23), e52–e52.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] cables released by the [[whistleblower]] site [[WikiLeaks]], Pfizer "lobbied against New Zealand getting a [[free trade]] agreement with the United States because it objected to New Zealand’s restrictive drug buying rules and tried to get rid of New Zealand’s former health minister, [[Helen Clark]], in 1990.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10695239"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/pharmaceuticals/news/article.cfm?c_id=278&amp;objectid=10695239 |title= WikiLeaks: Drug firms tried to ditch Clark |author1=David Fisher  |author2=Jonathan Milne  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=December 19, 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment and diversity==
Since 2004, Pfizer has received a 100% rating every year on the [[Corporate Equality Index]], released by the [[Human Rights Campaign|Human Rights Campaign Foundation]].

In 2012, Pfizer's Canadian division, which then employed 2,890 people, was named one of [[Canada's Top 100 Employers#Montreal Top 15 Winners|Montreal's Top 15 Employers]], the only research-based pharmaceutical company to receive this honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadastop100.com/montreal/montreal2012.pdf|title=Montreal's Top Employers 2012|date=2012|publisher=Canada's Top 100|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417084851/http://www.canadastop100.com/montreal/montreal2012.pdf|archivedate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in developing world health issues==
Pfizer makes the anti-fungal drug [[fluconazole]] available free of charge to governmental and [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) in [[developing country|developing countries]] with a greater than 1% prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/07/world/aids-fungus-drug-offered-to-poor-nations.html | title=AIDS Fungus Drug Offered to Poor Nations | date=June 7, 2001 | accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww4.aegis.org/news/re/2001/RE010226.html|title=S.Africa okays Pfizer AIDS drug distribution|publisher=Reuters NewMedia|date=February 21, 2001|first=Emelia|last=Sithole|accessdate=May 15, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091937/http://ww4.aegis.org/news/re/2001/RE010226.html|archive-date=September 29, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfizer.com/responsibility/global_health/diflucan_partnership_program |title=Pfizer - Diflucan Commitments |accessdate=2014-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also pledged to provide up to 740&amp;nbsp;million doses of its anti-[[pneumococcal infection|pneumococcal]] vaccine at discounted rates to infants and young children in 41 developing countries in association with the [[GAVI Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfizer.com/health/vaccines/developing_world |title=Pfizer - GAVI commitments |accessdate=2014-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Pfizer and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]] announced a joint effort to provide affordable access to Pfizer's long-lasting injectable contraceptive, [[Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate|medroxyprogesterone acetate]], to three million women in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/media-center/press-releases/2012/07/innovative-partnership-to-deliver-convenient-contraceptives-to-up-to-three-million-women |title=Pfizer Gates Foundation Press Release |accessdate=2014-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Priming''' is a cleaning and preparation process that involves cleaning scientific equipment with the same liquid chemical it will come into contact with during the experiment. During scientific experiments that require high levels of accuracy and involve liquid chemicals, the equipment that will come into contact with the liquid chemicals is primed. The process is used to minimize contamination and therefore obtain results that are more accurate.

When cleaning equipment it is near impossible to remove all the loose molecules.  It is almost certain that traces of the chemical used to clean the equipment will remain on its surfaces, forming a microscopically thin layer.

The advantages to priming are best demonstrated with an example.  Say a known quantity of concentrated [[hydrofluoric acid]] was needed for an experiment, and this quantity was measured out in a measuring cylinder cleaned with water.  Concentrated hydrofluoric acid reacts violently with water; the products would then contaminate the experiment.  This reaction is very [[exothermic]], and would warm the quantity, perhaps creating other problems, for example, if the experiment had been carried out under standard conditions.  Priming the equipment, in this case using concentrated hydrofluoric acid, would minimize such problems.

This process is also used in [[engineering]] and mechanics to avoid contamination, particularly in [[hydraulic]] systems, for example, braking systems in cars.

'''Svend Olufsen''' was a Danish [[electrical engineer]] who co-founded [[Bang &amp; Olufsen]] with [[:da:Peter Bang (ingeniør)|Peter Bang]]. Like Bang, Olufsen studied at the Technical University of Aarhus. Olufsen and Bang both shared an enthusiasm for radio, which at the time was in its infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svend Andreas Grøn Olufsen|url=http://www.gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=svendolufsen|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bang returned from a trip to the United States, he and Olufsen began running experiments in Olufsen's family manor, Quistrop, in [[Struer, Denmark]]. Their company, Bang &amp; Olufsen, was formally established on 17 November 1925, with Olufsen primarily focusing on the business aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bang &amp; Olufsen – A Short History – The First 25 Years|url=http://www.beoworld.org/article_view.asp?id=30|work=BeoWorld: Everything Bang &amp; Olufsen|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Olufsen's mother, Anna, helped fund the company through the sale of their family's eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svend Andreas Grøn Olufsen|url=http://www.gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=svendolufsen|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first commercially viable product came in 1927 with the production of a radio that could connect to [[alternating current]], rather than be battery-powered.

{{Main|Terrorism}}
{{terrorism}}
'''Terrorism financing''' refers to activities that provide financing or financial support to individual [[terrorist]]s or [[non-state actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Weapons of War, Minnesota Law Review (2016), available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2765010&lt;/ref&gt;  A government that maintains a list of terrorist organizations normally will also pass laws to prevent [[money laundering]] being used to finance those organizations.

Laws against money laundering and terror financing are used around the world. In the [[United States]], the [[Patriot Act]] was passed after the [[September 11 attacks]], giving the government [[anti-money laundering]] powers to monitor financial institutions. The Patriot Act has generated a [[USA PATRIOT Act#Controversy|great deal of controversy]] in the United States since its enactment. The United States has also collaborated with the United Nations and other countries to create the [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/eu-ups-its-fight-against-terrorist-financing/a-18903083|title=EU ups its fight against terrorist financing|work=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/tftp/index_en.htm|title=DGs - Migration and Home Affairs - What we do - ...Crisis &amp; Terrorism - Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws created attempted to thwart the financing of [[terrorism]] (CFT) and money laundering. Initially the focus of CFT efforts was on non-profit organizations, unregistered [[money services business]]es (MSBs) (including so called underground banking or ‘[[Hawala]]s’) and the criminalisation of the act itself. The [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) made nine special recommendations for CFT (first eight then a year later added a ninth). These nine recommendations have become the global standard for CFT and their effectiveness is assessed almost always in conjunction with anti-money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org|title=FATF-GAFI.ORG - Financial Action Task Force (FATF)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FATF Blacklist]] (the NCCT list) mechanism was used to coerce countries to bring about change.

== Money laundering ==
{{Main|Money laundering}}
Often linked in legislation and regulation, terrorism financing and money laundering are conceptual opposites. Money laundering is the process where cash raised from criminal activities is made to look legitimate for re-integration into the financial system, whereas terrorism financing cares little about the source of the funds, but it is what the funds are to be used for that defines its scope.

An in-depth study of the symbiotic relationship between [[organised crime in the United States|organised crime]] and terrorist organizations detected within the United States of America and other areas of the world referred to as crime-terror nexus points has been published in the forensic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Perri, Frank S., Lichtenwald, Terrance G., and MacKenzie, Paula M. (2009). [http://www.all-about-psychology.com/support-files/crime-terror-nexus.pdf Evil Twins: The Crime-Terror Nexus]. Forensic Examiner, 16-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makarenko|first=T|title=The Crime-Terror Continuum: Tracing the Interplay between Transnational Organized|journal=Global crime|volume=6|issue=1|pages=129－145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makarenko|first=T|title=Crime, Terror, and the Central Asian Drug Trade|journal=Harvard Asia Quarterly|year=2002|volume=6|issue=3|pages=1－24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makarenko|first=T|title=A model of terrorist-criminal relations|journal=Jane's Intelligence Review|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Peng|title=The Crime-Terror Nexus: Transformation, Alliance, Convergence|journal=Asian Social Science|year=2010|volume=6|issue=6|pages=11–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornell|first=S|title=The narcotics threat in greater Central Asia: from crime-terror nexus to state infiltration?|journal=China and Eurasia Forum Quarterly|year=2006|volume=4|issue=1|pages=37–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Perri, Lichtenwald and MacKenzie article emphasizes the importance of multi-agency working groups and the tools that can be used to identify, infiltrate, and dismantle organizations operating along the crime-terror nexus points.

Terrorists use low value but high volume fraud activity to fund their operations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Paramilitary groups{{which|date=May 2013}} in [[Northern Ireland]] are using{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} legitimate businesses such as hotels, pubs and taxi operators to launder money and fund political activities. Even beyond Ireland, terrorists are buying out/controlling front-end businesses especially cash-intensive businesses including in some cases money services businesses to move monies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Bulk cash smuggling and placement through cash-intensive businesses is one typology. They are now also moving monies through the new online payment systems. They also use trade linked schemes to launder monies. Nonetheless, the older systems have not given way. Terrorists also continue to move monies through MSBs/[[Hawala]]s, and through international ATM transactions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Charities also continue to be used in countries where controls are not so stringent.

== Suspicious activity ==
[[Operation Green Quest]], a US multi-agency task force established in October 2001 with the official purpose of countering terrorism financing considers the following patterns of activity as indicators of the collection and movement of funds that could be associated with terrorism financing:

* Account transactions that are inconsistent with past deposits or withdrawals such as cash, [[cheque]]s, [[wire transfer]]s, etc.
* Transactions involving a high volume of incoming or outgoing wire transfers, with no logical or apparent purpose that come from, go to, or transit through locations of concern, that is sanctioned countries, non-cooperative nations and sympathizer nations.
* Unexplainable clearing or negotiation of third party cheques and their deposits in foreign bank accounts.
* Structuring at multiple branches or the same branch with multiple activities.
* Corporate layering, transfers between bank accounts of related entities or charities for no apparent reasons.
* Wire transfers by charitable organisations to companies located in countries known to be bank or [[tax haven]]s.
* Lack of apparent [[Fundraising|fund raising]] activity, for example a lack of small cheques or typical donations associated with charitable bank deposits.
* Using multiple accounts to collect funds that are then transferred to the same foreign beneficiaries
* Transactions with no logical economic purpose, that is, no link between the activity of the organization and other parties involved in the transaction.
* Overlapping corporate officers, bank signatories, or other identifiable similarities associated with addresses, references and financial activities.
* Cash debiting schemes in which deposits in the US correlate directly with ATM withdrawals in countries of concern. Reverse transactions of this nature are also suspicious.
* Issuing cheques, money orders or other [[financial instruments]], often numbered sequentially, to the same person or business, or to a person or business whose name is spelled similarly.

It would be difficult to determine by such activity alone whether the particular act was related to terrorism or to [[organized crime]]. For this reason, these activities must be examined in context with other factors in order to determine a terrorism financing connection. Simple transactions can be found to be suspect and money laundering derived from terrorism will typically involve instances in which simple operations had been performed (retail [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] operations, international transfer of funds) revealing links with other countries including FATF blacklisted countries. Some of the customers may have [[Criminal record|police records]], particularly for trafficking in narcotics and weapons and may be linked with foreign terrorist groups. The funds may have moved through a [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|state sponsor of terrorism]] or a country where there is a terrorism problem. A link with a [[Politically exposed person]] (PEP) may ultimately link up to a terrorism financing transaction. A charity may be a link in the transaction. Accounts (especially student) that only receive periodic deposits withdrawn via ATM over two months and are dormant at other periods could indicate that they are becoming active to prepare for an attack.

==Germany==
In July 2010, [[Germany]] outlawed the [[Internationale Humanitäre Hilfsorganisation e.V.|Internationale Humanitäre Hilfsorganisation]] (IHH), saying it has used donations to support projects in Gaza that are related to [[Hamas]], which is considered by the European Union to be a terrorist organization,&lt;ref name="Hilfsorganisation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3918670,00.html|title=Germany bans group accused of Hamas links|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IHH"/&gt; while presenting their activities to donors as humanitarian help. German Interior Minister [[Thomas de Maiziere]] said, "[[Donations]] to so-called social welfare groups belonging to Hamas, such as the millions given by IHH, actually support the terror organization Hamas as a whole." &lt;ref name="Hilfsorganisation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IHH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/germany-outlaws-ihh-over-claimed-hamas-links-1.301483|title=Germany Outlaws Charity Over Alleged Hamas Links|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In 2009, an investigation carried out by the [[Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre]] (AUSTRAC) and other agencies, determined that funds were being sent from Australia for use by the Somalia-based terrorist group, [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]]. Money was remitted, with false names used to obscure the money trail. This investigation lead to the ultimate arrest of the suspects on charges of conspiring to commit a terrorist attack on an [[Holsworthy Barracks terror plot|Australian army base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/book/export/html/508  |title=Case studies - Remittance services (money transfers): Case 21 – Australian terror suspects sent funds to Somalia to support terrorist group |work=[[AUSTRAC]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2014, Australian authorities feared that money being transferred from Australia could be used for [[terrorism in Somalia]]. In 2015 Australian banks ceased providing money-transfer facilities to Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-17/somali-australians-plead-with-westpac-to-not-close/5822138  |title=Somali Australians plead with Westpac to not close remittance accounts |author=McGrath, Pat|date=17 October 2014|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/westpac-to-stop-somali-money-transfers-on-march-31/story-fngnvlxu-1227281376048  |title=Westpac to stop Somali money transfers on March 31 |author=Armitage, Laura|date=30 March 2015|work=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Tjong was born under the name Tjong Fung Nam (spelled in Hakka Chinese, {{zh|first=t|t={{linktext|張|鴻|南}}|s={{linktext|张|鸿|南}}|p=''Zhāng Hóngnán''}}) from the [[Hakka]] lineage in [[Guangdong]] (formerly known as Canton) at year 1860. He was also known as Tjong Yiauw Hian, and later in his life finally known as Tjong A Fie (spelled in Hakka Chinese, {{zh|first=t|t={{linktext|張|阿|輝}}|s={{linktext|张|阿|辉}}|p=''Zhāng Āhūi''}}) .&lt;ref name="tujuh"/&gt;
 
He came from a poor family. With his brother, Tjong Yong Hian, Tjong left school and helped in running his father's shop. Although he only had a brief education, Tjong knew the ways of trading and made his family's business successful.&lt;ref name="tujuh"/&gt;

Tjong decided to travel to the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) to seek a better life. At 1875, Tjong A Fie came to [[Medan]] and decided to settle down. He was only 18 years old at that time. With little money, he decided to follow his brother, Tjong Yong Hian, who stayed in Medan for five years. At that time, his brother was already a notable leader in Medan.&lt;ref name="tujuh"/&gt;

== Prominence in Medan ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De menigte in een straat te Medan bij de Chinese begrafenisstoet van de op 4 februari 1921 overleden majoor Tjong A Fie TMnr 60043492.jpg|thumb|right|The crowd around [[Kesawan]] street during funeral procession of the deceased Major Tjong A Fie on February 4, 1921]]
Tjong was a prominent figure in the development of [[Medan]], as seen through the construction of various buildings utilized by the citizens of Medan past and present. These buildings include [[Tjong A Fie Mansion|Tjong A Fie's Mansion]], located in Ahmad Yani Street near the Kesawan area, the Old Mosque or sometimes known as Crooked Alley Mosque, and the clock tower of [[Medan City Hall]], which is located in the intersection between Radan Saleh Street and Kesawan.&lt;ref name="tujuh"/&gt;

At year 1911, Tjong was appointed as [[Kapitan Cina]] (Majoor der Chineezen) to lead the [[Tionghoa]] community in Medan, replacing his brother, Tjong Yong Hian. Tjong was a highly respected person; he was also a master of the economics and politics of Medan. His business kingdom covered banks, railroads, plantations, which included palm oil plants and sugar plants.&lt;ref name="tujuh"/&gt;

While he carried out his duties as a Kapitan, Tjong succeeded in developing his individual business and the city of Medan. One of those developments included building the Kesawan Bank as a forerunner for financial security in Medan. The construction of educational facilities, hospitals, houses of worship and other public facilities has made Tjong as an incredibly influential figure in Medan. These developmental projects were supported by the close relationship of Tjong with the [[Sultanate of Deli]], the ruler of the Land Deli (also known as Medan) at the time.&lt;ref name="tujuh"/&gt;

== Family and personal life ==
Back in [[China]], Tjong married a woman with the family name of [[Lee (Chinese surname)|Lee]]. Upon arriving in Medan, he married a lady named Chew from [[Penang]] and had three children, named Tjong Kong Liong, Tjong Jin Song and Tjong Kwei Jin. Mrs. Chew died a few years later for unknown reasons. There is no historical record of these three children after the death of Mrs. Chew. Tjong married again several years later to Lim Koei-Yap from [[Binjai]]. He had seven children from this marriage.&lt;ref name="tujuh"/&gt;

Several of Tjong's grandchildren and great grandchildren had grown up together in Medan.  After Tjong's demise and subsequent social instability in Indonesia, some of them moved overseas to countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Netherlands, USA, UK, Scotland and Belgium while a few stayed in Medan, Bali and Jakarta. They remain in close contact till today despite the distance.&lt;ref name="tujuh"/&gt;

Tjong's long-time residence is located at Kesawan Street, Medan. The mansion is an architectural mix of [[Malaysia|Malay]], [[Europe]]an, and [[Tionghoa]] styles and contains forty rooms, each lined with hand-painted floor tiles from Italy and the walls depicting life in China with great detail.&lt;ref name="tujuh"/&gt;

The Tjong A Fie Mansion consists of two floors with each floor having its own designation. The first floor consists of several important rooms, including the right side of the house reserved for ethnically Chinese guests only, while the left side of the house has a room reserved for the [[Sultan of Deli]] and his family or guests. The middle room on the ground floor is a reception room for guests—the room has a door ten meters tall and has a  Chinese-style wooden door handle. On the back of the ground floor, there are spaces for ancestral worship, private rooms, and Tjong's family room. The top floor of the building is used as a ball room or meeting room; there is also an altar facing the meeting room used as a means of worship by Tjong and his family.&lt;ref name="tujuh"/&gt;

The mansion has two doors, the entrance of which is facing the Ahmad Yani Street in Kesawan and the exit of which is facing the Red Cross Street. The mansion spatially segregated men and women where the right part of building was intended for men and the left for women. This division was not limited to Tjong and his family, but also to guests and workers who settled in the mansion.&lt;ref name="tujuh"/&gt;

Construction of the mansion was completed circa 1900. In 2000, it was included in the list of cultural heritage landmarks protected by legislation in the city of Medan. The mansion has been open to public since 18 June 2009 to commemorate Tjong A Fie's 150th birthday and has been a popular tourist spot.&lt;ref name="tujuh"/&gt;

'''Value measuring methodology''' (or VMM) is a tool that helps [[financial planner]]s balance both tangible and intangible values when making [[investment decisions]], and monitor benefits.

Formal methods to calculate the [[Return on investment]] (ROI) have been widely understood and used for a long time, but there was no easy and widely known way to provide a formal justification for decisions based on intangible values, which can include the reputation of an organization, the wellbeing of staff, or the impact on society or the environment at large.  It was particularly difficult for decision makers to work through the trade-offs between costs and intangible benefits, especially for long-term investments by commercial organizations, and for governments and non-profit organizations who are primarily concerned with intangible values without wasting limited funds.  Even within commercial organizations, units traditionally viewed as "cost centres" found it difficult to get acceptance of proposals for projects that would lead to general and long-term efficiency or capability gains, as the benefits were difficult to assign to "profit centres".

The approach of the VMM is to start by developing a framework of values, including costs, risks, tangible returns and intangible returns, then assign scores to each element in the framework.  Once the relative scores of the different types of values are assigned and agreed, it becomes possible to examine alternatives and give yes/no decisions in a fairly objective and repeatable manner, and review progress using a range of traditional quantitative program management techniques.  As well as allowing comparison of different values within a project, the quantitative approach of the VMM permits review of the total contribution to a particular value across a range of projects.

==History and Adoption==
VMM was developed by the General Services Administration's (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) in collaboration with Harvard University.  The VMM was first articulated in a report by [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] in 2002 for the US Social Security Administration, as part of an [[E-Services|electronic services]] project.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Remenyi (2006). ''Proceedings of the 13th European Conference on Information Technology Evaluation''. p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

It was popularized by a suite of documents released by the [[US Federal Chief Information Officers Council]] in 2003, which give detailed guidance to agencies helping them to seek funding and plan budgets for their proposals, analyze their investments for values across their portfolio of initiatives, and track both tangible and intangible returns over time, with a particular emphasis on information technology investments and the production of ''OMB-300'' exhibits for the [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb US Office of Management and Budget].  The introductory document&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cio.gov/documents/TheValueof_IT_Investments.pdf Introductory document]&lt;/ref&gt; was given the significant title ''It's Not Just Return on Investment Anymore''.

The suite of documents from the US CIO Council include the following, which are readily adapted for other countries and non-government organizations:&lt;ref&gt;Nagy K. Hanna (2010). ''Transforming Government and Building the Information Society''. p.288&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline of the steps in the VMM==
Each of the four major steps of the VMM process has tasks and outputs.  The breakdown below, and the description of major value factors, is based primarily on the suite of VMM documents from the [[US Federal Chief Information Officers Council]] in 2003.

===Develop a decision framework===
*Tasks
**Identify and define value structure
**Identify and define risk structure
**Identify and define cost structure
**Begin documentation
*Outputs
**Prioritized value factors
**Defined and prioritized measures within each value factor
**Initial risk factor inventory
**Risk tolerance boundary
**Tailored cost structure
**Initial documentation of basis of estimate of cost, value and risk

Forcing the development of the decision framework, with the assignment of scores to intangibles allowing comparison to other intangibles as well as tangibles, eases the resolution of differences of perspectives between senior managers (e.g. Chief Financial Officer, Risk Manager, and the proposer of the initiative), allows changes to the scores to flow through to the rest of the process (especially the analysis of alternatives), and provides clarity of benefits to a board (before, during, and after the initiative), and clarity of priorities to people looking after more detailed aspects of the initiative.  The same transparency of values apply if the proposal is developed at an enterprise level, or within a lesser organizational unit.

'''Major value factors''' (from which the value hierarchy is developed) include the following
*direct customer value: benefits to customers/clients, e.g. convenient access, product enhancement
*social: benefits to society as a whole, e.g. reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions
*operational: better operations and lowering barriers to future initiatives, e.g. improved infrastructure
*strategic: contributions to strategic initiatives and fulfilling the mission of the organization
*financial: financial benefits, including increased revenue, decreased costs, and cost avoidance

===Analyze alternatives===
*Tasks
**Identify and define alternatives
**Estimate value and cost
**Conduct risk analysis
**Ongoing documentation
*Outputs
**Viable alternatives for solutions
**Cost and value analyses
**Risk analyses
**Tailored basis of estimate documenting value, cost, and risk, economic factors and assumptions

===Pull the information together===
*Tasks
**Aggregate the cost estimate
**Calculate the return on investment
**Calculate the value score
**Calculate the risk score
**Compare value, cost, and risk
*Outputs
**Cost estimate
**ROI metrics
**Value score
**Risk scores (cost and value)
**Comparison of cost, value and risk

===Communicate and document===
*Tasks
**Communicate value to customers and stakeholders
**Prepare budget justification document
**Satisfy ad hoc reporting requirement
**Use lessons learned to improve processes
*Outputs
**Documentation, insight and support:
***To develop results-based management controls
***For enterprise budget reporting and analysis
***To communicative initiative value
***For improving decision making and performance measurement through "lessons learned"
**Change and ad hoc reporting requirements

==Uses in Capital Investment Planning==
A holistic approach to Capital Investment Planning (CIP), using the portfolio approach, requires a significant amount of supporting documentation.  The VMM approach can provide planning data and performance assessment criteria for the following:

*Summary of spending
*Project description and justification
*Performance goals and measures
*Alternatives analysis
*Risk inventory and assessment
*Program management (partial)
*Acquisition strategy (partial)
*Project and funding plan (partial)
*Business case criteria (partial)

In particular, VMM allows quantitative reporting of commitments to particular intangibles across a number of initiatives, even when they differ by their stage in their lifecycles.

The [[United States|American]] '''Widener family''' of [[Peter Arrell Brown Widener]] (1834&amp;ndash;1915) and his wife Hannah Josephine Dunton (1836&amp;ndash;1896) were from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and were one of the wealthiest families in the United States. In 1883 Widener was part of the founding partnership of the [[Philadelphia Traction Company]] and used the great wealth accumulated from that business to become a founding organizer of [[U.S. Steel]] and the [[American Tobacco Company]].{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}

The legacy of Peter and Hannah Widener includes the [[Widener Library]] at [[Harvard University]] but even more important was the implanting of a social conscience in their children that has been passed down from generation to generation. While the family fortune dwindled over time through [[Estate tax in the United States|estate taxes]] and the natural division and redivision by inheritors, many of their 21st century descendants continue to be involved in charitable works. [[Widener University]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], is named after the Wideners as a result of a very large contribution the family made when the college was transitioning from an all-male military college to a co-educational civilian university.{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}

Peter and Hannah Widener built [[Lynnewood Hall]] in [[Elkins Park, Pennsylvania]], a 110-room [[Georgian architecture|Georgian-style]] mansion designed by [[Horace Trumbauer]] where they assembled one of the most valuable [[art]] collections in the country. Left a vast fortune, their offspring became one of the most prominent factors in American [[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred horse racing]] history as well as founding benefactors of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Widener University]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], and the [[Widener School for Crippled Children]].{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}
