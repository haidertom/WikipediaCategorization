{{wikinews|Two people killed in apparent murder-suicide at UCLA}}
On June 1, 2016, two men were killed in a [[Murder–suicide|murder-suicide]] at an engineering building at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). The gunman was identified as Indian-born 38-year-old former UCLA [[Ph.D]] student, Mainak Sarkar. The victim was William Scott Klug, an associate professor who was Sarkar's thesis adviser while Sarkar was a student at UCLA. A woman, later identified as Sarkar's estranged wife, was found dead in [[Minnesota]] during the subsequent investigation into the shooting, and is suspected to have been killed by Sarkar before the UCLA shooting.

==Details==
[[Image:UCLA Engr IV Bldg.jpg|thumb|right|Engineering IV, the building where the shooting occurred.]]
The shooting occurred at a fourth-floor office in Engineering IV, a building that is part of the [[UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science]].&lt;ref name="bhcouriertwodeadinapparentjune1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Dead In Apparent Murder-Suicide Shooting At UCLA|url=http://bhcourier.com/two-dead-in-murder-suicide-shooting-at-ucla/|accessdate=June 1, 2016|work=The Beverly Hills Courier|date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ChuckBlankstein&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/ucla-gunman-mainak-sarkar-had-kill-list-may-have-slayed-n584616|title=UCLA Gunman Mainak Sarkar Had Kill 'List,' May Have Killed Minnesota Woman: LAPD|work=NBC News|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016|first=Elizabeth|last=Chuck|first2=Andrew|last2=Blankstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the shooting, Christopher Lynch, an aerospace and mechanical engineering professor who heard the gunshots, went to Klug's office.&lt;ref name=LATimes.Quick&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ln-ucla-shooting-account-klug-sarkar-20160603-snap-story.html|title=Quick action by professors kept UCLA gunman from escape and potentially shooting more people|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=June 4, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016|first=Teresa|last=Watanabe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held the door shut, after which he heard another shot and then silence. Another professor said she heard someone fall after the last shot. Lynch later said that he did not feel the gunman try to open it but suspected the gunman heard yells for the hallway to be cleared out and that police were called in. Lynch was credited for potentially saving lives during the shooting.&lt;ref name=LATimes.Quick/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS.Quick&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ucla-shooting-professor-william-klugs-office-door-mainak-sarkar-los-angeles/|title=UCLA prof's quick thinking hailed for saving lives during shooting|work=CBS News|date=June 4, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyBruin.Recount&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailybruin.com/2016/06/08/faculty-recount-events-at-engineering-building-the-day-of-ucla-shooting/|title=Faculty recount events at engineering building the day of UCLA shooting|work=Daily Bruin|date=June 8, 2016|accessdate=June 9, 2016|first=Angie|last=Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A campus-wide alert to avoid the area was issued via UCLA's BruinAlert system at 9:49&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Daylight Time|PDT]],&lt;ref name=Tweet1&gt;{{cite tweet|user=UCLABruinAlert|author=UCLA BruinAlert|number=738049937326252032|date=1 June 2016|title=BruinAlert: Police Activity vic Engineering Building 4.

Two [[handgun]]s and a suicide note were found near the two bodies.&lt;ref name="bhcouriertwodeadinapparentjune1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MargolinSoneKeneally&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/ucla-student-killed-professor-kill-list/story?id=39554492|title=Ex-UCLA Student Tied to Another Fatality Before Campus Shooting|work=ABC News|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016|first=Josh|last=Margolin|first2=Julie|last2=Sone|first3=Meghan|last3=Keneally}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the shooting, police sources told ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' that from the appearance of the bodies, a student may have killed a professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-ucla-shooting-live-updates-htmlstory.html|title=UCLA shooting updates: Shooter's UCLA note leads police to "kill list"|last=Winton|first=Richard|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 1, 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least three shots were fired in the shooting.&lt;ref name=ChuckBlanksteinCarrero/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Based on initial reports of the shooting, authorities mistook it as an attempted [[mass shooting]], prompting a massive police response.&lt;ref name=APAL/&gt; School officials put the campus on [[lockdown]] as hundreds of UCLA and LAPD officers, including [[SWAT]] officers, and officers of other agencies searched the area.&lt;ref name=APAL/&gt;&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|title=2 killed in UCLA shooting, campus on lockdown|url=https://www.rt.com/usa/345098-active-shooter-ucla-victims/|publisher=Russia Today|date=June 1, 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yan|first1=Holly|last2=Bloom|first2=Deborah|last3=Mossburg|first3=Cheri|title=UCLA shooting: Murder-suicide occurs on campus|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/01/us/ucla-shooting-report/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=June 1, 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nearby hospital and three elementary schools were also put on lockdown. When the lockdown was lifted just after noon ([[Pacific Time Zone|PDT]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=UCLABruinAlert|author=UCLA BruinAlert|number=738087056061042689|date=1 June 2016|title=Lockdown lifted  All Clear  Check for details|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; classes at UCLA were canceled for the day.&lt;ref name=ChuckBlanksteinCarrero/&gt; An apartment traced to the gunman was searched by police, and a description of his vehicle, which had not been located, was released.&lt;ref name=ShoichetBerlingerChan/&gt;&lt;ref name=BloomPascucci&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ktla.com/2016/06/03/car-matching-description-plate-of-suspected-ucla-shooter-found-in-culver-city-video/|title=UCLA Shooter’s Car Found in Culver City; Bomb Squad Called: LAPD|work=KTLA|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2016|first=Tracy|last=Bloom|first2=Christina|last2=Pascucci}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WalshXiong&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/woman-shot-dead-in-brooklyn-park-death-linked-to-ucla-shooting/381659331/#1|title=Killing in Twin Cities linked to UCLA shooting|work=Star-Tribune|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016|first=Paul|last=Walsh|first2=Chao|last2=Xiong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the school was in lockdown, people at many locations found it difficult to shelter in place, as few of the doors had locks for events of this nature. As a result, some students resorted to creative mechanisms to keep the doors closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/ucla-students-on-active-shooter-lockdown-are-engineerin-1779897413|title=UCLA Students on Active Shooter Lockdown Are Engineering the Hell Out of Doors Without Locks|first=Matt|last=Novak|publisher=Gizmodo|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Waugh, the school's executive vice-chancellor and provost, said the University will review its [[Active shooter|active-shooter]] protocols.&lt;ref name=SvrlugaBerman/&gt; The issue was previously brought up during deadly mass shootings at [[Virginia Tech shooting|Virginia Tech]] and [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook Elementary School]], where students and teachers also had to improvise to keep the doors to classrooms closed. Although some schools across the country installed locks to doors, a more widespread adoption of this security measure was hindered by "the cost to retrofit doors and local fire codes that require doors to open in one motion during emergencies", according to experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ucla-shooting-renews-concerns-classrooms-locks-39609955|title=UCLA Shooting Renews Concerns About Classrooms With No Locks|publisher=ABC News|agency=Associated Press|date=June 4, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016|first=Christine|last=Armario}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools and universities disagreed about the importance of door locks during active-shooter situations; the [[University of Colorado]] stated that it wanted students and teachers to rely on training instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_30001959/locks-all-classroom-doors-ucla-shooting-raises-concerns|title=

U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] was briefed about the shooting aboard [[Air Force One]], according to [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Josh Earnest]].&lt;ref name=ChuckBlanksteinCarrero/&gt;

On June 3, two days after the shooting, the gunman's car was discovered by a bicyclist, parked in a residential area in [[Culver City, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/03/us/ucla-shooting/|title=UCLA shooting: Gunman's car found near Los Angeles|work=CNN|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2016|first=Catherine E.|last=Shoichet|first2=Joshua|last2=Berlinger|first3=Stella|last3=Chan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KPCC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/06/03/61303/police-ucla-assailant-s-car-found-in-culver-city/|title=UCLA shooting update: Gun used in Minnesota, UCLA shootings appears to be the same|work=KPCC|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; located about six miles southeast of the UCLA campus. It contained multiple containers of gasoline and an additional handgun. Police theorized that the containers were used to refuel the car during the gunman's drive from Minnesota to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=BloomPascucci/&gt; They also theorized that the gunman parked in Culver City, where he had lived at one time, and took a bus that he regularly used to get to UCLA during his attendance there. A bus transfer was found on his body.&lt;ref name=KPCC/&gt;

On June 8, a week after the shooting, UCLA announced the launch of a task force that will review the university's response to the incident, as well as a security analysis of the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-shooting-university-idUSKCN0YU0AB|title=UCLA to launch task force and investigation into campus shooting|work=Reuters|date=June 8, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2016|first=Sharon|last=Bernstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/06/09/ucla-launches-task-force-on-campus-safety-after-shooting/|title=UCLA Launches Task Force On Campus Safety After Shooting|work=CBS Los Angeles|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task force would later recommend "more frequent staff and student emergency-response training, more wardens to conduct emergency drills and a requirement that all faculty, staff and students provide cellphone numbers to the school so they could receive emergency-alert text messages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ohio-state-attack-prompts-colleges-to-review-emergency-response-plans-1480605230|title=Ohio State Attack Prompts Colleges to Review Emergency-Response Plans|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=December 1, 2016|accessdate=December 1, 2016|first1=Melissa|last1=Korn|first2=Kris|last2=Maher|first3=Douglas|last3=Belkin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, on June 10, UCLA students and campus leaders also called for more research into the increase of gun violence in American schools, and announced its intention to create the UCLA Institute on Campus Violence. It will be a research center that would "utilize the university’s research and public service capacity to study strategies to combat campus violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20160610/ucla-students-plan-institute-on-gun-violence-dedicated-to-shooting-victim-william-klug|title=UCLA students plan institute on gun violence dedicated to shooting victim William Klug|work=Los Angeles Daily News|date=June 10, 2016|accessdate=June 11, 2016|first=Joshua|last=Cain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal background===
Sarkar was born and raised in [[Durgapur]], a city in the state of [[West Bengal]], India. In 1984, he enrolled in [[St. Michael's School, Durgapur|St. Michael's School]], a local [[Mixed-sex education|co-education]], [[English-medium education|English-medium]] school. A schoolteacher working there described Sarkar as "an ordinary boy. Very quiet. Extremely well behaved and obedient. Never causing any trouble to anyone." The teacher also said that Sarkar left the school to attend the nearby Durgapur Bidhan Chandra Institute. From 2000 to 2001, he worked for eighteen months as a software developer at [[Infosys]] in [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/ucla-shooting-mainak-sarkar-remembered-as-good-student-in-his-hometown-2833413/|title=UCLA shooter Mainak Sarkar remembered as ‘good student’ in his hometown of Durgapur|work=The Indian Express|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2016|first=Esha|last=Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to sources and his now-deactivated [[LinkedIn]] profile, Sarkar graduated from the [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]] in [[West Bengal]], India, in 2000 with an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering. He then traveled to the U.S. in 2001 on a [[Visa (document)|student visa]] to pursue graduate studies. He first attended [[Stanford University]] from 2003 to 2005, graduating with a master's degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering. Sarkar then attended UCLA's engineering school from the fall of 2007 to the summer of 2013, graduating with a Ph.D degree in [[solid mechanics]].&lt;ref name=ChuckBlankstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=MargolinSoneKeneally/&gt;&lt;ref name=MatherWintonRochaWatanabe/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kharagpur"&gt;{{cite news|title=IIT alumnus, disgruntled student: Who is UCLA gunman Mainak Sarkar?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world/iit-alumni-disgruntled-student-who-is-ucla-gunman-mainak-sarkar/story-dyCATG886H8rsgXWhfWrEM.html|accessdate=June 2, 2016|publisher=Hindustan Times|date=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/what-we-know-about-mainak-sarkar-ucla-shooter/381683701/|title=What we know about Mainak Sarkar, UCLA shooter|work=The Star-Tribune|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MatherWintonWatanabeHamilton2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ucla-shooting-20160602-snap-story.html|title=An allegation of academic theft at heart of UCLA shooting|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016|first=Kate|last=Mather|first2=Richard|last2=Winton|first3=Teresa|last3=Watanabe|first4=Matt|last4=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2016/06/03/what-we-know-about-ucla-shooter-mainak-sarkar/|title=What we know about UCLA shooter Mainak Sarkar|work=Twin Cities Pioneer Press|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professors at UCLA described him as a "quiet and reserved" man who would not greet them whenever he passed by, and stated that he left "little impression" in their classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/ucla-gunman-mainak-sarkar-did-not-impress-in-class-indian-origin-professor-1415673|title=UCLA Gunman Mainak Sarkar Did Not Impress In Class: Indian-Origin Professor|work=NDTV|date=June 5, 2016|accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point after his relocation to the U.S., Sarkar briefly worked as a research assistant at the [[University of Texas at Arlington]] and as a software developer. After graduating from UCLA, he had been employed remotely as an engineering analyst for a rubber company in [[Ohio]]. In August 2014, he left his job, according to a former coworker.&lt;ref name=MatherWintonRochaWatanabe/&gt;&lt;ref name=MatherWintonWatanabeHamilton2/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBTMindock/&gt;

===Relationship with victims===
Sarkar maintained a personal blog called "''thelongdarktunnel''", which has since been deleted.&lt;ref name=ChuckBlanksteinCarrero/&gt; For months, he had been making hostile comments about Klug on social media, according to ''The Los Angeles Times''.

Police found a "kill list" at Sarkar's home in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], which named Hasti and Klug as well as another UCLA professor who remains unidentified but is stated to be "alright" by a police official.&lt;ref name=ChuckBlankstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=WalshXiong/&gt;&lt;ref name=MatherWintonRochaWatanabe/&gt; This professor, who had been aware of Sarkar's issues with him, was later confirmed to have been off-campus at the time of the shooting.&lt;ref name=MargolinSoneKeneally/&gt;

===Weapons===
After killing Hasti, Sarkar is believed by police to have equipped himself with two legally-purchased [[handgun]]s, along with several rounds of ammunition and [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]], and driven from his home to Los Angeles to commit Klug's murder.&lt;ref name=ChuckBlankstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=MargolinSoneKeneally/&gt;&lt;ref name=WalshXiong/&gt; A police official said of his weaponry, "He was certainly prepared to engage multiple victims".&lt;ref name=NYPostLi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2016/06/02/woman-on-ucla-shooters-kill-list-found-dead-in-minnesota/|title=Woman on UCLA shooter’s ‘kill list’ found dead in Minnesota|work=New York Post|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016|first=David K.|last=Li}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ballistic tests indicated Klug and Hasti were both killed by the same handgun. A search of Sarkar's Minnesota apartment recovered more ammunition and a ballistic vest, alongside other items.&lt;ref name=KPCC/&gt;

==Reactions==
Klug was memorialized in a tweet posted by [[Lieutenant Governor of California|California Lieutenant Governor]] [[Gavin Newsom]], who called him an "empathetic, brilliant teacher."&lt;ref name=NBCChuck&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/slain-ucla-professor-william-klug-was-father-two-brilliant-teacher-n584496|title=Slain UCLA Professor William Klug Was a Father of Two, 'Brilliant' Teacher|work=NBC News|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 2, 2016|first=Elizabeth|last=Chuck}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day after the shooting, UCLA hosted a candlelight vigil, attended by hundreds, including the Mayor of Los Angeles, [[Eric Garcetti]].&lt;ref name="ktlavigil"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hawkins|first1=Kirk|title=L.A.

Media outlets in India noted some similarities between Sarkar's killings and a 1969 murder case at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where student [[Tarasoff v.

'''''Aftermath''''' is a 1994 Spanish [[Horror film|horror]] [[short film]] written and directed by [[Nacho Cerdà]]. Containing no spoken dialogue, ''Aftermath'' is the second installment in a trilogy of shorts by Cerdà, preceded by 1990's ''The Awakening'', and followed by 1998's ''Genesis''.

== Plot ==

A woman named Marta Arnau Marti dies in a car crash, after accidentally running over a dog. An orderly wheels Marta's body into a morgue drawer, past a mourning couple, who a nurse gives a crucifix necklace. The orderly overhears two workers [[autopsy]]ing a pair of male bodies, looks in on them out of curiosity, and leaves when one of the morticians (who is disturbingly enthused by his duties) glares at him. The morticians complete their work on the dead men, and while one leaves, the other remains, and brings in Marta's body.

Aroused by Marta, the mortician locks himself in the morgue with her body, undresses it, removes the brain, and caresses it with a knife, which he uses to mutilate Marta's vagina, and cut open her torso. The mortician masturbates to orgasm while fondling Marta's breasts and innards, then takes photographs of his handiwork. Unable to contain his lust any longer, the mortician engages in [[necrophilia]], after setting his camera on automatic to record the event.

Afterward, the mortician autopsies Marta, cleans up, and leaves. In his home, the pajama-clad mortician blends Marta's stolen heart into a pulp, which he gives to his dog before proceeding to relax in his sitting room. As a baby's cries emanate from the television, the scraps of newspaper the dog is eating the heart off of are shown to contain Marta's obituary.

== Reception ==

[[Dread Central]] wrote, "It is intense. It is unflinching. Yet, at its core it is subtle, hauntingly beautiful, and every bit as rich in detail and composition as any other great film has ever been."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/aftermathgenesis-dvd#axzz2mn0d29Kz|title = ''Aftermath/Genesis'' (DVD)|last = Bostaph|first = D. W.|work = [[Dread Central]]|date = 24 August 2005|accessdate = 7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DVD Talk]] awarded four and a half out of five stars and wrote, "The necrophilia in this movie is very disturbing. It is not just carnal; it is filled with volatility and extreme violence. While nothing is shown outright, the implication is repellent enough. Indeed, one could argue that Cerdà is making a larger point about defying death. But it's a hard sell. Treating the departed as nothing more than a plaything for the fulfillment of one's most twisted desires almost erases any grander theme. While the ending is quite unnerving, the rest of ''Aftermath'' is an equally uneasy ordeal. You may see nothing more in it than [[fetishism]] gone foul, however. Or you may see something very insightful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/17184/aftermath-genesis/|title = ''Aftermath/Genesis''|last = Gibron|first = Bill|work = [[DVD Talk]]|date = 23 August 2005|accessdate = 7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bloody Disgusting]] rated it four and half out of five stars and wrote, "Aftermath, is definitely one of the most controversial films of the last couple of decades. Its ruthless and realistic depiction of grisly autopsies and a sinister surgeon with an inclination towards violent necrophilia has some of the hardest scenes to stomach in any horror movie, period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/109542/aftermathgenesis-v-2/|title=Aftermath/Genesis (V)|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Allegory of Wealth''''' is a c.1630-1635 painting by the French Baroque artist [[Simon Vouet]]. ''Allegory of Wealth'' is its traditional title, though [[Nicolas Milovanovic]] argues that it should instead be entitled ''Allegory of Contempt for Wealth'' and the [[Louvre]] (where it now hangs) entitles it ''Allegory of Faith and of Contempt for Wealth''

Probably painted for [[Louis XIII]]'s château at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], it is first mentioned in the French royal collection inventories early in the 18th century as ''Victory crowned with laurels holding in her arms an infant with a sash and an infant holding bracelets and precious stones''. Frédéric Villot entitled it ''La Richesse'' in the mid 19th century and this title was not contested until 2015.

In the [[Roman funerals and burial|burial practices of ancient Rome]] and [[Roman funerary art]], marble and limestone [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] elaborately carved in [[relief]] were characteristic of elite [[inhumation]] burials from the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zahra Newby]]. "Myth and Death: Roman Mythological Sarcophagi" in ''A Companion to Greek Mythology'' (Blackwell, 2011), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; At least 10,000 Roman sarcophagi have survived, with fragments possibly representing as many as 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jas Elsner|Jaś Elsner]], introduction to ''Life, Death and Representation: Some New Work on Roman Sarcophagi'' (De Gruyter, 2011), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although  [[classical mythology|mythological scenes]] have been mostly widely studied,&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, introduction to ''Life, Death and Representation'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; sarcophagus [[relief]] has been called the "richest single source of Roman iconography,"&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, introduction to ''Life, Death and Representation'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and may also depict the deceased's occupation or life course, military scenes, and other subject matter. The same workshops produced sarcophagi with Jewish or Christian imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, introduction to ''Life, Death and Representation'', pp. 1, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Early Christian sarcophagi]] produced from the late 3rd century onwards, represent the earliest form of large Christian sculpture, and are important for the study of [[Early Christian art]].

They were mostly made in a few major cities, including Rome and [[Athens]], which exported them to other cities. Elsewhere the [[stela]] gravestone remained more common.  They were always a very expensive form reserved for the elite, and especially so in the relatively few very elaborately carved examples; most were always relatively plain, with inscriptions, or symbols such as garlands.  Sarcophagi divide into a number of styles, by the producing area. "Roman" ones were made to rest against a wall, and one side was left uncarved, while "Attic" and other types were carved on all four sides; but the short sides were generally less elaborately decorated in both types.&lt;ref name="Hennig, 93-94"&gt;Hennig, 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The time taken to make them encouraged the use of standard subjects, to which inscriptions might be added to personalize them, and  portraits of the deceased were slow to appear.  The sarcophagi offer examples of intricate reliefs that depict scenes often based on [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]] or [[mystery religions]] that offered personal salvation, and [[allegory|allegorical]] representations. Roman [[funerary art]] also offers a variety of scenes from everyday life, such as game-playing, hunting, and military endeavors.&lt;ref name="Hennig, 93-94"/&gt;  [[Early Christian art]] quickly adopted the sarcophagus, and they are the most common form of early Christian sculpture, progressing from simple examples with symbols to elaborate fronts, often with small scenes of the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] in two rows within an architectural framework. The [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] (c. 359) is of this type, and the earlier [[Dogmatic Sarcophagus]] rather simpler. The huge [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[Sarcophagi of Helena and Constantina]] are grand Imperial examples.

[[Cremation]] was the predominant means of disposing of remains in the [[Roman Republic]]. Ashes contained in [[cinerary urn]]s and other monumental vessels were placed in tombs. From the 2nd century AD onward, [[inhumation]] became more common, and after the [[Roman Empire]] came under Christian rule, was standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;Glenys Davies, "Before Sarcophagi," in ''Life, Death and Representation,'' p. 20ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Sarcophagus of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]] is a rare example from much earlier.  A sarcophagus, which means "flesh-eater" in Greek, is a stone coffin used for inhumation burials.&lt;ref name="Awan"&gt;{{harvp|Awan|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarcophagi were commissioned not only for the elite of Roman society (mature male citizens),&lt;ref name="Davies_47"&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also for children, entire families, and beloved wives and mothers. The most expensive sarcophagi were made from marble, but other stones, lead, and wood were used as well.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; Along with the range in production material, there existed a variety of styles and shapes, depending on where the sarcophagus was produced and whom it was produced for.

==History==

===Before sarcophagi===
Inhumation burial practices and the use of sarcophagi were not always the favored Roman funerary custom. The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]s and Greeks used sarcophagi for centuries before the Romans finally adopted the practice in the second century.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; Prior to that period, the dead were usually cremated and placed in marble ash chests or ash altars, or were simply commemorated with a grave altar that was not designed to hold cremated remains. Despite being the main funerary custom during the Roman Republic, ash chests and grave altars virtually disappeared from the market only a century after the advent of the sarcophagus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often assumed that the popularity for sarcophagi began with the Roman aristocracy and gradually became more accepted by the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Davies_47"/&gt; However, in the past, the most expensive and ostentatious grave altars and ash chests were commissioned more frequently by wealthy freedmen and other members of the emerging middle class than by the Roman elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this fact and the lack of inscriptions on early sarcophagi, there is not enough evidence to make a judgment on whether or not the fashion for sarcophagi began with a specific social class. Surviving evidence does indicate that a great majority of early sarcophagi were used for children. This suggests that the change in burial practice may not have simply stemmed from a change in fashion, but perhaps from altered burial attitudes. It is possible that the decision to begin inhuming bodies occurred because families believed that inhumation was a kinder, and less disturbing burial rite than cremation, thus necessitating a shift in burial monument.&lt;ref name="Davies_47"/&gt;

===Stylistic transition from altars and ash chests to sarcophagi===
Although grave altars and ash chests virtually disappeared from the market in the second century, aspects of their decoration endured in some stylistic elements of sarcophagi. The largest stylistic group of early sarcophagi in the second century is garland sarcophagi, a custom of decoration that was previously used on ash chests and grave altars. Though the premise of the decoration is the same, there are some differences. The garland supports are often human figures instead of the animal heads used previously. In addition, specific mythological scenes fill the field, rather than small birds or other minor scenes. The inscription panel on garland ash altars and chests is also missing on garland sarcophagi. When a sarcophagus did have an inscription, it seemed to be an extra addition and usually ran along the top edge of the chest or between the decorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that early garland sarcophagi continued the tradition of grave altars with decorated garlands suggests that the customers and sculptors of sarcophagi had similar approaches to those who purchased and produced grave altars. Both monuments employed a similar collection of stylistic motifs with only subtle shifts in iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolitan Roman, Attic, and Asiatic sarcophagus production centers===
[[File:Roman - Sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysus - Walters 2331.jpg|thumbnail|The Sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysus is a good example of a Metropolitan Roman style sarcophagus with its flat lid, three-sided decoration, and Dionysian scenes from Greek mythology.]]
Sarcophagi production of the ancient Roman Empire involved three main parties: the customer, the sculpting workshop that carved the monument, and the quarry-based workshop that supplied the materials. The distance between these parties was highly variable due to the extensive size of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Russell|2010|pp=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan Roman, Attic, and Asiatic were the three major regional types of sarcophagi that dominated trade throughout the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; Although they were divided into regions, the production of sarcophagi was not as simple as it might appear. For example, Attic workshops were close to [[Mount Pentelikon]], the source of their materials, but were usually very far from their client. The opposite was true for the workshops of Metropolitan Rome, who tended to import large, roughed out sarcophagi from distant quarries in order to complete their commissions. Depending on distance and customer request (some customers might choose to have elements of their sarcophagi left unfinished until a future date, introducing the possibility of further work after the main commission), sarcophagi were in many different stages of production during transport. As a result, it is difficult to develop a standardized model of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Russell|2010|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metropolitan Rome====
Rome was the primary production center in the western part of the empire. A Metropolitan Roman sarcophagus often took the shape of a low rectangular box with a flat lid. As the sarcophagus was usually placed in a niche or against a wall in a mausoleum, they were usually only decorated on the front and two shorter sides. Many were decorated with carvings of garlands and fruits and leaves, as well as narrative scenes from Greek mythology. Battle and hunting scenes, biographical events from the life of the deceased, portrait busts, the profession of the deceased and abstract designs were also popular.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt;

====Attic====
[[File:Roman - Garland Sarcophagus - Walters 2329.jpg|thumb|Asiatic garland sarcophagus, the predominant type during the reigns of [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]] ''([[Walters Art Museum]])'',&lt;ref&gt;Davies, "Before Sarcophagi," in ''Life, Death and Representation,'' pp. 21, 28ff.&lt;/ref&gt; dated between 150 and 180, in Dokimeion marble, so probably made in Phrygia and then shipped to Rome. The gable-roof lid exemplifies the garland tradition common on ash altars and chests. It also has several incomplete parts on its four sides, suggesting the work was interrupted or it was needed on short notice.]]
Athens was the main production center for Attic style sarcophagi. These workshops mainly produced sarcophagi for export. They were rectangular in shape and were often decorated on all four sides, unlike the Metropolitan Roman style, with ornamental carvings along the bottom and upper edge of the monument. The lids were also different from the flat metropolitan Roman style and featured a pitched gable roof,&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; or a kline lid, which is carved in the style of couch cushions on which the form of the deceased reclines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Strong|Toynbee|1995|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority of these sarcophagi also featured mythological subjects, especially the [[Trojan War]], Achilles, and battles with the [[Amazons]].&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt;

====Asia Minor (Asiatic)====
The [[Dokimeion]] workshops in [[Phrygia]] specialized in architecturally formed large-scale Asiatic sarcophagi. Many featured a series of columns joined together by an entablature on all four sides with human figures in the area between the columns. The lids were often made in the gabled-roof design in order to complete the architectural-style sarcophagi so the coffin formed a sort of house or temple for the deceased. Other cities in Asia Minor produced sarcophagi of the garland tradition as well. In general, the sarcophagi were decorated on either three or four sides, depending on whether they were to be displayed on a pedestal in an open-air setting or against the walls inside tombs.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt;

===Myth and meaning on ancient Roman sarcophagi===
A transition from the classical garland and seasonal reliefs with smaller mythological figures to a greater focus on full mythological scenes began with the break up of the classical style in the late second century towards the end of [[Marcus Aurelius]]' reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift led to the development of popular themes and meanings portrayed through mythological scenes and allegories. The most popular mythological scenes on Roman sarcophagi functioned as aids to mourning, visions of life and happiness, and opportunities for self-portrayal for Roman citizens.

Images of [[Meleager]], the hero who slew the [[Calydonian Boar]], being mourned by his lover and hunting companion Atlanta, as well as images of [[Achilles]] mourning [[Patroclus]] were very common on sarcophagi that acted as grieving aids. In both cases, the mythological scenes were akin to mourning practices of ordinary Roman citizens in an effort to reflect their grief and comfort them when they visited the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=62–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playful images depicting [[Nereid]]s, Dionysiac triumphs, and love scenes of [[Dionysus]] and [[Ariadne]] were also commonly represented on sarcophagi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=128–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that these scenes of happiness and love in the face of death and mourning encouraged the living to enjoy life while they could, and reflected the celebration and meals that the mourners would later enjoy in the tomb when they returned to visit the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third century involved the return in popularity of self-representation on Roman sarcophagi.

There were several different ways Roman citizens approached self-representation on sarcophagi. Some sarcophagi had actual representations of the face or full figure of the deceased. In other cases, mythological portraits were used to connect characteristics of the deceased with traits of the hero or heroine portrayed. For example, common mythological portraits of deceased women identified them with women of lauded traits in myth, such as the devoted [[Selene]] or loyal [[Alcestis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=199–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes featuring the figures of Meleager and Achilles expressed bravery and were often produced on sarcophagi holding deceased men.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; Biographical scenes that emphasize the true virtues of Roman citizens were also used to commemorate the deceased. Scholars argue that these biographical scenes as well as the comparisons to mythological characters suggest that self-portrayal on Roman sarcophagi did not exist to celebrate the traits of the deceased, but rather to emphasize favored Roman cultural values&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrate that the family of the deceased were educated members of the elite that could understand difficult mythological allegories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third- and fourth-century sarcophagi===
The breakup of the classical style led to a period in which full mythological reliefs with an increase in the number of figures and an elongation of forms became more popular, as discussed above. The proportion of figures on the reliefs also became increasingly unbalanced, with the main figures taking up the greatest area with smaller figures crowded in the small pockets of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third century, another transition in theme and style of sarcophagi involved the return in popularity of representing mythological and non-mythological portraits of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagery of the four seasons also becomes popular during the third and fourth centuries. With the advent of Christianity in the third century, traditional motifs, like the seasons, remained, and images representing a belief in the afterlife appeared. The change in style brought by Christianity is perhaps most significant, as it signals a change in emphasis on images of retrospection, and introduced images of an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=261–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personalization==
[[Image:Sarcophagus Portonaccio Massimo.jpg|thumb|280px|The [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]]]]
'''Sarcophagi personalization''' is the customization of a [[sarcophagus]] to display the attributes, achievements, or history of the deceased through art and/or [[inscription]]s.

=== Sarcophagus of Lars Pulena ===
The sculpted scene on the front of the coffin shows the deceased in the Underworld between two [[Charuns]] ([[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] death demons) in which signified that his journey to the afterlife was successful.&lt;ref name=GART&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kleiner |first= Fred S. |title= Gardner's Art Through The Ages |edition= 13th |publisher= [[Thomson Wadsworth]] |year= 2009 |origyear= 2005 |isbn= 0-495-09307-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the lid, Pulena is shown laid across, in a reclining position, resting on his left arm and in front of him, a list of his life’s achievements which were inscribed on an open scroll.&lt;ref name=GART/&gt;

=== Melfi Sarcophagus ===
The Asiatic sarcophagus with kline portrait of a woman also carried an Etruscan influence of sculpting portraiture on the lid.&lt;ref name=GART/&gt; Made of marble, with reliefs on all four sides of the box (a feature in Eastern Sarcophagi production), and sculpted mini statues of [[Greek gods]] and heroes in frames are depicted.  The lid displays a portrait of the woman with [[Cupid]] (right end) and a little dog (in which the paws only remain at the left end).

=== Battle of Romans and barbarians ===
The [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]] is an example of one of a group of about twenty-five late Roman battle sarcophagi, with one exception all apparently dating to 170-210, made in Rome or in some cases [[Athens]].  These derive from [[Hellenistic]] monuments from [[Pergamon]] in [[Asia Minor]] showing Pergamene victories over the [[Gauls]], and were all presumably commissioned for military commanders.  The Portonaccio sarcophagus is the best known and most elaborate of the main [[Antonine]] group, and shows both considerable similarities to the [[Great Ludovisi sarcophagus]], the late outlier from about 250, and a considerable contrast in style and mood.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 205&lt;/ref&gt;

The face of the general is unfinished, either because the sculptors awaited a model to work from, or they had produced the work speculatively with no specific commission. The general and his wife are also each shown twice on the lid frieze, together holding each other's hands at the centre, and singly at the ends, again with unfinished faces.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 93&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The unusually large [[Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus]] shows a chaotic battle scene between the Romans and barbarian foes.  At the centre, a young general wears no helmet nor wields any weapon and has emblem of [[Mithras]], the Persian god of light, truth, and victory over death carved into his forehead.  Several scholars have identified him as one of the sons of [[Trajan Decius]],&lt;ref name=GART/&gt; who died of plague.

=== Santa Maria Antiqua Sarcophagus ===
A sarcophagus from the church of [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] with philosopher, [[orant]], and [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testament scenes is [[Early Christian art]] in which displays the story of [[Jonah]] on the left one-third, heads of a praying woman and a seated man reading from a scroll which are unfinished (intended to be portraits of the deceased) in the center, and continuing on, Christ as [[Good Shepherd]], and the baptism of Christ.&lt;ref name=GART/&gt;

'''''Andromeda Chained to the Rocks''''' (1630) is a 34 x 25 oil on panel painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Rembrandt]]. It is now in the [[Mauritshuis]],  [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. Andromeda represents Rembrandt's first full length mythological female nude [[history painting]] and is taken from a story in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.

==Mythology==
In Metamorphoses, [[Andromeda (mythology)]] is the daughter of an Ethiopian king and queen, [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]]. Cassiopeia was very boastful about her beauty, and asserted that she was more beautiful than [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], the queen of the gods and the Nereids. Insulted by Cassiopeia's assertions, [[Neptune]] sent a sea monster to the Ethiopian coast. Neptune then could only be appeased upon the sacrifice of Andromeda, the kings beautiful virgin daughter, to the sea monster. Andromeda was chained naked to rocks by the coast, awaiting the sea monster. [[Perseus]], passing by, had noticed the beautiful girl and made a deal with her parents that he would save her, should he be allowed to have her hand in marriage. The king and queen agree and Andromeda was spared.&lt;ref name="Ovid, book iv, myth ix"&gt;Ovid, book iv, myth ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Damsel in distress==
This painting depicts a classic example of the [[damsel in distress]]. In this theme a beautiful young woman is placed in a perilous situation, usually involving a monster or being trapped in captivity. The damsel can then only be rescued by a hero, whom of which she usually ends up marrying. In this painting, Andromeda has a distressed look on her face as she is completely shackled and unable to move. Although Perseus does not make an appearance in this painting, in similar works we can see Perseus being portrayed in a heroic and graceful light, shown through the use of warm colors and heroic poses.

==Depiction of beauty==
Many artists such as [[Titian]] have depicted this story by showing [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], her rescuer Perseus, and the sea monster all in the same composition. Her beauty as described in her source material can be seen in some of these other works, along with Perseus' role as her rescuer. In this work, Rembrandt shies away from classical conventions by showing her not as a glamorous beauty but as a frightened naturalistic looking girl.  No other figure is included, but her alarmed look out of the picture space to the right creates narrative tension.  The painting is an example of Rembrandt's rejection of idealized beauty. Since he did not believe true beauty existed naturally, he painted women as he saw them; naturally imperfect and flawed.&lt;ref name="Clark, p. 11"&gt;Clark, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Rembrandt's subsequent nude mythological paintings from this period ''[[Diana Bathing with her Nymphs with Actaeon and Callisto|Diana Bathing]]'' and ''[[Danaë (Rembrandt painting)|Danaë]]'' show his evolving portrayal of the nude.

'''Andy Warhol''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɔːr|h|ɒ|l}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]'': [http://www.dictionary.com/browse/warhol "Warhol"]&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Andrew Warhola'''; August 6, 1928&amp;nbsp;– February 22, 1987) was an American artist, director and producer who was a leading figure in the [[Art movement|visual art movement]] known as [[pop art]]. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, [[celebrity culture]], and [[advertising]] that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, [[silkscreening]], photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (1962) and ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' (1962), the experimental film ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966), and the [[multimedia]] events known as the ''[[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]]'' (1966–67).

Born and raised in [[Pittsburgh]], Warhol initially pursued a successful career as a [[commercial illustrator]]. After exhibiting his work in several [[art gallery|galleries]] in the late 1950s, he began to receive recognition as an influential and controversial artist. His [[New York City|New York]] studio, [[The Factory]], became a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished [[intellectual]]s, [[drag queen]]s, playwrights, [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] street people, [[Hollywood]] celebrities, and wealthy patrons.&lt;ref name="NYT-20181112"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Trebay |first1=Guy |last2=La Ferla |first2=Ruth |title=Tales From the Warhol Factory - In each of three successive spaces called the Factory, Andy Warhol created movies, paintings, time capsules and psychosexual dramas with a half-life of many decades.

In the late 1960s, he managed and produced the [[experimental rock]] band [[The Velvet Underground]] and founded ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine. He authored numerous books, including ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]]'' and ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]''. He lived openly as a [[gay]] man before the [[gay liberation|gay liberation movement]]. After [[gallbladder]] [[surgery]], Warhol died of [[cardiac arrhythmia]] in February 1987 at the age of 58.

Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective [[art exhibition|exhibitions]], books, and [[I Shot Andy Warhol|feature]] and documentary films.  [[The Andy Warhol Museum]] in his native city of Pittsburgh, which holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives, is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$105&amp;nbsp;million for a 1963 [[canvas]] titled ''[[Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)]]''; his works include some of the [[List of most expensive paintings|most expensive paintings ever sold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/andy-warhol-painting-sells-105m-article-1.1516240 |title=Andy Warhol painting sells for $105M |work=New York Daily News |date= November 13, 2013|accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 article in ''[[The Economist]]'' described Warhol as the "[[bellwether]] of the art market".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14941229 |title=A special report on the art market: The Pop master's highs and lows |work=The Economist |date= November 26, 2009|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and beginnings (1928–49)===
[[File:Andy Warhol's childhood home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|left|Warhol's childhood home. 3252 Dawson Street, [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|South Oakland]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania|alt=|267x267px]]
Warhol was born on August 6, 1928, in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warholfoundation.org/legacy/biography.html |title=Andy Warhol: Biography |publisher=Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth child of Ondrej Warhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola, Sr., 1889–1942)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1342249/John-Warhola-dies-aged-85.html  "Elder brother of Andy Warhol, who raised young artist, dies aged 85"], ''Daily Mail'', December 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhola.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Warhola.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Bockris, ''Warhol: The Biography'', Da Capo Press, 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julia Warhola|Julia]] (''née'' Zavacká, 1892–1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhola.com/andysmother.html |title=Mother |publisher=Warhola.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose first child was born in their homeland and died before their move to the U.S.

His parents were working-class [[Lemko]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Robert Magocsi, Ivan Pop, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ovCVDLYN_JgC&amp;pg=PA539 ''Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture''], University of Toronto Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Daggett Dillenberger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KemglT-1jSIC&amp;pg=PA7 Religious Art of Andy Warhol], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; emigrants from [[Miková|Mikó]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (now called Miková, located in today's northeastern [[Slovakia]]). Warhol's father emigrated to the United States in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death of Warhol's grandparents. Warhol's father worked in a coal mine. The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name="Bockris"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Victor |last=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |title=The life and death of Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City |year=1989 |pages=4–5 |isbn=0-553-05708-1 |oclc=19631216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic]] and attended [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]]. Andy Warhol had two older brothers—Pavol (Paul), the oldest, was born before the family emigrated; [[John Warhola|Ján]] was born in Pittsburgh. Pavol's son, [[James Warhola]], became a successful children's book illustrator.

In third grade, Warhol had [[Sydenham's chorea]] (also known as St. Vitus' Dance), the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a complication of [[Rheumatic fever|scarlet fever]] which causes skin pigmentation blotchiness.&lt;ref name="warhol.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhol.org/collection/aboutandy/andyfaq/ |title=biography |publisher=warhol |accessdate=January 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106165536/http://www.warhol.org/collection/aboutandy/andyfaq/ |archivedate=January 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/popart/Andy-Warhol.html |title=The Prince of Pop Art |publisher=Arthistoryarchive.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707153626/http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/popart/Andy-Warhol.html |archivedate=July 7, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Warhol graduated from [[Schenley High School]] in 1945. Also as a teen, Warhol won a [[Scholastic Art and Writing Awards|Scholastic Art and Writing Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Scholastic Inc |date=March 14, 2016 |title=America's Most Creative Teens Names as National 2016 Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Award Recipients |url=http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/america-s-most-creative-teens-named-national-2016-scholastic-art-writing-awards-recipe }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school, his intentions were to study [[Visual arts education|art education]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in the hope of becoming an art teacher, but his plans changed and he enrolled in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in Pittsburgh, where he studied [[commercial art]]. During his time there, Warhol joined the campus  Modern Dance Club and Beaux Arts Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andy Warhol: The College Years |url=http://www.warhol.org/responsive/event.aspx?id=2077 |website=The Andy Warhol Museum |accessdate=February 9, 2015|ref=warholmuse}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as art director of the student art magazine, ''Cano'', illustrating a cover in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warhol.org/Warhol/Content/collection/art/earlywork/1998-1-1590 |title=Sprite Heads Playing Violins, 1948 |website=the warhol: |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209190850/http://www.warhol.org/Warhol/Content/collection/art/earlywork/1998-1-1590/|archivedate=February 9, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a full-page interior illustration in 1949.&lt;ref name=Blake&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gopnik|first1=Blake|title=Feb 9, 2015: The Daily Pic|url=http://blakegopnik.com/post/110535434580|website=Blake Gopnik on Art|accessdate=February 9, 2015|ref=gopnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are believed to be his first two published artworks.&lt;ref name=Blake/&gt; Warhol earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in pictorial design in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising.

===1950s===
Warhol's early career was dedicated to commercial and advertising art, where his first commission had been to draw shoes for ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine in the late 1940s.&lt;ref name=foot/&gt; In the 1950s, Warhol worked as a [[Footwear|designer]] for shoe manufacturer Israel Miller.&lt;ref name=foot&gt;
Benstock, Shari and Suzanne Ferriss (editors). ''Footnotes: On Shoes'';  Rutgers University Press; February 1, 2001; {{ISBN|978-0813528717}}; pp. 44–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Israel Miller see [[i.a.]] "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/realestate/10scap.html A Little Jewel Box of a Shoe Store]" by Christopher Gray, ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; American photographer John Coplans recalled that

&lt;blockquote&gt;nobody drew shoes the way Andy did. He somehow gave each shoe a temperament of its own, a sort of sly, [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] kind of sophistication, but the shape and the style came through accurately and the buckle was always in the right place. The kids in the apartment [which Andy shared in New York – note by Coplans] noticed that the [[Shoe#Construction|vamp]]s on Andy's shoe drawings kept getting longer and longer but [Israel] Miller didn't mind. Miller loved them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Warhol's "whimsical" [[Pen-and-ink drawing|ink drawing]]s of shoe advertisements figured in some of his earliest showings at the [[Bodley Gallery]] in New York.

Warhol was an early adopter of the [[Screen printing|silk screen]] printmaking process as a technique for making paintings.  A young Warhol was taught silk screen printmaking techniques by [[Max Arthur Cohn]] at his graphic arts business in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://americanart.si.edu/artist/max-arthur-cohn-935 "Max Arthur Cohn"] at SAAM.&lt;/ref&gt; While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his "blotted line" technique, applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a [[printmaking]] process on the most rudimentary scale. His use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme, a method that prefigures his 1960s silk-screen canvas.&lt;ref name=foot/&gt; In his book ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'', Warhol writes: "When you do something exactly wrong, you always turn up something."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33886455/ns/today-entertainment/t/warhols-dollar-bills-painting-fetches-millions/ |title=Warhol's dollar bills painting fetches millions|publisher=MSNBC Today |date=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sherman&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SC0MCcfRsA8C&amp;pg=PA106 |title=Pop: The Genius of Andy Warhol|author= Tony Scherman, David Dalton|publisher= HarperCollins|date= 2010 | isbn= 9780060936631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol habitually used the expedient of tracing photographs projected with an [[Opaque projector|epidiascope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Warhol, Andy | author2=Glozer, Laslo, 1936- | author3=Schellmann, Jörg | author4=Edition Schellmann | title=Andy Warhol, art from art | publication-date=1994 | publisher=Edition Schellmann ; München : Schirmer/Mosel | isbn=978-3-88814-725-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using prints by [[Edward Wallowitch]], his 'first boyfriend'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation | author1=Koestenbaun, Wayne | title=Andy Warhol : a biography | publication-date=2015 | publisher=New York, NY Open Road Integrated Media, Inc | isbn=978-1-4976-9989-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the photographs would undergo a subtle transformation during Warhol's often cursory tracing of contours and [[hatching]] of shadows. Warhol used Wallowitch's photograph ''Young Man Smoking a Cigarette'' (c.1956),&lt;ref&gt;[http://flavorwire.com/573987/warhol-by-the-book-reveals-the-icons-fascinating-career-as-a-book-artist/8 Edward Wallowitch ''Young Man Smoking a Cigarette'' (c.1956 Gelatin silver print).

With the rapid expansion of the [[record industry]], [[RCA Records]] hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Andrew |last1=Oldham |authorlink=Andrew Loog Oldham |author2=Simon Spence |author3=Christine Ohlman |title=2Stoned |publisher=[[Secker and Warburg]] |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=0-436-28015-9 |oclc=50215773|page=137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andy Warhol's first New York solo [[pop art]] exhibition was hosted at Eleanor Ward's [[Stable Gallery]] November 6–24, 1962. The exhibit included the works ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'', ''100 Soup Cans'', ''100 Coke Bottles'', and ''100 Dollar Bills''. At the [[Stable Gallery]] exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet [[John Giorno]] who would star in Warhol's first film, ''[[Sleep (1963 film)|Sleep]]'', in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warholstars.org/warhol/warhol1/warhol1b/johngiorno.html |work=www.warholstars.org |title=John Giorno }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, [[mushroom cloud]]s, [[electric chair]]s, [[Campbell's Soup Cans]], [[Coca-Cola]] bottles, celebrities such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Troy Donahue]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking African-American protesters during the [[Birmingham campaign]] in the [[civil rights movement]]. During these years, he founded his studio, "[[The Factory]]" and gathered about him a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. His work became popular and controversial. Warhol had this to say about Coca-Cola:

{{quote|What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca-Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca-Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca-Cola, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Andy |last=Warhol |title=[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol|The philosophy of Andy Warhol: from A to B and back again]] |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |year=1975 |isbn=0-15-189050-1 |oclc=1121125 |pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

New York City's [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists such as Warhol were attacked for "capitulating" to consumerism. Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception.

[[File:Warhol-Campbell Soup-1-screenprint-1968.jpg|thumb|left|''Campbell's Soup I'' (1968)|alt=|346x346px]]

A pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit ''The American Supermarket'', a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) [[Billy Apple]], Mary Inman, and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

As an [[Commercial art|advertisement illustrator]] in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was [[Gerard Malanga]]. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at "[[The Factory]]", Warhol's [[aluminum foil]]-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included [[Freddie Herko]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Ronald Tavel]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Billy Name]], and [[Brigid Berlin]] (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation "[[Warhol Superstar|Superstars]]", including [[Nico]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Jackie Curtis]], and [[Candy Darling]]. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer [[John Giorno]] and film-maker [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]], also appear in Warhol films (many premiering at the [[New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre]] and [[55th Street Playhouse]]) of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. Less well known was his support and collaboration with several teen-agers during this era, who would achieve prominence later in life including writer David Dalton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Menand|first1=Louis|title=Top of the Pops|work=New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/01/11/top-of-the-pops|date=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; photographer Stephen Shore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grow|first1=Krystal|title=Time Lightbox|url=http://lightbox.time.com/2014/09/23/stephen-shore-at-the-factory/#1|publisher=Time Inc.|date=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artist Bibbe Hansen (mother of pop musician [[Beck]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Dagon|title=Billy Name:The Silver Age Black and White Photographs of Andy Warhol's Factory|date=2014|publisher=Reel Art Press|isbn=1909526177|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempted murder (1968)====
On June 3, 1968, [[radical feminist]] writer [[Valerie Solanas]] shot Warhol and [[Mario Amaya]], art critic and curator, at Warhol's studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schaffner |first=Ingrid |authorlink=Ingrid Schaffner |title=The Essential Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams]] |location=New York City |page=79 |year=1999 |isbn=0-8109-5806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the shooting, Solanas had been a marginal figure in the Factory scene. She authored in 1967 the ''[[S.C.U.M. Manifesto]]'',&lt;ref name="Solanas"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Valerie |last=Solanas |authorlink=Valerie Solanas |title=[[SCUM Manifesto]] |publisher=Verso |location=London |origyear=1967 |year=2004 |isbn=1-85984-553-3 |oclc=53932627}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Separatist feminism|separatist feminist]] tract that advocated the elimination of men; and appeared in the 1968 Warhol film ''[[I, a Man]]''. Earlier on the day of the attack, Solanas had been turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to Warhol. The script had apparently been misplaced.&lt;ref name="Jobey"&gt;Jobey, Liz, "Solanas and Son," ''The Guardian'' (Manchester, England), August 24, 1996, p, T10 and following.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amaya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day. Warhol was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived: surgeons opened his chest and [[internal cardiac massage|massaged his heart]] to help stimulate its movement again. He suffered physical effects for the rest of his life, including being required to wear a surgical corset.&lt;ref name="warhol.org"/&gt; The shooting had a profound effect on Warhol's life and art.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harding |first=James |title=The Simplest Surrealist Act: Valerie Solanas and the (Re)Assertion of Avantgarde Priorities |journal=[[TDR (journal)|TDR/The Drama Review]] |volume=45 |issue=4; Winter 2001 |pages=142–162 |doi=10.1162/105420401772990388|year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="popism287-295"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Andy |last1=Warhol |author2=Pat Hacket |title=POPism: the Warhol '60s |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=New York |year=1980 |pages=287–295 |isbn=0-15-173095-4 |oclc=5673923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solanas was arrested the day after the assault, after turning herself in to police. By way of explanation, she said that Warhol "had too much control over my life." She was subsequently diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and eventually sentenced to three years under the control of the [[New York City Department of Correction|Department of Corrections]]. After the shooting, the Factory scene heavily increased security, and for many the "Factory 60s" ended.&lt;ref name="popism287-295"/&gt;

Warhol had this to say about the attack: "Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television."&lt;ref name="StilesSelz1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kristine Stiles|author2=Peter Howard Selz|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: a Sourcebook of Artists' Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXV-HlsUzdcC&amp;pg=PA345|accessdate=January 13, 2013|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20251-1|pages=345–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===

Compared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s, the 1970s were a much quieter decade, as he became more entrepreneurial. According to [[Bob Colacello]], Warhol devoted much of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait commissions—including Shah of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], his wife Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]], his sister [[Princess Ashraf Pahlavi]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[John Lennon]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Brigitte Bardot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8179627.stm |work=BBC News | title=Warhol's Jackson goes on display | date=August 7, 2009 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/warhol.php|title=Andy Warhol Expert art authentication, certificates of authenticity and expert appraisers|website=www.artexpertswebsite.com|access-date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol's famous portrait of Chinese Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] was created in 1973. He also founded, with [[Gerard Malanga]], ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, and published ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol'' (1975). An idea expressed in the book: "Making money is art, and working is art and good business is the best art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delves Broughton|first=Philip|title=The Art of the Sale|year=2012|publisher=The Penguin Press|location=New York, NY|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol socialized at various nightspots in New York City, including [[Max's Kansas City]]; and, later in the 1970s, [[Studio 54]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |title=Andy Warhol Biography: From The Velvet Underground To Basquiat |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107015819/http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |archivedate=January 7, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was generally regarded as quiet, shy, and a meticulous observer.

In 1979, along with his longtime friend [[Stuart Pivar]], Warhol founded the [[New York Academy of Art]].&lt;ref name="NYM 1992"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gOMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |title=New York Magazine Jan 27, 1992 |publisher= |date=January 27, 1992 |accessdate=December 4, 2013|author1=New York Media |first1=LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |title=New York Magazine Apr 8, 1996 |publisher= |date=April 8, 1996 |accessdate=December 4, 2013|author1=New York Media |first1=LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Warhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the "[[bull market]]" of 1980s New York art: [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[David Salle]] and other so-called [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-Expressionists]], as well as members of the [[Transavantgarde]] movement in Europe, including [[Francesco Clemente]] and [[Enzo Cucchi]]. Before the 1984 [[Sarajevo]] [[Winter Olympics]], he teamed with 15 other artists, including [[David Hockney]] and [[Cy Twombly]], and contributed a [[Speed Skater]] print to the Art and Sport collection. The Speed Skater was used for the official [[1984 Winter Olympics|Sarajevo Winter Olympics]] poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aanddgallery.com/store/images/uploads/WarholWinterolympics.jpg|title="Speed Skater" official 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics poster by Andy Warhol|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, [[graffiti]] artist [[Fab Five Freddy]] paid homage to Warhol when he painted an entire train with Campbell soup cans. This was instrumental in Freddy becoming involved in the underground NYC art scene and becoming an affiliate of Basquiat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip Hop Family Tree|last=Piskor|first=Ed|publisher=Fantagraphics|year=2013|isbn=1606996908|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this period, Warhol was being criticized for becoming merely a "business artist".&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michal |last=Lando |date=April 8, 2008 |title=Reexamining Warhol's Jews |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207486218796&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=January 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703204535/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207486218796&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archivedate=July 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, reviewers disliked his exhibits of portraits of 1970s personalities and celebrities, calling them superficial, facile and commercial, with no depth or indication of the significance of the subjects. They also criticized his 1980 exhibit of 10 portraits at the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] in Manhattan, entitled ''Jewish Geniuses'', which Warhol—who was uninterested in [[Judaism]] and Jews—had described in his diary as "They're going to sell."&lt;ref name="jpost" /&gt; In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as "the most brilliant mirror of our times," contending that "Warhol had captured something irresistible about the [[zeitgeist]] of American culture in the 1970s."&lt;ref name="jpost" /&gt;

Warhol also had an appreciation for intense [[Hollywood glamour]]. He once said: "I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They're so beautiful. Everything's plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Victor |last1=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |author2=[[Gerard Malanga]] |title=Up-tight: the Velvet Underground story |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London |year=2002 |page=66 |isbn=0-7119-9170-7 |oclc=49906101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Warhol immortalized the singer [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] by creating one of his final portraits, [[Prince (painting)|''Orange Prince (1984)'']], a commission from Vanity Fair to accompany an article to celebrate the success of Prince's [[Purple Rain (album)|album]] and [[Purple Rain (film)|movie entitled ''Purple Rain'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/04/prince-at-the-height-of-his-powers|title=Purple Fame: An Appreciation of Prince at the Height of His Powers.

In the ''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries|Andy Warhol Diaries]]'', Warhol recorded how excited he was to see Prince and [[Billy Idol]] together at a party in the mid 1980s, and he compared them to the Hollywood movie stars of the 1950s and '60s who also inspired his portraits: "... seeing these two glamour boys, its like ''boys'' are the new Hollywood glamour girls, like [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Andy Warhol diaries |date=2014 |last=Warhol |first=Andy |last2=Hackett |first2=Pat |isbn=9781455561452|edition= 1st Twelve |location=New York, NY |publisher=Twelve |oclc=881024850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paintings===
By the beginning of the 1960s, [[pop art]] was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as [[Roy Lichtenstein]], would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the "Pope of Pop", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]]). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bronwit Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries [[Jasper Johns]], [[James Rosenquist]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had also once graced.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Patrick S (1986).

It was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhol's dollar paintings. On November 23, 1961, Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, ''Pop, The Genius of Warhol'', was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |title=The Soup Cans—Andy Warhol |publisher=Warholstars.org |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801234441/http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |archivedate=August 1, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his first major exhibition, Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell's soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life. A 1964 ''Large Campbell's Soup Can'' was sold in a 2007 [[Sotheby's]] auction to a South American collector  for £5.1 million ($7.4 million).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.artnet.com/market/sothebys-100-million-contemporary-art-evening-sale-422258 Early Lucian Freud Painting Leads Sotheby’s $100 Million Contemporary Art Evening Sale]" by Colin Gleadell, ''[[Artnet]]'', February 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

He loved [[celebrity|celebrities]], so he painted them as well. From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group-4 race version of the then "elite supercar" [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]]. It was reported at the time that, unlike the three artists before him, Warhol opted to paint directly onto the automobile himself instead of letting technicians transfer his scale-model design to the car.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060525054033/http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/Andy-Warhol-lg.jpg Bmw Art Car 1979: M1 by Andy Warhol], ''Car Body Design'', March 27, 2006 (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213000309/http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |title=Bmw Art Car 1979: M1 by Andy Warhol |publisher=carbodydesign.com |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol produced both comic and serious works; his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques—silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors—whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962–63 ''Death and Disaster'' series. The ''Death and Disaster'' paintings included ''Red Car Crash'', ''Purple Jumping Man'', and ''Orange Disaster.'' One of these paintings, the diptych ''Silver Car Crash'', became the highest priced work of his when it sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction on Wednesday, November 13, 2013, for $105.4 million.&lt;ref name="sothebys.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Sotheby's – November 14, 2013 |url=http://www.sothebys.com/content/sothebys/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/contemporary/2013/11/record-warhol-leads-.html |title=Record Warhol Leads Contemporary Sale &amp;#124; Sotheby's |publisher=Sothebys.com |date=November 14, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Warhol's work, as well as his own personality, has been described as being [[Buster Keaton|Keatonesque]]. Warhol has been described as playing dumb to the media. He sometimes refused to explain his work. He has suggested that all one needs to know about his work is "already there 'on the surface'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/warhol.php |title=Andy Warhol Biography (1928–1987) |publisher=Art Experts |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblots]] are intended as pop comments on art and what art could be. His cow wallpaper (literally, wallpaper with a cow [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]) and his [[redox|oxidation]] paintings (canvases prepared with copper paint that was then oxidized with urine) are also noteworthy in this context. Equally noteworthy is the way these works—and their [[means of production]]—mirrored the atmosphere at Andy's New York "Factory". Biographer Bob Colacello provides some details on Andy's "piss paintings":

{{quote|Victor&amp;nbsp; ... was Andy's ghost pisser on the Oxidations. He would come to the Factory to urinate on canvases that had already been primed with copper-based paint by Andy or Ronnie Cutrone, a second ghost pisser much appreciated by Andy, who said that the vitamin B that Ronnie took made a prettier color when the acid in the urine turned the copper green. Did Andy ever use his own urine? My diary shows that when he first began the series, in December 1977, he did, and there were many others: boys who'd come to lunch and drink too much wine, and find it funny or even flattering to be asked to help Andy 'paint'. Andy always had a little extra bounce in his walk as he led them to his studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bob |last=Colacello |authorlink=Bob Colacello |title=Holy terror: Andy Warhol close up |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=1990 |page=343 |isbn=0-06-016419-0 |oclc=21196706}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Warhol's first portrait of ''Basquiat'' (1982) is a black photo-silkscreen over an oxidized copper "piss painting".

After many years of silkscreen, oxidation, photography, etc., Warhol returned to painting with a brush in hand in a series of more than 50 large collaborative works done with [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] between 1984 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Chiappini, Rudi (ed.), ''Jean-Michel Basquiat''.

Andy Warhol was commissioned in 1984 by collector and gallerist [[Alexander Iolas]] to produce work based on [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' for an exhibition at the old refectory of the Palazzo delle Stelline in [[Milan]], opposite from the [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] where Leonardo da Vinci's mural can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schmuckli, [http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/warhol/ "Andy Warhol: The Last Supper" (June 1999 – December 2001)] [[Guggenheim Museum SoHo]]. Retrieved September 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol exceeded the demands of the commission and produced nearly 100 variations on the theme, mostly silkscreens and paintings, and among them a collaborative sculpture with Basquiat, the ''Ten Punching Bags (Last Supper)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warhol.org/education/resourceslessons/Jean-Michel-Basquiat/ Collaboration with Andy Warhol: Jean Michel Basquiat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082251/http://www.warhol.org/education/resourceslessons/Jean-Michel-Basquiat/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}, The Andy Warhol Museum.

Artist [[Maurizio Cattelan]] describes that it is difficult to separate daily encounters from the art of Andy Warhol: "That's probably the greatest thing about Warhol: the way he penetrated and summarized our world, to the point that distinguishing between him and our everyday life is basically impossible, and in any case useless."

In the period just before his death, Warhol was working on ''[[Cars (painting)|Cars]]'', a series of paintings for [[Mercedes-Benz]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/01/arts.warhol|title=Warhol: Cars|date=September 1, 2001|accessdate=April 24, 2010|work=The Guardian |location=London | first=Maev | last=Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-portrait by Andy Warhol (1963–64), which sold in New York at the May Post-War and Contemporary evening sale in [[Christie's]], fetched $38.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13371502|title=Andy Warhol self-portrait fetches $38.4m|date=May 12, 2011|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2012, his classic painting ''Double Elvis (Ferus Type)'' sold at auction at [[Sotheby's]] in New York for US$33 million. With commission, the sale price totaled US$37,042,500, short of the $50 million that Sotheby's had predicted the painting might bring. The piece (silkscreen ink and [[spray paint]] on canvas) shows [[Elvis Presley]] in a [[gunslinger]] pose. It was first exhibited in 1963 at the [[Ferus Gallery]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Warhol made 22 versions of the ''Double Elvis'', nine of which are held in museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AP|title=Warhol 'Elvis' sells for $37M; Lichtenstein, Weiwei works break own records at NYC auction|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/warhol-elvis-sells-for-37m-lichtenstein-weiwei-works-break-own-records-at-nyc-auction/2012/05/09/gIQAQQKDEU_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
[[File:Empire Screenshot Warhol.jpg|thumb|240x240px|Screenshot from the [[Empire (1964 film)|''Empire'']].|alt=]]
Warhol worked across a wide range of media—painting, photography, drawing, and sculpture. In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/|title=Andy Warhol Filmography|work=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus some 500 short black-and-white "[[Screen Tests|screen test]]" portraits of Factory visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffner (1999), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (1963 film)|Sleep]]'', monitors poet [[John Giorno]] sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' is one continuous shot of the face of [[DeVeren Bookwalter]] supposedly receiving [[oral sex]] from filmmaker [[Willard Maas]], although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. The film ''[[Eat (film)|Eat]]'' consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by [[LaMonte Young]] called ''Trio for Strings'' and subsequently created his famous series of static films including ''Kiss'', ''Eat'', and ''Sleep'' (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker [[Jonas Mekas]], who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Uwe |last=Husslein |title=Pop goes art: Andy Warhol &amp; Velvet Underground |publisher=Wuppertal |year=1990 |oclc=165575494}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Batman Dracula]]'' is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of [[DC Comics]]. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the ''Batman''  series, Warhol's movie was an "homage" to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly [[Camp (style)|campy]] Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary ''[[Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis]]''.

Warhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as [[Brigid Berlin]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Nico]], and [[Jackie Curtis]]. Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.

His most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two [[16 mm film|16 mm]]-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that "story" while it was lowered for the other. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol's seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s.

Warhol was a fan of filmmaker [[Radley Metzger]]{{'s}} film work&lt;ref name="FD-20140807"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hudson |first=David |title= This Is Softcore: The Art Cinema Erotica of Radley Metzger |url=https://www.fandor.com/keyframe/daily-this-is-softcore-the-art-cinema-erotica-of-radley-metzger |date=August 7, 2014 |work=[[Fandor (film site)|Fandor]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented that Metzger's film, ''[[The Lickerish Quartet]]'', was "an outrageously kinky masterpiece".&lt;ref name="NYT-20170404"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandmir |first=Richard |title=Radley Metzger, Whose Artful Erotica Turned Explicit, Dies at 88 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/movies/radley-metzger-director-who-left-erotica-for-hard-core-dies-at-88.html |date=April 4, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TRR-20170402"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Metzger |first1=Juliette |last2=Feldman |first2=Caryl |last3=West |first3=Ashley |title=Press Release: Radley Metzger, pioneering filmmaker, dies at 88 |url=http://www.therialtoreport.com/2017/04/02/radley-metzger-2/ |date=April 2, 2017 |work=[[The Rialto Report]] |accessdate=April 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FSLC-AndyWarhol"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |title=''The Lickerish Quartet''|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/the-lickerish-quartet |date=August 8, 2014|work=[[Film Society of Lincoln Center]]|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blue Movie]]''—a film in which Warhol superstar [[Viva (actress)|Viva]] makes love in bed with [[Louis Waldon]], another Warhol superstar—was Warhol's last film as director.&lt;ref name="NYT-19690722"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review – Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19690810"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

After his June 3, 1968, shooting, a reclusive Warhol relinquished his personal involvement in filmmaking. His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for [[the Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie [[exploitation film|exploitation]] fare with ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (1970 film)|Trash]]'', and ''[[Heat (1972 film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter "Warhol" films starred [[Joe Dallesandro]]—more of a Morrissey star than a true [[Warhol superstar]].

In the early 1970s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.

===Music===
In the mid-1960s, Warhol adopted the band [[the Velvet Underground]], making them a crucial element of the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] multimedia performance art show. Warhol, with [[Paul Morrissey]], acted as the band's manager, introducing them to [[Nico]] (who would perform with the band at Warhol's request). While managing [[The Velvet Underground]], Andy would have them dressed in all black to perform in front of movies that he was also presenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/955634990|title=Please kill me : the uncensored oral history of punk|others=McNeil, Legs,, McCain, Gillian,|isbn=9780802125361|edition= Twentieth anniversary |location=New York|oclc=955634990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he "produced" their first album ''[[The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico]]'', as well as providing its album art. His actual participation in the album's production amounted to simply paying for the studio time. After the band's first album, Warhol and band leader [[Lou Reed]] started to disagree more about the direction the band should take, and their artistic friendship ended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1989, after Warhol's death, Reed and [[John Cale]] re-united for the first time since 1972 to write, perform, record and release the concept album ''[[Songs for Drella]]'', a tribute to Warhol.

Warhol designed many album covers for various artists starting with the photographic cover of [[John Wallowitch]]'s debut album, ''This Is John Wallowitch!!!'' (1964). He designed the cover art for [[The Rolling Stones]]' albums ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971) and ''[[Love You Live]]'' (1977), and the [[John Cale]] albums ''[[The Academy in Peril]]'' (1972) and ''[[Honi Soit (album)|Honi Soit]]'' in 1981. One of Warhol's last works was a portrait of [[Aretha Franklin]] for the cover of her 1986 [[Music recording sales certification|gold album]] ''[[Aretha (1986 album)|Aretha]]'', which was done in the style of the ''Reigning Queens'' series he had completed the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bego | first = Mark |title =Aretha Franklin: The Queen of Soul |publisher=Da Capo Press |year = 2001 | page = 250 |isbn = 0-306-80935-4 |oclc = 46488152 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ErKigdCXUwoC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=warhol+album+cover+1986 | accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol strongly influenced the [[New wave music|new wave]]/[[punk rock]] band [[Devo]], as well as [[David Bowie]]. Bowie recorded a song called "[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]" for his 1971 album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''. Lou Reed wrote the song "Andy's Chest", about [[Valerie Solanas]], the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the ''[[VU (album)|VU]]'' album in 1985. Bowie would later play Warhol in the 1996 movie, ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]''. Bowie recalled how meeting Warhol in real life helped him in the role, and recounted his early meetings with him:

{{quote|I met him a couple of times, but we seldom shared more than platitudes. The first time we saw each other an awkward silence fell till he remarked my bright yellow shoes and started talking enthusiastically. He wanted to be very superficial. And seemingly emotionless, indifferent, just like a dead fish. Lou Reed described him most profoundly when he once told me they should bring a doll of Andy on the market: a doll that you wind up and doesn't do anything. But I managed to observe him well, and that was a helping hand for the film ''[Basquiat'']. … We borrowed his clothes from the museum in Pittsburgh, and they were intact, unwashed. Even the pockets weren't emptied: they contained pancake, white, deadly pale ''{{abbr|fond de teint|foundation}}'' which Andy always smeared on his face, a check torn in pieces, someone's address, lots of homeopathic pills and a wig. Andy always wore those silver wigs, but he never admitted it were wigs. One of his hairdressers has told me lately that he had his wigs regularly cut, like it were real hair. When the wig was trimmed, he put on another next month as if his hair had grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/95/h.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616041825/http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/95/h.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 16, 2013 |title=Can the Real David Bowie Rise, Please? |journal=''[[HUMO]]'' magazine |date=December 5, 1995 |accessdate=June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Books and print===
[[File:Warhol autograph.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Warhol drawing and signature]]
Beginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work.

The first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was ''[[25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy]]'', printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs. The original edition was limited to 190 numbered, hand colored copies, using Dr. Martin's ink washes. Most of these were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends. Copy No. 4, inscribed "Jerry" on the front cover and given to [[Geraldine Stutz]], was used for a facsimile printing in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John |last=Russell |authorlink=John Russell (art critic) |date=December 6, 1987 |title=Art |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/06/books/art.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US $35,000 by [[Doyle New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doylenewyork.com/default.htm May 3, 2006, auction at Doyle New York]. Retrieved August 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other self-published books by Warhol include:
* ''A Gold Book''
* ''Wild Raspberries''
* ''Holy Cats''

Warhol's book ''A La Recherche du Shoe Perdu'' (1955) marked his "transition from commercial to gallery artist".&lt;ref name=SmithAllaraWarhol2002&gt;Smith, John W., Pamela Allara, and Andy Warhol. ''Possession Obsession: Andy Warhol and Collecting''. Pittsburgh, PA: Andy Warhol Museum, 2002, p. 46. {{ISBN|0-9715688-0-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (The title is a [[wordplay|play on words]] by Warhol on the title of French author [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]''.)&lt;ref name=SmithAllaraWarhol2002/&gt;

After gaining fame, Warhol "wrote" several books that were commercially published:
* ''[[A, a novel|a, A Novel]]'' (1968, {{ISBN|0-8021-3553-6}}) is a literal transcription—containing spelling errors and phonetically written background noise and mumbling—of audio recordings of [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]] and several of Andy Warhol's friends hanging out at the Factory, talking, going out.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]] (From A to B &amp; Back Again)'' (1975, {{ISBN|0-15-671720-4}})—according to Pat Hackett's introduction to ''The Andy Warhol Diaries'', Pat Hackett did the transcriptions and text for the book based on daily phone conversations, sometimes (when Warhol was traveling) using audio cassettes that Andy Warhol gave her. Said cassettes contained conversations with [[Brigid Berlin]] (also known as Brigid Polk) and former ''Interview'' magazine editor [[Bob Colacello]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'' (1980, {{ISBN|0-15-672960-1}}), authored by Warhol and Pat Hackett, is a retrospective view of the 1960s and the role of pop art.
* ''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries]]'' (1989, {{ISBN|0-446-39138-7}}), edited by Pat Hackett, is a diary dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations. Warhol started the diary to keep track of his expenses after being audited, although it soon evolved to include his personal and cultural observations.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol created the fashion magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' that is still published today. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other media===
Although Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he authored works in many different media.
*[[File:Silver Clouds Warhol Musee dArt Moderne ville Paris.jpg|thumb|''Silver Clouds'' Reproduction at the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], December 2015, Warhol Unlimited Exposition]]'''Drawing:''' Warhol started his career as a commercial illustrator, producing drawings in "blotted-ink" style for advertisements and magazine articles. Best known of these early works are his drawings of shoes. Some of his personal drawings were self-published in small booklets, such as ''Yum, Yum, Yum'' (about food), ''Ho, Ho, Ho'' (about Christmas) and ''Shoes, Shoes, Shoes''. His most artistically acclaimed book of drawings is probably ''A Gold Book'', compiled of sensitive drawings of young men. ''A Gold Book'' is so named because of the [[gold leaf]] that decorates its pages.&lt;ref name=Bourdon51&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N.

The image was said to have been drawn when Andy was nine or 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-17591826 |title='Andy Warhol sketch found' in US garage sale |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various authorities have challenged the image's authenticity.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
* '''Sculpture:''' Warhol's most famous sculpture is probably his ''Brillo Boxes'', silkscreened ink on wood replicas of the large, branded cardboard boxes used to hold 24 packages of [[Brillo]] soap pads. The original Brillo design was by commercial artist [[James Harvey (artist)|James Harvey]]. Warhol's sculpture was part of a series of "grocery carton" works that also included Heinz ketchup and Campbell's tomato juice cases.&lt;ref name="365 Takes"&gt;{{cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N.

A ''Silver Cloud'' was included in the traveling exhibition ''Air Art'' (1968–1969) curated by [[Willoughby Sharp]]. ''Clouds'' was also adapted by Warhol for [[avant-garde]] choreographer Merce Cunningham's dance piece ''RainForest'' (1968).&lt;ref name=Bourdon231&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N.

* '''Audio:''' At one point Warhol carried a portable recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said and did. He referred to this device as his "wife". Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol's was his ''Invisible Sculpture'', a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol's cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* '''Time Capsules:''' In 1973, Warhol began saving ephemera from his daily life—correspondence, newspapers, souvenirs, childhood objects, even used plane tickets and food—which was sealed in plain cardboard boxes dubbed Time Capsules. By the time of his death, the collection grew to include 600, individually dated "capsules". The boxes are now housed at the Andy Warhol Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N.

* '''Television:''' Andy Warhol dreamed of a [[television special]] about a favorite subject of his{{dash}}[[Nothing]]{{dash}}that he would call ''The Nothing Special''. Later in his career he did create two cable television shows, ''Andy Warhol's TV'' in 1982 and ''[[Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes]]'' (based on his famous "[[fifteen minutes of fame]]" quotation) for MTV in 1986. Besides his own shows he regularly made guest appearances on other programs, including ''[[The Love Boat]]'' wherein a Midwestern wife ([[Marion Ross]]) fears Andy Warhol will reveal to her husband ([[Tom Bosley]], who starred alongside Ross in sitcom ''[[Happy Days]]'') her secret past as a Warhol superstar named Marina del Rey. Warhol also produced a TV commercial for [[Schrafft's]] Restaurants in New York City, for an ice cream dessert appropriately titled the "Underground Sundae".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm |title=Underground Sundae |year=2005 |first=Michael |last=Ferguson |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116182237/http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm |archivedate=January 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pork'' was based on tape-recorded conversations between Brigid Berlin and Andy during which Brigid would play for Andy tapes she had made of phone conversations between herself and her mother, socialite Honey Berlin. The play featured [[Jayne County]] as "Vulva" and [[Cherry Vanilla]] as "Amanda Pork".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Andy Warhol Museum|url=http://www.warhol.org/responsive/event.aspx?id=2215|accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Andy Warhol also produced the stage musical ''[[Man on the Moon (musical)|Man on the Moon]]'', which was written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of the [[Mamas and the Papas]].

===Producer and product===
He founded the gossip magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'', a stage for celebrities he "endorsed" and a business staffed by his friends. He collaborated with others on all of his books (some of which were written with Pat Hackett.) He adopted the young painter [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and the band [[The Velvet Underground]], presenting them to the public as his latest interest, and collaborating with them. One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian "Superstar" and the Warholian portrait). He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from ''[[Love Boat]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Matheson | first=Whitney | date=August 6, 2013 | title=See six of Warhol's best film/TV appearances | work=[[USA Today]] | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2013/08/06/andy-warhol-video/2623869/ | access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | last1=Munroe | first1=Don | last2=Fremont | first2=Vincent | last3=Etkin | first3=Sue | date=October 10, 1981 | title=Andy Warhol's TV: Makeup and Death | language = English | publisher=''[[NBC]]'' | url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/warhol-film/n8846?snl=1 | access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Richard Pryor]] movie ''Dynamite Chicken''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Obituaries | date=February 7, 2002 | title=Ernest Pintoff, 70; Animator Won Oscar | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/07/local/me-pintoff7 | access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The fact that Warhol's homosexuality influenced his work and shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and is an issue that Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications (''e.g.'', ''Popism: The Warhol 1960s''). Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and films such as ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'', ''My Hustler'' and ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'') draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters, including the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre and 55th Street Playhouse, in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Waugh, ''Hard to Imagine: Gay Male eroticism in Photography and Film from the Beginnings to Stonewall'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first works that Warhol submitted to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In ''Popism'', furthermore, the artist recalls a conversation with the film maker [[Emile de Antonio]] about the difficulty Warhol had being accepted socially by the then-more-famous (but [[closeted]]) gay artists [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. De Antonio explained that Warhol was "too swish and that upsets them." In response to this, Warhol writes, "There was nothing I could say to that. It was all too true. So I decided I just wasn't going to care, because those were all the things that I didn't want to change anyway, that I didn't think I 'should' want to change&amp;nbsp; ... Other people could change their attitudes but not me".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Gavin |last=Butt |title=Between you and me: queer disclosures in the New York art world, 1948–1963 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, N.C |year=2005 |isbn=0-8223-3486-0 |oclc=57285910 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exploring Warhol's biography, many turn to this period—the late 1950s and early 1960s—as a key moment in the development of his persona. Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like "Um, no" and "Um, yes", and often allowing others to speak for him)—and even the evolution of his pop style—can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.&lt;ref name="Fairbrother"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fairbrother |first=Trevor |chapter=Tomorrow's Man |title=Success Is a Job in New York: the Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol |editor=Donna De Salvo |location=New York |publisher=Grey Art Gallery and Study Center |year=1989 |pages=55–74 |isbn=0-934349-05-3 |oclc=19826995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
[[File:WarholLastSup.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Images of Jesus from ''The [[Last Supper]]'' cycle (1986). Warhol made almost 100 variations on the theme, which the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] felt "indicates an almost obsessive investment in the subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Claudia |last=Schmuckli |url=http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/warhol/ |title=Andy Warhol: The Last Supper |publisher=[[Solomon R.

Warhol was a practicing [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic]]. He regularly volunteered at [[homeless shelter]]s in New York City, particularly during the busier times of the year, and described himself as a religious person.&lt;ref name="godspy-Warhol"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James |last=Romaine |date=November 12, 2003 |title=Transubstantiating the Culture: Andy Warhol's Secret |url=http://oldarchive.godspy.com/culture/Andy-Warhol-Transubstantiating-the-Culture.cfm.html |journal=[[Godspy]] |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Warhol's later works depicted religious subjects, including two series, ''Details of Renaissance Paintings'' (1984) and ''The Last Supper'' (1986). In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.&lt;ref name="godspy-Warhol"/&gt;

During his life, Warhol regularly attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Liturgy]], and the priest at Warhol's church, [[Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (New York)|Saint Vincent Ferrer]], said that the artist went there almost daily,&lt;ref name="godspy-Warhol"/&gt; although he was not observed taking [[Eucharist#Catholic|Communion]] or going to [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Confession]] and sat or knelt in the pews at the back.&lt;ref name="Warhol at SVFC"/&gt; The priest thought he was afraid of being recognized; Warhol said he was self-conscious about being seen in a [[Roman Rite]] church [[sign of the Cross|crossing himself]] "in the [[Byzantine Rite|Orthodox]] way" (right to left instead of the reverse).&lt;ref name="Warhol at SVFC"/&gt;

His art is noticeably influenced by the [[Eastern Christian]] tradition which was so evident in his places of worship.&lt;ref name="godspy-Warhol"/&gt;

Warhol's brother has described the artist as "really religious, but he didn't want people to know about that because [it was] private". Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol's [[eulogy]] [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] depicted it as devout: "To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]]. He took considerable pride in financing his nephew's studies for the priesthood".&lt;ref name="godspy-Warhol"/&gt;

===Collections===
Warhol was an avid collector. His friends referred to his numerous collections, which filled not only his four-story [[townhouse]], but also a nearby storage unit, as "Andy's Stuff." The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his "Stuff."

Warhol's collections included a Coca-cola memorabilia sign, and 19th century paintings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-08/entertainment/ca-3738_1_pop-art|title=Warhol: Pop Artist or Crusader for Tradition?|last=MUCHNIC|first=SUZANNE|date=May 8, 1988|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with airplane menus, unpaid invoices, pizza dough, pornographic pulp novels, newspapers, stamps, supermarket flyers, and cookie jars, among other eccentricities. It also included significant works of art, such as [[George Bellows]]'s ''[[Miss Bentham]]''.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barber.org.uk/american-acquisition-barber/ |title=American Acquisition |publisher=Barber Institute of Fine Arts |accessdate=February 16, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217000620/http://barber.org.uk/american-acquisition-barber/ |archivedate=February 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his main collections was his [[wig]]s. Warhol owned more than 40 and felt very protective of his hairpieces, which were sewn by a New York wig-maker from hair imported from Italy. In 1985 a girl snatched Warhol's wig off his head. It was later discovered in Warhol's diary entry for that day that he wrote: "I don't know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony."

Another item found in Warhol's boxes at the museum in Pittsburgh was a [[mummy|mummified]] human foot from [[Ancient Egypt]]. The curator of anthropology at [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] felt that Warhol most likely found it at a flea market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inktank.fi/the-5-most-unusual-habits-of-andy-warhol/ |title=The 5 most unusual habits of Andy Warhol |publisher=Inktank.fi |date=November 20, 2012 |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol died in Manhattan at 6:32&amp;nbsp;a.m. on February 22, 1987 at age 58. According to news reports, he had been making a good recovery from [[gallbladder]] surgery at [[New York Hospital]] before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative [[cardiac arrhythmia|irregular heartbeat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/nyregion/hospital-asserts-it-gave-warhol-adequate-care.html |first=Robert O. |last=Boorstin |title=Hospital Asserts it Gave Warhol Adequate Care |date=April 13, 1987 |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors.&lt;ref name="NYM 1992" /&gt; His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and [[water intoxication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Ronald |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/05/nyregion/care-faulted-in-the-death-of-warhol.html |title=Care faulted in the death of warhol |work=The New York Times |date=December 5, 1991 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-12-24/news/9112240841_1_warhol-york-hospital-gallstones |title=Andy Warhol Heirs Settle Lawsuit With Hospital Over Artist's Death| work= Orlando Sentinel |publisher= |date=December 24, 1991 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before Warhol's death, doctors expected Warhol to survive the surgery, though a revaluation of the case about thirty years after his death showed many indications that Warhol's surgery was in fact riskier than originally thought.&lt;ref name="death-nyt"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gobnik|first1=Blake |title=Warhol's Death: Not So Simple, After All |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/arts/design/andy-warhols-death-not-so-routine-after-all.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=February 22, 2017 | deadurl = No | archivedate = February 22, 2017 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Farts%2Fdesign%2Fandy-warhols-death-not-so-routine-after-all.html%3Faction%3Dclick%26contentCollection%3DU.S.%26module%3DTrending%26version%3DFull%26region%3DMarginalia%26pgtype%3Darticle&amp;date=2017-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely reported at the time that Warhol died of a "routine" surgery, though when considering factors such as his age, a [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] of gallbladder problems, his previous [[Ballistic trauma|gunshot wounds]], and his medical state in the weeks leading up to the procedure, the potential risk of death following the surgery appeared to have been significant.&lt;ref name="death-nyt" /&gt;

Warhol's brothers took his body back to Pittsburgh, where an open-coffin [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] was held at the Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home. The solid bronze casket had gold-plated rails and white upholstery. Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, a platinum wig, and sunglasses. He was laid out holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral liturgy was held at the [[Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church]] on Pittsburgh's [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Side]]. The eulogy was given by Monsignor Peter Tay. [[Yoko Ono]] and [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] were speakers. The coffin was covered with white roses and [[Asparagus aethiopicus|asparagus ferns]]. After the liturgy, the coffin was driven to [[St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery]] in [[Bethel Park, Pennsylvania|Bethel Park]], a south suburb of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 49627). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the grave, the priest said a brief prayer and sprinkled holy water on the casket. Before the coffin was lowered, Paige Powell dropped a copy of ''Interview'' magazine, an ''Interview'' T-shirt, and a bottle of the [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estee Lauder]] perfume "Beautiful" into the grave. Warhol was buried next to his mother and father. A memorial service was held in Manhattan for Warhol on April 1, 1987, at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]].

==Foundation==
Warhol's will dictated that his entire estate—with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members—would go to create a foundation dedicated to the "advancement of the visual arts". Warhol had so many possessions that it took [[Sotheby's]] nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than US$20&amp;nbsp;million.

In 1987, in accordance with Warhol's will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts began. The foundation serves as the estate of Andy Warhol, but also has a mission "to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process" and is "focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature."&lt;ref name="warholfoundation intro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholfoundation.org/foundation/overview.html|title=Introduction |publisher=The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, Warhol was portrayed by [[Crispin Glover]] in [[Oliver Stone]]'s film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'' (1991), by [[David Bowie]] in [[Julian Schnabel]]'s film ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' (1996), and by [[Jared Harris]] in [[Mary Harron]]'s film ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'' (1996).

Warhol appears as a character in [[Michael Daugherty]]'s opera ''[[Jackie O (the opera)|Jackie O]]'' (1997). Actor Mark Bringleson makes a brief cameo as Warhol in ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' (1997).

Many films by avant-garde cineast [[Jonas Mekas]] have caught the moments of Warhol's life. Sean Gregory Sullivan depicted Warhol in the film ''[[54 (film)|54]]'' (1998). [[Guy Pearce]] portrayed Warhol in the film ''[[Factory Girl (film)|Factory Girl]]'' (2007) about [[Edie Sedgwick]]'s life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|author= Hickenlooper, George |title=Factory Girl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Greg Travis]] portrays Warhol in a brief scene from the film ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' (2009).

Agent W is desperate to end his undercover job ("I'm so out of ideas I'm painting soup cans and bananas, for Christ sakes!", "You gotta fake my death, okay? I can't listen to sitar music anymore." and "I can't tell the girls from the boys.").

Andy Warhol (portrayed by [[Tom Meeten]]) is one of main characters of the 2012 British television show ''[[Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy]]''. The character is portrayed as having robot-like mannerisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">The '''Antwerp School''' was a school of artists active in [[Antwerp]], first during the 16th century when the city was the economic center of the [[Low Countries]], and then during the 17th century when it became the artistic stronghold of the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] under [[Peter Paul Rubens]].

==History==
Antwerp took over from [[Bruges]] as the main trading and commercial center of the [[Low Countries]] around 1500. Painters, artists and craftsmen joined the [[Guild of Saint Luke]], which educated apprentices and guaranteed quality.

The first school of artists that emerged in the city were the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]], a group of anonymous late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] painters active in the city from about 1500 to 1520. They were followed by [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painters in the Italian tradition that developed at the end of the [[High Renaissance]]. [[Jan Gossaert]] was a major artist in the city at this time. Other artists, such as [[Frans Floris]], continued this style.

The [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] riots ('[[Beeldenstorm]]' in Dutch) of 1566 that preceded the [[Dutch Revolt]] resulted in the destruction of many works of religious art, after which time the churches and monasteries had to be refurnished and redecorated. Artists such as [[Otto van Veen]] and members of the [[Francken]] family, working in a late mannerist style, provided new religious decoration. It also marked a beginning of economic decline in the city, as the [[Scheldt]] river was blockaded by the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1585 diminishing trade.

[[File:Paul de Vos, Ark van Noah.jpg|thumb|left|Paul de Vos, ''Ark van Noah'']]The city experienced an artistic renewal in the 17th century. The large workshops of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jacob Jordaens]], and the influence of [[Anthony van Dyck]], made Antwerp the center of the Flemish Baroque.  The city was an internationally significant publishing centre, and had a huge production of [[old master print]]s and book illustrations.  Antwerp ''[[animalier]]s'' or animal painters, such as [[Frans Snyders]], [[Jan Fyt]] and [[Paul de Vos]] dominated this speciality in Europe for at least the first half of the century.  Many artists joined the [[Guild of Romanists]], a society for which having visited Rome was a condition of membership. But as the economy continued to decline, and the [[Habsburg]] Governors and the Church reduced their patronage, many artists trained in Antwerp left for the Netherlands, England, France or elsewhere, and by the end of the 17th century Antwerp was no longer a major centre for art.

The artistic legacy of Antwerp is represented in many museums, and paintings of the Antwerp School are valued at [[auction]]s.

[[File:The Bard.jpg|thumb|''The Bard'' (ca. 1817), by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]]]
In medieval [[Gaels|Gaelic]] and [[Britons (historical)|British]] culture, a '''bard''' was a professional [[Storytelling|story teller]], verse-maker and music composer, employed by a patron (such as a monarch or noble), to commemorate one or more of the patron's ancestors and to praise the patron's own activities.

Originally a specific, lower class of poet, contrasting with the higher rank known as ''[[fili]]'' in Ireland and Highland Scotland, with the decline of living [[bardic tradition]] in the modern period the term "bard" acquired generic meanings of an author or [[minstrel]], especially a famous one. For example, [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], are known as "the Bard of Avon" and "the Bard of Bengal" respectively.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of English"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of English&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work of Rabindranath Tagore celebrated in London - BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-33543786|website=BBC News|accessdate=15 July 2015|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - Beardna.jpg|thumb|left|230px|'Beardna,' a loanword of Celtic origin]]
The word is a Celtic [[loan word]] from [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''bàrd'', Irish ''bard'', Welsh ''bardd''. In 16th-century Scotland, it was a derogatory term for an [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] musician; nonetheless it was later romanticised by Sir [[Walter Scott]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of English"/&gt;

==Origin==
In medieval [[Gaels|Gaelic]] and [[Wales|Welsh]] society, a ''bard'' ([[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]] and Irish Gaelic) or ''bardd'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]) was a professional poet, employed to compose [[Eulogy|eulogies]] for his [[lord]] (see [[Planxty#Etymology|planxty]]). If the employer failed to pay the proper amount, the bard would then compose a satire (c.f. ''[[fili]]'', ''[[fáith]]''). In other Indo-European societies, the same function was fulfilled by [[skald]]s, [[rhapsode]]s, [[minstrel]]s and ''[[scop]]s'', among others. A hereditary caste of professional poets in [[Proto-Indo-European society]] has been reconstructed by comparison of the position of poets in medieval Ireland and in ancient India in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Litchfield West, ''Indo-European poetry and myth'', Oxford University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-19-928075-9}}, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bards (who are not the same as the Irish 'filidh' or 'fili') were those who sang the songs recalling the tribal warriors' deeds of bravery as well as the genealogies and family histories of the ruling strata among [[Celt]]ic societies. The pre-Christian Celtic peoples recorded no written histories; however, Celtic peoples did maintain an intricate oral history committed to memory and transmitted by bards and filid. Bards facilitated the memorisation of such materials by the use of [[Metre (poetry)|metre]], [[Rhyme#Function of rhyme|rhyme]] and other formulaic poetic devices.

One of the most notable bards in Irish Mythological was [[Amergin Glúingel]], he was bard, druid and judge for the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]].

==History==

===Ireland===
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
{{See also|Bardic poetry}}
In medieval Ireland, bards were one of two distinct groups of poets, the other being the ''[[fili]]''. According to the [[Early Irish law]] text on status, ''[[Uraicecht Becc]]'', bards were a lesser class of poets, not eligible for higher poetic roles as described above. However, it has also been argued that the distinction between ''filid'' (pl. of ''fili'') and bards was a creation of Christian Ireland, and that the ''filid'' were more associated with the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/articles/onbards.html|title=On Bards, And Bardic Circles|website=www.pbm.com|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breatnach"&gt;Breatnach, Liam. ''[[Uraicecht na Ríar]]'', ca. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- this should have some publication data or a URḶ if at all possible --&gt; By the Early Modern Period, these names came to be used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergin|first1=Osborn|title=Irish Bardic Poetry|publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|location=Dublin|pages=3–5|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/bardic.html|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish bards formed a professional hereditary [[caste]] of highly trained, learned poets. The bards were steeped in the history and traditions of [[clan]] and country, as well as in the technical requirements of a verse technique that was [[Syllabic verse|syllabic]] and used [[assonance]], [[half rhyme]] and [[alliteration]], among other conventions. As officials of the court of king or chieftain, they performed a number of official roles. They were [[chronicle]]rs and [[Satire|satirists]] whose job it was to praise their employers and damn those who crossed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://irishempire.org/news/travel-roots/druids-filid-bards-custodians-of-celtic-tradition/25|title=Druids, Filid &amp; Bards: Custodians of Celtic Tradition|last=Empire|first=Irish|website=irishempire.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that a well-aimed bardic satire, ''glam dicenn'', could raise boils on the face of its target.

The bardic system lasted until the mid-17th century in Ireland and the early 18th century in Scotland. In Ireland, their fortunes had always been linked to the Gaelic aristocracy, which declined along with them during the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor Reconquest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.historyireland.com/early-modern-history-1500-1700/divided-gaels-gaelic-cultural-identities-in-scotland-and-ireland-c-1200-c-1650/|title=Divided Gaels: Gaelic cultural identities in Scotland and Ireland c. 1200–c. 1650|date=2013-02-22|work=History Ireland|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early history of the bards can be known only indirectly through mythological stories. The first mention of the bardic profession in Ireland is found in the [[Lebor Gabála Érenn|Book of Invasions]], in a story about the Irish colony of [[Tuatha De Danann]] (Peoples of Goddess Danu), also called Danonians. They became the ''[[aos sí]]'' (folk of the mound), comparable to Norse ''[[alfr]]'' and British [[fairy]]. During the tenth year of the reign of the last Belgic monarch, the people of the colony of Tuatha De Danann, as the Irish called it, invaded and settled in Ireland. They were divided into three tribes—the tribe of Tuatha who were the nobility, the tribe of De who were the priests (those devoted to serving God or De) and the tribe of Danann, who were the bards. This account of the Tuatha De Danann must be considered legendary; however the story was an integral part of the oral history of Irish bards themselves.

===Scotland===
{{Further information|MacMhuirich bardic family}}
The best-known group of bards in Scotland were the members of the MacMhuirich family, who flourished from the 15th to the 18th centuries. The family was centred in the [[Hebrides]], and claimed descent from a 13th-century Irish bard who, according to legend, was exiled to Scotland. The family was at first chiefly employed by the [[Lords of the Isles]] as poets, lawyers, and physicians.&lt;ref name="Clancy-453"/&gt; With the fall of the Lordship of the Isles in the 15th century, the family was chiefly employed by the [[Scottish clan chief|chiefs]] of the [[Clan Macdonald of Clanranald|MacDonalds of Clanranald]]. Members of the family were also recorded as musicians in the early 16th century, and as clergymen possibly as early as the early 15th century.&lt;ref name="Thomson-61"&gt;{{citation |author=Thomson, Derick S. |authorlink=Derick Thomson |title=Gaelic Learned Orders and Literati in Medieval Scotland |journal=Scottish Studies |publisher=The Journal of the School of Scottish Studies University of Edinburgh |year=1968 |volume=12 |issue=1 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the family to practise classical Gaelic poetry was Domhnall MacMhuirich, who lived on [[South Uist]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Clancy-453"&gt;{{citation |last=Clancy |first=Thomas Owen |authorlink=Thomas Owen Clancy |contribution=Clann MacMhuirich |title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia |editor1-last=Koch |editor1-first=John T. |editor1-link=John T. Koch |year=2006 |location=[[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=1-85109-445-8 |page=453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wales===
{{further information|Dryw|Book of Taliesin}}
A number of bards in [[Welsh mythology]] have been preserved in [[medieval Welsh literature]] such as the [[Red Book of Hergest]], the [[White Book of Rhydderch]], the [[Book of Aneirin]] and the [[Book of Taliesin]]. The bards [[Aneirin]] and [[Taliesin]] may be legendary reflections of historical bards active in the 6th and 7th centuries.
Very little historical information about [[Dark Age Wales|Dark Age Welsh]] court tradition survives, but the Middle Welsh material came to be the nucleus of the [[Matter of Britain]] and [[Arthurian legend]] as they developed from the 13th century. The (Welsh) Laws of Hywel Dda, originally compiled around 900 A.D, identify a bard as a member of a king's household. His duties, when the bodyguard were sharing out booty, included the singing of the sovereignty of Britain—possibly why the genealogies of the British high kings survived into the written historical record.

The royal form of bardic tradition ceased in the 13th century, when the 1282 [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|Edwardian conquest]] permanently ended the rule of the Welsh princes. The legendary suicide of ''The Last Bard'' (c. 1283), was commemorated in the poem ''[[The Bards of Wales]]'' by the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] poet [[János Arany]] in 1857, as a way of encoded resistance to the suppressive politics of his own time. However, the poetic and musical traditions were continued throughout the Middle Ages, e.g., by noted 14th-century poets [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]] and [[Iolo Goch]]. The tradition of regularly assembling bards at an [[eisteddfod]] never lapsed, and was strengthened by formation of the [[Gorsedd]] by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in 1792, establishing Wales as the major Celtic upholder of bardic tradition in the 21st century. Many regular ''eisteddfodau'' are held in Wales, including the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] which was instituted in 1861 and has been held annually since 1880. Many Welsh schools conduct their own annual versions at which bardic traditions are emulated.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [http://stjulians.realsmartcloud.com/our-eisteddfod/ Our Eisteddfod] at St Julian's School, Newport, 19 March 2013. Accessed 20 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical and poetic traditions of the Welsh bards are perpetuated by the [[Gorsedd|Gorsedd of bards]] and through the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] (''Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru'').

==Literature==

[[File:Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy Y, 1825, object 54, The Voice of the Ancient Bard (Metropolitan Museum of Art).jpg|thumb|upright|William Blake's hand painted engraving of his poem "[[The Voice of the Ancient Bard]]" in the ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'']]

From its frequent use in Romanticism, 'The Bard' became attached as a title to various  poets,
* 'The Bard of Armagh' is [[Martin Hearty]]
* 'The Bard of Avon,' 'The Immortal Bard' (or in England, simply 'The Bard') is [[William Shakespeare]]
* 'The Bard of Ayrshire' (or in Scotland, simply 'The Bard') is [[Robert Burns]]
* 'The Bard of Bengal' is [[Rabindranath Tagore]]
* 'The Bard of Olney' is [[William Cowper]]
* 'The Bard of Rydal Mount' is [[William Wordsworth]]
* 'The Bard of Salford' is [[John Cooper Clarke]]
* 'The Bard of Twickenham' is [[Alexander Pope]]
* Australian [[bush poet]]s such as [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]] are referred to as "bush bards"
* [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jim MacCool]] and the band [[Blind Guardian]] have also been termed 'bards'

From its Romanticist usage, the notion of the bard as a minstrel with qualities of a priest, magician or seer also entered the [[fantasy]] genre in the 1960s to 1980s, for example as the 'Bard' class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons),"Bard" class (Pathfinder RPG - Paizo), ''Bard'' by [[Keith Taylor (author)|Keith Taylor]] (1981), ''[[Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish]]'' by [[Morgan Llywelyn]] (1984), and in video games in fantasy settings such as ''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|The Bard's Tale]]'' (1985).

==Portraits==
The artist, initially unidentified, was eventually revealed to be Conor Casby, a school teacher in his thirties from Claremorris, [[County Mayo]].&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt; The first portrait was surreptitiously hung in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]] on 7 March 2009.&lt;ref name=teacher_questioned/&gt; Casby is said to have entered the National Gallery carrying a shoulder bag,&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt; and located a free space for his portrait and its caption among other portraits of prominent Irish people such as [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[W. B. Yeats]], and [[Bono]].&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt; Casby then left the building unnoticed by security.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt; It was reported as having read: &lt;blockquote&gt;Brian Cowen, Politician 1960–2008. This portrait, acquired uncommissioned by the National Gallery, celebrates one of the finest politicians produced by Ireland since the foundation of the state. Following a spell at the helm of the Department of Finance during a period of unprecedented prosperity, Brian Cowen inherited the office of Taoiseach in 2008. Balancing a public image that ranges from fantastically intelligent analytical thinker to Big Ignorant Fucker from Offaly, the Taoiseach proves to be a challenging subject to represent.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The National Gallery called gardaí after it discovered the unauthorised painting. It has claimed that it had been hanging in public view for no more than twenty minutes before it was removed,&lt;ref name=could_be_charged&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7964096.stm|title=Cowen artist 'could be charged'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230238/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7964096.stm|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; contradicting the ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'''s claim that it hung for over an hour.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt;

The following day, 8 March, Casby hung a second painting of Cowen in the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] (RHA). A woman attempted to buy the RHA portrait before it was removed.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt;&lt;ref name=stunt_story_nut_hammer&gt;{{cite news|first=Ken |last=Foxe |url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/mar/29/a-stunt-a-story-a-nut-and-a-hammer/ |title=A stunt, a story, a nut and a hammer |newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]] |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331022003/http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/mar/29/a-stunt-a-story-a-nut-and-a-hammer/ |archivedate=31 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the RHA painting, he is holding a pair of blue and white underpants in his left hand.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt; In the other, he is clutching a [[toilet paper|toilet roll]].&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7960997.stm|title=Naked taoiseach paintings removed|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=24 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230406/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7960997.stm|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt;

==Media reports==
''Sunday Tribune'' reporter Ken Foxe was contacted by a source at the National Gallery on 9 March and was the first to break the story of Cowen's portraits. Subsequently, "Topsy Campbell" (a pseudonym for Casby) sent [[camera phone]] photographs of the paintings on display.&lt;ref name=stunt_story_nut_hammer/&gt; The incidents were first reported in the ''Tribune'' of 22 March.&lt;ref name=stunt_story_nut_hammer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Foxe|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/mar/22/cowen-hung-out-to-dry-in-national-gallery-hijack/#image_1|title=Cowen hung out to dry in National Gallery hijack|newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]]|date=22 March 2009|accessdate=1 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327191317/http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/mar/22/cowen-hung-out-to-dry-in-national-gallery-hijack/#image_1|archivedate=27 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RTÉ===
On 23 March, [[state broadcaster]] [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] ran a report on the hangings at the end of the ''[[RTÉ News: Nine O'Clock|Nine O'Clock News]]''. The report by Tadhg Enright displayed the paintings, obtained an appraisal (of zero) from an art expert, and mentioned that Cowen was "not thought to have posed for the anonymous artist".&lt;ref name=before_complaint&gt;{{cite news|first=Ronan|last=McGreevy|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0326/1224243451815.html|title=Cowen not consulted before complaint to RTÉ|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was not used on subsequent newscasts. On 24 March, the Nine O'Clock News included an apology "for any personal offence caused to Mr Cowen or his family or for any disrespect shown to the office of Taoiseach by [the prior] broadcast."&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0325/breaking38.htm|title=Gardaí visit radio station in Cowen painting inquiry|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=28 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230609/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/garda%C3%AD-visit-radio-station-in-cowen-painting-inquiry-1.838054|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original item was removed from the online archives at [[RTÉ.ie]], and the apology added.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt;

===Today FM===
On 24 March, ''[[The Ray D'Arcy Show]]'' on commercial radio station [[Today FM]], covered the story. Producer [[Will Hanafin]] revealed that a friend of the artist had e-mailed photographs of a similarly styled painting to him in January, a caricature of the Taoiseach urinating in a full frontal nude pose. This painting has not been displayed publicly.&lt;ref name=producer_reaction/&gt; A Garda detective visited the station requesting the emails.&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt; The Garda was said to have been "sheepish and apologetic" about the visit but indicated that he had received an order from "on high" to initiate an investigation.&lt;ref name=producer_reaction/&gt; Hanafin refused to comply with the Garda request and, being told that a [[search warrant]] would be sought,&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; labelled the entire affair as "crazy".&lt;ref name=producer_reaction&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.ie/ireland/idqlqleysn/|title=Today FM producer brands reaction 'crazy'|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=28 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302224032/http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/idqlqleysn/|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abroad===
The incident was covered by foreign newspapers, including ''[[The Times]]'' of London.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Sharrock|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5971027.ece|title=Brian Cowen is exposed to ridicule by art gallery guerrilla|newspaper=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also covered in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;

===Online===
Blogs and [[social network service]]s such as Twitter were reported to be popular outlets for members of the general public to express their dissatisfaction at the attempted censorship and apology of RTÉ.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; A YouTube video of the original RTÉ news report had received more than three thousand views within twenty-four hours.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; The affair was nicknamed "Picturegate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/12591/digital-life/picturegate-has-web-in-uproar|title=Irish internet in uproar over Picturegate censorship|work=Silicon Republic|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=26 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230815/http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/12591/digital-life/picturegate-has-web-in-uproar|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Cowengate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cearta.ie/2009/03/cowengate-and-freedom-of-expression/|title=Cowengate and Freedom of Expression|work=cearta.ie|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=26 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230929/http://www.cearta.ie/2009/03/cowengate-and-freedom-of-expression/|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in online discussions.

==Garda investigation==
The Garda investigation was said to have taken six hours. The possible crimes were offending [[decency]], [[Hate speech#Ireland|incitement to hatred]], and [[criminal damage]] for nailing the painting to the wall&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; (though it has also been reported that paintings were hung without the use of nails)&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/artdesign/story/2009/03/27/cowen-nudes.html?ref=rss|title=Artist behind naughty nudes of Irish PM emerges|work=CBC News|date=27 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators telephoned Casby and he entered Pearse Street Garda Station where he was interviewed for two hours, admitted to having hung the two paintings and was subsequently released.&lt;ref name=teacher_questioned&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0325/cowenb.html|title=Teacher questioned over Cowen paintings|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave gardaí five more portraits of other politicians, including [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]].&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;&lt;ref name=stunt_story_nut_hammer/&gt; A file was prepared for the [[Director of public prosecutions#Ireland|director of public prosecutions]], but it is expected that no charges will be brought.&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt; Casby expressed his desire to "draw an end" to the matter by auctioning the paintings for charity.&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;

==Political reaction==
The incidents attracted comment from politicians.

The RTÉ News report was criticised as being in bad taste by [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Seanad Éireann|Senators]] [[Maria Corrigan]] and [[Mary O'Rourke]] and [[Teachta Dála|TDs]] [[M. J. Nolan]] and [[Michael Kennedy (Dublin politician)|Michael Kennedy]]. [[Fine Gael]] TD [[Michael W. D'Arcy]] called it the "most distasteful report I have seen on RTÉ in years".&lt;ref name=before_complaint/&gt; Kennedy urged consideration for the feelings of Cowen's wife and children, and called on [[Director-General of RTÉ]] [[Cathal Goan]] to resign, but did not advocate charging the artist.&lt;ref name=producer_reaction/&gt;

Some suggested the government had put pressure on RTÉ to withdraw the report and apologise, or on Today FM to co-operate with the Garda. The station received several complaints that the report was in bad taste, including one from the government press secretary, Eoghan Ó Neachtain, who claimed he was acting on his own initiative.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; [[Fine Gael]]'s [[Enda Kenny]]&lt;ref name="Ceann Comhairle exasperated as Kenny fails to see the bigger picture"&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=O'Regan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0327/1224243552769.html|title=Ceann Comhairle exasperated as Kenny fails to see the bigger picture|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=27 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302231103/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/ceann-comhairle-exasperated-as-kenny-fails-to-see-the-bigger-picture-1.731374|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Flanagan]] called it a restriction on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]].&lt;ref name=teacher_questioned/&gt;&lt;ref name=opposition_pressure&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0326/cowenb.html|title=Opposition slams Govt over portrait pressure|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=28 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302231227/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0326/115596-cowenb/|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liz McManus]] of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] criticised RTÉ for "bow[ing] to political pressure".&lt;ref name=opposition_pressure/&gt; RTÉ claimed the decision to withdraw the report was taken by RTÉ executives, and that Ó Neachtain's complaint was received after the late-night ''[[RTÉ News on Two|News on Two]]'' had already been broadcast without the report.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt;

Some criticised the Garda investigation as a waste of resources. Fine Gael's [[Frances Fitzgerald (Irish politician)|Frances FitzGerald]] said it was "over the top"; [[Rónán Mullen]] defended it as appropriate.&lt;ref name=opposition_pressure/&gt; Labour's [[Joan Burton]] said "While I sympathise with the Taoiseach and his family, the public has noticed that it took gardaí six months to [[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy|go into the Anglo Irish Bank]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/mar/29/it-took-gardai-six-months-to-go-into-anglo-irish-r/ |title='It took Gardaí six months to go into Anglo Irish': reaction to cowengate |date=29 March 2009 |newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]] |accessdate=1 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402180945/http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/mar/29/it-took-gardai-six-months-to-go-into-anglo-irish-r/ |archivedate= 2 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidents are referred to in the 2009 episode of ''[[Reeling in the Years]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/reelingintheyears/2009.html|title=The 2000s: 2009|work=Reeling in the Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, it was reported that both paintings were on display in Sean Mac D's pub in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/naked-brian-cowen-pictures-make-a-comeback-80608-Feb2011/|title=Naked Brian Cowen pictures make a comeback|publisher=TheJournal.ie|date=9 June 2013 |accessdate=27 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230102/http://www.thejournal.ie/naked-brian-cowen-pictures-make-a-comeback-80608-Feb2011/|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DV8 Physical Theatre''' (or Dance Visual 8) is a [[physically integrated dance]] company based at [[Artsadmin]] in [[London]], United Kingdom. It was officially founded in 1986 by [[Lloyd Newson]] (1986-2015), Michelle Richecoeur (1986-1988) and Nigel Charnock (1986-1989, 1992). [[Lloyd Newson]] has led the company as choreographer and artistic director since its inception, apart from the production ''My Sex, Our Dance'' (1986), which was co-created and performed with Nigel Charnock.

DV8's work is characterised by the desire to communicate ideas and feelings clearly and very pretentiously, often with a focus on socio-political issues. The work challenges the limitations of dance by using any means necessary to find the most appropriate way to say something, thereby incorporating elements of theatre, dance, film, and, increasingly, text.&lt;ref name="DV8 Physical Theatre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theatreanddance.britishcouncil.org/artists-and-companies/profiles/dv8-physical-theatre/|title=DV8 Physical Theatre|work=Theatre and Dance}}&lt;/ref&gt; DV8 has toured work in the UK and to 28 countries worldwide, and received 55 national and international awards.&lt;ref name="dv8.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dv8.co.uk/awards|title=Awards|work=dv8.co.uk|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundation and Early Work===
Lloyd Newson founded DV8 Physical Theatre in 1986 in response to his frustration with the lack of subject matter in contemporary dance.  He felt audiences were being ‘conned about the depth’ of (much) contemporary dance, which he saw as generally superficial; obsessed with 'aesthetics over content'.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsKtaMrxguE|title=DV8 Physical Theatre - Company Promo|date=10 March 2015|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first work Newson produced with the new company was made in partnership with Nigel Charnock, and was titled ''My Sex, Our Dance'' (1986); it tackled the emergence of AIDS and investigated the idea of trust, both emotionally and physically, between two gay men.&lt;ref name="Arditti"&gt;{{cite news | last = Arditti

All three works toured the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dv8.co.uk/projects/archive/elemen-three-sex/about|title=ELEMEN T(H)REE SEX|work=dv8.co.uk|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dv8.co.uk/projects/archive/deep-end|title=DEEP END|work=dv8.co.uk|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''My Sex, Our Dance'' and ''Deep End'' were also performed in New York as part of the Next Wave Festival (held at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]]) in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The next work for the company was ''My Body, Your Body'' (1987), which explored the psychology of women who seek out relationships with abusive men. It was based on an audio recording of a close female friend of Newson’s and the book, Women Who Love Too Much by [[Robin Norwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1988, Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men was created for the stage and, two years later, adapted for film – the first of several made by the company. The production drew inspiration from the book, Killing for Company, about serial killer [[Dennis Nielsen]].&lt;ref name="Arditti"/&gt; It garnered numerous awards for DV8, including the [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] Dance Award and the [[Evening Standard]] Ballet Award, both in 1989.&lt;ref name="Bremser 2011 303"&gt;{{cite book

===1990 - 2000===

After Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men, Newson began to develop a more poetic style, involving increasingly complex sets.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;  He stated at the time that he was ‘fatigued by the bruising physicality’ that marked DV8’s work from 1986-1989.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;  The first of these works was ''If Only…'' (1990), which won the Golden Pegasus Award at the Melbourne International Festival (1990).&lt;ref name="Bremser 2011 303"/&gt; ''Strange Fish'' (1992) followed, featuring Wendy Houstoun&lt;ref name="Judith"/&gt; alongside Nigel Charnock and singer [[Melanie Pappenheim]].

Throughout the 1990s, DV8 continued to produce work that was critically well received and popular with audiences.  The [[BBC]] film version of [[Enter Achilles]] (1995) won a Prix Italia and an International [[Emmy Award]] in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Recent Work===

In 2004-5, DV8 created ''Just for Show'', the first of a series of co-productions with the [[National Theatre (UK)|National Theatre]] (London).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a significant new relationship in terms of the company’s cross-genre position between increasingly arbitrary categories of “dance” and “theatre”.

The next production, ''To Be Straight With You'' (2007), marked a move by Newson into [[verbatim theatre]] – setting minutely-detailed movement to the real (edited) words of real people. To create the script, 85 people of varying ethnicities and sexuality were interviewed by Newson and his researcher, Anshu Rastogi, about their experiences and views concerning religion, culture and homosexuality.

''Can We Talk About This?'' (2011–12), a second verbatim production, dealt with freedom of speech, censorship and Islam. It drew on existing interviews as well as those conducted by Newson himself, and involved people associated with the burning of author [[Salman Rushdie|Salman Rushdie’s]] [[Satanic Verses]] and associates of film-maker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], who was murdered by Dutch Islamist, [[Mohammed Bouyeri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

DV8’s most recent work, ''JOHN'' (2014) follows the life-story of a man, the eponymous title character, played by Hannes Langolf. It traces his criminality, drug use, personal relationships, efforts at rehabilitation and desire to lead an ordinary life. Again co-produced with the [[National Theatre (UK)|National Theatre]], it was broadcast to cinemas worldwide through the [[NT Live]] programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntlive.nationaltheatre.org.uk/productions/47625-john|title=JOHN|work=nationaltheatre.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 12th January 2016, the company announced that artistic director Lloyd Newson was taking time out to reflect about the future. Due to this the company confirmed that the production of new work was to be paused indefinitely. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Style==
DV8’s work is characterised by a desire to take risks, to question people’s attitudes and beliefs, to dissolve barriers that separate art forms, and ultimately to communicate ideas and feelings clearly and unpretentiously. The company frequently addresses pertinent social topics, such as freedom of speech, human rights, multiculturalism, tolerance/intolerance, gender roles, sexual identity and social class, as well as personal issues.&lt;ref name="DV8 Physical Theatre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;
	
DV8’s work seeks to use the most appropriate means available to serve its mission. Thus, its productions have incorporated elements of dance, naturalistic movement, video, circus skills and more recently, verbatim text.&lt;ref name="DV8 Physical Theatre"/&gt;

==Funding and Production==
DV8 Physical Theatre receives funding through Arts Council England’s National Portfolio programme, as well as occasional project support from the British Council.&lt;ref name="DV8 Physical Theatre"/&gt; It has toured work extensively in the UK and Europe, and further afield to Australia, the USA, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan. Many of its long-term co-production partners are theatres and festivals from across the world. It is an [[Artsadmin]] associate company,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.artsadmin.co.uk/artists/dv8-physical-theatre&lt;/ref&gt; and also a member of the ITC, Dance UK and IETM. Newson has often stated that the company is motivated by artistic inspiration and creative need, rather than financial, organisational and touring demands.&lt;ref name="DV8 Physical Theatre"/&gt;

==Works==
It has thus far produced 18 works for the stage,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dv8.co.uk/about-dv8&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of which have toured internationally, and four award-winning films adapted from stage performances.

'''''Dau al set''''' was a [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[avant-garde]] magazine founded in September 1948 by [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]] and directed by [[Joan Ponç]]. The magazine was produced by the artistic group [[Dau al Set]]. It was the continuation of another magazine called ''[[Algol (magazine)]]'' published by the same group. The magazine had eight pages measuring {{convert|250|x|175|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The texts were written in Catalan and Spanish. The magazine continued publishing numbers until December 1951.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"&gt;TORRENT, Joan; TASIS, Rafael. Història de la premsa catalana. Barcelona: Bruguera, 1966.(volume  I- pp. 907-908)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and Collaborators==
At the beginning, the magazine followed [[Dadaism]] and the authors expressed their hatred towards society. Later on, it evolved a new surrealistic attitude. Due to this variety and evolution, in 1950, the magazine became a space where everybody could follow innovative artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclop%C3%A8dies/gran-enciclop%C3%A8dia-catalana/EC-GEC-0021566.xml?s.q=dau+al+set#.UwSAGGJ5P7A|title=Dau al Set |work=Gran Enciclopèdia Catalan|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dau al Set'' was a Catalan avant-garde group formed by poet [[Joan Brossa]], the philosopher Arnau Puig and the painters [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Joan Pons]], [[Modest Cuixart]] and [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]].

Contributors to the magazine included [[Joan Brossa]], Arnau Puig, [[J. E. Cirlot]], A. Cirici Pellicer, [[Jean Cocteau]], Àngel Ferrant, J. V. Foix, [[Francis Picabia]], Cesàreo Rodríguez Aguilera, Enrique Sordo and [[Michel Tapié]]. The magazine offered drawings by [[Modest Cuixart]], Joan Ponç, [[Antoni Tàpies]] and [[Joan Josep Tharrats]].

The [[Museum of Modern Art]] ratred the magazine as one of the 20 best avant-garde magazines from the 20th century.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7170">'''Design for assembly''' ('''DFA''') is a process by which [[product design|products are designed]] with ease of [[Manufacturing|assembly]] in mind.  If a product contains fewer parts it will take less time to assemble, thereby reducing assembly costs.  In addition, if the parts are provided with features which make it easier to grasp, move, orient and insert them, this will also reduce assembly time and assembly costs.  The reduction of the number of parts in an assembly has the added benefit of generally reducing the total cost of parts in the assembly.  This is usually where the major cost benefits of the application of design for assembly occur.

==Approaches==
Design for assembly can take different forms.  In the 1960s and 1970s various rules and recommendations were proposed in order to help designers consider assembly problems during the design process.  Many of these rules and recommendations were presented together with practical examples showing how assembly difficulty could be improved.  However, it was not until the 1970s that numerical evaluation methods were developed to allow design for assembly studies to be carried out on existing and proposed designs.

The first evaluation method was developed at [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] and was called the Assembly Evaluation Method (AEM).&lt;ref&gt;Miyakawa, S. and Ohashi, T., "The Hitachi Assembly Evaluation Method (AEM)," Proc. International Conference on Product Design for Assembly, Newport, Rhode Island, April 15–17, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  This method is based on the principle of "one motion for one part." For more complicated motions, a point-loss standard is used and the ease of assembly of the whole product is evaluated by subtracting points lost.  The method was originally developed in order to rate assemblies for ease of automatic assembly.

Starting in 1977, Geoff Boothroyd, supported by an NSF grant at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], developed the Design for Assembly method (DFA), which could be used to estimate the time for manual assembly of a product and the cost of assembling the product on an automatic assembly machine.&lt;ref&gt;Boothroyd, G., "Design for Assembly – A Designer's Handbook", Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Nov. 1980.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognizing that the most important factor in reducing assembly costs was the minimization of the number of separate parts in a product, he introduced three simple criteria which could be used to determine theoretically whether any of the parts in the product could be eliminated or combined with other parts.  These criteria, together with tables relating assembly time to various design factors influencing part grasping, orientation and insertion, could be used to estimate total assembly time and to rate the quality of a product design from an assembly viewpoint.  For automatic assembly, tables of factors could be used to estimate the cost of automatic feeding and orienting and automatic insertion of the parts on an assembly machine.

In the 1980s and 1990s, variations of the AEM and DFA methods have been proposed, namely:  the GE Hitachi method which is based on the AEM and DFA; the Lucas method, the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] method and several others which were based on the original DFA method. All methods are now referred to as ''design for assembly'' methods.

==Implementation==
Most products are assembled manually and the original DFA method for manual assembly is the most widely used method and has had the greatest industrial impact throughout the world.

The DFA method, like the AEM method, was originally made available in the form of a handbook where the user would enter data on worksheets to obtain a rating for the ease of assembly of a product.  Starting in 1981, Geoffrey Boothroyd and Peter Dewhurst developed a computerized version of the DFA method which allowed its implementation in a broad range of companies.  For this work they were presented with many awards including the [[National Medal of Technology]].  There are many published examples of significant savings obtained through the application of DFA.  For example, in 1981, Sidney Liebson, manager of manufacturing engineering for [[Xerox]], estimated that his company would save hundreds of millions of dollars through the application of DFA.&lt;ref&gt;Boothroyd, G., "Design for assembly: The Road to Higher productivity", Assembly Engineering, March, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, [[Ford Motor Company]] credited the software with overall savings approaching $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Henchy, L.W., "American Manufacturing Fights Back", Business Solutions, Feb. 22, 1988, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;  In many companies DFA is a corporate requirement and DFA software is continually being adopted by companies attempting to obtain greater control over their manufacturing costs. There are many key principles in design for assembly&lt;ref&gt;Assembly Automation and Product Design G. Boothroyd, Marcell Dekker, Inc. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Product Design for Manufacture and Assembly G. Boothroyd and P. Dewhurst, Boothroyd Dewhurst, Inc. 1989 Marcell Dekker, Inc. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Design and Analysis of Manufacturing Systems Rajan Suri University of Wisconsin 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Product Design for Assembly: The Methodology Applied G. Lewis and H. Connelly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simultaneous Engineering Study of Phase II Injector Assembly line Giddings &amp; Lewis 1997&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Notable examples==
Two notable examples of good design for assembly are the [[Sony Walkman]] and the [[Swatch]] watch.  Both were designed for fully automated assembly.  The Walkman line was designed for "vertical assembly", in which parts are inserted in straight-down moves only. The Sony SMART assembly system, used to assemble Walkman-type products, is a [[robotic]] system for assembling small devices designed for vertical assembly.

The IBM Proprinter used '''design for automated assembly''' (DFAA) rules.
These DFAA rules help design a product that can be assembled automatically by robots, but they are useful even with products assembled by manual assembly.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture''' (ESALA) is part of [[Edinburgh College of Art]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in Scotland. The school was ranked 5th in the UK in the 2013 Guardian University Guide and 4th in the Complete University Guide, for architecture. In 2016 Edinburgh ranked 3rd in the country for Architecture according to the Complete University Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=Architecture&amp;y=2016 |title= Complete University Guide 2016 |publisher= Complete University Guide |accessdate=2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1907, Edinburgh College of Art was established under the control of Scottish Education Department, after approvement of major reorganisation of Edinburgh higher art education. At the time, Edinburgh College of Art was divided into four schools: Drawing and Painting, Design and Crafts, Architecture, and Sculpture&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/about/our-vision-ethos-and-history "Our Vision, Ethos, and History"]. The University of Edinburgh. Retrieved 2018-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourhistory.is.ed.ac.uk/index.php/Edinburgh_College_of_Art "Our History: Edinburgh College of Art"]. Our History, The University of Edinburgh. Retrieved 2018-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt;. The establishment of the new School of Architecture was initially aimed for the training of architects and artists, which was supported by public subscriptions and foundations. First architecture courses were taught in 1908, in which it experienced numerous changes in teaching staff, structure, syllabus, and its role in the education of architects, in the period from 1908 until 1968. The first Head of the School of Architecture within Edinburgh College of Art was John Watson, appointed in 1908&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=202272 "Scottish Architects"]. Scottish Architects. Retrieved 2018-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt;. Meanwhile, The Forbes Chair of Architecture, which was a joint post with Edinburgh College of Art, was established in 1947, in which Raymond Gordon Brown was the holder of the title as well as the Head of School of Architecture within the University of Edinburgh. Between 1968 and 2004, Edinburgh College of Art enjoyed associate status and awarded degrees of Heriot-Watt University&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usfeatures/universities/eca.html "Awarding Institution"]. Undiscovered Scotland. Retrieved 2018-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since 2004, the University of Edinburgh became the accrediting body for Edinburgh College of Art, in which degrees and programmes obtained at Edinburgh College of Art had been validated by the University of Edinburgh. In 2009, the School of Architecture within the University of Edinburgh merged with Edinburgh College of Art’s School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture to form the Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (ESALA), and established academic federation between the two institutions. From 2009 to 2011, ESALA as a joint school was belonged to both Edinburgh College of Art and the University of Edinburgh’s School of Arts, Culture, and Environments. In 2011, Edinburgh College of Art merged with the University of Edinburgh. As the result, Edinburgh College of Art has combined with the university’s School of Art, Culture, and Environment to form a new enlarged Edinburgh College of Art within the University of Edinburgh’s College of Humanities and Social Sciences&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourhistory.is.ed.ac.uk/index.php/Architecture "History of the School of Architecture"].

'''The Federation of Children's Book Groups''' is a national charity in the [[United Kingdom]] that promotes children's books and reading for pleasure for all ages of children, from newborns to teenagers. The organisation is run by volunteers interested in supporting children and their books, both at a national level, through an executive, and a local level, through local groups, with the support also of individuals and professional members. The Federation liaises with publishers, libraries, schools and other bodies with an interest in literacy, reading and young people. 

The Federation owns and coordinates the [[Red House Children's Book Award]], the UK's only national book award voted for entirely by children.

The Federation promotes [[National Share-a-Story Month]] (every May) and [[National Non-Fiction Day]] (every November). It holds an annual conference each spring (with the help of local groups) as well as various one day regional conferences. The Federation regularly publishes booklists for children of different ages, as well as producing newsletters three times a year, and providing general advice and information on children's books and reading for enjoyment.

In 2011 The Federation of Children's Book Groups won the [[Eleanor Farjeon Award]] for distinguished service to the world of British children's books.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/news/4162_the_federation_of_childrens_book_groups_wins_award&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Anne Wood]], a British children's television producer, and creator of the [[Teletubbies]], established the first Book Group to promote enthusiasm for and about children's book in 1965. Soon more groups were created and the Federation of Children's Book Groups was created in 1968. Many of the original local groups are still in existence, though new groups are developing every year.

==Local Book Groups==
There are currently over 25 separate Book Groups throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Each group is different but typically a local group holds
*Meetings for adults to discuss children's books.
*Events with visiting speakers, including authors and illustrators.
*Activities for children such as storytelling and book exhibitions.

'''''Freedom from Want''''', also known as '''''The Thanksgiving Picture''''' or '''''I'll Be Home for Christmas''''', is the third of the [[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|''Four Freedoms'' series]] of four [[oil painting]]s by American artist [[Norman Rockwell]]. The works were inspired by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1941 [[State of the Union Address]], known as [[Four Freedoms]].

The painting was created in November 1942 and published in the March 6, 1943 issue of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. All of the people in the picture were friends and family of Rockwell in [[Arlington, Vermont|Arlington]], [[Vermont]], who were photographed individually and painted into the scene. The work depicts a group of people gathered around a dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] to depict the celebration, it has become an iconic representation for Americans of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. ''The Post'' published ''Freedom from Want'' with a corresponding essay by [[Carlos Bulosan]] as part of the ''Four Freedoms'' series. Despite many who endured [[sociopolitical]] hardships abroad, Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring the [[socioeconomic]] hardships domestically, and it thrust him into prominence.

The painting has had a wide array of adaptations, parodies, and other uses, such as for the cover for the 1946 book ''Norman Rockwell, Illustrator''.  Although the image was popular at the time in the United States and remains so, it caused resentment in Europe where the masses were enduring wartime hardship. Artistically, the work is highly regarded as an example of mastery of the challenges of white-on-white painting and as one of Rockwell's most famous works.

In mid-June Rockwell sketched in charcoal the ''Four Freedoms'' and sought commission from the [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] (OWI). He was rebuffed by an official who said, "The last war, you illustrators did the posters. This war, we're going to use fine arts men, real artists."&lt;ref name=LaF/&gt; However, ''Saturday Evening Post'' editor, Ben Hibbs, recognized the potential of the set and encouraged Rockwell to produce them right away.&lt;ref name=LaF/&gt; By early fall, the authors for the Four Freedoms had submitted their essays. Rockwell was concerned that ''Freedom from Want''  did not match Bulosan's text.  In mid-November, Hibbs wrote Rockwell pleading that he not scrap his third work to start over. Hibbs alleviated Rockwell's thematic concern; he explained that the illustrations only needed to address the same topic rather than be in unison. Hibbs pressured Rockwell into completing his work by warning him that the magazine was on the verge of being compelled by the government to place restrictions on four-color printing, so Rockwell had better get the work published before relegation to halftone printing.&lt;ref name=C307&gt;{{cite book|title=Norman Rockwell: A Life|chapter=21: The Big Ideas|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2001|author=Claridge, Laura|pages=307–308|isbn=0-375-50453-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''Four Freedoms'' series ran in ''The Saturday Evening Post'', the magazine made sets of reproductions available to the public and received 25,000 orders. Additionally the OWI, which six months earlier had declined to employ Rockwell to promote the Four Freedoms, requested 2.5 million sets of posters featuring the Four Freedoms for its war-bond drive in early 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americainwwii.com/articles/norman-rockwell-and-the-four-freedoms/|title=Norman Rockwell and the Four Freedoms|accessdate=December 17, 2013|author=Heydt, Bruce|work=America in WWII|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockwell bequeathed this painting to a custodianship that became the Norman Rockwell Museum in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]], [[Massachusetts]], and it is now part of the museum's permanent collection.

According to author Amy Dempsey, during the [[Cold War]], Rockwell's images affirmed traditional American values, depicting Americans as prosperous and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Art in the Modern Era|last= Dempsey| first= Amy|isbn=0-8109-4172-4|publisher=Harry N.

Despite Rockwell's general optimism, he had misgivings about having depicted such a large turkey when much of Europe was "starving, overrun [and] displaced" as [[World War II]] raged.&lt;ref name=TAlbaNRiiFFW/&gt;&lt;ref name=ANDFTW&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Wk9tVC7WwyoC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Freedom+From+Want%22+Rockwell#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Freedom%20From%20Want%22%20Rockwell&amp;f=false|title=A New Deal For The World|accessdate=November 28, 2013|year=2007|isbn=0-674-28192-6|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|page=|last= Borgwardt, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BHRH&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eyDQEt3tKoEC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22Freedom+From+Want%22+Rockwell#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Freedom%20From%20Want%22%20Rockwell&amp;f=false|title=Bringing Human Rights Home: Portraits of the movement|accessdate=November 28, 2013|year=2007|isbn=0-275-98821-X|publisher=[[Praeger Perspectives]]|page=33|editor1=Albisa, Catherine |editor2=Martha F.

Abrams, Inc. with [[High Museum of Art]] and [[Norman Rockwell Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Richard Halpern says the painting not only displays overabundance of food, but also of "family, conviviality, and security", and opines that "overabundance rather than mere sufficiency is the true answer to want." He parallels the emotional nourishment provided by the image to that of the food nourishment that it depicts, remarking that the picture is noticeably inviting. However, by depicting the table with nothing but empty plates and white dishes on white linen, Rockwell may have been invoking the [[Puritan]] origins of the Thanksgiving holiday.&lt;ref name=NRTUoI&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/?id=FwF-AWzsLIYC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=|title=Norman Rockwell: The Underside of Innocence|accessdate=November 28, 2013| year= 2006| isbn=0-226-31440-5|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|page=72| last= Halpern| first= Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], the painting represents the theme of family continuity, virtue, homeliness, and abundance without extravagance in a Puritan tone, as confirmed by the modest beverage choice of water.&lt;ref name=AV&gt;{{cite book|title=American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America|last = Hughes| first= Robert|authorlink=Robert Hughes (critic)|isbn=0-679-42627-2|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1997|chapter=The Empire of Signs|pages=508–509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Lizabeth Cohen]] says that by depicting this freedom as a celebration in the private family home rather than a worker with a job or a government protecting the hungry and homeless, Rockwell suggests that ensuring this freedom was not as much a government responsibility as something born from participation in the mass consumer economy.&lt;ref name=ANDFTW/&gt;

One of the notable and artistically challenging elements of the image is Rockwell's use of white-on-white: white plates sitting on a white tablecloth.&lt;ref name=FFWaNRaamtn/&gt;&lt;ref name=HaK102/&gt; Art critic [[Deborah Solomon]] describes this as "one of the most ambitious plays of white-against-white since [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]]'s ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl|Symphony in White, No. 1]]''".&lt;ref name=S210/&gt; Solomon further describes the work as "a new level of descriptive realism. Yet, the painting doesn't feel congested or fussy; it is open and airy in the center. Extensive passages of white paint nicely frame the individual faces."&lt;ref name=S210/&gt;

Jim Martin, positioned in the lower right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer.&lt;ref name=S210&gt;{{cite book|title=American Mirror: The Life and Art of Norman Rockwell|chapter=Fifteen: The ''Four Freedoms'' (May 1942 to May 1943)|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]|year=2013| last= Solomon| first= Deborah|isbn=978-0-374-11309-4|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a microcosm of the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner.&lt;ref name=S210/&gt; Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer.

'''Giovanna Garzoni''' (1600–1670) was an Italian painter who was prominent in  Europe during the Baroque period. Garzoni started her career painting religious, mythological, and allegorical subjects but became famous for her works with [[tempera]] and watercolors of botanical subjects.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Jordi Vigué. ''Great Women Masters of Art.'' (New York: Watson-Guptill, 2003), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The artist rose to prominence due to her precision and balance with space and scientific realism of her subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila McTighe. “Foods and the Body in Italian Genre Paintings, about 1580: Campi,Passarotti, Carracci”. The Art Bulletin, College Art Association 86 (2004):301–323,accessed October 23, 2014, doi 10.2307/3177419.&lt;/ref&gt; Garzoni was often called the Chaste Giovanna due to her vow to remain a virgin. Garzoni is also notable for being one the few women who opted to travel throughout Europe and receive an education during the 17th century instead of settling down and starting a family.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Fortune, and Linda Falcone.''Invisible Women.'' (Florence: The Florentine Press, 2010), 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have speculated Garzoni may have been influenced by fellow botanical painter [[Jacopo Ligozzi]]&lt;ref&gt;“Artists: Giovanna Garzoni”. The J. Paul Getty Museum. Accessed October 22, 2014. http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=21178.&lt;/ref&gt; although details about Garzoni's training are widely unknown.

==Early life==

Giovanna Garzoni was born in 1600 in [[Ascoli Piceno]] in the Marche district of Italy to Giacomo Garzoni and Isabetta Gaia.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Jordi Vigué. ''Great Women Masters of Art''. (New York: Watson-Guptill, 2003), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of Garzoni's parents were of Venetian origin and are believed to have come from a long line of Venetian painters but this item is often disputed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Garzoni's grandfather Nicola and uncle Vincenzo from her mother’s side were both goldsmiths while her other uncle, Pietro Gaia, was a painter who studied at the school of Palma the Younger.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Carole Collier Frick, Stefania Biancani, and Elizabeth S. G. Nicholson. ''Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque.'' (Milano: Skira, 2007), 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have widely speculated that Garzoni started off her career as an apprentice under her uncle sometime before 1615. Garzoni also had a brother, Mattio whom she would travel with throughout her career as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Collier Frick, Stefania Biancani, and Elizabeth S. G. Nicholson. ''Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque.'' (Milano: Skira, 2007), 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

After residing in Rome for the first 15 years of her life, in 1616 Garzoni accepted a commission from chemist Giovanni Vorvino of Rome to paint a [[herbarium]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  Four years later in 1620 Garzoni arrived into Venice and painted ''Saint Andrew'' for the Venetian Church of the Ospedale degli Incurabili. Garzoni stayed in Venice for a few more years and during that time attended the Calligraphy school of Giacomo Rogni. Shortly after her studies, Garzoni produced a book of cursive characters called the ''Libro de'caratteri Cancellereschi Corsivi''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

After receiving an education, in 1630 Garzoni along with her brother Mattio, left Venice for Naples where she worked for the Spanish viceroy, The Duke of Alacala. Garzoni remained in Naples for one year until she moved to Rome in 1631. Garzoni’s stay in Rome was short lived however, due to Christina of France’s persistent efforts to have the artist come to Turin to serve as the miniaturist for the Turinese court.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Collier Frick, Stefania Biancani, and Elizabeth S. G. Nicholson. ''Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque.'' (Milano: Skira, 2007), 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Garzoni reached Turin in 1632 and lived there until 1637. After staying in Turin, Garzoni became familiarized with fellow artists [[Fede Galizia]] and [[Panfilo Nuvolone]].&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Carole Collier Frick, Stefania Biancani, and Elizabeth S. G. Nicholson. ''Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque''. (Milano: Skira, 2007), 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  A few years later in 1640, Garzoni arrived in Paris and stayed there until 1642 when she went to Rome. Garzoni traveled back and forth from Rome to Florence until 1651 where her primary clients were in the prominent Medici Family, particularly Grand Duke Ferdinando II, Grand Duchess Victoria, and Gardinal Giovan Carlo.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Collier Frick, StefaniaBiancani, and Elizabeth S. G. Nicholson. ''Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque.'' (Milano: Skira, 2007), 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving the Medici Court, Garzoni decided to settle in Rome in 1651 where she worked for the Florentine Court.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Collier Frick, StefaniaBiancani, and Elizabeth S. G. Nicholson. ''Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque''. (Milano: Skira, 2007), 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as painting, Garzoni attended the [[Accademia di San Luca]] meetings, a program aimed at educating, socializing, and professionalizing painters, architects and sculptors of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;“The History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590–1635: Archived from the Archivio di Stato di Roma”. National Gallery of Art.

==Notable works and clients==
[[File:Giovanna Garzoni - Plate of Peas - WGA8493.jpg|thumb|Giovanna Garzoni (Italian, 1600 – 1670). ''Plate with White Beans, ca.'' 1650–1662. Gouache on parchment. Galleria Paletina, Florence.]]
''Plate with White Beans:''

''Plate with White Beans'' was one of the many pieces the Medici Family commissioned Garzoni to paint. The piece depicts a dish containing ripe beans and has been noted for the amount of detail the artist put into the piece, even marking points of decay on the beans. The painting was created some time between 1650–1662 and is now located in Florence at the Galleria Palatina.&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Vigué. ''Great Women Masters of Art''. (New York: Watson-Guptill, 2003), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cherries on a Plate, Broad Beans, and Bumblebee:''

The painting is another example of Garzoni’s many tempera pieces. Garzoni created this piece  around 1665 and dedicated it to the prominent Medici family of Florence. The piece is now located in Florence at the Galleria Palatina.&lt;ref&gt;Jodi Vigué. ''Great Women Masters of Art''. (New York: Watson-Guptill, 2003), 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of Carlo Emanuele I, Duke of Savory:''

Thise tempera piece on vellum depicts one of the two portraits created by Garzoni of one of the two dukes of Savory, Carlo Emanuele I, the other being of Emanuele Filiberto. The piece was created between 1623–1637 when Garzoni was invited to work for the court of Turin by Christina of France in 1632.The painting is now located in Palazzo Reale, Turin and was last restored in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Collier Frick, Stefania Biancani, and Elizabeth S. G. Nicholson. ''Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque''. (Milano: Skira, 2007), 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Still Life with a Basket of Fruit, a Vase with Carnations and Shells on a Table:''

This gouache on vellum piece is one of the 20 still-life miniatures that Garzoni produced for the Medici family from the years 1650–1662. The piece depicts carnations, conch shells, as well as a basket of fruit. Due to her work for the Medici Court, Garzoni became a favorite within the Florentine court for her depictions of nature and botanical subjects. The piece is now located in the Wallace and Wilhelmina Holladay Collection in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Collier Frick, Stefania Biancani, and Elizabeth S. G. Nicholson. ''Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque.'' (Milano: Skira, 2007), 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Plate of Figs:''

The year of creation varies from 1661 to 1662. The painting is believed to be part of a 20-piece collection on vellum by Garzoni that all depict miniatures of fruit. There have been several sightings of the piece being reproduced for Garzoni often duplicated her pieces for various clients. The piece is part of the Graham Arader III Collection in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Collier Frick, Stefania Biancani, and Elizabeth S. G. Nicholson. ''Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque''. (Milano: Skira, 2007), 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two important manuscript notebooks by Garzoni exist. The rare books library, [[Dumbarton Oaks]], contains a self-portrait of the elderly artist, in addition to a number of botanical studies. Another album, held by the [[Accademia di San Luca]], the artists' institute to which Garzoni left her estate, includes flower studies and still lifes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48507800|title = The flowering of Florence: botanical art for the Medici|last = Tongiorgi Tomasi|first = Lucia|last2 = Hirschauer|first2 = Gretchen A|last3 = National Gallery of Art (U.S.)|date = 2002-01-01|publisher = National Gallery of Art|isbn = 0894682881|location = Washington, D.C.|pages = 77–81|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

It is believed by historians that Garzoni never married, but several others have claimed the artist was once married to Venetian portrait painter Tiberio Tinelli in 1622.&lt;ref name=Bottacin1998&gt;Francesca Bottacin, Appunti per il soggiorno veneziano di Giovanna Garzoni: documenti inediti, in “Arte Veneta”, 52, 1998, pp. 141–147&lt;/ref&gt; However the marriage was short lived due to Garzoni’s vow of chastity and as a result Tinelli and Garzoni separated in 1624.&lt;ref name=Bottacin1998/&gt; Others have also suggested that the reason for the split was due to the belief that Tinelli practiced magic. This resulted in Garzoni’s father Giacomo to suspecting that his son-in-law was practicing witchcraft and encouraging his daughter to end the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Fortune and Linda Falcone. ''Invisible Women.'' (Florence: The Florentine Press, 2010), 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Garzoni's marriage to Tinelli was ended by annulment rather than divorce because they two never consummated their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne M. Ferraro. ''Marriage Wars in Late Renaissance Venice''. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only way to end a marriage in an era when divorce was not condoned due to the belief that divorce would ruin a man's honor.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne M. Ferraro. ''Marriage Wars in Late Renaissance Venice''. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Due to her ailing health, prior to her death, in 1666, Garzoni devised a will that left her estate to the Church of Santa Martina, the church of the Accademia di San Luca on the basis that she would be buried in the church. Garzoni died in Rome in February 1670 at the age of 70.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Today, Garzoni’s tomb remains at the Church of Santa Martina but it was not interred there until 1698, nearly 29 years after her death. Along with her tomb, a portrait of Giovanna Garzoni conducted by Roman painter [[Giuseppe Ghezzi]] is also located at the Accademia.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Fortune and Linda Falcone. ''Invisible Women''. (Florence: The Florentine Press, 2010), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GRAPHOPOLI''' is the first edition of an Urban Art Biennale curated by Celina Nogueras Cuevas, developed by the Museum of Art of Puerto Rico (MAPR) and sponsored by [[UBS Financial Services]]
With an open call for portfolios last April the MAPR drafted the best urban artists from the Island and challenged them to transform giant scale structures into eye-catching urban landmarks.  The artists had an opportunity to intervene uncommon places such as a [[Pump|water pump]], a [[Dormitory|student residence]] building, a sport center, a lighthouse viewpoint and a [[water tank]], among others.  A selection committee which consisted of international figures such as  infamous Miss 17 from NY and artist/editor of Swindle Magazine, Sonik (Boston) among local professionals selected the artists that were to participate in the event.

GRAPHOPOLI accommodated the contestants in two categories: solo and crew. Artists such as BIKISMO, SOFIA, LARREGUI, NEPO and PUN18, preceded the solo artist category. Each artist challenged concepts of [[everyday life]] and propaganda, such as [[consumerism]] and visual exploitation, gentrification, femininity, fantasy, childhood among others.
The second category composed by: ADMcru, COROGRAFICO and OS Crew, transformed ordinary structures and walls with their signature styles: a combination of playful personages, colorful urban settings, and remarkable photo-like creations.     
This first edition of GRAPHOPOLI captivated various [[municipalities of Puerto Rico]] that instantly adopted this innovative program into their art and cultural enhancement plan.

{{for|the American rock band|Grateful Dead}}
'''Grateful dead'''  (or '''grateful ghost''') is a [[Folklore|folktale]] present in many cultures throughout the world. The most common story involves a traveler who encounters a corpse of someone who never received a proper [[burial]], typically stemming from an unpaid debt.&lt;ref name="encybrit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037771/grateful-dead#23476.hook|title=Grateful dead|accessdate=2007-12-14|year=2007|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cscmu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/gdead/faq/name.html|title=Dead FAQ: How did they get the name?|accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traveler then either pays off the dead person's debt or pays for burial. The traveler is later rewarded or has their life saved by a person or animal who is actually the soul of the dead person; the grateful dead is a form of the [[donor (fairy tale)|donor]].

The "grateful dead" story is [[Aarne–Thompson]]–Uther type 505.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0505.html|title=The Grateful Dead:  folktales of Aarne–Thompson–Uther type 505|author=D.L. Ashliman|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient Egyptian text explains the [[Golden Rule|principle of reciprocity]] in which the deceased calls for a blessing on the person who remembers his name and helps him into a happy afterlife:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But if there be a man, any one whomsoever, who beholdeth this writing and causeth my soul and my name to become established among those who are blessed, let it be done for him likewise after his final arriving (at the end of life's voyage) in recompense for what was done by him for me, Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;"The Burden of Isis, Being the Laments of Isis and Nephthys", James Teackle Dennis, Dutton &amp; Co, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One variant is the [[Book of Tobit]].&lt;ref name="hibbard74"&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' p74. New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[chivalric romance]] ''[[Amadas]]'' has the title knight pay his last coins for such a burial.&lt;ref name="hibbard74"/&gt;  It appears in various fairy tales, such as the Italian ''[[Fair Brow]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 725 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Swedish ''[[The Bird 'Grip']]'' and [[Hans Christian Andersen|H.

'''''Hahn/Cock''''' is a sculpture of a giant blue [[cockerel]] by the German artist [[Katharina Fritsch]]. It was unveiled in London's [[Trafalgar Square]] on 25 July 2013 and was displayed on the vacant [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|fourth plinth]]. The [[fibreglass]] work stood {{convert|4.72|m}} high and was the sixth work to be displayed on the plinth, on which it stayed until 17 February 2015. It was subsequently acquired by [[Mitchell Rales#Glenstone|Glenstone]], a private museum, and exhibited at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, DC, following its 2016 reopening.&lt;ref name=dcist&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dcist.com/2016/04/blue_rooster.php |title=The National Gallery's East Building Is Reopening—With A Giant, Blue Rooster On Top |last=Sturdivant |first=Christina |work=DCist |date=29 April 2016 |accessdate=27 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725193111/http://dcist.com/2016/04/blue_rooster.php |archivedate=25 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is in an edition of two. The second version is in the sculpture garden of the [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis, MN on a pedestal designed by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gascone |first=Sarah |title=After 'Scaffold' Controversy, All Eyes on the Walker as Its Sculpture Garden Is Set to Reopen |url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/walker-minneapolis-sculpture-garden-reopens-970991 |newspaper=Artnet News |date=9 June 2017 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meanings==

Fritsch says that there are many possible interpretations of the cockerel, which took her two and a half years to create, but calls it "a feminist sculpture, since it is I who am doing something active here – I, a woman, am depicting something male. Historically it has always been the other way around. Now we are changing the roles. And a lot of men are enjoying that."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/25/big-blue-cock-trafalgar-square|title=Big blue cock erected on fourth plinth in London's Trafalgar Square|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|work=The Guardian|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that the surrounding area has a strongly male character, with numerous statues of "male persons standing on pedestals" and the male-dominated culture that goes with London's status as a business centre. The statue is intended to be a humorous counterbalance, contrasting with the very formal [[equestrian statue]]s on the square's other three plinths: "Humour is always a big thing for me. It stops things from becoming too severe. I like English humour. It is so often very dark."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

The sculpture was selected by the Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group, a panel of specialist advisors that guides and monitors the commissions for the plinth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/arts-culture/fourth-plinth/fourth-plinth-commissioning-group|title=Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=2 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728110842/http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/arts-culture/fourth-plinth/fourth-plinth-commissioning-group|archivedate=28 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a press release issued by the group to announce Fritsch as the winner of the commission,

{{quote|The sculpture ... communicates on different levels. First of all is the consideration of the formal aspect of its placement: the mostly grey architecture of Trafalgar Square would receive an unexpectedly strong colour accentuation, the size and colour of the animal making the whole situation surreal or simply unusual. The cockerel is also a symbol for regeneration, awakening and strength and finally, the work refers, in an ironic way, to male-defined British society and thoughts about biological determinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/ins/gb/lp/kue/bku/en7068258.htm|title=Katharina Fritsch – Winner Fourth Plinth 2013|author=Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group|publisher=Goethe Institut|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was unveiled on 25 July 2013 by [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]]. He pointed out the irony that the cockerel, an unofficial national emblem of France, was standing in a square commemorating [[Battle of Trafalgar|a famous British victory over the French]].&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Fritsch has said that she was unaware of the connection until it was explained to her. According to Fritsch, she chose the cockerel to represent strength and regeneration, "but it's a nice humorous side-effect to have something French in a place that celebrates victory over Napoleon. He has come back as a cockerel!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5itQIgB69bKNiuW4cJCdvyhlViZVg?docId=CNG.5e0e2113672b51814051e52cbb767171.141|title=Giant blue cockerel roosts at London's Trafalgar Square|agency=AFP|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson said in his speech that "I hope French people will not take it as excessive British chauvinism – but for me it stands for [[2013 Tour de France#General classification|the recent British triumph in the Tour de France]], which we have [[2012 Tour de France#General classification|won twice in a row]] ... it is a symbol of French sporting pride, brought like a chicken to London. We have mounted this French cock at the heart of our imperial square."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

Fritsch and Johnson have both noted the sexual [[double entendre]] in the work's name – ''hahn'' in [[German language|German]] has the same double meaning as "cock" in English – and the artist admits that it is consciously intended as a play on words. She highlighted the fact that Trafalgar Square itself has a somewhat phallic character: "It's about male posing, about showing power, about showing ... erections! I mean, look at [[Nelson's Column|that column]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130725-cock-cockerel-london-trafalgar-square-blue-art-katharina-fritsch-uk-france|title=Giant French rooster ruffles London feathers|publisher=France 24|date=26 July 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked whether he felt that the cock had crushed his manhood, Johnson said: "No, not at all. I am happy to channel the power and enthusiasm of that bird; I feel inspired by its regal manner and mood of confidence."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; He told the crowd that he would "not lapse into double entendres and ask how long this wonderful creature will 'stay up' in the square," before unveiling what he called a "big, blue ... bird."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/10202386/Boris-unveils-big-blue-bird-in-Trafalgar-Square.html|title=Boris unveils 'big, blue bird' in Trafalgar Square|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The giant cock received generally positive reviews from art critics, with punning headlines such as "Big blue cock erected on fourth plinth in London's Trafalgar Square",&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; "Boris Johnson in Trafalgar Square with a Massive Blue Cock And Disgruntled Woman"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/25/boris-johnson-caption-comp_n_3651708.html|title=Boris Johnson in Trafalgar Square with a Massive Blue Cock And Disgruntled Woman|work=The Huffington Post UK|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Boris Johnson unveils giant cock in Trafalgar Square"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.uk.msn.com/uk/boris-johnson-giant-cock-trafalgar-square-london|title=Boris Johnson unveils giant cock in Trafalgar Square|publisher=MSN UK|last=Jones|first=Ian|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Adrian Searle]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that "the scale and modelling and degree of detail feel right", with a "lifelike and other-worldly" feel to the sculpture. He felt that it avoided "straining to look meaningful or relevant" and that despite its irreverence, it "lightens the mood and lifts the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/25/fourth-plinth-gives-nelson-the-bird|last=Searle|first=Adrian|title=Fourth plinth: Katharina Fritsch's cockerel gives Nelson the bird|work=The Guardian|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'s'' Serena Davis did not regard it as being as impressive as some of the previous works to have stood on the fourth plinth, but nonetheless called it "one of the jolliest things to have sat upon the square's spare plinth since the public art commissions for it began in 2005."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-reviews/10201962/Fourth-Plinth-Trafalgar-Square-Cock-review.html|title=Fourth Plinth Trafalgar Square: Cock, review|last=Davies|first=Serena|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC News' arts correspondent Rebecca Jones wrote that the work has "a kind of joyful aspect to it which will put a smile on many people's faces".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23448832|title=Blue cockerel takes roost on Fourth Plinth|publisher=BBC News|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors interviewed by the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' newspaper also gave it a thumbs up.&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/sacre-bleu-lord-nelson-now-looks-down-on-a-giant-french-cock-in-trafalgar-square-8731524.html|title=Sacre bleu! Lord Nelson now looks down on a giant French cock in Trafalgar Square|work=Evening Standard|location=London|last=Jury|first=Louise|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thorney Island Society, a local conservation group, objected to the sculpture on the grounds that it was "unrelated to the context of Trafalgar Square and adds nothing to it but a feeble distraction", but ''The Guardian's'' chief arts writer [[Charlotte Higgins]] pointed out that Fritsch's other works have a habit of "appear[ing] "fanciful and dramatic" and "unrelated" to their contexts." She commented that one should not "overthink it. It's a big, blue, funny, weird, surreal bird in Trafalgar Square. It's going to cheer us all up. Katharina's Cock, as I'd like to think of it, should be a hit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2013/may/01/art-sculpture|title=Planning cock-up on Trafalgar Square's Fourth Plinth|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|work=The Guardian|date=1 May 2013|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8538">The [[hoplite]]s were soldiers from [[Ancient Greece]] who were usually free citizens. They had a very uniform and distinct appearance; specifically they were armed with a [[spear]] (''[[dory]]'') in their right hand and a heavy round [[shield]] in their left.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hoplite soldiers were organized in battle into the "[[Phalanx|Phalanx formation]]". The goal of this formation was to create uniformity and a powerful military force in order to maximize the effectiveness as the army as a whole, rather than use people as individual fighters. With the hoplite formation everyone was the same in battle. The Phalanx formation appeared during the 7th and 8th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/180753601|title=War in human civilization|last=Azar.|first=Gat,|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199236633|location=Oxford|oclc=180753601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representation of hoplites in art show historians how the Greeks used this formation in battle as well as how the soldiers were dressed and what their armor looked like. The hoplite formation is shown in different styles of pottery such as [[White ground technique|white ground]] and [[Black-figure pottery|black figure]] and also on many different types of pottery such an ''[[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes|olpe]]'', ''[[krater]],'' ''[[alabastron]]'', and ''[[dinos]]''. Across all depictions, hoplite soldiers wear the same armor and carry the same weapons in the same position. In addition, the aspect of uniformity is emphasized in these representations.

== Representations in art ==

=== Chigi Vase ===
[[File:Detail from the Chigi-vase.jpg|thumb|
Chigi Vase 650-640 BC
]]The [[Chigi vase|Chigi Vase]] is a [[Orientalizing period|Protocorinthian]] ''[[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes|olpe]]'' and was made by the Chigi Painter from 650-640 BC. The [[Chigi vase|Chigi Vase]] was discovered in an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] tomb at Monte Aguzzo. It is [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] style with an unusual use of [[Polychrome|polychromy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cvaonline.org/tools/pottery/painters/keypieces/corinthian/chigi.htm|title=Greek vases 800-300 BC: key pieces - The Classical Art Research Centre|website=www.cvaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains the earliest known representation of the [[hoplite]] [[phalanx formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurwit|first=Jeffrey|date=2002|title=Reading the Chigi Vase|url=|journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens|volume=71|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vase shows the moment that the two hoplite formations come in contact in battle. Each soldier is armed with a decorative round shield in their left hand and a long spear in their right as well as a helmet. Behind the soldiers is a flute player that may have been used to keep the hoplites marching correctly. The [[Chigi vase]] is arguably one of the most important representations of the Hoplite Soldier in [[Ancient Greek art|Greek Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chigi Vase gives historians as insight to how the phalanx formation was used in battle.

=== Terracotta Alabastron ===
[[File:Terracotta alabastron (perfume vase) MET DP119906.jpg|thumb|Terracotta alabastron 590–570 BC]]
This Middle [[Corinthia]]n perfume vase from 590–570 BC contains two friezes of the [[Phalanx|hoplite phalanx]]. The [[terracotta]] vase uses a form of [[Black-figure pottery|black figure]] and is only 21.3&amp;nbsp;cm in height. Both friezes show hoplites with a circular shield in their left hand, spear in their right, as well as a typical hoplite helmet. All of the hoplites are faced in the same way and have about the same distance in between their feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Terracotta alabastron (perfume vase)|date=ca. 590–570 B.C.|url=https://metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247192|accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could reflect the state of uniformity and the lack of individualism within hoplite warfare. The top frieze is interrupted by another figure who does not resemble a hoplite soldier. The rest of the vase is decorated with lines and dots, creating zones on the vase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amyx, Darrell A. 1988.

=== Hoplite black figure Dinos  ===
This Attic black figure [[Dinos]] now located in [[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]] in [[Paris]] was made by "The Louvre Painter" in 560 BC. It contains three friezes. The first depicts [[Troilus|Troilos]] and Polyxena at the fountain, a  Centauromachy, the return of [[Hephaestus|Hephaistos]], and a [[symposium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Louvre%20E%20876&amp;object=Vase|title=Louvre E 876 (Vase)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle frieze shows a [[Phalanx|hoplite phalanx]], and the bottom frieze shows a horse race. The frieze with the hoplites shows two hoplite formations engaging in battle. The hoplite in front of the first phalanx advances to the left over a body. Another hoplite extends his arm as he leans to throw he spear to the warrior in front of him. The warriors on foot all possess typical characteristics of hoplites with their spear and round shield as well as their helmet. In addition the hoplites are close to each other in proximity which is a feature of the [[Phalanx|phalanx formation]].

=== Attic Black-Figure Calyx Krater ===

Attic Black-Figure Calyx Krater
]]This Calyx Krater was made in 530 BCE from [[Farsala|Pharsala]] and uses the [[Black-figure pottery|black figure]] stye. It is also painted  in the manner of [[Exekias]]. The [[Krater|Calyx Krater]]  depicts the scene a Four-horse [[chariot]] and a [[Homer]]ic battle around the body of a dead warrior, that might be [[Patroclus|Patroklos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.namuseum.gr/collections/vases/archaic/archaic14-en.html#|title=NATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM OF ATHENS - OFFICIAL SITE|website=www.namuseum.gr|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the scene is on the two hoplites clashing in battle, behind each of them is a hoplite phalanx. This image gives insight into how two hoplite formations engaged in battle. The figures can be identified as hoplites because of their round [[Round shield|shield]] in their left hand as well as their spear in the right hand.

=== Dionysos with Satyr and Maenad Alabastron ===
The "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Harvard+1920.44.54&amp;object=vase Dionysos with Satyr and Maenad Ababastron]" was made by the [[Haimon Painter|Haimon painter]] in 480 BC and it from the late [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]]. It is attic black figure and white ground. The lower frieze represents a  [[Gigantomachy]]. [[Heracles|Herakles]] and [[Athena]] fight five [[Giants (Greek mythology)|giants]], four of whom are represented as hoplites. The viewer can tell that the giants are hoplites because of the typical helmets, the round shield held in the left hand, and the spear in the right hand. One of the hoplite [[Giants (Greek mythology)|giants]] is on the ground to due to his fight with Athena. the others are attacking Herakles from behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Harvard+1920.44.54&amp;object=vase|title=Harvard 1920.44.54 (Vase)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work of art is an interesting take on the typical [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Gigantomachy]]. The representation of the hoplite formation in this period hints that the Greeks were still using this formation in warfare. In addition, this [[alabastron]] is an example of the combination of a mythological battle (the Gigantomachy) and aspects of real battles (the hoplite formation) that we see in other examples of Greek Art, specifically the [[Temple of Athena Nike]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Akropolis]] and the [[Stoa Poikile]] on the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Classical Agora]].

'''''In the Shadow of Your Wings''''' (Unter dem Schatten deiner Flügel) is a collection of selected entries from the diary of [[Jochen Klepper]] covering the period between April 1932 and 10 December 1942. The book appeared in 1956.

The [[Protestantism|Protestant]] German [[Author|writer]], [[journalist]] and [[poet]] of ecclesiastical songs, Jochen Klepper, loses his creative power in the course of the above-mentioned ten years under steadily increasing [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist]] reprisals. Klepper is married with the [[Jew]] Johanna. Hanni, as Johanna is called, has brought two daughters from her first marriage. Klepper's younger stepdaughter Renate is threatened with [[deportation]] after the [[World War II|war]] begins.  Klepper applies for an exit permit for the young girl to go to Sweden. The author appeals to the [[Sicherheitsdienst|security services]]. There his request is turned down. Klepper takes his own life together along the lives of his wife and child in a nondescript Berlin residential house.

== Diary ==
'''1932''' Klepper suffers from his childlessness. He calls himself a "[[Religion|religious]] [[Socialism|socialist]]".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the 30-year-old author is narrow. But Klepper is fulfilled as an [[intellectual]] by big desire for fame.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1933''' To Kleppers understanding is not author who has merely ideas and materials. Author is who can express that quite peculiar "state of the liveliness"&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; in his text. Talent would be unnecessary.&lt;br/&gt;
The Nazis have now all power monopolized. Klepper is at the [[Radio]]&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; employed. He is denounced: "Jewish family. [[SPD]] member"&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; is the accusation. The active employees will be suspended from service. Still Klepper not despondent. Because he holds fast to his faith, writes in his novel "The Father, Novel of [[Frederick William I of Prussia|the Soldier-King]]" ([[Stuttgart]] 1937) and loves his wife Hanni. Is Klepper "divine tool"?&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; He has doubts.
Also  these odious "[[memoir]]s", which Klepper writes down - which value do they have? The writer will remain in the country at any rate. Abroad he sees no working possibility. Indeed, in Berlin the giants [[Ullstein-Verlag|Ullstein]] and [[Universum Film AG|Ufa]] want his cooperation, however, do not pay. Thus Klepper would like to be taken up in the [[:de:Reichsschrifttumskammer|Empire Literature Chamber]].&lt;br/&gt;
'''1934''' The plan succeeds, because one of his guarantors is a [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] man. Besides, Klepper calls the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] "ill visionaries",&lt;ref name="Source p. 145"&gt;Source p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; if he entrusts with his worry about the future of Germany the diary.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1935''' Clamour is not possible for Klepper. He lives under the motto "Keep still".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; With such behavior a small private sphere can be saved. The excesses in [[Kurfürstendamm]] are disconcerting. Jewish women receive on the open road slaps in the face.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of all that, Klepper further wants to write, as long as he may still remain in the Empire Literature Chamber. Since writing is a religious process for him. God has called the author and latter answers with a book - a stammered answer.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''1936''' German relatives recommend to the couple Klepper repeatedly to send both daughters in the sure foreign country. Klepper said the precaution would be unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Quelle S. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The author probably knows about his isolation in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Quelle S. 223&lt;/ref&gt; however, he builds on the help of God.&lt;ref&gt;Quelle S. 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In '''1937''', on 25 March&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; the author from the Empire Literature Chamber is excluded. The reason is to Kleppers conviction his [[:de:Mischehe (Nationalsozialismus)|mixing marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusion is out on an appeal in June suspended, and the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Imperial War Department]] recommends Kleppers new novel "The Father" as a reading for the [[Wehrmacht]] members.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1938''' However, the Empire Literature Chamber accuses the [[Christian]] Klepper "of slavish posture" which would contradict the "new mind".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; From March Klepper is supervised no more by the Empire Literature Chamber, but by the [[Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]]. Nevertheless, in this precarious situation there is still a courageous journalist, the Klepper his organ as a platform offers: The Protestant theologian [[:de:Hermann Mulert|Prof. Mulert]] encourages the author to write for the "Christian world". Klepper remains careful. If [[Ernst Wiechert]] sits, nevertheless, because of the case [[Martin Niemöller|Niemöller]] in the [[Buchenwald concentration camp|concentration camp]]. Klepper and his wife, Hanni register well as Jewish doctors and lawyers in Germany are no longer allowed to practice, how German Jews to sell their assets and emigrate. There should be a [[Buchenwald concentration camp|concentration camp]] near [[Weimar]]. Every German Jew should carry from [[:de:Namensänderungsverordnung|1st January, 1939]], in addition, the given name [[List of Biblical names#I|Israel]] or [[Sara (given name)|Sara]] and must give him everywhere. Polish Jews in Germany will be imprisoned or expelled. In spite of this news couple Klepper builds a new house in Berlin. In connection with the [[Kristallnacht]] Klepper disturb the arbitrary arrests of Jewish men by the [[Gestapo]]. Klepper's wife Hanni [[Religious conversion|converts]] to the Christianity. Klepper is horrified about Hannis [[:de:Kennkarte|identification card]].&lt;br/&gt;
'''1939''' Both stepdaughters Kleppers would like to [[Emigration|emigrate]]. Wife Hanni wants to remain. [[Nazism|NS]] [[Ideology|ideologist]] [[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] speaks openly, all Jews should leave the [[German Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; German Jews must offer before certain valuables - as for example precious metals - to buying places to the sales.&lt;br/&gt;
When the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|war breaks out]], Klepper does a [[Patriotism|patriotic]] note in his diary: He could not Germany the decline wish.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 468&lt;/ref&gt; As from November Jews for leaving their local authorized by the Gestapo need, Klepper expresses the suicide thought. Is [[suicide]] a sin? The older stepdaughter is the departure to England succeed. Because of the younger daughter Renate wants the couple to stay alive.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1940''' February: A rumour reaches Klepper. Jews would be deported by [[Szczecin]] to [[Lublin]].&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; As a wife of an "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" Hanni is protected. However, for daughter Renate it becomes more and more dangerous: Men of the [[SS-Totenkopfverbände|Death's Head SS]] ring in the front door and inquire after the young girl. Renate converts - like before her mother - to the Christianity. Klepper receives news from an unfathomable process in the German Reich: [[Racial hygiene|Hindered]] are murdered. All called events weaken taken together the creativity of the sensitive Klepper so much that he manages the next novels ([[Katharina Luther|Katharina von Bora]]) no more. The vitality, however, he wants to keep. And thus he struggles dogged, tenaciously and, in the end, successfully for an entry permit for Renate to Sweden. For all that Klepper means on 26 July surprisingly, Germany will defeat England.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 522, 4th Line up&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''1941''' From December, 1940 Klepper serves with the armed forces and will dismiss at the beginning of October, 1941 because of "military unworthiness", thus because of his "non-aryan marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin's Jews are now in a very hard situation. Renate must carry discriminating [[Yellow badge]] and brings terrifying news with home: Confessed become after [[Łódź|Litzmannstadt]] deports. The suicide thought lies to young Renate far. She hopes for survival. Klepper penetrates up to "[[Minister without Portfolio#Germany|Imperial Minister]] Dr. [[Wilhelm Frick|Frick]]" and obtains a document in which Renate ministerial protection from deportation is assured. This letter may Renates life admittedly only so long protected until the Sicherheitsdienst mercilessly intervenes. News about the deportation of Jews takes no end. Renate sways between depression and hope.
The girl tells the thoughts of suicide, if their departure fail should, not go back. News of massacres, perpetrated on Jews, invade from the east to Berlin.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1942''' Hanni rejects the thought of triple suicide. Klepper does not know whether he should condemn the German warfare. After tantalizing back-and-forth Renate from Sweden receives the desired entry permit. Frick is no more responsible, in the meantime, for the exit permit, but now [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann]]. Klepper does not receive the permission and goes voluntarily to the death.

== Title ==
Kleppers faith in God seems steadfast. An external sign of this deep religiousness are the omnipresent [[Bible#Old Testament|Bible]] citations. Under one of the verses stands the book:
:Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me,
:for my soul takes refuge in you.
:Yes, '''in the shadow of your wings''', I will take refuge,
:until disaster has passed. [[s:Bible (World English)/Psalms#Psalm 57|Psalm 57,1]]&lt;ref&gt;Source pp. 3, 208, 364, 530&lt;/ref&gt;
All citations reflect taken together upon the ten-year-period away the unprecedented God's trust and last imploring, yes, last of all shouting God in the highest need.

== Persons ==

Klepper reports about narrower contacts with writers: [[:de:Reinhold Schneider|Reinhold Schneider]]&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; and [[:de:Rudolf Alexander Schröder|Rudolf Alexander Schröder]]&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; are called multiple. Klepper mentions several prominent concentration camp prisoners - activists of the [[Confessing Church|Bekennenden Kirche]] - thus, e.g., the [[pastor]] [[:de:Hans Ehrenberg|Ehrenberg-Bochum]].

== Style and themes ==

The extensive memoirs can be read as a dialog with God. Klepper lays his welfare and woe in the hands of the Lord. However, besides, Klepper knows that he "one day", as [[Werner Bergengruen|Bergengruen]]&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 262, 14th Bottom line&lt;/ref&gt; formulates a little disrespectfully, before "his heavenly commander" will have to be responsible for his acting and letting. The form arises from the said. Klepper, deeply religious, has torn to and fro. He knows, he does mistakes, but he cannot from his skin. Among the wings of the Lord standing, the fate of the author's resume. And Klepper meticulously describes the process. The honesty and independence of the author is impressive with all. Before the surprised reader enters less the fighter Klepper than rather the silent sufferer.

== Reception ==
*Bergengruen&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka pp. 259 - 268&lt;/ref&gt; does in January, 1957 in his detailed review to the first publication of the diaries no secret from his quite obviously deeply to seated resentments.
**It looks as subordinate Bergengruen of sister Hildegard  of the author material motives in the publication of the diaries of brother.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bergengruen speaks a truth. Renate's life was as of a "[[Nuremberg Laws|full Jew]]" - as one said in the [[:de:Sprache des Nationalsozialismus|NS linguistic usage]] - threatens in the German Reich. Klepper has had long enough time to support the emigration of the girl.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Bergengruen can conclude in the connection from the memoirs neither on feelings of guilt nor on selfdoubt of the author.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka pp. 266 bottom - 267 top&lt;/ref&gt;
**To an opponent of the Nazi regime the subservien Klepper could not explain itself.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;
**Indeed, Bergengruen certifies mental power to the author, however, it lacks him of feeling and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bergengruen also calls details which are not discoverable in the available book: For example, when he Klepper after October 1941, in his Berlin home visits, the blended man of the house has glorified his period of service with the armed forces and has regretted his forcible elimination from the troop.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka pp. 264, 267&lt;/ref&gt;
*Klepper should have taken away his diaries from the access of the NS henchmen successfully, while he buried the papers.&lt;ref&gt;Riegel, van Rinsum p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Architecture Awards''' are the oldest global awards for new architecture, landscape architecture, interiors and urban planning. The program was launched by the [[Chicago Athenaeum]] Museum of Architecture and Design in 2005 to honor and celebrate the most outstanding architecture designed and built or unbuilt throughout the world.

The International Architecture Awards are the only non-commercial, global, and public awards program given jointly by two not-for-profit Museums in the United States and Europe dedicated to public education concerning architecture and industrial design.

The Awards are also independent of any affiliation to a commercial trade organization such as the RIBA or AIA.

The Awards are also regarded internationally as the mark of excellence, recognizing the best global architecture practices, as well as the corporate clients, developers, state and local governments, institutions, general contractors that produced them.

The Program is open to all international architecture offices and U.S. firms with projects outside the United States. (U.S. submissions are judged annually for the American Architecture Award.

The awards are awarded annually at the end of September by the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design, and Metropolitan Arts Press Ltd. In 2009 the awards were presented in partnership with The European Center for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies.

The winning projects are selected by the international jury from a short list of several hundred international submissions from architectural practices around the world. 
The short-list is then judged by a jury of peer practitioners, educators, and architecture journalists and critics.  Juries have taken place in Dublin, Oslo, Stuttgart, Munich, Istanbul, Athens, Vilnius, Helsinki, New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

All submitted projects are to be designed by architects in their respective countries of origin or abroad three years prior to the award year. For example, the deadline for submissions for the 2019 International Architecture Awards is December 1, 2018 for buildings designed and/or built between 2015-2018.
Categories include:  Skyscrapers, high rises, corporate offices and complexes, housing, schools, universities, institutions, museums, galleries, social housing, entertainment, libraries, restoration and renovations, restaurants, industrial buildings, private homes, sports and transportation buildings, infrastructure, energy facilities, civic and community buildings, expositions buildings, exhibits, religious buildings, public spaces, urban planning, and landscape architecture.

The awarded projects form an exhibition "The City and the World" that have toured inside Europe and South America including The International Biennial of Architecture Buenos Aires and The Istanbul Design Biennial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Chicago Athenaeum: International Architecture Awards 2008  | work = | publisher = detail.de | date = | url = http://www.detail.de/artikel_athenaeum-chicago-award_22800_En.htm | accessdate = 2010-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023085045/http://www.detail.de/artikel_athenaeum-chicago-award_22800_En.htm|archive-date=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Finnish architects select 97 buildings in thirty nations to win the world's most prestigious 2009 International Architecture Awards| work = | publisher =Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design | date =September 21, 2009 | url = http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/intarch/2009/2009INTARCHSPRESSRELEASE.pdf| accessdate = 2010-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008195558/http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/intarch/2009/2009INTARCHSPRESSRELEASE.pdf |archive-date=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning''' in [[Jamaica, Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]] is a [[performing arts|performing]] and [[visual arts|visual]] [[arts center]] that was founded in 1972 in an effort to revitalize the surrounding business district. As of 2012, it serves more than 28,000 people annually via a 1,650 [[square foot]] [[art gallery|gallery]], a 99-seat [[proscenium]] theater, and art &amp; music studios.  The building that houses the center is the former Queens Register of Titles and Deeds Building, a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City landmark]] that is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=jchist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcal.org/about/history.html|work=History|title=History|publisher=Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning|accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Outside the building is one of only two remaining [[Sidewalk clock on Jamaica Avenue|cast-iron sidewalk clocks]] in New York City,&lt;ref name=lp&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-york-city/sights/gallery/jamaica-center-for#ixzz24z7X3knH|work=New York City Sights|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a late-Victorian era headquarters of the [[Jamaica Savings Bank]] next door.

==Queens Register of Titles and Deeds Building==
'''Office of the Register''', also known as Queens Register of Titles and Deeds Building, is a historic government building located in the [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] section of the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]].  It was built between 1895 and 1913 and is an imposing, three story building with a [[limestone]] facade in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Italian Renaissance]] style. A rear five story addition was built in 1938.  The facade features deep rustication on the first floor and a smooth [[ashlar]] surface above.  The building housed the Office of the Register until 1974, after which it became the Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning (JCAL).&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7361|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Office of the Register|date=October 1989|accessdate=2011-01-16 |author1=David J.

:''[[Printmaking]] art techniques such as [[engraving]], [[etching]], [[woodcut]] and [[lithography]] are covered more fully in their respective articles.''
'''Line art''' or '''line drawing''' is any image that consists of distinct straight or curved lines placed against a (usually plain) background, without gradations in [[shading|shade]] (darkness) or [[hue]] ([[color]]) to represent two-dimensional or three-dimensional objects. Line art can use lines of different colors, although line art is usually monochromatic.
Line art emphasizes [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]] and [[Outline drawing|outline]], over color, shading, and [[wikt:texture|texture]]. However, areas of solid [[pigment]] and dots can also be used in addition to lines. The lines in a piece of line art may be all of a constant width (as in some [[Sketch (drawing)|pencil drawings]]), of several (few) constant widths (as in [[technical illustration]]s), or of freely varying widths (as in brush work or [[engraving]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Line art may tend towards [[Realism (arts)|realism]] (as in much of [[Gustave Doré]]'s work), or it may be a [[caricature]], [[cartoon]], [[ideograph]], or [[glyph]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Before the development of [[photography]] and of [[halftone]]s, line art was the standard format for [[illustrations]] to be used in [[Printing|print]] publications, using black ink on white paper.  Using either [[stippling]] or [[hatching]], shades of gray could also be simulated.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

One of the most fundamental elements of art is the line. An important feature of a line is that it indicates the edge of a two-dimensional (flat) shape or a three-dimensional form.  A shape can be indicated by means of an outline and a three-dimensional form can be indicated by [[contour lines]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, Henry M. ''A World of Art''. Prentice Hall.

'''Magenta''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|t|ə|}}) is a [[color]] that is variously defined as purplish-[[red]],&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; reddish-[[purple]], purplish, or [[mauve|mauvish]]-[[crimson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/magenta definition of magenta] in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the RGB color model, it is made by mixing equal amounts of blue and red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23rNl2hwk3AC&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=magenta%20red%20violet%20color%20theory&amp;f=false |title=The Quilter's Color Club: Secrets of Value, Temperature &amp; Special Effects |author=Christine E. Barnes |publisher=C&amp;T Publishing Inc |date=1 February 2011 |isbn=9781607051664 |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On [[color wheel]]s of the [[RGB color model|RGB (additive)]] and [[subtractive color|CMY (subtractive)]] color models, it is located midway between [[red]] and [[blue]].  It is the [[complementary color]] of [[green]]. It is one of the four colors of ink used in color printing and by an [[inkjet printer]], along with [[yellow]], [[black]], and [[cyan]], to make all the other colors.  The tone of magenta used in [[printing]] is called "printer's magenta".

Magenta took its name from an [[aniline]] dye made and patented in 1859 by the French chemist François-Emmanuel Verguin, who originally called it ''fuchsine''.   It was renamed to celebrate the Italian-French victory at the [[Battle of Magenta]] fought between the French and Austrians on June 4, 1859, near the Italian town of [[Magenta, Lombardy|Magenta]] in [[Lombardy]].&lt;ref name=Ball214/&gt; A virtually identical color, called roseine, was created in 1860 by two British chemists: Chambers Nicolson and George Maule.

The [[web colors|web color]] magenta is also called [[fuchsia (color)|fuchsia]].

==In optics and color science==
Magenta is an [[spectral color#Non-spectral colors|extra-spectral color]], meaning that it is not found in the [[visible spectrum]] of light. Rather, it is physiologically and psychologically perceived as the mixture of red and violet/blue light, with the absence of green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abelard.org/colour/col-hi.htm|title=theory of colour: Orange is Tertiary|author=the auroran sunset, updated Xavier|work=abelard.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the RGB color system, used to create all the colors on a television or computer display, magenta is a secondary color, made by combining equal amounts of red and blue light at a high intensity. In this system, magenta is the [[complementary color]] of green, and combining green and magenta light on a black screen will create white.

In the [[CMYK color model]], used in color printing, it is one of the three primary colors, along with cyan and yellow, used to print all the rest of the colors. If magenta, cyan, and yellow are printed on top of each other on a page, they make black. In this model, magenta is the complementary color of green, and these two colors have the highest contrast and the greatest harmony. If combined, green and magenta ink will look dark gray or black. The magenta used in color printing, sometimes called process magenta, is a darker shade than the color used on computer screens.

A [[Line of purples|purple]] hue in terms of [[color theory]], magenta is evoked by light having less power in green [[wavelength]]s than in blue/violet and red wavelengths ([[complementary color|complement]]s of magenta have wavelength 500–530 [[nanometer|nm]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce MacEvoy. "[http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html#huenames Light and the Eye]", ''Handprint''. A chart citing R.W.G. Hunt 2004. ''The Reproduction of Color''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Munsell color system]], magenta is called ''red–purple''.

If the spectrum is wrapped to form a color wheel, magenta (additive secondary) appears midway between [[red]] and violet. Violet and red, the two components of magenta, are at opposite ends of the visible spectrum and have very different wavelengths. The additive secondary color magenta, as noted above, is made by combining violet and red light at equal intensity; it is not present in the spectrum itself.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fuchsia and magenta==
In optics, [[fuchsia (color)|fuchsia]] and magenta are essentially the same color. The [[web colors]] fuchsia and magenta are completely identical, and are made by mixing exactly the same proportions of blue and red light. In design and printing, there is a little more variation. The French version of fuchsia in the [[RGB color model]] and in printing contains a higher proportion of red than the American version of fuchsia. [[Fuchsia]] flowers themselves, which inspired both colors, have a variety of colors, from fuchsia to purple to red.

==History==

===Fuchsine and magenta dye (1859)===
[[File:Carte du Duché de Bouillon (1864).jpg|thumb|160px|right|An 1864 map showing the Duchy of Bouillon in magenta]]
The color magenta was the result of the industrial chemistry revolution of the mid-nineteenth century, which began with the invention by [[William Perkin]] of [[mauveine]] in 1856, which was the first synthetic [[aniline dye]]. The enormous commercial success of the dye and the new color it produced, [[mauve]], inspired other chemists in Europe to develop new colors made from aniline dyes.&lt;ref name=Ball214&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Bd3KqmkhPMC&amp;pg=PA214#v=onepage&amp;q=aniline%20mauve%20magenta&amp;f=false |title=Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Color  |author=Philip Ball  |edition=illustrated |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001  |isbn=978-0226036281  |page=214 |accessdate=27 July 2014}} Originally referenced from French edition pages 311–312 {{ISBN|978-2754105033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, François-Emmanuel Verguin, the director of the chemical factory of Louis Rafard near [[Lyon]], tried many different formulae before finally in late 1858 or early 1859, mixing aniline with [[carbon tetrachloride]], producing a reddish-purple dye which he called "[[fuchsine]]", after the color of the flower of the fuchsia plant. He quit the Rafard factory and took his color to a firm of paint manufacturers, Francisque and Joseph Renard, who began to manufacture the dye in 1859.

In the same year, two British chemists, Chambers Nicolson and George Maule, working at the laboratory of the paint manufacturer George Simpson, located in Walworth, south of London, made another aniline dye with a similar red-purple color, which they began to manufacture in 1860 under the name "roseine". In 1860 they changed the name of the color to "magenta", in honor of the [[Battle of Magenta]] fought between the French and Austrians at [[Magenta, Lombardy]] the year before, and the new color became a commercial success.&lt;ref name=Ball214/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maerz and Paul. ''A Dictionary of Color'', New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 126 Plate 52 Color Sample K12–Magenta&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1935 the family of [[quinacridone]] dyes was developed. These have colors ranging from red to violet, so nowadays a quinacridone dye is often used for magenta. Various tones of magenta—light, bright, brilliant, vivid, rich, or deep—may be formulated by adding varying amounts of white to quinacridone artist's paints.

Another dye used for magenta is [[Lithol Rubine BK]]. One of its uses is as a food coloring.

===Process magenta (pigment magenta; printer's magenta) (1890s)===

}}
In [[color printing]], the color called '''process magenta''', '''pigment magenta''', or '''printer's magenta''' is one of the three primary pigment colors which, along with [[yellow]] and [[cyan]], constitute the three [[Primary colors#Subtractive primaries|subtractive primary colors]] of pigment. (The secondary colors of pigment are blue, green, and red.) As such, the hue magenta is the [[complementary color|complement]] of [[green]]: magenta [[pigment]]s absorb green light; thus magenta and green are opposite colors.

The [[CMYK]] printing process was invented in the 1890s, when newspapers began to publish color [[comic strip]]s.

Process magenta is not an [[RGB]] color, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer's ink, so there may be variations in the printed color that is pure magenta ink. A typical formulation of ''process magenta'' is shown in the color box at right.

===Web colors magenta and fuchsia===

At right is the [[web color]] '''magenta'''. It is one of the three secondary colors in the [[RGB color model]].
On the [[:File:RBG color wheel.svg|RGB color wheel]], magenta is the color between [[Rose (color)|rose]] and [[Violet (color)|violet]], and halfway between [[red]] and [[blue]].

{{color swatch|#ff00ff|Magenta (fuchsia)|right}}

This color is called ''magenta'' in [[X11 color names|X11]] and ''fuchsia'' in [[HTML]]. In the RGB color model, it is created by combining equal intensities of red and blue light. The two web colors magenta and '''fuchsia''' are exactly the same color. Sometimes the web color magenta is called ''electric magenta'' or ''electronic magenta''.

While the magenta used in printing and the web color have the same name, they have important differences. Process magenta (the color used for magenta printing ink—also called printer's or pigment magenta) is much less vivid than the color magenta achievable on a computer screen. CMYK printing technology cannot accurately reproduce on paper the color on the computer screen. When the web color magenta is reproduced on paper, it is called fuchsia and it is physically impossible for it to appear on paper as vivid as on a computer screen.

Colored pencils and [[crayon]]s called "magenta" are usually colored the color of ''process magenta'' (''printer's magenta'') shown above.

==In science and culture==

===In art===
*Shades of magenta began to appear in art soon after it was introduced. [[Paul Gauguin]] (1848-1903) used a shade of magenta in 1890 in his portrait of Marie Lagadu, and in some of his South Seas paintings.
*[[Henri Matisse]] and the members of the [[Fauvist]] movement used magenta and other non-traditional colors to surprise viewers, and to move their emotions through the use of bold colors.
*Since the mid-1960s, water based fluorescent magenta paint has been available to paint [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] [[black light]] [[painting]]s. (Fluorescent [[Cerise (color)|cerise]], fluorescent [[chartreuse yellow]], fluorescent blue, and fluorescent green.)
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===In astronomy===
*Astronomers have reported that [[Stellar classification|spectral class]] T brown dwarfs (the ones with the coolest temperatures except for the recently discovered Y brown dwarfs) are colored magenta because of absorption by [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] [[atom]]s of light in the green portion of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkstar1.co.uk/ds3.htm Brown Dwarves] (go halfway down the website to see a picture of a magenta brown dwarf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burrows et al.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===In botany===
Magenta is a common color for flowers, particularly in the tropics and sub-tropics. Because magenta is the complementary color of green, magenta flowers have the highest contrast with the green foliage, and therefore are more visible to the animals needed for their pollination.

===In public transport===
Magenta was the English name of Tokyo's [[Toei Ōedo Line|Oedo]] subway line color. It was later alternated to ''[[ruby]]''.

=== In transportation ===
In aircraft [[autopilot]] systems, the path that pilot or plane should follow to its destination is usually indicated in cockpit displays using the color magenta.&lt;ref name="autopilot"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/children-of-the-magenta-automation-paradox-pt-1/ | title = Children of the Magenta (Automation Paradox, pt. 1) | first = Katie | last = Mingle | date = 2015-06-23 | work = 99% Invisible }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In vexilology and heraldry ==
Magenta is an extremely rare color to find on heraldic flags and coats of arms, since its adoption dates back to relatively recent times. However, there are some examples of its use:
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Flag of Cartago (Valle del Cauca).svg| Flag of the [[Cartago, Colombia|municipality of Cartago]], [[Colombia]].
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===In politics===
*The color magenta is used to symbolize [[anti-racism]] by the [[Amsterdam]]-based anti-racism Magenta Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Magenta Foundation. [http://www.magenta.nl/english/ Organization website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827010357/http://www.magenta.nl/english/ |date=2006-08-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Danish politics the magenta is the color of [[Det Radikale Venstre]], the Danish social-liberal party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5430">A '''manifest''', '''customs manifest''' or '''cargo document''' is a [[document]] listing the [[cargo]], [[passenger]]s, and [[crew]] of a [[ship]], [[aircraft]], or [[vehicle]], for the use of [[customs]] and other officials. Where such a list is limited to identifying passengers, it is a '''passenger manifest''' or '''passenger list'''; conversely, a list limited to identifying cargo is a '''cargo manifest''' or '''cargo list'''. The manifest may be used by people having an interest in the transport to ensure that passengers and cargo listed as having been placed on board the transport at the beginning of its passage continue to be on board when it arrives at its destination.&lt;blockquote&gt;This document, made up generally by the ship's broker, from the contents of the [[Bill of lading|bills of lading]], contains a specification of the nature and quantity of the cargo laden, and is generally attested officially, and in some countries notarially. The [[Prize (law)|prize laws]] seldom mention this paper ; nor is it general ; but yet of essential importance in case of search, as well for belligerents, as for neutrals in procuring a speedy dismissal. It is usual to require it at the [[Customs|custom]] house.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=fIUuAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=%22passport+bill+of+lading%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hhnjnpF6Zb&amp;sig=4xgrojj4cR-w9wx_qnTQK8OqrJI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBrZH2-4naAhUBQBQKHd1xCB8Q6AEIODAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22passport%20bill%20of%20lading%22&amp;f=false|title=Laws of the Sea: With Reference to Maritime Commerce During Peace and War|last=Jacobsen|first=Friedrich Johann|date=1818|publisher=Edward J. Coale.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this way, a cargo manifest is like a [[passport]] except that it is used for [[goods]] instead of (or in addition to) [[Person|persons]]; the manifest is evidence to the [[nationality]] of the goods, the absence of [[contraband]], and that property belonging to [[Belligerent|belligerents]] is not laden on board of the vessel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Vessels are under no legal obligation to carry a manifest and, indeed, it is only necessary for neutral vessels in a time of war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cargo manifest vs. bill of lading ==
A cargo manifest and a [[bill of lading]] may carry similar information and the concepts are not always clearly distinguished. In some cases, a single document may serve both purposes. In general, a bill of lading serves as a [[legal instrument]] focusing on and documenting such issues as [[ownership]], whereas a cargo manifest is often more concerned with physical aspects of the cargo, such as [[weight]] and [[size]]. When the cargo is being shipped by several different shipping companies on the same vessel, there will usually be separate bills of lading for each company, but only a single consolidated cargo manifest. On the other hand, if the cargo contains [[dangerous goods]], there may be a separate dangerous cargo manifest. 
 
==Uses==
===Customs and excise===
[[Customs|Customs authorities]] may require cargo-carrying vessels or vehicles to provide information on the cargo manifest such as its consignor, consignee, quantity of goods, origin, destination and value.&lt;ref name=BusinessDictionary&gt;Business Dictionary.com, "[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/manifest.html Manifest]", retrieved 23 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===International travel===
Immigration authorities may require passenger-carrying vessels or vehicles to provide a passenger manifest listing information such as names and ports of embarkation and disembarkation.&lt;ref name=BusinessDictionary/&gt;

===Disasters===
In case of [[disaster]]s, passenger manifests may be helpful in identifying casualties and notifying families of passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Code of Federal Regulations]] |chapter-url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/243.1 |chapter=14 CFR Part 243 - Passenger Manifest Information, §243.1 Purpose }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 13, 1997 |title=Domestic Passenger Manifest Information – Advance notice of proposed rulemaking |url=https://www.epic.org/privacy/faa/passenger_manifest_397.html |journal=Federal Register |volume=62 |number=49 |access-date=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cargo manifests can support [[insurance claim]]s for lost goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Customer Support – Marine Cargo Claims / Documents Required |author= |url=http://www.ecics.com.sg/customer-support.html |publisher=[[List of insurance companies in Singapore|ECICS Limited]] |date=2014 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
Manifests can be useful tools for [[archaeology]]. For example, researchers used old ship's manifests to recreate the available amenities in their restoration of the historic [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|Custom House Plaza]] in [[Monterey, California]],&lt;ref&gt;Maxine Cass, ''Northern California Off the Beaten Path, 8th: A Guide to Unique Places'' (2009), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; which was built in 1821 and remains the oldest public building in [[California]].

'''Mester de juglaría''' ("Ministry of [[jongleur]]y") is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[Spanish literature|literature]] [[genre]] from the 12th and 13th centuries, transmitted [[oral tradition|orally]]
by "juglares" who made their living by telling and singing these stories in public places and palaces while performing short theatrical scenes, acrobatics or other amusements.

These anonymous stories were mostly [[cantar de gesta]]. Although versified to make
it easier to memorize, juglares probably often changed the story a little bit as they passed it to others.

There are more theories regarding the origin of these texts. The ''individualist theory'' states that these texts
were the creation of one poet and they didn't change much. On the other hand, the ''traditionalist theory''
says that it is a collective work of the public and it was totally changed on its route.

Compared to the [[Mester de Clerecía]] the authors weren't educated, it treats popular topics, the language is simple and the metrics of the verses is irregular.

The most known examples of the works that can be classified as Mester de Juglaría is El [[Cantar de Mio Cid]] and [[Representación de los Reyes Magos]].

'''Metarealism''' is a direction in [[Russian poetry]] and art that was born in the 1970s to the 1980s. The term was first used by [[Mikhail Epstein|Mikhail Epshtein]], who coined it in 1981 and made it public in the Soviet magazine "Voprosy Literatury" in 1983; see below his "Theses on Metarealism and Conceptualism" from 1983 and the following years [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.concept.metareal.html] Also: Third Wave: The New Russian Poetry. Ed. K. Johnson &amp; S. M. Ashby. Preface by M. Epshtein, A. Wachtel, [[Alexei Parshchikov|A. Parshchikov]]. University of Michigan Press, 1992 {{ISBN|0-472-06415-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;10, 53, 184 [https://books.google.com/books?id=czhO4m4yjZUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA173&amp;lpg=RA1-PA173&amp;dq=metarealism+poetry&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9zVPX-rMeG&amp;sig=gKOXtyHheDWHsGEgc15Vh1Gknf4#PPP1,M1], Tom Epstein's essay «Metarealism» in the anthology Crossing Centuries: The New Generations in Russian Poetry. Ed. High, John. NY: Talisman House Pub., 2000 {{ISBN|1-883689-90-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-883689-90-2}}, p.&amp;nbsp;87-89, and [[Marjorie Perloff]] "Russian Postmodernism: An Oxymoron?" in Postmodern Culture, Volume 3, # 2, January 1993 [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/postmodern_culture/v003/3.2perloff.html].

M. Epshtein insists that in its philosophic dimension metarealism is "[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] realism," while "stylistically" metarealism is "[[metaphorical]]" realism. (See the most detailed explanation and exposition of this term in Epshtein's articles "Theses on Metarealism and Conceptualism" [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.concept.metareal.html], "A Catalogue of the New Poetries" (Russian version) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904005720/http://modernpoetry.by.ru/proekt/epshtein.htm |date=September 4, 2007 }} and in its English version [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.catalog.poetry.html] Thus, "meta" means both "through" and "beyond" the reality that we all can see; hence, "metarealism" is the realism of the hyperphysical nature of things. The main expression of its essence is given through a non-visual [[metaphor]] or, according to another Epshtein's term, a "metabola" (rather than [[hyperbole]]), that means "transfer" or "transition," opening many dimensions. [See part 3 in {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904005720/http://modernpoetry.by.ru/proekt/epshtein.htm |date=September 4, 2007 }} "Metabola" is different from the [[symbol]] or a "visual" metaphor, because it assumes the interosculation of realities. See: M.Epshtein. After the Future: the Paradoxes of Postmodernism &amp; Contemporary Russian Culture. [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1995, 416 p.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|0-87023-973-2}}, {{ISBN|0-87023-974-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;40–50. Metarealism has very little to do with [[surrealism]], since it appeals to the [[superconscious]] and not to the [[subconscious]], thus opening up a many-dimensional perception of the world.

Metarealism further gained traction after it became a subject of the House of Artists debate at an exhibition of the [[Hyperreality|Hyperrealists]], where its utility was discussed as a new method of creation to overcome traditional realism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge Communication: Transparency, Democracy, Global Governance|last=Mesaros|first=Caludiu|publisher=Editura Universității de Vest|year=2011|isbn=9789731253497|location=|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==What is metarealism?==

[http://www.metarealism.com Metarealism] is synonymous to metaconscience, which means beyond psychological consciousness, beyond a subjective psychological polarized view of reality. Metarealism seeks to depict the reality which exists beyond that psychological subjective perspective. Metarealism proposes not only to communicate further than the pictorial aspect of the perception of other dimensions of reality, but also the essence of those dimensions and their relation to us as human beings. Metarealism then becomes a tool for the evolution of consciousness; just like in the old days when artists painted sacred art to depict their vision of the reality they perceived, through their spiritual interpretation of other dimensions. Thus, Epstein explained that the entire history of world art is the premise and source of metarealism, particularly its condensed codes, encyclopedic summaries, and extracts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|last2=Genis|first2=Alexander|last3=Vladiv-Glover|first3=Slobodanka|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2016|isbn=9781782388647|location=New York|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, metabola or metabole is derived from the dictionary and a microencyclopedia of culture, compressed and translated from one language to another so that it pertains to a reality consisted of interpenetration of different consubstantial realities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Epstein, metarealism is an attempt to return to the word the fullness of its [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] and transcendent meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After the Future: The Paradoxes of Postmodernism and Contemporary Russian Culture|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1995|isbn=0870239732|location=Amherst|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metarealism could be also considered a sacred art, in that it also tries to depict, through a [metaconscious] perspective, the essence of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind. Meta meaning, a [[holistic]] view of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind, who sees reality as a whole rather than from a subjective personalized intellectually fragmented point of view. Metarealism is the materialization in pictorial form of the reality of other dimensions and their direct effect, and relation upon us. Metarealism tries to depict the relations between those dimensions of reality and how we psychologically interpret them through our sub mental symbolism. As a narrative style, metarealism does not have a clearly defined lyrical hero and focuses instead on the so-called sum of perceptions, which is "the geometrical space constituted by points of view.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Metarealism in visual art==

According to Bernard De Montréal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.psychologie-alternative.com/Bernard%20de%20Montreal.htm |title=Bernard de Montreal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114114543/http://www.psychologie-alternative.com/Bernard%20de%20Montreal.htm |archive-date=2017-01-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; most contemporary visual arts are involutionary art that expresses the dissimulated frustrations and struggle of the unconscious self in her search for real identity through the [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]], sub mental symbolism of the art form an [[avocation]] of the soul that has little in common with the interdimensional identity of the self.

Conscious or mental art "metarealism" when created by an metaconscious artist is inspired from the higher self, and is a channel for the dictation of the conscious science of art, instead of being simply a lower form of self-expression, a cultural artefact of relative value.

The mental artist has little need for unconscious expression and directs her creative "expiration" toward the exploration of higher consciousness through her art, rather than simply entertaining a fictitious role. Art in its astral form belongs to our kind of civilization. We still need its contention that there is more to reality than appears at first sight. Art in its higher form is therefore created by a totally new human being.

The reader is able to get an idea about a peculiar “philosophy of language” of metarealists, constants of their poetic world, metametaphor, “poetic theater” and other things.

The '''''Miracle of the Cross at the Ponte di Rialto''''', also known as '''''The Healing of the Madman''''' (Italian: ''Miracolo della Croce a Rialto'') is a painting by Italian Renaissance artist [[Vittore Carpaccio]], dating from c. 1496. It is now housed in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]] in [[Venice]].

==History==
The painting was commissioned for the Grand Hall of the  [[Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista]], the seat of the eponymous brotherhood in Venice. The commission included a total of nine large canvasses, by prominent artists of the time such as Bellini, [[Perugino]], [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Giovanni Mansueti]], [[Lazzaro Bastiani]] and [[Benedetto Rusconi]]. 
[[File:Vittore carpaccio, miracolo della Croce a Rialto 02.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Detail.]]
The subject of the paintings was to be the miracles of a fragment of the [[True Cross]]. The item had been donated to the brotherhood by [[Philippe de Mézières]] (or Filippo Maser), chancellor of the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] and [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] in 1369, and soon became the object of veneration in the city.

The canvasses were all executed in 1496-1501. All survive today, aside from that by Perugino, and are now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia.

==Description==
The painting shows the miracle of the healing of a madman through the relic of the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]], held by the [[Patriarchate of Grado|Patriarch of Grado]]  Francesco Querini, which took place in the   Palazzo a San Silvestro on the  [[Canal Grande]], near the [[Rialto Bridge]]. The scene has an asymmetrical composition, with figures in the foreground at the left and, behind them, the façade of the buildings following the canal. They feature the typical inverted cone chimneys of medieval Venice.
[[File:Vittore carpaccio, miracolo della Croce a Rialto 03.jpg|thumb|220px|Detail.]]
The miraculous event is relegated in a wide loggia in the upper left corner: most of the canvas is occupied by a veduta with a great number of  characters and naturalistic items. The people include a group of walkers who precede the religious procession following the relic. The bridge is still in wood, as it was  before it collapsed in 1524. Like the current version (dating from 1591) it had a double row of shops at the sides and, at the top, a movable  boardwalk needed to allow the passage of the taller vessels. 

On the right is the 15th century appearance of the  [[Fondaco dei Tedeschi]], destroyed by a fire in January 1505. Other architectural features include the bell tower of [[San Giovanni Crisostomo]], the portico of [[Ca' da Mosto]] and the bell tower of [[Santi Apostoli, Venice|Santi Apostoli]] before its reconstruction in   1672.

Details of human activities include the private gondolas used as ferries, the presence of numerous foreigners with eastern style garments, women clearing carpets, and workers who are clearing their barrels.

'''Norwegian Design Council''' ({{lang-no|Norsk Designråd}}) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] state-controlled [[stiftelse|foundation]] that encouraged good [[design]] of Norwegian products as a key to improved innovation and the products international reputation and sales.

Among the activities of the Norwegian Design Council were awarding the  ''Merket for God Design'' and ''Design Effekt'' awards. It also cooperated closely with [[Innovation Norway]] concerning new ventures. The council worked as a competence centre and was funded by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry]], through consulting and through other projects.

'''Ordubad Buzkhana''' – is an ice-house located in [[Ordubad]]. The architectural monument was built in the XIV century. It is one of the largest ice-houses in Azerbaijan. The ice-house is located on the southern side of the city of Nakhchivan, also near the Imamzadeh complex. It is one of three main ice houses in Nakhchivan, one of the other ones being [[Nakhchivan Buzkhana]].

It was restored in the XVIII century. In 2014, the historical and architectural buzkhana was restored and operated again.&lt;ref name="azertag"&gt;{{cite web|title= Buzxanalar Naxçıvanın tarixi abidələri sırasında özünəməxsus yer tutur|url= https://azertag.az/xeber/Buzxanalar_Naxchivanin_tarixi_abideleri_sirasinda_ozunemexsus_yer_tutur-1024511|publisher= azertag.az|language= az|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The total area of the ice house is 166 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, its height is 11,32 meters. The building consists of a large room in internal entrance, a double stair with 36 stairs and a cellar where the ice is kept. The ice house has 5 domes, a common hall, an entrance and an auxiliary room. The walls are built of baked bricks and lime-clay mixture. Thickness of the walls of the building is 0.8 meter. The ceiling of the room is flat.&lt;ref name="naxcivantv"&gt;{{cite web|title= Naxçıvan inciləri: Buzxanalar|url= http://naxcivantv.az/index.php/x-b-rl-r/940-buzxana.html|publisher= naxcivantv.az|language= az|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dqmk"&gt;{{cite web|title= Naxçıvan inciləri: Buzxanalar|url= http://www.dqmk.nmr.az/medeniyyet/tarixi_abideler/ordubad_buzxana.php|publisher= dqmk.nmr.az|language= az|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The ice house was built for commercial purposes. In the past, ice-houses were used by local residents to protect themselves, their personal belongings and their food products against heat in summer. Special people used to extract ice from the buzkhana by wearing special clothes and fed needs of people of Ordubad.&lt;ref name="dqmk"/&gt;

'''Palace of Culture and Science''' ({{lang-pl|Pałac Kultury i Nauki}}; abbreviated '''''PKiN''''') is a notable high-rise building in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. Constructed in 1955, it is the center for various companies, public institutions and cultural activities such as concerts, cinemas, theaters, libraries, sports clubs, universities, scientific institutions and authorities of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]. Motivated by Polish historicism and American [[art deco]] high-rise buildings, the PKiN was designed by Soviet architect [[Lev Rudnev]] in [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|"Seven Sisters"]] style and is informally referred to as the ''[[Eighth Sister]]''.

The Palace of Culture and Science is the tallest building in Poland, the [[List of tallest buildings in the European Union|eighth-tallest building]] in the [[European Union]] and one of the [[List of tallest buildings in Europe|tallest on the European continent]]. It is {{convert|237|m}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pkin.pl/historia-palacu/ "History of the Palace"], at the official website (retrieved March 22, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Name===
The building was originally known as the Joseph Stalin Palace of Culture and Science (''Pałac Kultury i Nauki imienia Józefa Stalina''), but in the wake of [[destalinization]] the dedication to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] was revoked.&lt;ref name="Palace-2" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestufs.net/download/conferences/Warsaw_May07/BESTUFS_Warsaw_May07_Conference_Leaflet.pdf |publisher=Best Urban Freight Solutions |title=Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science |date=24 May 2007 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin's name was removed from the colonnade, interior lobby and one of the building's sculptures.

Varsovians still commonly use nicknames to refer to the palace, notably ''Pekin'' ("[[Beijing]]", because of its abbreviated name ''PKiN''), and ''Pajac'' ("clown", a word that sounds close to ''Pałac''). Other less common names include ''Stalin's syringe'', the ''Elephant in Lacy Underwear'', ''Russian Wedding Cake'', or even ''Ch.j Stalina'' (Stalin's D..k").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =|url =http://www.whatsonwhen.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=destination&amp;loc_id=135388&amp;sub_section=Don't+Miss|title =Warsaw: Don't Miss|work =www.whatsonwhen.com|publisher =|pages =|page =|date =|accessdate =25 July 2008|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110816144716/http://www.whatsonwhen.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=destination&amp;loc_id=135388&amp;sub_section=Don%27t+Miss|archivedate =16 August 2011|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author = Małgorzata Barwicka |url =http://www.tc.ciechanow.pl/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=4422|title = Pałac pod lupą |work = www.tc.ciechanow.pl |publisher = Tygodnik Ciechanowski |pages = |page = |date = 7 March 2007 |accessdate = 29 July 2008|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, only ''Pekin'' was the popular alternative name. Also, despite some later confusion, the name ''patyk'' (a Polish word for stick) didn't stand for PKiN but for the {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} signpost, in the corner of the [[Parade Square]], near the intersection of [[Marszałkowska Street]] and [[Jerusalem Avenue]]. The four walls of the signpost display the names of several large or important cities around the world, together with the distances from the signpost itself.

===Construction===
[[File:Pałac Kultury i Nauki - 01.jpg|thumb|left|South view of the Palace]]
Construction started in 1952 and lasted until 1955. A gift from the Soviet Union to the people of Poland, the tower was constructed, using Soviet plans, by 3,500 to 5,000 Russian workers and 4,000 Polish workers. Sixteen workers died in accidents during the construction.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web  |author = |url = http://www.pkin.pl/historia/ |title = History of PKiN in a nutshell |work = www.pkin.pl |publisher = |pages = |page = |date = |accessdate = 25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian builders were housed at a new suburban complex built at Poland's expense, with its own cinema, food court, community centre and swimming pool, called Osiedle "Przyjaźni" (Neighborhood of Friendship).&lt;ref name="Palace-2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pkin.pl/historia/  Pałac Kultury i Nauki "Historia"] at the PKN official website.&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of the building is closely related to [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|several similar skyscrapers]] built in the Soviet Union of the same era, most notably the [[Main building of Moscow State University]]. However, the main architect [[Lev Vladimirovich Rudnev|Lev Rudnev]] incorporated some Polish architectural details into the project after traveling around Poland and seeing the architecture.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The monumental walls are headed with pieces of masonry copied from [[Renaissance]] houses and palaces of [[Kraków]] and [[Zamość]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Shortly after opening, the building hosted the [[5th World Festival of Youth and Students]]. Many visiting dignitaries toured the Palace, and it also hosted performances by notable international artists, such as a 1967 concert by [[The Rolling Stones]], the first by a major western rock group behind the [[Iron Curtain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author = Timothy Tilghman |url = http://rockontour.net/bj67.html |title = The Stones Tumultuous 1967 European Tour |work = rockontour.net |publisher = |pages = |page = |date = |accessdate = 25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, it hosted the historic [[Leonard Cohen]] concert, surrounded by many political expectations, which were avoided by Cohen in his prolonged introductions during the three-hour show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/warsaw85.html |title=Leonard Cohen in Warsaw (1985) by Daniel Wyszogrodzki |publisher=Leonardcohenfiles.com |date=22 March 1985 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four {{convert|6.3|m|adj=mid}} clock faces were added to the top of the building ahead of the millennium celebrations in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Philopappos monument.jpg|thumb|250px|A close-up view of the Philopappu Monument]]
'''The Philopappu Monument''' ({{lang-el|Μνημείο Φιλοπάππου}}) is an [[ancient Greek]] [[mausoleum]] and [[monument]] dedicated to ''Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes [[Philopappos]]'' or ''Philopappus'', ({{lang-el|Γάιος Ιούλιος Αντίοχος Επιφανής Φιλόπαππος}}, 65–116 AD), a prince from the [[Kingdom of Commagene]]. It is located on Mouseion Hill in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], southwest of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]].

== Origins ==
Philopappos died in 116, and his death caused great grief to his sister [[Julia Balbilla]], citizens of Athens and possibly to the imperial family. As a dedication to honor the memory of Philopappos, Balbilla with the citizens of Athens erected a tomb structure on [[Muse]] '''Hill''' (Lofos Muson) near the [[Acropolis of Athens]]. His marble tomb monument is still known as the Philopappu Monument, and the hill is today known as '''Philopappu Hill''' (Λόφος Φιλοπάππου). 

The Greek geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (''Description of Greece'', I.25.8), describes Philopappos’ grand tomb as a ''monument built for a Syrian man''. The monument was built on the same site where Musaios or [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]], a 6th-century BC priestly poet and mystical seer, was held to have been buried. The location of this tomb, opposite the Acropolis and within formal boundaries of the city, shows the high position Philopappos had within Athenian society.

== Description ==
Philopappos’ monument is a two-storey structure, supported by a base. On the lower level there is a frieze representing Philopappos as a [[Roman consul|consul]], riding on a chariot and led by [[lictor]]s. The upper level shows statues of three men: of [[Antiochus IV of Commagene|Antiochus IV]] on the left, of Philopappos in the centre and of [[Seleucus I Nicator]], now lost, on the right.

In the niche below Philopappos is an inscription in Greek: Φιλόπαππος Επιφάνους Βησαιεύς ("Philopappos, son of Epiphanes of the [[deme]] of the Besa"). This was the name Philopappos carried as an Athenian citizen. In the niche left of Philopappos, a Latin inscription records Philopappos’ titles, honors and his career as a [[Roman magistrate]]: "Caius Iulius Antiochus Philopappos, son of Caius, of the Fabian tribe, consul and Arval brother, admitted to the praetorian rank by the emperor Caesar Nerva [[Trajan]] Optimus [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] Germanicus Dacicus". On the right niche of Philopappos once stood a Greek inscription (now only the base is preserved): Βασιλεύς Αντίοχος Φιλόπαππος Βασιλέως Επιφανούς Αντιόχου ("King Antiochus Philopappos, son of King Antiochus Epiphanes"). 

Below the statue of Antiochus IV, Philopappos' paternal grandfather, is an inscription that states "King Antiochus son of King Antiochus". This inscription honors Antiochus IV and his late father, the last independent ruler of the [[Kingdom of Commagene]], King [[Antiochus III of Commagene|Antiochus III Epiphanes]]. When Antiochus III died in 17, Commagene was annexed by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Tiberius]] and became a part of the [[Roman Empire]]. Below the statue of Seleucus I, the founder of the [[Seleucid Empire]] from whom the Commagene kings claimed descent, stood another inscription, now lost. The traveller [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli|Cyriacus of Ancona]] wrote in his memoir that underneath the inscription stated "King Seleucus Nicator, son of Antiochus".

The monument measures {{convert|9.80|×|9.30|m}}, and contains Philopappos’ burial chamber. The structure is built of white [[Pentelic marble]] on a [[socle (architecture)|socle]] {{convert|3.08|m}} high, made of porous marble and veneered with slabs of [[Hymettus|Hymettian]] marble. The north side of Philopappos’ monument bears lavish architectural decorations.

== Excavations and history ==
In 1898, excavations were carried out at the monument and in 1899 conservation work was undertaken. In 1940, archaeologists H. A. Thompson and J. Travlos conducted small additional excavations. Recent investigations have certified that architectural parts of Philopappos’ Monument were used for construction of the Minaret in the [[Parthenon]]. 

Only two-thirds of the façade remains. The tomb chamber behind the façade is completely destroyed except for the base. The Philopappos Monument was apparently still intact in 1436, when the traveller [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli]] visited the monument and wrote in his memoirs that the monument was still intact. The destruction of the monument must have occurred after this time.

== The Philopappou movement ==
The year 2002 saw the rise of a movement in Athens to defend the natural character of what the people call Philopappou Hill, where the Philopappos Monument is located.

With an area of {{convert|173|acre}}, which was declared an archaeological park in 1955-56, it is first and foremost the home of indigenous birds, including the Athenian owl and the peregrine falcon, as well as an important stop-over for many migratory birds, amounting to a total of about 94 different species. It also has a community of land tortoises, bats and a large variety of plant species. Philopappou Hill includes: the Hill of the Muses, the Hill of the Nymphs, and the [[Pnyx]], the latter being of great historical importance, as it was the meeting place of democratic legislatures in ancient times. 
The park is likewise known for the beautiful landscaping and stone pathways created by architect [[Dimitris Pikionis]], who also restored the 16th-century Byzantine chapel of Saint Dimitrios [Loumbardiaris] in 1954-58. In 1996 the Ministry of Culture declared the works of Pikionis a monument of contemporary architecture. They are also listed by UNESCO as a protected monument of cultural heritage. For more than 10 years the residents of the neighbourhoods surrounding the Hill have challenged the plans of the Ministry of Culture to fence the entire 173 acres and restrict access by imposing visiting hours and an entrance fee.

It is to this day the belief of the movement that the best protection for the hill is guaranteed by the love, care and active participation of the local people. As a result of their tenacity, the largest and most naturally beautiful public space in Athens remains free and open to all, day and night.

[[File:Tuke, Henry Scott (1858–1929), Ruby, gold and malachite, 1902.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Henry Scott Tuke]], ''Ruby, Gold and Malachite'', 1902]]

'''''Ruby, Gold and Malachite''''' is an [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by [[Henry Scott Tuke]].  It depicts six young men in and around a boat, bathing in the sea.  It was painted near [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and exhibited at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1902, along with two other works by Tuke, ''The Run Home'' and ''Portrait of Alfred de Pass''.   It was one of his greatest successes.

The painting measures {{convert|117|cm|in}} by {{convert|159|cm|in}}.  It was acquired by the [[City of London Corporation]] and is displayed at the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]].

==Background==
[[File:Tuke, Henry Scott (1858–1929), "August Blue," 1893.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Scott Tuke]], ''[[August Blue]]'', 1893-4, Tate Britain.]]
Tuke was born in [[York]] in 1858, but his family moved to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] the following year, where it was hoped the milder climate would ameliorate the tuberculosis suffered by his father, the physician [[Daniel Hack Tuke]]. He showed early talent for art, and studied at the [[Slade School of Art]] in London in 1874–9 and in Paris from 1881 to 1883, and also travelled to Italy.  He returned to [[Cornwall]] to live in Falmouth 1883, and is usually identified as a member of the [[Newlyn school]].  Many of his works involve boys or young men, often in or beside the sea, and usually naked, although generally in a position where their genitals are hidden from view.

==Painting==
The painting depicts six young men at [[Newporth Beach]] near Falmouth on a summer's day, in and about a rowing boat on the sea by the shoreline.  The painting shows no horizon, making it the open-air space more enclosed and intimate.  Four of the subjects are [[art nude|naked]]: one swimming to the upper left, one resting on rocks to the lower left, one wading and holding the boat to the lower right, and one sitting on the side of the boat in the centre.  The two others are clothed: one standing in white trousers holding an oar at the rear of the boat, and one sitting in the boat with white hat and trousers and an eye-catching red top.
[[File: Ruby, Gold and Malachite (detail).jpg|thumb|A detail from ''Ruby, Gold and Malachite'', with Charlie Mitchell as model.]]

The painting is ambiguous, and can be read in several ways: as a celebration of athletic masculinity; a representation of the innocence and purity of youth, unselfconscious in a natural setting; an image of a lost [[rural idyll]]; a depiction of the sons of empire; or (in the aftermath of the [[Boer War]]) as celebration of pleasure and an implicit criticism of the militarisation of youth.  Many commentators note Tuke's acquaintance with the [[Uranian]] movement and discern a [[homoerotic]] charge.

The title ''[[Ruby]], [[Gold]] and [[Malachite]]'' – referring to the red, yellow and green tones used in the work&amp;nbsp;– echo an essay by [[John Addington Symonds]], and may refer back to the opening lines of a poem "The Sundew" published by [[Algernon Swinburne]] in 1866: "A little marsh-plant, yellow-green, // And pricked at lip with tender red".  The poem describes a lovers' tryst in marshland, witnessed by a [[sundew]].  Swinburne's poem was the inspiration for Tuke's 1894 work, ''[[August Blue]]'', the title of Tuke's painting being a quotation from the closing lines of the poem.

Tuke used several of his regular models for the work, including the brothers Richard and Georgie Fouracre, Bert White, Harry Cleave, and Charlie Mitchell (1885–1957, shown resting on the rocks in the lower left) who was Tuke's boatman for 30 years.  Tuke left Mitchell £1,000 in his will.

==Reception==
Pictures of naked youths outside of a classical context were not generally acceptable in this period, with a notable exception for depictions of bathing: another prominent example is [[Thomas Eakins]]' ''[[The Swimming Hole]]'' (1883–5).  Tuke was elected an [[Associate of the Royal Academy]] in 1900 and a full member of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1914.  His work remained popular until the First World War ended the gilded age of late Victorian and Edwardian England.   Tuke's work fell out of favour after the war, and Tuke died in 1929.  His work regained popularity after it was discovered by a generation of [[openly gay]] art enthusiasts in the 1970s.

It is a [[parody]] of the [[self-help]] book genre.

Andrea Beach of [[Common Sense Media]] gave the book a rating of three out of five stars, stating, in part, "Fans of her Miranda Sings YouTube channel will love this colorfully absurd satire of the self-help industry. ...Older teens can be encouraged to think about how Colleen Ballinger ... uses satire, irony, and exaggeration and how those techniques affect the real message conveyed." The site goes on to state, "The book may seem ridiculous at first glance, but mature, media-savvy teens can absorb positive messages about the absurdity of how self-help and self-esteem videos make things look so easy ... and find a sense of community in realizing they're not the only ones who recognize social media's often-unrealistic expectations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrea|last=Beach| url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews/selp-helf| title=''Selp-Helf''| website= Common Sense Media|accessdate= April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Symphony No. 2''' in E minor, is one of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] composer [[Aram Khachaturian]]'s most well-known pieces of music. Completed in 1944, it was nicknamed ''The Bell'' or ''Symphony with Bells'' by Georgi Khubov&lt;ref name=Stokowski2 /&gt; for its bell motif that begins and ends the piece. A typical performance lasts about 50 minutes.

==Background==
Written during the height of the Second World War, Khachaturian's second symphony illustrates the pain that humanity, and the composer himself, felt at the time, although he was comfortably tucked away in the [[Union of Soviet Composers|Composer's Union]] retreat in [[Ivanovo]], with the likes of [[Sergei Prokofiev]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. The composer described the piece as being "a requiem of wrath, a requiem of protest against war and violence."&lt;ref name=Reel&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reel|first1=James|title=Aram Khachaturian: Symphony No. 2 in A minor ("Symphony with Bells")|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/symphony-no-2-in-a-minor-symphony-with-bells-mc0002366559|website=AllMusic|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that it "embodied everything that the people think and feel today."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|title=War Years: Composer of the Week, Aram Khachaturian (1903-1978)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04mb6ch|website=BBC Radio 3|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written for the 25th anniversary of the Russian Revolution.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Aram Khachaturian: Soviet Composer|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Aram-Khachaturian|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have said of it: "The Bell is 50 minutes of unrelenting power, and those moments when you think it’s relenting are simply chances for Khachaturian to reload the IS-3 tank that is his orchestra."&lt;ref name=Tank&gt;{{cite web|title=Something cool you might have missed: The Bell!|url=https://klacknermusic.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/something-cool-you-might-have-missed-the-bell/|website=Everything but the Music|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it took Khachaturian only two months to write, the composer would revise it many more times.

The world premiere took place on 30 December 1943 at the [[Moscow Conservatory]], with the [[State Academic Symphony Orchestra of the Russian Federation|State Symphony Orchestra of the USSR]] and conductor [[Boris Khaykin]].&lt;ref name=Stokowski1&gt;{{cite web|title=1948 Sep 24 Tour: Stokowski|url=http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/f561c2ea-b81a-4ee2-94fd-41ad290c4b57/fullview#page/16/mode/2up|website=New York Philharmonic: Leon Levy Digital Archives|publisher=New York Philharmonic|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony's United States premiere was given by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and a special orchestra as assembled only for the occasion in [[Carnegie Hall]] on 13 April 1945. All the musicians performing dedicated their service to the War Orphans of Stalingrad, where the concert's proceeds were donated as well.&lt;ref name=Stokowski2&gt;{{cite web|title=1949 Jan 20, 21|url=http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/4123ff0b-dbf6-43a6-840d-572ec8427710/fullview#page/4/mode/2up|website=New York Philharmonic: Leon Levy Digital Archives|publisher=New York Philharmonic|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The symphony is scored for: [[piccolo]], two [[Western concert flute|flutes]], two [[oboe]]s, [[Cor anglais|English Horn]], two [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, four [[French Horn]]s, three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[Military drums|military drum]], [[cymbal]]s, [[Gong|tam-tam]], [[bass drum]], [[Glockenspiel|bells]], [[xylophone]], [[harp]], [[piano]], and [[String Instrument|strings]].

During one of Khachaturian's numerous revisions of the symphony, he swapped places of the inner two movements.&lt;ref name=Woodstra&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodstra|first1=Chris|last2=Brennan|first2=Gerald|last3=Schrott|first3=Allan|title=All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music|date=2005|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9780879308650|page=687|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nlDOICBmhbkC&amp;pg=PA686&amp;lpg=PA686&amp;dq=Symphony+No.+2+Khachaturian+premiere&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3-8SGMtbWR&amp;sig=qHx49cJU7m6uX6-ZFP9MDVra-M4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO94uU1pPKAhUMmBoKHYIXAW4Q6AEIQzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Symphony%20No.%202%20Khachaturian%20premiere&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is the current order:

#Andante maestoso
#Allegro risoluto
#Andante sostenuto
#Andante mosso - allegro sostenuto. Maestoso

The first movement begins with a bell motif that gives the symphony its nickname, "but it immediately falls into the Technicolor, Armenian-flavored style familiar from Khachaturian's ballet Spartacus," James Reel writes.&lt;ref name=Reel /&gt; "A mournful section develops, carried mainly by the strings, and is repeatedly thrown into contrast with the alarming gesture from the movement's opening bars. Despite passages of high drama, the movement ends with a long, gradual fade-out." The ''Allegro risoluto'', sometimes the second and sometimes the third movement, is very rhythmic and forward moving. This movement is much less sinister and more life filled than the other movements. Khachaturian called that life "rest after hard labor."&lt;ref name=Reel /&gt; The ''Andante sostenuto'' is the most tragic movement of the whole symphony, the most [[requiem]]-like part of the piece. Its funeral march atmosphere comes from an [[Armenian culture|Armenian]] folk melody. Here, the climax is attained with the bell theme. However, the composer wrote of the ''Andante'': "I wish that listeners would not look for concrete illustrations to a series of pictures of superhuman sufferings caused to the Soviet people by the Nazi monsters. But I can't help admitting that while writing the Andante, I saw those horrible sights before my mind's eye."&lt;ref name=Stokowski2 /&gt; Soviet critic Khubov, who gave the symphony its nickname, wrote of the last movement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the fourth movement ... exultation is the feeling. Piercing fanfares open the section. The brass hurls out what is perhaps aptly described as a "Brass Chorus of Glory." Some softer fragments follow with echoings of previous themes. Then, a grand climax is attained as the "bell theme" and the "Brass Chorus" thunder out an idea symbolic of triumph.&lt;ref name=Stokowski2 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5848">'''TV Lab''' (short for Television Laboratory) was a program founded at [[WNET|Thirteen/WNET]] public television station in 1972 by [[David Loxton]] with support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and [[New York State Council on the Arts]]. The program provided artists with advanced video making equipment through an artist-in-residence program. Between 1975 and 1977, the Video Tape Review series was established and broadcast through TV Lab. David Loxton created TV Lab's Independent Documentary Fund in 1977, aiming to provide funding for the creation of independent documentaries. Unable to match funds from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the IDF and TV Lab lost support, eventually ending in 1984.&lt;ref name="vanishingvision"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=James|title=The Vanishing Vision: The Inside Story of Public Television|year=1995|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=9780520086593|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1971, the Rockefeller Foundation donated $150,000 for the establishment of TV Lab. At the time, [[Howard Klein (music critic)|Howard Klein]] was Assistant Director at the Rockefeller Foundation and played an instrumental role in the Rockefeller Foundation's decision to donate to TV Lab at Thirteen/WNET, working with [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]'s Fred Barzyk and artist Nam June Paik, among others. Initially, [[John Jay Iselin]], WNET's President at the time, suggested Robert Kotlowitz for the role of TV Lab director, but artists involved in the project expressed discontent with the proposal. Barzyk then suggested David Loxton for the position of Director, and in 1972 TV Lab began under Loxton's direction with additional grants from the New York State Council on the Arts.&lt;ref name="SturkenKlein"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sturken|first=Marita|title=Howard Klein and the Rockefeller Foundation's funding of the media arts|journal=Afterimage|date=January 1987|volume=14|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1972 and 1974, TV Lab primarily operated through an artist-in-residence program, supporting artists in the creation of [[video art]]. [[Nam June Paik]], [[Dimitri Devyatkin]], [[Ed Emshwiller]], [[Shirley Clarke]], and [[Douglas Davis (artist)|Douglas Davis]] were among artists who participated in the artist-in-residence program during this initial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=London|first=Barbara|title=Video: A Selected Chronology, 1963-1983|journal=Art Journal|date=Autumn 1985|volume=45|issue=3|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, [[TVTV (video collective)|TVTV video collective]] came to Loxton seeking support for a guerrilla video project about guru Maharaj-Ji and his followers at the Houston Astrodome.&lt;ref name="vanishingvision" /&gt; This became TV Lab's first video documentary, ''Lord of the Universe'', marking the beginning of TV Lab's venture into non-fiction video.

In 1975, the Video Tape Review (VTR) series hosted by Russell Connor was established as part of TV Lab, airing until 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gever|first=Martha|title=Pressure Points: Video in the Public Sphere|journal=Art Journal|date=Autumn 1985|volume=45|issue=3|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; VTR was used to introduce viewers to artists at TV Lab and provide some exposure to their work, and in its two years, featured the work of artists and video collectives including Jon Alpert and Keiko Tsuno, TVTV, Broadside TV, and Video Freex.  In 1977, David Loxton created the Independent Documentary Fund (IDF) at TV Lab, founded by the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. The IDF provided funds for independent documentaries such as [[Jack Willis|Jack Willis']] ''[[Paul Jacobs and the Nuclear Gang]]'' and [[Rob Epstein|Robert Epstein's]] ''[[The Times of Harvey Milk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Howard|title=Nam June Paik and TV Lab: License to Create|url=http://media.gfem.org/node/9494|publisher=Grantmakers in Film and Electronic Media|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006045021/http://media.gfem.org/node/9494|archivedate=2013-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, TV Lab lost funding from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] when Program Fund Director Lewis Freedman did not renew CPB funds, and TV Lab was unable to match required funds from the National Endowment for the Arts.&lt;ref name="vanishingvision" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SturkenKlein" /&gt;

[[File:BnF ms. 854 fol. 49 - Perdigon (1).jpg|thumb|right|The troubadour [[Perdigon]] playing his fiddle.]]
A '''troubadour''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|t|r|uː|b|ə|d|ʊər|}}, {{IPA-fr|tʁubaduʁ|lang}}; {{lang-oc|trobador}}, {{IPA-oc|tɾuβaˈðu|IPA}}&lt;!--, &lt;small&gt;archaically:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-oc|tɾuβaˈðor|}}{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the Old Occitan pronunciation|date=September 2013}}--&gt;) was a composer and performer of [[Old Occitan]] [[lyric poetry]] during the [[High Middle Ages]] (1100–1350). Since the word ''troubadour'' is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a [[trobairitz]].

The troubadour school or tradition began in the late 11th century in [[Occitania]], but it subsequently spread to Italy and Spain. Under the influence of the troubadours, related movements sprang up throughout Europe: the [[Minnesang]] in Germany, ''[[trovadorismo]]'' in [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]] and Portugal, and that of the [[trouvère]]s in northern France. [[Dante Alighieri]] in his ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' defined the troubadour lyric as ''fictio rethorica musicaque poita'': rhetorical, musical, and poetical fiction. After the "classical" period around the turn of the 13th century and a mid-century resurgence, the art of the troubadours declined in the 14th century and around the time of the [[Black Death]] (1348) it died out. 

The texts of troubadour songs deal mainly with themes of [[chivalry]] and [[courtly love]]. Most were metaphysical, intellectual, and formulaic. Many were humorous or vulgar satires. Works can be grouped into three styles: the ''[[trobar leu]]'' (light), ''[[trobar ric]]'' (rich), and ''[[trobar clus]]'' (closed). Likewise there were many [[genre]]s, the most popular being the ''[[canso (song)|canso]]'', but ''[[sirventes]]'' and ''[[tenso]]s'' were especially popular in the post-classical period.

==Etymology of name==
The oldest mention of the word ''troubadour'' as ''trobadors'' is found in a 12th-century Occitan text by [[Cercamon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolf|first=George|title=The Poetry of Cercamon and Jaufre Rudel.|year=1983|publisher=Garland Publishing|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word ''troubadour'' is an exact rendition from a French word first recorded in 1575 in an historical context to mean "langue d'oc poet at the court in the 12th and 13th century" ([[Jean de Nostredame]], ''Vies des anciens Poètes provençaux'', p.&amp;nbsp;14 in Gdf. Compl.).&lt;ref name="cnrtl.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/troubadour|title=TROUBADOUR : Etymologie de TROUBADOUR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French word is borrowed itself from the Occitan word ''trobador''. It is the [[oblique case]] of the [[nominative]] ''trobaire'' “composer", related to ''trobar'' “to compose, to discuss, to invent" ([[Wace]], ''Brut'', editions I. Arnold, 3342) It may come from the hypothetical [[Late Latin]] *''tropāre'' “to compose, to invent a poem" by regular [[phonetic change]]. This recreated form is deduced from the Latin root ''tropus'', meaning a [[Trope (music)|trope]] and the various meanings of the Old Occitan related words. In turn, the Latin word derives ultimately from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''τρόπος'' (''tropos''), meaning "turn, manner".&lt;ref name=chaytor&gt;Chaytor, [http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Troubadours1.html Part 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; B [[Intervocal]] Latin [p] shifted regularly to [b] in Occitan (cf. Latin ''sapere'' &gt; Occitan ''saber'' “to know") (cf. Latin ''sapere'' &gt; ''savoir''). The Latin suffix ''-ātor'', ''-atōris'' explains the Occitan suffix, according to its [[declension]] and [[Diacritical mark|accentuation]] : Gallo-Romance &lt;small&gt;*TROPĀTOR&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Allières, ''La formation de la langue française'', coll. Que sais-je ?, éditions PUF, 1982, p. 49.  2) Imparisyllabiques β) Mots en -OR -ŌRE.&lt;/ref&gt; &gt; Occitan ''trobaire'' (subject case) and &lt;small&gt;*TROPATŌRE&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="ALLIÈRES 49"&gt;ALLIÈRES 49.&lt;/ref&gt; &gt; Occitan ''trobador'' « troubadour » (oblique case).

There is an alternative theory to explain the meaning of ''trobar'' as “to compose, to discuss, to invent". It has the support of some historians, specialists of literature and musicologists to justify of the troubadours' origins in Arabic [[Andalusian classical music|Andalusian musical]] practices. According to them, the Arabic word ''ṭaraba'' “song" (from the [[triliteral]] root Ṭ-R-B (طرب) “provoke emotion, excitement, agitation; make music, entertain by singing") could partly be the etymon of the verb ''trobar''.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Rosa Menocal (1985), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/474171 "Pride and Prejudice in Medieval Studies: European and Oriental"], ''Hispanic Review'', '''53''':1, 61–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The origin and meaning of courtly love: a critical study of European scholarship|author=Roger Boase|page=131|year=1977|publisher=Manchester University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Arabic root had already been proposed before : Ḍ-R-B (ضرب) “strike", by extension “play a musical instrument".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ahess_0395-2649_1966_num_21_5_421446 Richard Lemay, « À propos de l'origine arabe de l'art des troubadours », ''Annales. Économies, sociétés, civilisations'', vol. 21, n°5, 1966, p. 991 (French)]&lt;/ref&gt; They entertain the possibility that the nearly homophonous Ḍ-R-B root may have contributed to the sense of the newly coined Romance verb ''trobar''.

Some proponents of this theory argue, only on cultural grounds, that both etymologies may well be correct, and that there may have been a conscious poetic exploitation of the [[Phonology|phonological]] coincidence between ''trobar'' and the triliteral Arabic root Ṭ-R-B when [[Sufism|Sufi Islamic]] musical forms with a love theme first spread from [[Al-Andalus]] to southern France. It has also been pointed out that the concepts of "finding", "music", "love", and "ardour" — the precise semantic field attached to the word troubadour — are allied in Arabic under a single root W-J-D (وجد) that plays a major role in Sufic discussions of music, and that the word troubadour may in part reflect this.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Idries Shah]], ''The Sufis''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the linguistic facts do not support a hypothetical theory : the word ''trover'' is mentioned in French as soon as the 10th century before ''trobar'' in Occitan (see above) and the word ''trovere'' &gt; ''trouvère'' appears almost simultaneously in French as ''trobador'' in Occitan (see above).

In archaic and classical troubadour poetry, the word is only used in a mocking sense, having more or less the meaning of "somebody who makes things up". Cercamon writes:
:''Ist trobador, entre ver e mentir,''
:''Afollon drutz e molhers et espos,''
:''E van dizen qu'Amors vay en biays''
::(These troubadours, between truth and lies/corrupt lovers, women and husbands,/ and keep saying that Love proceeds obliquely).&lt;ref&gt;''Puois nostre temps comens'a brunezir''; read the whole text [http://www.trobar.org/troubadours/cercamon/cmn5.php here]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peire d'Alvernha]] also begins his famous mockery of contemporary authors ''cantarai d'aquest trobadors'',&lt;ref&gt;read the whole text [http://www.trobar.org/troubadours/alvernha/pealv12.php here]&lt;/ref&gt; after which he proceeds to explain why none of them is worth anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Del Monte|first=A.|title=Peire d'Alvernha, Liriche|year=1955|location=Turin}}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to themselves seriously, troubadours almost invariably use the word "chantaire" (singer).

==Origins==
The early study of the troubadours focused intensely on their origins. No academic consensus was ever achieved in the area. Today, one can distinguish at least eleven competing theories (the adjectives used below are a blend from the [[Grove Dictionary of Music]] and Roger Boase's ''The Origins and Meaning of Courtly Love''):

#'''Arabic''' (also '''Arabist''' or '''Hispano-Arabic''')&lt;br&gt;The sixteenth century Italian historian Giammaria Barbieri was perhaps the first to suggest Arabian influences on the music of the troubadours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Diminutives in the "dīwān" of Ibn Quzmān: A Product of Their Hispanic Milieu?|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume=52|issue=2|year=1989|page=241|last1=Abu-Haidar|first1=JA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars like J.B. Trend have asserted that the poetry of troubadours is connected to Arabic poetry written in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Veldeman|first1=Marie-Christine|year=2001|volume=28|issue=2|page=87-100|journal=Equivalences|title=Egypt, or the quest for syncretism and spiritual wholeness in Lawrence Durrell's Avignon Quintet}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have attempted to find direct evidence of this influence. In examining the works of [[William IX of Aquitaine]], [[Évariste Lévi-Provençal]] and other scholars found three lines that they believed were in some form of Arabic, indicating a potential Andalusian origin for his works. The scholars attempted to translate the lines in question, though the medievalist Istvan Frank contended that the lines were not Arabic at all, but instead the result of the rewriting of the original by a later scribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malkin|first1=Peter|title=Provence and Pound|page=326|publisher=University of California|year=1979|isbn=978-0520034884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=“Beech1992”&gt;{{cite journal|title= Troubadour Contacts with Muslim Spain and Knowledge of Arabic: New Evidence Concerning William IX of Aquitaine |journal=Romania|year=1992|page=14-26|last1=Beech|first1=George T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars like [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]] stated that the troubadour tradition was created by William, who had been influenced by [[Moorish]] music and poetry while fighting with the [[Reconquista]]. However, George T. Beech states that there is only one documented battle that William fought in Spain, and it occurred towards the end of his life. Beech adds that while the sources of William’s inspirations are uncertain, he and his father did have Spanish individuals within their extended family, and he may have been friendly with some Europeans who could speak the Arabic language.&lt;ref name=“Beech1992” /&gt; Regardless of William's personal involvement in the tradition's creation, [[Magda Bogin]] states that Arab poetry was likely one of several influences on European “courtly love poetry”, citing [[Ibn Hazm]]’s “[[The Ring of the Dove]]” as an example of a similar Arab tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogin|first1=Magda|last2=Bogin|first2=Meg|title=The Women Troubadours|year=1995|publisher=WW Norton|page=46-47|isbn=978-0393009651}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of transmission from Arab Spain to the rest of Europe did exist, such as the [[Toledo School of Translators]], though it only began translating major romances from Arabic into Latin in the second half of the thirteenth century, with [[Expurgation|objectionable sexual content]] removed in deference to the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1997|isbn=978-0415609845|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies|editor=Mona Baker and Kirsten Malmkjaer|page=553|chapter=Spanish tradition|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#'''Bernardine-Marianist''' or '''Christian'''&lt;br&gt;According to this theory, it was the theology espoused by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and the increasingly important [[Mariology]] that most strongly influenced the development of the troubadour genre. Specifically, the emphasis on religious and spiritual love, disinterestedness, mysticism, and devotion to Mary explained "courtly love". The emphasis of the reforming [[Robert of Arbrissel]] on "matronage" to achieve his ends can explain the troubadour attitude towards women.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald A. Bond, "Origins", in Akehurst and Davis, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronologically, however, this hypothesis is hard to sustain (the forces believed to have given rise to the phenomenon arrived later than it). But the influence of Bernardine and Marian theology can be retained without the origins theory. This theory was advanced early by Eduard Wechssler and further by Dmitri Scheludko (who emphasises the [[Cluniac Reform]]) and Guido Errante. Mario Casella and Leo Spitzer have added "[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]]" influence to it.
#'''Celtic''' or '''Chivalric-Matriarchal'''&lt;br&gt;The survival of pre-Christian sexual ''mores'' and warrior codes from [[matriarchal]] societies, be they [[Celt]]ic, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], or [[Pictish]], among the aristocracy of Europe can account for the idea (fusion) of "courtly love". The existence of pre-Christian matriarchy has usually been treated with scepticism as has the persistence of underlying paganism in high medieval Europe.
#'''Classical Latin'''&lt;br&gt;The classical Latin theory emphasises parallels between [[Ovid]], especially his ''Amores'' and ''Ars amatoria'', and the lyric of courtly love. The ''aetas ovidiana'' that predominated in the 11th century in and around [[Orléans]], the quasi-[[Cicero]]nian ideology that held sway in the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial court]], and the scraps of [[Plato]] then available to scholars have all been cited as classical influences on troubadour poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald A. Bond, "Origins", in Akehurst and Davis, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;
#('''Crypto-''')'''Cathar'''&lt;br&gt;According to this thesis, troubadour poetry is a reflection of [[Cathar]] religious doctrine. While the theory is supported by the traditional and near-universal account of the decline of the troubadours coinciding with the suppression of Catharism during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (first half of the 13th century), support for it has come in waves. The explicitly Catholic meaning of many early troubadour works also works against the theory.
#'''Liturgical'''&lt;br&gt;The troubadour lyric may be a development of the Christian [[liturgy]] and [[hymnody]]. The influence of the [[Song of Songs]] has even been suggested. There is no preceding [[Latin poetry]] resembling that of the troubadours. On those grounds, no theory of the latter's origins in classical or post-classical Latin can be constructed, but that has not deterred some, who believe that a pre-existing Latin corpus must merely be lost to us.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; That many troubadours received their grammatical training in Latin through the Church (from ''clerici'', clerics) and that many were trained musically by the Church is well-attested. The musical school of [[St. Martial's Abbey, Limoges|Saint Martial's]] at [[Limoges]] has been singled out in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; "Para-liturgical" [[trope (literature)|trope]]s were in use there in the era preceding the troubadours' appearance.
#'''Feudal-social''' or '''-sociological'''&lt;br&gt;This theory or set of related theories has gained ground in the 20th century. It is more a methodological approach to the question than a theory; it asks not from where the content or form of the lyric came but rather in what situation/circumstances did it arise.&lt;ref name=menocal47&gt;Menocal, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Marxist]] influence, [[Erich Köhler]], [[Marc Bloch]], and [[Georges Duby]] have suggested that the "essential hegemony" in the castle of the lord's wife during his absence was a driving force. The use of [[feudal]] terminology in troubadour poems is seen as evidence. This theory has been developed away from sociological towards [[psychological]] explanation.
#'''Folklore''' or '''Spring Folk Ritual'''&lt;br&gt;According to [[María Rosa Menocal]], [[Alfred Jeanroy]] first suggested that [[folklore]] and [[oral tradition]] gave rise to troubadour poetry in 1883. According to F. M. Warren, it was [[Gaston Paris]], Jeanroy's reviewer, in 1891 who first located troubadour origins in the festive dances of women hearkening the spring in the [[Loire Valley]]. This theory has since been widely discredited, but the discovery of the ''[[jarcha]]s'' raises the question of the extent of literature (oral or written) in the 11th century and earlier.&lt;ref name=menocal47/&gt;
#'''Medieval Latin''' or '''Mediolatin''' ('''Goliardic''')&lt;br&gt;Hans Spanke analysed the intertextual connexion between vernacular and [[medieval Latin]] (such as [[Goliardic]]) songs. This theory is supported by Reto Bezzola, Peter Dronke, and musicologist [[Jacques Chailley]]. According to them, ''trobar'' means "inventing a trope", the trope being a poem where the words are used with a meaning different from their common signification, i.e. [[metaphor]] and [[metonymy]]. This poem was originally inserted in a serial of modulations ending a liturgic song. Then the trope became an autonomous piece organized in stanza form.&lt;ref name="DITL"&gt;[http://www.ditl.info/arttest/art4482.php Troubadour], ''Observatoire de terminologie littéraire'', [[University of Limoges]], France.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of late 11th-century poets of the "[[Loire school]]", such as [[Marbod of Rennes]] and [[Hildebert of Lavardin]], is stressed in this connexion by Brinkmann.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald A. Bond, "Origins", in Akehurst and Davis, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Neoplatonic'''&lt;br&gt;This theory is one of the more intellectualising. The "ennobling effects of love" in specific have been identified as [[Neoplatonic]].&lt;ref&gt;Menocal, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; It is viewed either as a strength or weakness that this theory requires a second theory about how the Neoplatonism was transmitted to the troubadours; perhaps it can be coupled with one of the other origins stories or perhaps it is just peripheral. Käte Axhausen has "exploited" this theory and A. J. Denomy has linked it with the Arabist (through [[Avicenna]]) and the Cathar (through [[John Scotus Eriugena]]).&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vilém9.jpg|thumb|left|[[William IX of Aquitaine]] portrayed as a knight, who first composed poetry on returning from the [[Crusade of 1101]]]]

===Early period===
The earliest troubadour whose work survives is Guilhèm de Peitieus, better known as Duke [[William IX of Aquitaine]] (1071–1126). Peter Dronke, author of ''The Medieval Lyric'', however, believes that "[his] songs represent not the beginnings of a tradition but summits of achievement in that tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dronke, ''The Medieval Lyric'', Perennial Library, 1968. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; His name has been preserved because he was the [[Duke of Aquitaine]], but his work plays with already established structures; [[Eble II of Ventadorn]] is often credited as a predecessor, though none of his work survives. [[Orderic Vitalis]] referred to William composing songs about his experiences on his return from the [[Crusade of 1101]] (c. 1102). This may be the earliest reference to troubadour lyrics. Orderic also provides us (1135) with what may be the first description of a troubadour performance: an eyewitness account of William of Aquitaine.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Picauensis uero dux ... miserias captiuitatis suae ... coram regibus et magnatis atque Christianis coetibus multotiens retulit rythmicis uersibus cum facetis modulationibus''. (X.21)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then the Poitevin duke ... the miseries of his captivity ... before kings, magnates, and Christian assemblies many times related with rhythmic verses and witty measures.&lt;ref&gt;Translation based on [[Marjorie Chibnall]], in Bond, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Spread===
[[File:Troubadours berlin.jpg|thumb|200px|Trobadours, 14th century]]
The first half of the 12th century saw relatively few recorded troubadours. Only in the last decades of the century did troubadour activity explode. Almost half of all troubadour works that survive are from the period 1180–1220.&lt;ref&gt;Paden, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;
In total, moreover, there are over 2,500 troubadour lyrics available to be studied as lingusitic artifacts (Akehurst, 23).
The troubadour tradition seems to have begun in western Aquitaine ([[Poitou]] and [[Saintonge]]) and [[Gascony]], from there spreading over into eastern Aquitaine ([[Limousin (province)|Limousin]] and [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]]) and [[Provence]]. At its height it had become popular in [[Languedoc]] and the regions of [[Rouergue]], [[Toulouse]], and [[Quercy]] (c. 1200). Finally, in the early 13th century it began to spread into first Italy and then [[Catalonia]], whence to the rest of Spain and to Portugal. This development has been called the ''rayonnement des troubadours'' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɛjɔnmɑ̃ dɛ tʁubaduːʁ|pron}}).&lt;ref&gt;Paden, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical period===
The classical period of troubadour activity lasted from about 1170 until about 1213. The most famous names among the ranks of troubadours belong to this period. During this period the lyric art of the troubadours reached the height of its popularity and the number of surviving poems is greatest from this period. During this period the ''[[Canso (song)|canso]]'', or love song, became distinguishable as a genre. The master of the ''canso'' and the troubadour who epitomises the classical period is [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]. He was highly regarded by his contemporaries, as were [[Giraut de Bornelh]], reputed by his biographer to be the greatest composer of melodies to ever live, and [[Bertran de Born]], the master of the ''[[sirventes]]'', or political song, which became increasingly popular in this period.

The classical period came to be seen by later generations, especially in the 14th and 15th centuries and outside of Occitania, as representing the high point of lyric poetry and models to be emulated. The language of the classic poets, its grammar and vocabulary, their style and themes, were the ideal to which poets of the troubadour revival in Toulouse and their Catalan and Castilian contemporaries aspired. During the classical period the "rules" of poetic composition had first become standardised and written down, first by [[Raimon Vidal]] and then by [[Uc Faidit]].

==Lives==
{{see also|List of troubadours and trobairitz|Minstrel|Vida (Occitan literary form)|Razo|Consistori del Gay Saber|Consistori de Barcelona}}
The 450 or so troubadours known to historians came from a variety of backgrounds. They made their living in a variety of ways, lived and travelled in many different places, and were actors in many types of social context. The troubadours were not wandering entertainers. Typically, they stayed in one place for a lengthy period of time under the patronage of a wealthy nobleman or woman. Many did travel extensively, however, sojourning at one court and then another.

===Status===
The earliest known troubadour, the Duke of Aquitaine, came from the high nobility. He was followed immediately by two poets of unknown origins, known only by their sobriquets, [[Cercamon]] and [[Marcabru]], and by a member of the princely class, [[Jaufre Rudel]]. Many troubadours are described in their ''vidas'' as poor knights. It was one of the most common descriptors of status: [[Berenguier de Palazol]], [[Gausbert Amiel]], [[Guilhem Ademar]], [[Guiraudo lo Ros]], [[Marcabru]], [[Peire de Maensac]], [[Peirol]], [[Raimon de Miraval]], [[Rigaut de Berbezilh]], and [[Uc de Pena]]. [[Albertet de Sestaro]] is described as the son of a noble jongleur, presumably a [[Petty nobility|petty noble]] lineage.

Later troubadours especially could belong to lower classes, ranging from the middle class of merchants and "burgers" (persons of urban standing) to tradesmen and others who worked with their hands. [[Salh d'Escola]] and [[Elias de Barjols]] were described as the sons of merchants and [[Elias Fonsalada]] was the son of a burger and jongleur. [[Perdigon]] was the son of a "poor fisherman" and [[Elias Cairel]] of a blacksmith. [[Arnaut de Mareuil]] is specified in his ''vida'' as coming from a poor family, but whether this family was poor by noble standards or more global ones is not apparent.

Many troubadours also possessed a clerical education. For some this was their springboard to composition, since their clerical education equipped them with an understanding of musical and poetic forms as well as vocal training. The ''vidas'' of the following troubadours note their clerical status: [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], [[Folquet de Marselha]] (who became a bishop), [[Gui d'Ussel]], [[Guillem Ramon de Gironella]], [[Jofre de Foixà]] (who became an abbot), [[Peire de Bussignac]], [[Peire Rogier]], [[Raimon de Cornet]], [[Uc Brunet]], and [[Uc de Saint Circ]].

===''Trobadors'' and ''joglars''===
[[File:Vielles and Citole, Manuscript T (El Escorial, Biblioteca del Real Monasterio, MS. T. I. 1), fol. 5r, detail.jpg|thumb|right|Musicians in the time of the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]. These were in the court of the king, two [[vielle]] players and one [[citoler]].]]

The Occitan words ''trobador'' and ''trobaire'' are relatively rare compared with the verb ''trobar'' (compose, invent), which was usually applied to the writing of poetry. It signified that a poem was original to an author (''trobador'') and was not merely sung or played by one. The term was used mostly for poetry only and in more careful works, like the ''vidas'', is not generally applied to the composition of music or to singing, though the troubadour's poetry itself is not so careful. Sometime in the middle of the 12th century, however, a distinction was definitely being made between an inventor of original verse and the performers of others'. These last were called ''joglars'', from the Latin ''ioculatores'', giving rise also to the French ''jongleur'', Castilian ''juglar'', and English [[juggler]], which has come to refer to a more specific breed of performer. The medieval ''jongleur/joglar'' is really a [[minstrel]].

At the height of troubadour poetry (the "classical period"), troubadours are often found attacking ''jongleurs'' and at least two small genres arose around the theme: the ''ensenhamen joglaresc'' and the ''sirventes joglaresc''. These terms are debated, however, since the adjective ''joglaresc'' seems to imply "in the manner of the ''jongleurs''". Inevitably, however, pieces of these genres are verbal attacks at ''jongleurs'', in general and in specific, with named individuals being called out. It is clear, for example from the poetry of [[Bertran de Born]], that ''jongleurs'' were performers who did not usually  compose.They often performed the troubadour's songs: singing, playing instruments, dancing, and even doing acrobatics.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest reference to the ''[[basse danse]]'' comes from [[Raimon de Cornet]], who attributes it to the ''jongleurs'' of the mid-14th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 13th century [[Guiraut Riquier]] bemoaned the inexactness of his contemporaries and wrote a letter to [[Alfonso X of Castile]], a noted patron of literature and learning of all kinds, for clarification on the proper reference of the terms ''trobador'' and ''joglar''. According to Riquier, every vocation deserved a name of its own and the sloppy usage of ''joglar'' assured that it covered a multitude of activities, some, no doubt, with which Riquier did not wish to be associated. In the end Riquier argued—and Alfonso X seems to agree, though his "response" was probably penned by Riquier—that a ''joglar'' was a courtly entertainer (as opposed to popular or low-class one) and a troubadour was a poet and composer.

Despite the distinctions noted, many troubadours were also known as jongleurs, either before they began composing or alongside. [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], [[Aimeric de Sarlat]], [[Albertet Cailla]], [[Arnaut de Mareuil]], [[Elias de Barjols]], [[Elias Fonsalada]], [[Falquet de Romans]], [[Guillem Magret]], [[Guiraut de Calanso]], [[Nicoletto da Torino]], [[Peire Raimon de Tolosa]], [[Peire Rogier]], [[Peire de Valeira]], [[Peirol]], [[Pistoleta]], [[Perdigon]], [[Salh d'Escola]], [[Uc de la Bacalaria]], [[Uc Brunet]], and [[Uc de Saint Circ]] were jongleur-troubadours.

===''Vidas'' and ''razos''===

A ''vida'' is a brief prose biography, written in [[Occitan]], of a troubadour. The word ''vida'' means "life" in Occitan. In the [[chansonnier]]s, the manuscript collections of medieval troubadour poetry, the works of a particular author are often accompanied by a short prose biography. The ''vidas'' are important early works of vernacular prose nonfiction. Nevertheless, it appears that many of them derive their facts from literal readings of their objects' poems, which leaves their historical reliability in doubt. Most of the ''vidas'' were composed in Italy in the 1220s, many by [[Uc de Saint Circ]].

A ''razo'' (from Occitan for "reason") was a similar short piece of Occitan prose detailing the circumstances of a particular composition. A ''razo'' normally introduced the poem it explained; it might, however, share some of the characteristics of a ''vida''. The ''razos'' suffer from the same problems as the ''vidas'' in terms of reliability. Many are likewise the work of Uc de Saint Circ.

===''Podestà''-troubadours===
A phenomenon arose in Italy, recognised around the turn of the 20th century by Giulio Bertoni, of men serving in several cities as ''[[podestà]]s'' on behalf of either the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph or Ghibelline]] party and writing political verse in Occitan rhyme. These figures generally came from the urban middle class. They aspired to high culture and though, unlike the nobility, they were not patrons of literature, they were its disseminators and its readers.

The first ''podestà''-troubadour was [[Rambertino Buvalelli]], possibly the first native Italian troubadour, who was ''podestà'' of [[Genoa]] between 1218 and 1221. Rambertino, a Guelph, served at one time or another as ''podestà'' of [[Brescia]], [[Milan]], [[Parma]], [[Mantua]], and [[Verona]]. It was probably during his three-year tenure there that he introduced Occitan lyric poetry to the city, which was later to develop a flourishing Occitan literary culture.

Among the ''podestà''-troubadours to follow Rambertino, four were from Genoa: the Guelphs [[Luca Grimaldi]], who also served in Florence, Milan, and [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]], and [[Luchetto Gattilusio]], who served in Milan, [[Cremona]], and Bologna, and the Ghibellines [[Perceval Doria]], who served in [[Arles]], [[Avignon]], [[Asti]], and [[Parma]], and [[Simon Doria]], sometime ''podestà'' of [[Savona]] and [[Albenga]]. Among the non-Genoese ''podestà''-troubadours was [[Alberico da Romano]], a nobleman of high rank who governed [[Vicenza]] and [[Treviso]] as variously a Ghibelline and a Guelph. He was a patron as well as a composer of Occitan lyric.

Mention should be made of the Provençal troubadour [[Isnart d'Entrevenas]], who was ''podestà'' of Arles in 1220, though he does not fit the phenomenon Giulio Bertoni first identified in Italy.

===Trobairitz===
{{main|Trobairitz}}
The ''trobairitz'' were the female troubadours, the first female composers of [[secular music]] in the Western tradition. The word ''trobairitz'' was first used in the 13th-century ''[[Romance of Flamenca]]'' and its derivation is the same as that of ''trobaire'' but in feminine form. There were also female counterparts to the ''joglars'': the ''[[joglaresse|joglaresas]]''. The number of trobairitz varies between sources: there were twenty or twenty-one named trobairitz, plus an additional poet known only as [[Domna H.]] There are several anonymous texts ascribed to women; the total number of trobairitz texts varies from twenty-three (Schultz-Gora), twenty-five ([[Pierre Bec|Bec]]), thirty-six (Bruckner, White, and Shepard), and forty-six (Rieger). Only one melody composed by a trobairitz (the [[Beatritz de Dia|Comtessa de Dia]]) survives. Out of a total of about 450 troubadours and 2,500 troubadour works, the trobairitz and their corpus form a minor but interesting and informative portion. They are, therefore, quite well studied.

[[File:BnF ms. 12473 fol. 110v - Na Castelloza (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Castelloza]]

The trobairitz were in most respects as varied a lot as their male counterparts, with the general exceptions of their poetic style and their provenance. They wrote predominantly ''[[cansos]]'' and ''[[tenso]]s''; only one ''sirventes'' by a named woman, [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]], survives (though two anonymous ones are attributed to women). One ''[[salut d'amor]]'', by a woman ([[Azalais d'Altier]]) to a woman ([[Clara d'Anduza]]) is also extant and one anonymous ''[[planh]]'' is usually assigned a female authorship. They wrote almost entirely within the ''[[trobar leu]]'' style; only two poems, one by [[Lombarda]] and another [[Alais, Yselda, and Carenza]], are usually considered to belong to the more demanding ''[[trobar clus]]''. None of the trobairitz were prolific, or if they were their work has not survived. Only two have left us more than one piece: the Comtessa de Dia, with four, and [[Castelloza]], with three or four. One of the known trobairitz, [[Gaudairença]], wrote a song entitled ''Coblas e dansas'', which has not survived; no other piece of hers has either.

The trobairitz came almost to a woman from [[Occitania]]. There are representatives from the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], [[Provence]], [[Languedoc]], the [[Dauphiné]], [[Toulousain]], and the [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]]. One trobairitz, [[Ysabella (trobairitz)|Ysabella]], may have been born in [[Périgord]], Northern Italy, [[Latin Empire|Greece]], or [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Palestine]]. All the trobairitz whose families we know were high-born ladies; only one, Lombarda, was probably of the merchant class. All the trobairitz known by name lived around the same time: the late 12th and the early 13th century (c. 1170 – c. 1260). The earliest was probably [[Tibors de Sarenom]], who was active in the 1150s (the date of her known composition is uncertain). The latest was either [[Garsenda of Forcalquier]], who died in 1242, though her period of poetic patronage and composition probably occurred a quarter century earlier, or [[Guilleuma de Rosers]], who composed a ''tenso'' with [[Lanfranc Cigala]], known between 1235 and 1257. There exist brief prose biographies—''[[Vida (Occitan literary form)|vidas]]''—for eight trobairitz: [[Almucs de Castelnau]] (actually a ''[[razo]]''), [[Azalais de Porcairagues]], the Comtessa de Dia, Castelloza, [[Iseut de Capio]] (also a ''razo''), Lombarda, [[Maria de Ventadorn]], and Tibors de Sarenom.

==Works==

===Schools and styles===

Three main styles of Occitan lyric poetry have been identified: the ''[[trobar leu]]'' (light), ''[[trobar ric]]'' (rich), and ''[[trobar clus]]'' (closed, [[Hermeticism|hermetic]]). The first was by far the most common: the wording is straightforward and relatively simple compared to the ''ric'' and literary devices are less common than in the ''clus''. This style was the most accessible and it was immensely popular. The most famous poet of the ''trobar leu'' was [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]. The ''trobar clus'' regularly escapes modern scholarly interpretation. Words are commonly used metaphorically and symbolically and what a poem appears to be about on its surface is rarely what is intended by the poet or understood by audiences "in the know". The ''clus'' style was invented early by [[Marcabru]] but only favoured by a few masters thereafter. The ''trobar ric'' style is not as opaque as the ''clus'', rather it employs a rich vocabulary, using many words, rare words, invented words, and unusual, colourful wordings.

Modern scholars recognise several "schools" in the troubadour tradition. Among the earliest is a school of followers of Marcabru, sometimes called the "Marcabrunian school": [[Bernart Marti]], [[Bernart de Venzac]], [[Gavaudan]], and [[Peire d'Alvernhe]]. These poets favoured the ''trobar clus'' or ''ric'' or a hybrid of the two. They were often moralising in tone and critical of contemporary courtly society. Another early school, whose style seems to have fallen out of favour, was the "Gascon school" of [[Cercamon]], [[Peire de Valeira]], and [[Guiraut de Calanso]]. Cercamon was said by his biographer to have composed in the "old style" (''la uzansa antiga'') and Guiraut's songs were ''d'aquella saison'' ("of that time"). This style of poetry seems to be attached to early troubadours from [[Gascony]] and was characterised by references to nature: leaves, flowers, birds, and their songs. This Gascon "literary fad" was unpopular in [[Provence]] in the early 13th century, harming the reputation of the poets associated with it.

In the late 13th century a school arose at [[Béziers]], once the centre of pre-Albigensian Languedoc and of the Trencavel lordships, in the 1260s–80s. Three poets epitomise this "school": [[Bernart d'Auriac]], [[Joan Esteve]], [[Joan Miralhas]], and [[Raimon Gaucelm]]. All three were natives of Béziers and lived there. All three were members of the urban middle class and no courtesans: Miralhas was possibly a potter and Bernart was a ''mayestre'' (teacher). All three were supporters of the French king [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] and the French aristocracy against the native Occitan nobility. They have been described as "Gallicised". Raimon Gaucelm supported the [[Eighth Crusade]] and even wrote a ''planh'', the only known one of its kind, to a burgher of Béziers. Joan Esteve and Bernart both composed in support of the French in the [[Aragonese Crusade]]. The Béziers are a shining example of the transformation of Occitania in the aftermath of the Albigensian Crusade, but also of the ability of troubadours to survive it.

===Genres===
Troubadours, at least after their style became established, usually followed some set of "rules", like those of the ''[[Leys d'amors]]'' (compiled between 1328 and 1337). Initially all troubadour verses were called simply ''vers'', yet this soon came to be reserved for only love songs and was later replaced by ''canso'', though the term lived on as an antique expression for the troubadours' early works and was even employed with a more technically meaning by the last generation of troubadours (mid-14th century), when it was thought to derive from the Latin word ''verus'' (truth) and was thus used to describe moralising or didactic pieces. The early troubadours developed many genres and these only proliferated as rules of composition came to be put in writing. The known genres are:
*''[[Alba (poetry)|Alba]]'' (morning song)— the song of a lover as dawn approaches, often with a watchman warning of the approach of a lady's jealous husband
*''[[Arlabecca]]''— a song defined by poetic metre, but perhaps once related to the [[rebec]]
*''[[Canso (song)|Canso]]'', originally ''vers'', also ''chanso'' or ''canço''— the love song, usually consisting of five or six [[stanza]]s with an [[envoi]]
*''[[Cobla (Occitan literary term)|Cobla esparsa]]''— a stand-alone stanza
*''[[Comiat]]''— a song renouncing a lover
*[[Crusade song]] (''canso de crozada'')— a song about the [[Crusades]], usually encouraging them
*''[[Dansa]]'' or ''balada''— a lively dance song with a [[refrain]]
*''[[Descort]]''— a song heavily discordant in verse form and/or feeling
*''[[Desdansa]]''— a dance designed for sad occasions
*''[[Devinalh]]''— a riddle or cryptogram
*''[[Ensenhamen]]''— a long didactic poem, usually not divided into stanzas, teaching a moral or practical lesson
*''[[Enuig]]''— a poem expressing indignation or feelings of insult
*''[[Escondig]]''— a lover's apology
*''[[Estampida]]''— a dance-like song
*''[[Gap (song)|Gap]]''— a boasting song, often presented as a challenge, often similar to modern sports chants
*''[[Maldit]]''— a song complaining about a lady's behaviour and character
*''[[Partimen]]''— a poetical exchange between two or more poets in which one is presented with a dilemma by another and responds
*''[[Pastorela]]''— the tale of the love request of a [[knight]] to a [[shepherdess]]
*''[[Planh]]''— a lament, especially on the death of some important figure
*''[[Plazer]]''— a poem expressing pleasure
*''[[Salut d'amor]]''— a love letter addressed to another, not always one's lover
*''[[Serena (song)|Serena]]''— the song of a lover waiting impatiently for the evening (to consummate his love)
*''[[Sestina]]''— highly structured verse form
*''[[Sirventes]]''— a political poem or [[satire]], originally put in the mouth of a paid soldier (''sirvens'')
*[[Sonnet]] (''sonet'')— an Italian genre imported into Occitan verse in the 13th century
*''[[Tenso]]''— a poetical debate which was usually an exchange between two poets, but could be fictional
*''[[Torneyamen]]''— a poetical debate between three or more persons, often with a judge (like a tournament)
*''[[Viadeyra|Viadeira]]''— a traveller's complaint

All these genres were highly fluid. A cross between a ''sirventes'' and a ''canso'' was a ''meg-sirventes'' (half-''sirventes'').&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes ''canso-sirventes'' or ''sirventes-canso'' was used. [[Bertran de Born]] uses the term ''miei sirventes''.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tenso'' could be "invented" by a single poet; an ''alba'' or ''canso'' could be written with religious significance, addressed to God or the Virgin; and a ''sirventes'' may be nothing more than a political attack. The ''maldit'' and the ''comiat'' were often connected as a ''maldit-comiat'' and they could be used to attack and renounce a figure other than a lady or a lover, like a commanding officer (when combined, in a way, with the ''sirventes'').

[[Peire Bremon Ricas Novas]] uses the term ''mieja chanso'' (half song) and [[Cerverí de Girona]] uses a similar phrase, ''miga canço'', both to refer to a short ''canso'' and not a mixture of genres as sometimes supposed. Cerverí's ''mig'' (or ''meig'') ''vers e miga canço'' was a ''vers'' in the new sense (a moralising song) that was also highly critical and thus combined the ''canso'' and the ''sirventes''. Among the more than one hundred works of Cerverí de Girona are many songs with unique labels, which may correspond more to "titles" than "genres", but that is debatable: ''peguesca'' (nonsense), ''espingadura'' ([[flageolet]] song), ''libel'' (legal petition), ''esdemessa'' (leap), ''somni'' (dream), ''acuyndamen'' (challenge), ''desirança'' (nostalgia), ''aniversari'' (anniversary), ''serena'' (serene).&lt;ref&gt;Frank M. Chambers (1985), ''An Introduction to Old Provençal Versification'', (Darby, PA: Diane Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87169-167-1}}.), pp. 195–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most "Crusading songs" are classified either as ''cansos'' or ''sirventes'' but sometimes separately. Some styles became popular in other languages and in other literary or musical traditions. In [[French literature|French]], the ''alba'' became the ''[[aubade]]'', the ''pastorela'' the ''[[pastourelle]]'', and the ''partimen'' the ''[[jeu parti]]''. The ''sestina'' became popular in [[Italian literature]]. The troubadours were not averse to borrowing either. The ''planh'' developed out of the Latin ''[[planctus]]'' and the sonnet was stolen from the [[Sicilian School]]. The [[basse danse]] (''bassa dansa'') was first mentioned in the troubadour tradition (c. 1324), but only as being performed by jongleurs.

[[File:BnF ms. 854 fol. 135 - Le moine de Montaudon (1).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Monge de Montaudon]] receiving a [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrow hawk]] as a prize for his performance in a contest]]

===Performance===
Troubadours performed their own songs. Jongleurs (performers) and ''cantaires'' (singers) also performed troubadours' songs. They could work from [[chansonnier]]s, many of which have survived, or possibly from more rudimentary (and temporary) songbooks, none of which have survived, if they even existed. Some troubadours, like [[Arnaut de Maruelh]], had their own jongleurs who were dedicated to singing their patron's work. Arnaut's ''joglar et cantaire'', probably both a singer and a messenger, who carried his love songs to his lady, was [[Pistoleta]]. The messenger was commonplace in troubadour poetry; many songs reference a messenger who will bring it to its intended ear. A troubadour often stayed with a noble patron of his own and entertained his court with his songs. Court songs could be used not only as entertainment but also as propaganda, praising the patron, mocking his enemies, encouraging his wars, teaching ethics and etiquette, and maintaining religious unity.

The court was not the only venue for troubadour performance. Competitions were held from an early date. According to the ''vida'' of the [[Monge de Montaudon]], he received a [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrow hawk]], a prized hunting bird, for his poetry from the ''cour du Puy'', some sort of poetry society associated with the court of [[Alfonso II of Aragon]]. The most famous contests were held in the twilight of the troubadours in the 14th and 15th centuries. The ''[[jocs florals]]'' held by the [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] at [[Toulouse]], by [[Peter IV of Aragon]] at [[Lleida]], and the [[Consistori de Barcelona|Consistori de la Gaya Sciència]] at [[Barcelona]] awarded floral prizes to the best poetry in various categories, judging it by its accordance with a code called the ''[[Leys d'amors]]''.

Troubadour songs are still performed and recorded today, albeit rarely.
{{Listen|filename=A Chantar2.ogg|title=A chantar m'er|description=The only existing song by a ''trobairitz'' which survives with music.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

===Music===
Troubadour songs were usually [[monophony|monophonic]]. Fewer than 300 melodies out of an estimated 2500 survive.&lt;ref&gt;''The Grove Concise Dictionary of Music'' edited by Stanley Sadie. Macmillan Press Ltd., London.&lt;/ref&gt; Most were composed by the troubadours themselves. Some were set to pre-existing pieces of music. [[Raimbaut de Vaqueyras]] wrote his ''Kalenda maya'' ("The Calends of May") to music composed by jongleurs at [[Montferrat]].

===Grammars and dictionaries===
Beginning in the early 13th century, the spread of Occitan verse demanded grammars and dictionaries, especially for those whose native tongue was not Occitan, such as the Catalan and Italian troubadours, and their imitators. The production of such works only increased with the academisation of the troubadour lyric in the 14th century.

==Legacy==
{{main|Occitan literature}}

===Transmission===
Some 2,600 poems or fragments of poems have survived from around 450 identifiable troubadours. They are largely preserved in songbooks called ''[[chansonnier]]s'' made for wealthy patrons.

Troubadour songs are generally referred to by their [[incipit]]s, that is, their opening lines. If this is long, or after it has already been mentioned, an abbreviation of the incipit may be used for convenience. A few troubadour songs are known by "nicknames", thus ''D'un sirventes far'' by [[Guilhem Figueira]] is commonly called the ''Sirventes contra Roma''. When a writer seeks to avoid using unglossed Occitan, the incipit of the song may be given in translation instead or a title may even be invented to reflect the theme of the work. Especially in translations designed for a popular audience, such as Ezra Pound's, English titles are commonly invented by the translator/editor. There are examples, however, of troubadour songs given Occitan titles in the manuscripts, such as an anonymous ''pastorela'' that begins ''Mentre per una ribeira'', which is entitled ''Porquieira''.

===Table of chansonniers===
The number of Occitan parchment chansonniers given as extant varies between authors, depending on how they treat fragmentary and multilingual manuscripts. Conventionally, fragments are classified as fragments of the surviving chansonnier they most closely resemble and not as chansonniers in their own right. Some chansonniers have received both Occitan and French letters: troubadour D is trouvère H, W is M and X is U. The lettering (''siglas'') was introduced by [[Karl Bartsch]], who placed sources he considered more reliable higher in the alphabet. This system is imperfect, however, since many of the chansonniers produced for an Italian audience are heavily edited and do not necessarily more closely resemble the original compositions. While parchment chansonniers are more durable, paper ones also exist and have received lower-case ''siglas''.&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt and Kay, "Appendix 4", 303–04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paden, "Manuscripts", in Akehurst and Davis, 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Venus, Cupid, Folly, and Time''''' (also called '''''An Allegory of Venus and Cupid''''' and '''''A Triumph of Venus''''') is an [[allegory|allegorical]] painting by the [[Florence|Florentine]] artist [[Agnolo Bronzino]]. It is now in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/bronzino-an-allegory-with-venus-and-cupid|title=bronzino-an-allegory-with-venus-and-cupid|publisher=www.nationalgallery.org.uk|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==

About 1546, Bronzino was commissioned to create a painting that has come to be known as ''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], [[Cupid]], [[Folly (allegory)|Folly]], and [[Time (mythology)|Time]]''. It displays the ambivalence, eroticism, and obscure imagery that are characteristic of the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] period, and of Bronzino's master [[Pontormo]].

The painting may have been commissioned by [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] or by [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Francesco Salviati]], to be presented by him as a gift to [[Francis I of France]]. [[Vasari]] wrote that it was sent to King Francis, though he does not specify by whom. The erotic imagery would have appealed to the tastes prevalent in both the [[Medici]] and French courts at this time. The attention to [[Texture (painting)|texture]] and wealth is also consistent with Bronzino's [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] patronage. The painting was brought by [[Napoleon]] from [[Paris]] to [[Vienna]], where in 1813, Johann [[House of Keglević|Keglević]] gained possession of the painting from [[Franz Wenzel, Graf von Kaunitz-Rietberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiens lebende Schriftsteller, Künstler und Dilettanten im Kunstfache: dann Bücher-, Kunst- und Naturschätze und andere Sehenswürdigkeiten dieser Haupt- und Residenz-Stadt : ein Handbuch für Einheimische und Fremde, Seite 319, Franz Heinrich Böckh, Bauer, Wien 1821.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budapest"&gt;The masters of mannerism, Museum of fine arts Budapest, page 29, Szépművészeti Múzeum (Hungary), Marianne Haraszti-Takács, Taplinger Pub. Co., New York 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1860 it has been in London.

The figure of Venus can be likened to a precious object (such as a marble statue) in a luxurious setting, desirable because of her unavailability. In this large, unusually cold composition, which is deliberately constructed on a counterpoint of opposing movements, the finest work is in the treatment of the faces. Bronzino, known above all as a portrait painter, painted several carefully drawn portraits of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]].&lt;ref name="Budapest" /&gt;
==Scholarly debate==
[[Image:Angelo Bronzino Det 004.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Venus and Cupid detail.]]

Crowded into the claustrophobic foreground of the painting are several figures whose identities have been the subject of extensive scholarly debate. At times it has also been called ''A Triumph of Venus''. Its meaning, however, remains elusive. Cupid, along with his mother (Venus) and the nude [[putto]], to the right, are all posed in a typical Mannerist ''[[figura serpentinata]]'' form.

The two central figures are easily identified by their attributes as Venus and Cupid. For example, she holds the golden apple she won in the [[Judgement of Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/JudgementParis.html|title=Judgement of Paris|publisher=www.theoi.com|accessdate=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~hughesc/judgment_of_Paris.htm Aphrodite equals Venus]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/peter-paul-rubens-the-judgement-of-paris/26781 peter-paul-rubens-the-judgement-of-paris + Venus] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126105844/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/peter-paul-rubens-the-judgement-of-paris/26781 |date=November 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while he sports the characteristic wings and [[quiver]].  Both figures are nude, illuminated in a radiant white light. Cupid fondles his mother's bare breast and kisses her lips.

The bearded, bald figure to the upper right of the scene is believed to be Time, in view of the hourglass behind him.&lt;ref name="nag"/&gt; He sweeps his arm forcefully out to his right. Again, it is difficult to interpret his gesture with any certainty; it could be to prevent the figure at the far left of the picture from shielding the incestuous transgressions of Venus and the adolescent Cupid with the billowing blue fabric that provides a screen between the figures in the fore and background. Many scholars believe that his gesture seems to say "Time is fleeting, and you never know when it may be all over." The figure opposite Time, and also grasping at the drapery, is usually called [[Eternal oblivion|Oblivion]] because of  the lack of substance to his form—eyeless sockets and mask-like head. The mask-like face of this figure is echoed by the image of two actual masks in the lower right-hand corner.

There is also Folly, to the right of Venus and Cupid.{{expand section|date=March 2015}}&lt;!-- You mention Oblivion behind Folly...--&gt;

The identity of the remaining figures is even more ambiguous. The old woman rending her hair (see detail at right) has been called [[Jealousy]]—though some believe her to represent the ravaging effects of [[syphilis]]&lt;ref name="nag"&gt;[[National Gallery (London)|The National Gallery]]. 2001. [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng651 An Allegory with Venus and Cupid] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525092014/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng651 |date=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (result of unwise intercourse). The creature at the right-hand side behind Folly, with a girl's face and disjointed, grotesque body, extending a [[honeycomb]] with her left hand attached to her right arm, and hiding behind her back a scorpion's barb, may represent Pleasure and [[Fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;'Fraude' as interpreted by Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology'', Harper Torchbooks (New York, Harper and Row, 1962), pp. 86–91 (originally pub. by Oxford University Press, 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nag"/&gt; There is, however, no consensus on these identifications.&lt;ref name="nag"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4241">'''Villagers Theatre''' is a [[community theater]] located in the municipal complex of [[Somerset, New Jersey]], United States. It was founded in 1960 and is still running today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Villagers Theatre celebrates 50 years |quote=It was started in 1960 by 20 theater enthusiasts. Mrs.  Van Middlesworth who owned the [[Colonial Farms]] restaurant, donated $500 ... |work=[[Community Courier]] |date=July 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has a New Playwrights Series where unpublished plays are performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Villagers accepting scripts for series |url=http://suburban.gmnews.com/news/2008-10-09/bulletin_board/044.html |quote=Scripts must be original, unpublished works. All comedies, dramas and farces of professional quality are welcomed. There is no limit on cast size, although smaller casts (under eight characters) are preferred. Shows designed to be performed on one set, with an eye toward future community theatre productions, are also preferred. One-act plays and shorter scripts will be considered, in addition to full-length scripts. There are no restrictions for content or language. Musical plays will not be considered. |work=[[Sayreville Suburban]] |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=2010-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theatre was founded in 1960 and began doing shows in the Van Middlesworth Barn. In 1979, the barn was sold, and a new barn was built. The new building opened in 1980, but closed in 1987 due to new [[fire code]] laws. Township citizens raised $250,000 to renovate the space, and the theatre re-opened in 1988.

==New Playwrights Series==
Every year, the theatre takes submissions of new plays by unheard of playwrights and presents staged readings of six new, original shows. Musicals are not accepted, due to the short rehearsal span and lack of time for actors to learn the music. The readings take place once a month from February to May, sometimes with two in one night.

==Major Productions==
In 2015, the theatre presented the world premiere of ''[[Mary Poppins (musical)|Mary Poppins Jr.]]'' for their Miniature Musical Makers program. (An acting class and performance program for children 8 to 13.)

Their January 2016 production of ''[[Fences (play)|Fences]]'' received high acclaim and was transferred to a [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] [[Black History Month]] festival.

==Education==
The theatre offers its Miniature Musical Makers program (MMM) for kids ages 9 through 13. MMM is a 12 week program that trains the kids in acting, singing, dancing, and production design, culminating in the performance of a full-length 1 to 2 hour show (with a one weekend run). There is also a teen ensemble, which is the same thing but for ages 14 to 17 and goes for 11 weeks. MMM costs $745 and the teen ensemble is $695. There is a $100 discount for early enrollment.

There is also a Summer Theatre Arts program, offering three different sessions for kids 6-8, 8-12, and 12-16. The program runs for three weeks and costs $850 for a full day program and $450 to go for a half day. The camp culminates in a performance.

'''Wolfe Video''' is the oldest and largest exclusive distributor of [[LGBT]] films in North America.

Founded in 1985 in [[New Almaden]] by Kathy Wolfe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mglff.com/2004/andreasperling.htm|title=Wolfe Career Achievement Award Presented to Andrea Sperling|publisher=''Miami Gay and Lesbian Film Festival|date=2004-05-24|accessdate=2009-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company began as a consumer mail order distribution company for lesbian [[VHS]] videos but has evolved over the years to become a full-service distributor of [[LGBT]] films. Wolfe releases LGBT films on [[DVD]] in North America as well as doing film festival bookings, foreign sales, US digital delivery, and broadcast sales for its library of more than one hundred feature films and dozens of shorts and documentaries.

Notable Wolfe releases over the years include the film ''[[Big Eden]]'', the 20th Anniversary DVD release of ''[[Desert Hearts]]'', ''[[Were the World Mine]]'', and [[Thom Fitzgerald]]'s AIDS drama ''[[3 Needles]]''. Significant Wolfe DVD releases in recent years include the [[Sundance Film Festival]] award-winner ''[[Undertow (2009 film)|Undertow]]'', the acclaimed French drama ''[[Tomboy (2011 film)|Tomboy]]'', the multiple award-winner ''[[Gayby]]'', and Swedish lesbian romance ''Kiss Me ([[With Every Heartbeat (film)|With Every Heartbeat]]'').  Wolfe has also released two films by the writer and director [[Stephen Cone]], including ''[[The Wise Kids]]'' and ''[[Henry Gamble's Birthday Party]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Nigel M. |title=Wolfe Video Acquires DVD/VOD Rights to Outfest Winner 'The Wise Kids' |work=[[Indiewire]] |date=July 31, 2012 |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/wolfe-video-acquires-dvd-vod-rights-to-the-wise-kids |accessdate=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sharf |first=Zack |title=Exclusive: Wolfe Releasing Acquires Gay Coming-Of-Age Drama 'Henry Gamble's Birthday Party' |work=[[Indiewire]] |date=September 8, 2015 |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/exclusive-wolfe-releasing-acquires-gay-coming-of-age-drama-henry-gambles-birthday-party-20150908 |accessdate=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
