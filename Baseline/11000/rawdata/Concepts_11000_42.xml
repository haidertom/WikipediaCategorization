The '''1989 Tiananmen Square protests''', commonly known in [[mainland China]] as the '''June Fourth Incident''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{lang|zh|六四事件}}, ''liùsì shìjiàn''), were student-led [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] in [[Beijing]] (the capital of the [[People's Republic of China]]) in 1989. More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the''' '89 Democracy Movement''' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|八九民运}}, ''bājiǔ mínyùn''). The protests were forcibly suppressed after [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Premier]] [[Li Peng]] declared [[martial law]]. In what became known in the West as the '''Tiananmen Square Massacre''', [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|troops with automatic rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators]] trying to block the military's advance towards [[Tiananmen Square]]. The number of civilian deaths has been estimated variously from 180 to 10,454.&lt;ref name=10,000&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press|title=Declassified: Chinese official said at least 10,000 civilians died in 1989 Tiananmen massacre, documents show|date=21 December 2017|last=Cheng|first=Kris|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/12/21/declassified-chinese-official-said-least-10000-civilians-died-1989-tiananmen-massacre-documents-show/|access-date=22 December 2017}} Political chief of 38th Army Li Zhiyun and US Government documents, respectively&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Wong, ''Red China Blues'', Random House 1997, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

Set against a backdrop of rapid economic development and social changes in [[History of the People's Republic of China (1976–89)|post-Mao Zedong China]], the protests reflected anxieties about the country's future in the popular consciousness and among the political elite. The [[Chinese economic reform|reforms of the 1980s]] had led to a nascent [[market economy]] which benefitted some people, but seriously disaffected others and the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included [[inflation]], limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy and restrictions on political participation. The students called for [[democracy]], greater accountability, [[freedom of the press]] and [[freedom of speech]], though they were loosely organized and their goals varied.&lt;ref name="nathan"&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew J. |last=Nathan |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010101faessay4257-p0/andrew-j-nathan/the-tiananmen-papers.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040706113745/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010101faessay4257-p0/andrew-j-nathan/the-tiananmen-papers.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 6, 2004 |title=The Tiananmen Papers |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |date=January–February 2001 |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB16/documents/index.html Tiananmen Square, 1989: ''The Declassified History'']; George Washington University&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the protests, about 1 million people assembled in the Square.&lt;ref name="zhao171"/&gt;

As the protests developed, the authorities veered back and forth between conciliatory and hardline tactics, exposing deep divisions within the party leadership.&lt;ref name="Saich"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T-hxw0-d05gC&amp;pg=PA121 Anthony Saich, ''The People's Movement: Perspective on Spring 1989''] M.E.

University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|978-0-472-08451-7}}. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, the suppression temporarily halted the policies of liberalization in the 1980s. Considered a watershed event, the protests also set the limits on political expression in China well into the 21st century. Its memory is widely associated with questioning the legitimacy of Communist Party rule and remains one of the most sensitive and most widely censored political topics in [[mainland China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resetdoc.org/story/00000001371 |title="The Consequences of Tiananmen", Andrew J.

In the Chinese language, the incident is most commonly known as the June Fourth Incident. Events named by date in Chinese are conventionally named by the number of the month and the date, followed by the type of event. Thus, the common Chinese name for the crackdown on the 1989 massacre is June Fourth Incident (Chinese: {{lang|zh|六四事件}}, ''liùsì shìjiàn''), literally Six Four Incident ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|六}}}} means six, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|四}}}} means four, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|事件}}}} means incident). The nomenclature of the former is consistent with the customary names of the other two great protests that occurred in Tiananmen Square: the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919 and the [[Tiananmen Incident|April Fifth Movement]] of 1976. June Fourth refers to the day on which the People's Liberation Army cleared Tiananmen Square of protesters, although actual operations began on the evening of 4 June. Names such as June Fourth Movement (Chinese: {{lang|zh|六四运动}}, ''liù-sì yùndòng'') and '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: {{lang|zh|八九民运}}, ''bā-jiǔ mínyùn'') are used to describe the event in its entirety.

Outside mainland China, and among circles critical of the crackdown within mainland China, it is commonly referred to in Chinese as June Fourth Massacre (Chinese: {{lang|zh|六四屠杀}}, ''liù-sì túshā'') and June Fourth Crackdown (Chinese: {{lang|zh|六四镇压}}, ''liù-sì zhènyā''). To bypass [[internet censorship in China]], which uniformly considers all the above-mentioned names too 'Sensitive' for search engines and public forums, alternative names have sprung up to describe the events on the Internet, such as May&amp;nbsp;35th, VIIV ([[Roman numerals]] for 6 and 4) and Eight Squared (i.e. 8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 64).&lt;ref name="TheAge"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.theage.com.au/world/china-tightens-information-controls-for-tiananmen-anniversary-20090604-bvxf.html |title = China tightens information controls for Tiananmen anniversary |agency = Agence France-Presse |date=June 4, 2009 |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=November 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[government of the People's Republic of China]] have used numerous names for the event since 1989, gradually reducing the intensity of terminology applied.&lt;ref name="vog"&gt;{{cite book |last = Vogel |first = Ezra F. |title = Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China |year = 2011 |publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-05544-5 |page = 634 |id =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the events were unfolding, it was labelled a "counterrevolutionary riot", which was later changed to simply "riot", followed by "political storm" and finally the leadership settled on the more neutralized phrase "political turmoil between the Spring and Summer of 1989", which it uses to this day.&lt;ref name="vog"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/editorial/the-day-china-trampled-on-freedom/2009/05/29/1243456737644.html |title = The day China trampled on freedom |date=May 30, 2009 |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=November 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, the terms Tiananmen Square Massacre, Tiananmen Square Protests or Tiananmen Square Crackdown are often used to describe the series of events. However, much of the violence did not actually happen in Tiananmen, but outside the square in the city of Beijing near the [[Muxidi]] area.&lt;ref name="miles"/&gt; The term also gives a misleading impression that demonstrations only happened in Beijing, when in fact they occurred in many cities throughout China.&lt;ref name="miles"/&gt; (Examples include [[Chengdu]] from the account of Louisa Lim's ''[[The People's Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited|The People's Republic of Amnesia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = People's Republic of Amnesia|last = Lim|first = Louisa|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0190227913|location = |page = 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{History of the People's Republic of China}}
The [[Cultural Revolution]] ended with chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976. The movement, spearheaded by Mao, caused severe damage to the country's economic and social fabric. The country was mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the Communist Party itself. At the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee]] in December 1978, [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's [[Paramount leader|''de facto'' leader]]. Deng launched a comprehensive [[Chinese economic reform|program to reform the Chinese economy]]. Within several years, the country's direction entirely changed. The focus on ideological purity was replaced by a full-on drive to achieve material prosperity.

To run his reform agenda, Deng promoted his allies to top government and party posts. [[Hu Yaobang]] was appointed the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] in February 1980, and [[Zhao Ziyang]] was named as [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]] in September.

=== Challenges with reform ===
The reforms aimed to decrease the role of the state in the economy and gradually introduced private forms of production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had de-collectivized and 80% of state owned enterprises were permitted to retain profits. Within a few years, production increased by leaps and bounds, and poverty was reduced substantially.

While the reforms were generally well received by the public, concerns grew over a series of social problems that the changes brought about, including [[Corruption in China|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] by elite party bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;Naughton, B. p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The state-mandated pricing system, in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices stable at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, this allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''Silenced Scream: a Visual History of the 1989 Tiananmen Protests''. Donna Rouviere Anderson, Forrest Anderson. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the money supply had expanded too fast. At least a third of factories were unprofitable. The government tightened the money supply in 1988, leaving much of the economy without loans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Following the 1988 [[Beidaihe]] meeting, the party leadership under Deng agreed to a transition to a market-based pricing system.&lt;ref name="Dingxin Zhao 2001. p. 127"&gt;Dingxin Zhao.

Vol. 40 (24), December 9, 1988; p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; News of the relaxation of price controls triggered waves of cash withdrawals, buying and hoarding all over China.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; The government panicked and rescinded the price reforms in less than two weeks, but its impact was pronounced for much longer. Inflation soared. Official indices report that the [[Consumer Price Index]] increased 30% in Beijing between 1987 and 1988, leading to panic among salaried workers that they could no longer afford staple goods.&lt;ref name=vog600&gt;Vogel, E. 600–01&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the new market economy, unprofitable [[state-owned enterprise]]s were pressured to cut costs. This threatened a vast proportion of the population which relied on the "[[iron rice bowl]]", i.e. a host of social benefits such as job security, medical care and subsidized housing.&lt;ref name=vog600/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Hui, Thomas Huters ed.

=== Social disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis ===
Reformist leaders envisioned in 1978 that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the opening of new universities and increased enrollment,&lt;ref name="Dingxin Zhao 2001. pp.82"&gt;Zhao, D. p. 82. (University enrollment increased from 625,319 in 1977 to 2,065,923 in 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased market demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered on the basis of [[nepotism]] and favoritism.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in their area of jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=vog600/&gt; Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the "Democracy Salon" and the "Lawn Salon" (''Caodi Shalong''), began appearing on Beijing university campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao D. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically.&lt;ref name="Dingxin Zhao 2001. p. 127"/&gt;

At the same time, the party's nominally socialist ideology faced a legitimacy crisis as it gradually adopted capitalist practices.&lt;ref name="Wang, H. p. 57"&gt;Wang, H. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Private enterprise gave rise to profiteers who took advantage of lax regulations, and who often flaunted their wealth in front of those who were less well off.&lt;ref name=vog600/&gt; Popular discontent was brewing over unfair wealth distribution. Greed, not skill, appeared to be the most crucial factor of success. There was widespread public disillusionment over the country's future. People wanted change, yet the power to define 'the correct path' continued to rest solely in the hands of the unelected government.&lt;ref name="Wang, H. p. 57"/&gt;

The comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over the pace of [[marketization]] and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers ("the right", led by [[Hu Yaobang]]) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives ("the left", led by [[Chen Yun]]) said that the reforms had gone too far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. Both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.&lt;ref name=ghp&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gate of Heavenly Peace|url=http://tsquare.tv/film/transcript.html|publisher=Long Bow Group Inc. in collaboration with ITVS|year=1995|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1986 student demonstrations ===
{{Main|1986 Chinese Student Demonstrations}}
In mid-1986, astrophysics professor [[Fang Lizhi]], who had returned from a position at [[Princeton University]], began a personal tour around universities in China, speaking about liberty, human rights, and [[separation of powers]]. Fang was part of a wider undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution were a direct result of the authoritarian political system and the rigid command economy.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. pp. 64, 215&lt;/ref&gt; The view that political reform was the only answer to China's on-going problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated all over the country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Standoff at Tiananmen (2009). Eddie Cheng. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems, while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Inspired by Fang and other 'people-power' movements around the world, in December 1986, student demonstrators staged protests against the slow pace of reform. The issues were wide-ranging, and included demands for economic liberalization, democracy, and rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Hui, Thomas Huters ed. ''China's New Order: Society, Politics, and Economy in Transition''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-674-02111-8}}. pp. 56–7.&lt;/ref&gt; While the protests were initially contained in [[Hefei]], where Fang lived, they quickly spread to Shanghai, Beijing and other major cities. This alarmed the central leadership, who accused the students of instigating Cultural Revolution-style turmoil.

General secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] was blamed for taking a soft attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives. Hu was forced to resign as general secretary on 16 January 1987. Then the party began the "Anti-[[bourgeois liberalization]] Campaign", taking aim at Hu, political liberalization and Western-inspired ideas in general.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. (1999). ''The Search for Modern China''. p. 685. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; The Campaign stopped student protests and tightened the political environment, but Hu remained popular among progressives in the party, intellectuals, and students.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of Hu Yaobang ===
When [[Hu Yaobang]] suddenly died of a heart attack on 15 April 1989, students reacted strongly, most of them believing that his death was related to his forced resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Calhoun|first1=Craig|title=Revolution and repression in Tiananmen square|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/42467/1/Calhoun_Revolution_repression_Tianmen_1989.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hu's death provided the initial impetus for students to gather in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Pan, Philip P. (2008). ''Out of Mao's Shadow: The Struggle for the Soul of a New China''. Simon &amp; Schuster. p. 274. {{ISBN|978-1-4165-3705-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In university campuses, many posters appeared eulogizing Hu, calling for a revival of Hu's legacy. Within days, most posters were writing about broader political issues, such as freedom of the press, democracy, and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Small spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on 15 April around [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] at [[Tiananmen Square]]. On the same day, many students at [[Peking University]] (PKU) and [[Tsinghua University]] erected shrines, and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion. Organized student gatherings also began on a small scale in [[Xi'an]] and Shanghai on 16 April. On 17 April, students at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]] (CUPL) made a large [[wreath]] to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its laying-party was on 17 April and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; At 5 pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the [[Great Hall of the People]], near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds giving public orations commemorating Hu and discussing social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the operation of the Great Hall, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.

Starting on the night of 17 April, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the Square. As its size grew, the gathering gradually evolved into a protest, as students began to draft a list of pleas and suggestions (Seven Demands) for the government:
# Affirm Hu Yaobang's views on democracy and freedom as correct.
# Admit that the campaigns against [[Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign|spiritual pollution]] and bourgeois liberalization had been wrong.
# Publish information on the income of state leaders and their family members.
# Allow privately run newspapers and stop press censorship.
# Increase funding for education and raise intellectuals' pay.
# End restrictions on demonstrations in Beijing.
# Provide objective coverage of students in official media.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;Zhao D. p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 18 April, students remained in the Square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes singing patriotic songs and listening to impromptu speeches by student organizers, others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at [[Xinhua Gate]], the entrance to [[Zhongnanhai]], the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the leadership. Police restrained the students from entering the compound. Students then staged a [[sit-in]].

On 20 April, most students had been persuaded to leave Xinhua Gate. To disperse about 200 students that remained, police used batons; minor clashes were reported. Many students felt abused by the police, and rumours about police brutality spread quickly. This incident angered students on campus, where those who were not politically active decided to join the protests.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Also on this date, a group of workers calling themselves the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]] issued two handbills challenging the central leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Walder, Andrew W., and Gong Xiaoxia. "Workers in the Tiananmen Protests: The Politics of the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation." ''Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs'', no. 29, January 1993. pp. 1–2. Full text of article available at http://www.tsquare.tv/links/Walder.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Hu's [[state funeral]] took place on 22 April. On the evening of 21 April, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the Square was to be closed off for the funeral. The funeral, which took place inside the Great Hall and attended by the leadership, was broadcast live to the students. General secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] delivered the eulogy. The funeral seemed rushed, and only lasted 40 minutes, as emotions ran high in the Square. Students wept.&lt;ref name=ghp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. pp. 152–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Peng|title=Li Peng Diary: The Critical Moments|year=2010|publisher=Au Ya Publishing|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-1-921815-00-3|chapter=21 April Entry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security cordoned off the east entrance to the Great Hall, but several students pressed forward. Three of these students knelt on the steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier [[Li Peng]].&lt;ref name="Zhao153"&gt;Zhao, D. p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.&lt;ref name="Zhao153"/&gt;

From 21 to 23 April 21, students began organizing under the banners of formal organizations. On 23 April, the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]] (also known as the Union) was formed. It elected CUPL student [[Zhou Yongjun]] as chair. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Wu'erkaixi]] also emerged as leaders. From this vantage point, the Union called for a general class boycott at all Beijing universities. Such an independent organization operating outside of party jurisdiction alarmed the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in [[Changsha]] and [[Xi'an]]. In Xi'an, arson from rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government.&lt;ref name="zzy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zhao |first=Ziyang |title=Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang |year=2009 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-1-4391-4938-6 |chapter=The origins of the 1989 Student Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action. Zhao dismissed Li's views. Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to [[North Korea]] on 23 April.&lt;ref name="liu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=Alan P.L. |title=Aspects of Beijing's Crisis Management: The Tiananmen Square Demonstration |journal=Asian Survey |date=May 1990 |volume=30 |series=5 |pages=505–521 |jstor=2644842 |doi=10.1525/as.1990.30.5.01p0385c |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhao's departure to North Korea left Li Peng as the acting executive authority in Beijing. On 24 April, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] and mayor [[Chen Xitong]] to gauge the situation at the Square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and major party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed that firm action against protesters must be taken.&lt;ref name="liu"/&gt; On the morning of 25 April, President [[Yang Shangkun]] and Premier [[Li Peng]] met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate 'warning' must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations.&lt;ref name=vog603&gt;Vogel, E. pp. 603–6&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests from the leadership, and highlighted Deng's having 'final say' on important issues. Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials in an effort to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.

On 26 April, the party's official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' issued a front-page editorial titled "[[April 26 Editorial|It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances]]." The language in the editorial effectively branded the student movement to be an anti-party, anti-government revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2005-02/23/content_2609426.htm |archive-url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20060424034105/http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2005-02/23/content_2609426.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 24, 2006 |title=Full text of the April 26 Editorial |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=February 23, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article enraged students, who interpreted it as a direct indictment on the protests and its cause. The editorial backfired. Instead of scaring students into submission, it squarely antagonized the students against the government.&lt;ref name=zhd155&gt;Zhao, D. p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The polarizing nature of the editorial made it a major sticking point for the remainder of the protests.&lt;ref name=vog603/&gt; The editorial evoked memories of the Cultural Revolution, using similar rhetoric as that used during the 1976 [[Tiananmen Incident]]—an event that was initially branded an anti-government conspiracy but was later rehabilitated as "patriotic" under Deng's leadership.&lt;ref name=ghp/&gt;

=== 27 April demonstrations ===
{{main|April 27 demonstrations|l1=27 April demonstrations}}
[[File:Han Dongfang.png|thumb|170px|[[Han Dongfang]], founder of the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]]]]
Organized by the Union on 27 April, some 50,000–100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers.&lt;ref name=ghp/&gt; The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of "anti-corruption, anti-cronyism", but "pro-party".&lt;ref name="zhd155"/&gt; In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction as the result of an 26 April editorial.&lt;ref name="zhd155"/&gt;

The stunning success of the March forced the government into making concessions and meeting with student representatives. On 29 April, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman [[Yuan Mu]] ([[:zh:袁木|袁木]]) met with appointed representatives of government-sanctioned student associations. While the talks discussed a wide range of issues, including the editorial, the Xinhua Gate incident and freedom of the press, they achieved few substantive results. Independent student leaders such as Wuer Kaixi refused to attend.&lt;ref name="zhd157"&gt;Zhao, D. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's tone grew increasingly conciliatory as Zhao Ziyang returned from [[Pyongyang]] on 30 April and resumed his executive authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and concession was the only alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao asked that the press be opened to report the movement positively, and delivered two sympathetic speeches on 3–4 May. In the speeches, Zhao said that the student's concerns about corruption were legitimate, and that the student movement was patriotic in nature.&lt;ref name="Vogel, E. p.608"&gt;Vogel, E. p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt; The speeches essentially negated the message presented by 26 April Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched on the streets of Beijing on 4 May to commemorate the [[May Fourth Movement]] and repeat demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On 4 May, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the class boycott. Subsequently, the majority of students began to lose interest in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparing for dialogue ===
{{main|Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement}}
The leadership was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, factional tensions, between the progressive camp and the conservative camp, intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.&lt;ref name="Vogel, E. p.608"/&gt;

In preparation for dialogue, the Autonomous Student Union elected representatives to a formal Dialogue Delegation. However, the Union leaders were reluctant to let the Delegation unilaterally take control of the movement.&lt;ref name=zhao161&gt;Zhao, D. p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing internal discord and declining engagement from the student body at large, a group of charismatic leaders, including Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi, called for more radical measures to regain momentum. They believed that the government's 'dialogue' was merely a way to trick the students into submission. They began mobilizing students for a hunger strike on 11 May.&lt;ref name="zhao161" /&gt;

=== Hunger strikes begin ===
{{main|The Students' Hunger Strike of the 1989 Tiananmen Protests}}
[[File:蒲志強19890510.jpg|thumb|A photo of [[Pu Zhiqiang]], a student protester at Tiananmen, taken on 10 May 1989]]
Students began the hunger strike on 13 May, two days before the highly publicized [[state visit]] by Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Knowing that the welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev was scheduled to be held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought.&lt;ref name="vogel612"&gt;Vogel, E. pp. 612–4.&lt;/ref&gt; By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.&lt;ref name="Zhao, D. p.167"&gt;Zhao, D. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the course of events in Beijing, protests and strikes began at universities in other cities, with many students traveling to Beijing to join the demonstration. Generally, the demonstration at Tiananmen Square was well ordered, with daily marches of students from various Beijing-area colleges displaying their solidarity with the class boycott and with the demands of the protest. The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'', the world socialist anthem, on their way to, and at, the square.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]] (August 30, 1989). ''Preliminary Findings on Killings of Unarmed Civilians, Arbitrary Arrests and Summary Executions Since June 3, 1989''. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afraid that the movement would spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping asked that the Square be cleared for Gorbachev's visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao again used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately.&lt;ref name="vogel612" /&gt; Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation (not just the government). On the morning of 13 May, [[Yan Mingfu]], head of the Communist Party's [[United Front (China)|United Front]], called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Chen Ziming]] and [[Wang Juntao]].&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Yan said the government was prepared to hold immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether the students withdraw or not—in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.&lt;ref name="Zhao, D. p.165"&gt;Zhao, D. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mikhail Gorbachev visit ===
{{main|1989 Sino-Soviet Summit}}
Press restrictions were loosened significantly during early to mid-May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. On 14 May, intellectuals led by [[Dai Qing]] gained permission from [[Hu Qili]] to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals on ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]''. The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the Square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict.&lt;ref name="Zhao, D. p.167" /&gt; However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government, and refused to move. That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by [[Shen Tong]] and Xiang Xiaoji. Yan affirmed the patriotic nature of the student movement and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the Square.&lt;ref name="Zhao, D. p.165"/&gt; While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership. Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Yan then personally went to the Square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage.&lt;ref name=ghp/&gt; Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the 26 April Editorial and rebranding the movement as "patriotic and democratic"; Li refused.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Peng. Diary entry for 15 May.&lt;/ref&gt;

The students remained in the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, the first of its kind in [[Sino-Soviet split|some 30 years]], marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. However, its smooth proceedings was derailed by the student movement; according to one scholar, this embarrassed the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the [[Great Hall of the People]] amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square.&lt;ref name=vogel612/&gt; When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. The statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.&lt;ref name=vogel612/&gt;

=== Gathering momentum ===
The hunger strike galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from 17–18 May. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials.&lt;ref name="zhao171"&gt;Zhao, D. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Many grassroots Party and [[Communist Youth League|Youth League]] organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate.&lt;ref name=zhao171/&gt; In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng in support of students. The [[Red Cross Society of China|Chinese Red Cross]] issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, giving the movement international spotlight. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.

The movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained significant momentum. By 17 May, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not know how to respond. Because the demonstrations now included a wide array of social groups, each carrying its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate, and what the demands were. The government, still split on how to deal with the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy.&lt;ref name=zhao171/&gt; These combined circumstances put immense pressure on the authorities to act, and martial law was discussed as a viable response.&lt;ref name=zhao181&gt;Zhao, D. p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation seemed intractable, so the weight of taking decisive action fell on paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. On 17 May, a PSC meeting was called at Deng's residence.&lt;ref name="li517"&gt;{{cite book |last=Li |first=Peng |title = The Critical Moment – Li Peng Diaries |year = 2010 |publisher = Au Ya Publishing |location = Hong Kong |isbn =978-1-921815-00-3 |section = Entry for 17 May}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, Zhao Ziyang's concessions-based strategy, which called for the retraction of the April 26 Editorial, was thoroughly criticized.&lt;ref name="tp20"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Nathan |first = Andrew |title = On the Tiananmen Papers |journal = Foreign Affairs |year = 2002 |volume = 80 |issue = 1 |pages = 2–48 |doi = 10.2307/20050041 |jstor = 20050041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Li Peng and Deng asserted that by making a conciliatory speech on 4 May, Zhao exposed divisions within the top leadership and emboldened the students.&lt;ref name="tp20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhao Ziyang.

''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Pakistan Daily Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Deng then moved to declare [[martial law]] as a show of the government's no-tolerance stance.&lt;ref name="tp20"/&gt; To justify martial law, the demonstrators were described as tools of "[[bourgeois liberalism]]" advocates who were pulling the strings behind the scenes, as well as tools of elements within the party who wished to further their personal ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J.

On the evening of 17 May, the PSC met at Zhongnanhai to finalize plans for martial law. At the meeting, Zhao announced that he was ready to "take leave", citing he could not bring himself to carry out martial law.&lt;ref name="tp22" /&gt; The elders in attendance at the meeting, [[Bo Yibo]] and Yang Shangkun, urged the PSC to follow Deng's orders.&lt;ref name="tp22"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Nathan |first = Andrew |title = On the Tiananmen Papers |journal = Foreign Affairs |year = 2002 |volume = 80 |issue=1 |pages = 2–48 |doi = 10.2307/20050041 |jstor = 20050041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao did not consider the inconclusive PSC vote to have legally binding implications on martial law;&lt;ref&gt;Ignatius, Adi.

Li Peng said the government's main concern was sending hunger strikers to hospital.

In the early morning of 19 May, Zhao Ziyang went to Tiananmen in what became his political [[swan song]] (final effort). He was accompanied by [[Wen Jiabao]]. Li Peng also went to the Square, but left shortly thereafter. At 4:50{{nbsp}}am Zhao made a speech with a bullhorn to a crowd of students, urging the students to end the hunger strike.&lt;ref name=adi&gt;Ignatius, Adi. "Preface".

Zhao's emotional speech was applauded by some students. It would be his last public appearance.&lt;ref name=adi/&gt;

On 19 May, the PSC met with military leaders and party elders. Deng presided over the meeting and said that martial law was the only option. At the meeting Deng declared that he was 'mistaken' in choosing Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang as his successors, and resolved to remove Zhao from his position as general secretary. Deng also vowed to deal resolutely with Zhao's supporters and begin propaganda work.

University students in Shanghai also took to the streets to commemorate the death of Hu Yaobang and protest against certain policies of the government. In many cases, these were supported by the universities' Party committees. [[Jiang Zemin]], then-Municipal Party Secretary, addressed the student protesters in a bandage and 'expressed his understanding' as he was a former student agitator before 1949. At the same time, he moved swiftly to send in police forces to control the streets and to purge Communist Party leaders who had supported the students.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

On April 19, the editors of the ''[[World Economic Herald]]'', a magazine close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu. Inside was an article by [[Yan Jiaqi]], which commented favourably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge. Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, [[Jiang Zemin]] demanded that the article be censored. Many newspapers were printed with a blank page.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Wright, "The Political Fortunes of the World Economic Herald", ''Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs'', nr 23, pp 121–132 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Jiang then suspended Qin Benli. His decisive action earned accolades from party elders, who praised Jiang's loyalty.

In Hong Kong on 27 May, over 300,000 people gathered at [[Happy Valley Racecourse]] for a gathering called Democratic songs dedicated for China (Chinese: {{lang|zh|民主歌聲獻中華}}). Many Hong Kong celebrities sang songs and expressed their support for the students in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dragonmui |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVjUGz_bHnU&amp;list=PLF7C9846E075808EB |title=Playlist of "Democratic Songs for China" on YouTube |publisher=YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, a procession of 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people, one fourth of Hong Kong's population, led by [[Martin Lee]], [[Szeto Wah]] and other organization leaders, paraded through [[Hong Kong Island]]. Across the world, especially where ethnic-Chinese lived, people gathered and protested. Many governments, including those of the United States and Japan, issued travel warnings to China.

=== Martial law ===
The Chinese government declared [[martial law]] on 20 May and [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989#Mobilization|mobilized at least 30 divisions]] from five of the country's [[PLA Military Region|seven military regions]].{{sfn|Wu|2009|pp=30–31}} At least 14 of PLA's 24 army corps contributed troops.{{sfn|Wu|2009|pp=30–31}} As many as 250,000 troops were eventually sent to the capital, some arriving by air and others by rail.&lt;ref name="WRH03 PLA Troop Estimate"&gt;(Chinese) [http://blog.boxun.com/hero/201004/wurenhua/10_1.shtml Wu Renhua, "六四北京戒严部队的数量和番号" 《1989天安门事件二十周年祭》之三]. Retrieved June 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Guangzhou's civil aviation authorities put regular airline tickets on hold to prepare for transporting military units.&lt;ref name=tb80/&gt;

The army's entry into the city was blocked at its suburbs by throngs of protesters. Tens of thousands of demonstrators surrounded military vehicles, preventing them from either advancing or retreating. Protesters lectured soldiers and appealed to them to join their cause; they also provided soldiers with food, water, and shelter. Seeing no way forward, the authorities ordered the army to withdraw on 24 May. All government forces retreated to bases outside the city.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}}&lt;ref name="George Washington University"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB16/documents/09-01.htm |title = Secretary of State's Morning Summary for 3&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;1989 |publisher=George Washington University |accessdate = August 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Army's withdrawal was initially seen as 'turning the tide' in favour of protesters, in reality mobilization took place across the country for a final assault.&lt;ref name="tb80"&gt;{{cite book |last = Brook |first = Timothy |authorlink = Timothy Brook (historian) |title = Quelling the People: The Military Suppression of the Beijing Democracy Movement |year=1998 |publisher = Stanford University Press |location = Stanford, California |isbn = 978-0-8047-3638-1 |pages = 80–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, internal divisions intensified within the student movement itself. By late May, the students became increasingly disorganized with no clear leadership or unified course of action. Moreover, Tiananmen Square was overcrowded and facing serious hygiene problems. [[Hou Dejian]] suggested an open election of the student leadership to speak for the movement, but was met with opposition.&lt;ref name=ghp/&gt; Meanwhile, [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] moderated his position, ostensibly sensing the impending military action and consequences, and advocated for a temporary withdrawal from Tiananmen Square to re-group on campus, but this was opposed by 'hardliner' student factions who wanted to hold the Square. The increasing internal friction would lead to struggles for control of the loudspeakers in the middle of the square in a series of 'mini-coups': whoever controlled the loudspeakers was 'in charge' of the movement. Some students would wait at the train station to greet arrivals of students from other parts of the country in an attempt to enlist factional support.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Gate of Heavenly Peace |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7ou2-Kv4UA |publisher=ITVN, The Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation |accessdate = January 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Student groups began accusing each other of ulterior motives such as collusion with the government and trying to gain personal fame from the movement. Some students even tried to oust Chai Ling and Feng Congde from their leadership positions in an attempted kidnapping, an action Chai called a "well-organized and pre-meditated plot."&lt;ref name="ghp" /&gt;

On 1 June, [[Li Peng]] issued a report titled "On the True Nature of the Turmoil", which was circulated to every member of the Politburo.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=330}} The report aimed to persuade the Politburo of the necessity and legality of clearing Tiananmen Square by referring to the protestors as terrorists and counterrevolutionaries.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=330}} The report stated that turmoil was continuing to grow, the students had no plans to leave, and they were gaining popular support.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=335}} Further justification for martial law came in the form of a report submitted by the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] (MSS) to the party leadership, which emphasized the infiltration of [[bourgeois liberalism]] into China and the negative effect that the West, particularly the United States, had on the students.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=338}} The MSS expressed its belief that American forces had intervened in the student movement in hopes of overthrowing the Communist Party.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=343}} The report created a sense of urgency within the party, and provided justification for military action.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=338}} In conjunction with the plan to clear the Square by force, the Politburo received word from the martial law troops headquarters stating that the troops were ready to help stabilize the capital, and that they understood the necessity and legality of martial law to overcome the turmoil. {{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=349}}

On 2 June, the movement saw an increase in action and protest, solidifying the CPC's decision that it was time to act. Protests broke out as newspapers published articles that called for the students to leave Tiananmen Square and end the movement. Many of the students in the Square were not willing to leave and were outraged by the articles.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=353}} They were also outraged by ''Beijing Daily's 1'' June article "Tiananmen, I Cry for You", written by a fellow student who had become disillusioned with the movement, as he thought it was chaotic and disorganized.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=353}} In response to the articles, thousands of students lined the streets of Beijing to protest against leaving the Square.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=362}}

The order did not explicitly contain a shoot-to-kill directive but permission to "use any means" was understood by some units as authorization to use lethal force.

At 8:30{{nbsp}}pm, army helicopters appeared above the Square and students called for campuses to send reinforcements. At 10{{nbsp}}pm, the founding ceremony of the Tiananmen Democracy University was held as scheduled at the base of the [[Goddess of Democracy]]. At 10:16{{nbsp}}pm, the loudspeakers controlled by the government warned that troops may take "any measures" to enforce martial law. By 10:30{{nbsp}}pm, news of bloodshed to the west and south of the city began trickling into the Square, often told by witnesses drenched in blood. At midnight, the students' loudspeaker announced news that a student had been killed on West Chang'an Avenue, near the Military Museum and a somber mood settled on the Square. Li Lu, the deputy commander of the student headquarters, urged students to remain united in defending the Square through non-violent means. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, [[Wu'erkaixi]] fainted after learning that a female student at Beijing Normal University, who had left campus with him earlier in the evening, had just been killed. Wuerkaixi was taken away by ambulance. By then, there were still 70,000–80,000 people in the Square.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act1"&gt;(Chinese) [http://blog.boxun.com/hero/64/27_1.shtml Wu Renhua, "天安门事件的最后一幕"].

At about 12:15{{nbsp}}am, a [[flare]] lit up the sky and the first armored personnel vehicle appeared on the Square from the west. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, two more APCs arrived from the South. The students threw chunks of concrete at the vehicles. One APC stalled, perhaps by metal poles jammed into its wheels, and the demonstrators covered it with gasoline-doused blankets and set it on fire. The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum on the east side of the Square.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act1"/&gt;

Pressure mounted on the student leadership to abandon non-violence and retaliate against the killings. At one point, Chai Ling picked up the megaphone and called on fellow students to prepare to "defend themselves" against the "shameless government." However, she and Li Lu agreed to adhere to peaceful means and had the students' sticks, rocks and glass bottles confiscated.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act2"&gt;(Chinese) [http://blog.boxun.com/hero/64/27_2.shtml Wu Renhua, "天安门事件的最后一幕"].

At about 1:30{{nbsp}}am, the vanguard of the 38th Army and paratroopers from the 15th Airborne Corps arrived at the north and south ends of the Square, respectively.&lt;ref name="WRH June 4"/&gt; They began to seal off the Square from reinforcements of students and residents, killing more demonstrators who were trying to enter the Square.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, June 2, 2009 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8057762.stm :Tiananmen killings: Were the media right?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the 27th and 65th Armies poured out of the Great Hall of the People to the west and the 24th Army emerged from behind the History Museum to the east.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act2"/&gt; The remaining students, numbering several thousand, were completely surrounded at the Monument of the People's Heroes in the center of the Square. At 2{{nbsp}}am, the troops fired shots over the heads of the students at the Monument.

At about 2:30{{nbsp}}am, several workers near the Monument emerged with a machine gun they had captured from the troops and vowed to take revenge. They were persuaded to give up the weapon by Hou Dejian. The workers also handed over an assault rifle without ammunition, which Liu Xiaobo smashed against the marble railings of the Monument.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act3"&gt;(Chinese) [http://blog.boxun.com/hero/64/27_3.shtml Wu Renhua, "天安门事件的最后一幕"].

They rode in an ambulance to the northeast corner of the Square and spoke with Ji Xinguo, the political commissar of the 38th Army's 336th Regiment, who relayed the request to command headquarters, which agreed to grant safe passage for the students to the southeast. The commissar told Hou, "it would be a tremendous accomplishment, if you can persuade the students to leave the Square.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act3"/&gt;

At 4{{nbsp}}am, the lights on the Square suddenly turned off, and the government's loudspeaker announced: "Clearance of the Square begins now. We agree with the students' request to clear the Square."&lt;ref name="WRH June 4"/&gt; The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'' and braced for a last stand.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act3"/&gt; Hou returned and informed student leaders of his agreement with the troops. At 4:30{{nbsp}}am, the lights relit and the troops began to advance on the Monument from all sides. At about 4:32{{nbsp}}am, Hou Dejian took the student's loudspeaker and recounted his meeting with the military. Many students, who learned of the talks for the first time, reacted angrily and accused him of cowardice.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act4"&gt;(Chinese) [http://blog.boxun.com/hero/64/27_4.shtml Wu Renhua, "天安门事件的最后一幕"].

The soldiers initially stopped about 10 meters from the students. The first row of troops took aim with machine guns in the prone position. Behind them soldiers [[Squatting position|squatted]] and stood with assault rifles. Mixed among them were anti-riot police with clubs. Further back were tanks and APCs.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act4"/&gt; Feng Congde took to the loudspeaker and explained that there was no time left to hold a meeting. Instead, a voice vote would decide the collective action of the group. Although the "stays" were louder than "gos", Feng said the "gos" had prevailed.&lt;ref name="Interview with John Pomfret"/&gt; Just at that time, at about 4:40{{nbsp}}am, a squad of soldiers in camouflaged uniform charged up the Monument and shot out the students' loudspeaker.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.dwnews.com/news/2013-06-02/59207710-4.html |title=Image of soldiers storming the Monument |publisher=History.dwnews.com |date=2013-06-02 |accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other troops beat and kicked dozens of students at the Monument, seizing and smashing their cameras and recording equipment.

Some of the students and professors persuaded others still sitting on the lower tiers of the Monument to get up and leave, while soldiers beat them with clubs and gunbutts and prodded them with bayonets.

Just past 6{{nbsp}}am on June 4, as a convoy of students who had vacated the Square were walking westward in the bicycle lane along Chang'an Avenue back to campus, three tanks pursued them from the Square, firing tear gas and one drove through the crowd, killing 11 students, injuring scores.&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese) [http://www.secretchina.com/news/10/06/13/354351.html Wu Renhua, "六部口坦克追轧学生撤退队伍事件"].

Later in the morning, thousands of civilians tried to re-enter the Square from the northeast on East Chang'an Avenue, which was blocked by rows of infantry. Many in the crowd were parents of the demonstrators who had been in the Square. As the crowd approached the troops, an officer sounded a warning, and the troops opened fire.

=== 5 June ===
On 5 June, suppression of the protest was immortalized in Western media by the famous video footage and photographs of [[Tank Man|a lone man standing in front of a column of tanks]] driving out of Tiananmen Square. The iconic photo that would eventually make its way around the world was taken on 5 June on [[Chang'an Avenue]]. As the tank driver tried to go around him, the "Tank Man" moved into the tank's path. He continued to stand defiantly in front of the tanks for some time, then climbed up onto the turret of the lead tank to speak to the soldiers inside. After returning to his position in front of the tanks, the man was pulled aside by a group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/etc/transcript.html |title = FRONTLINE: The Tank Man transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By and large, the government regained control in the week following the military's seizure of the Square. A political purge followed in which officials responsible for organizing or condoning the protests were removed, and protest leaders jailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/04/world/asia/china-tiananmen-activists/index.html |title = China's Tiananmen activists: Where are they now? |first1 = Anjali |last1 = Tsui |first2 = Esther |last2 = Pang |publisher = CNN |access-date = 2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also protests in other countries, many adopting the use of black armbands as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The municipal government gained recognition from the top leadership in Beijing for averting a major upheaval.

In the interior cities of Xi'an, Wuhan, Nanjing and Chengdu, many students continued protests after 4 June, often erecting roadblocks. In Xi'an, students stopped workers from entering factories.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|pp=399, 404}} In Wuhan, students blocked the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Yangtze River Railway bridge]] and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=400}} About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=405}} In Wuhan the situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a [[bank run]] and resorted to panic-buying.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=408}}

Similar scenes unfolded in Nanjing. On 7 June, hundreds of students staged a blockade at the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]] as well as the Zhongyangmen Railway Bridge. They were persuaded to evacuate without incident later that day, though returned the next day to occupy the main railway station and the bridges.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=409}}

The atmosphere in [[Chengdu]] was more violent. On the morning of 4 June, police forcibly broke up the student demonstration taking place in Chengdu's main square. The resulting violence killed eight people, and injured hundreds. The most brutal attacks occurred on 5 and 6 June. Witnesses estimate that 30 to 100 bodies were thrown onto a truck after a crowd broke into the Jinjiang Hotel.&lt;ref name="Chengdu violence NPR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lim |first=Louisa |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/04/15/301433547/after-25-years-of-amnesia-remembering-a-forgotten-tiananmen |title=Louisa Lim, NPR |publisher=Npr.org |date=2014-04-15 |accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amnesty International, at least 300 people were killed in Chengdu on 5 June.

== Death toll ==
The civilians killed in the city of Beijing, according to the city police, "included university professors, technical people, officials, workers, owners of small private enterprises, retired workers, high school students and grade school students, of whom the youngest was nine years old."{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=437}} The number of deaths and the extent of bloodshed in the Square itself have been in dispute since the events. As the Chinese authorities actively suppress discussion of the events as well as research of the subject, it is difficult to verify exact figures. As a result, large discrepancies exist among various casualty estimates.

=== Official figures ===
Official Chinese government announcements put the number of dead between zero and 300. At the State Council press conference on 6 June, spokesman Yuan Mu said that "preliminary tallies" by the government showed that about 300 civilians and soldiers died, including 23 students from universities in Beijing, along with a number of people he described as "ruffians".{{sfn|Oksenberg|Sullivan|Lambert|1990|p=364}} Yuan also said some 5,000 soldiers and police along with 2,000 civilians were wounded. On June 19, Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] reported to the Politburo that the government's confirmed death toll was 241, including 218 civilians (of which 36 were students), 10 PLA soldiers and 13 People's Armed Police, along with 7,000 wounded.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=436}}&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/cron/ Frontline – The Memory of Tiananmen 1989].

=== Declassified files ===
United States government files declassified in 2014 estimated there had been 10,454 deaths and 40,000 injured.

=== Other estimates ===
Other estimates of the death toll have been higher than the figures announced by the government. [[Nicholas D.

=== Identifying the dead ===
The [[Tiananmen Mothers]], a victims' advocacy group co-founded by [[Ding Zilin]] and Zhang Xianling, whose children were killed during the crackdown, have identified 202 victims {{as of|2011|August|lc=y}}. The group has worked painstakingly, in the face of government interference, to locate victims' families and collect information about the victims. Their tally has grown from 155 in 1999 to 202 in 2011. The list includes four individuals who committed suicide on or after 4 June, for reasons that related to their involvement in the demonstrations.&lt;ref name="TiananmenMothersList"&gt;(Chinese) [http://www.tiananmenmother.org/index_files/Page480.htm Tiananmen Mothers Victims of June Fourth Name List] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822222351/http://www.tiananmenmother.org/index_files/Page480.htm |date=August 22, 2016 }}.

He was unable to afford medical bills and hanged himself in August because of unbearable pain. Zou Bing (Victim No. 51), a 19-year-old student at the [[Beijing Broadcasting Institute]], hanged herself in September 1989 because of her inability to pass interrogation into her involvement in the protest. Qi Li, (Victim No. 162), a student at the [[Central Academy of Drama]], hanged himself to escape the pressure of post-protest investigation at his school. Wei Wumin (Victim No. 163), also a student at the Central Academy of Drama, who participated in the hunger strike, committed suicide by standing in front of an oncoming train.

Wu Renhua of the [[Chinese Alliance for Democracy]], an overseas group agitating for democratic reform in China, said that he was only able to verify and identify 15 military deaths. Wu asserts that if deaths from events unrelated to demonstrators were removed from the count, only seven deaths among military personnel may be counted as those "[[killed in action]]" by rioters.&lt;ref name="WRH-PLA casualty tabulation"/&gt;

=== Deaths in Tiananmen Square itself ===
[[File:Goddess_of_Democracy_at_UBC.jpg|thumb|200px|A replica of ''[[Goddess of Democracy]]'' outside of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]]
On 19 June, Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing delivered the results of the official enquiry. More than 7,000 were wounded or injured and two hundred forty one killed, including thirty-six students, ten soldiers and thirteen People's Armed Police during a riot in Chang'An Road.&lt;ref&gt;Che Muqi, "Beijing Turmoil.1990, Foreign Language Press&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese government officials have long asserted that no one died in the Square itself in the early morning hours of 4 June, during the 'hold-out' of the last batch of students in the south of the Square. Initially foreign media reports of a "massacre" on the Square were prevalent, though subsequently journalists have acknowledged that most of the deaths occurred outside of the Square in western Beijing. Several people who were situated around the square that night, including former Beijing bureau chief of ''The Washington Post'' [[Jay Mathews]]{{efn|Jay Mathews, former Beijing bureau chief for ''The Washington Post'' said that "as far as can be determined from the available evidence, no one died that night in Tiananmen Square". He goes on to conclude: {{quote|A few people may have been killed by random shooting on streets near the square, but all verified eyewitness accounts say that the students who remained in the square when troops arrived were allowed to leave peacefully. Hundreds of people, most of them workers and passersby, did die that night, but in a different place and under different circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/the_myth_of_tiananmen.php|author=Jay Mathews|work=Columbia Journalism Review|date=September–October 1998|title=The Myth of Tiananmen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}}} and CBS correspondent [[Richard Roth (journalist)|Richard Roth]]{{efn|Richard Roth reported that he was held captive by troops in the Great Hall of the People on the west side of the Square on the night of 3 June and could hear but not see into the Square until dawn when they were driven through the Square. He heard a "volley of gunfire" to silence the students' loudspeakers. He added that there is no doubt that many people were killed in the area on the way to and around the Square, mostly in western Beijing, which the Chinese government denies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/there-was-no-tiananmen-square-massacre/ "There was no "Tiananmen Square Massacre"], CBS News.&lt;/ref&gt;}} reported that while they had heard sporadic gunfire, they could not find enough evidence to suggest that a massacre took place on the Square itself. Records by the Tiananmen Mothers suggest that three students died in the Square the night of the Army's push into the Square.&lt;ref name="NotForget"&gt;An English translation of the Tiananmen Mothers' Database – Note: contains incorrect English spellings of some victims' names. [https://archive.is/20130624215424/http://notforgetus.com/EN/Asia/China/Tiananmen "Not Forget Us"] Accessed June 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy activist Wu Renhua asserted that the government's discussion of the issue was a [[red herring]] intended to absolve itself of responsibility and showcase its benevolence. Wu said that it was irrelevant whether the shooting occurred inside or outside of the Square itself, as it was still a reprehensible massacre of unarmed civilians.&lt;ref name="mrHu"&gt;Wu Renhua, ''Regarding the Clearing of the Square of June 4'' ([http://blog.boxun.com/hero/201005/wurenhua/3_1.shtml in Chinese]): "Really, whether the fully equipped army of troops massacred peaceful ordinary folks inside or outside the Square makes very little difference. It is not even worthwhile to have this discussion at all."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
=== Arrests and punishment ===
The authorities carried out mass arrests. Many workers were summarily tried and executed. In contrast, the students—many of whom came from relatively affluent backgrounds and were well-connected—received much lighter sentences. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]], the student leader who topped the most wanted list, spent seven years in prison. Many of the students and university staff implicated were permanently politically stigmatized, some never to be employed again. Some student leaders such as [[Chai Ling]] and [[Wuer Kaixi]] were able to escape to the United States, the United Kingdom, France and other Western nations under [[Operation Yellowbird]] that was organized from Hong Kong, a British territory at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18141489.html|title=Article: Still on the wing; inside Operation Yellowbird, the daring plot to help dissidents escape.(special report: China)|newspaper=Newsweek|date=April 1996|last1=Liu|first1=Melinda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller protest actions continued in other cities for a few days. Some university staff and students who had witnessed the killings in Beijing organized or spurred commemorative events upon their return to school. At Shanghai's prestigious [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Jiaotong University]], for example, the party secretary organized a public commemoration event, with engineering students producing a large metal wreath.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

According to the [[Dui Hua Foundation]], citing a provincial government, 1,602 individuals were imprisoned for protest-related activities in the early 1989. {{as of|2012|May|}}, at least two remain incarcerated in Beijing and five others remain unaccounted for.&lt;ref name="Duihua"&gt;[http://duihua.org/wp/?page_id=5933 "Less Than a Dozen June Fourth Protesters Still in Prison"] ''[[Dui Hua Foundation]]'' May 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, it was reported that Miao Deshun was believed to be the last known prisoner incarcerated for their participation in the protests; he was last heard from a decade ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-27659475 |last = Harron |first = Celia |title = Miao Deshun: China's last Tiananmen prisoner? |newspaper=BBC News|accessdate= 23 September 2014 |date = 2014-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All are reported to be suffering from mental illness.&lt;ref name="Duihua" /&gt;

=== Leadership changes ===
{{main|Political purges during and after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests}}
The Party leadership expelled Zhao Ziyang from the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). [[Hu Qili]], another PSC member who opposed the martial law but abstained from voting, was also removed from the committee. He was, however, able to retain his party membership, and after "changing his opinion", was reassigned as deputy minister in the Ministry for Machinery and Electronics Industry. Another reform-minded Chinese leader, [[Wan Li]], was also put under house arrest immediately after he stepped out of his plane at [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Beijing Capital Airport]] upon returning from his shortened trip abroad; the authorities declared his detention to be on health grounds. When Wan Li was released from his house arrest after he finally "changed his opinion" he, like [[Qiao Shi]], was transferred to a different position with equal rank but a mostly ceremonial role. Several Chinese ambassadors abroad claimed political asylum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DC1430F93AA15755C0A96F948260 Beijing Orders Its Ambassadors Home for a Meeting], ''The New York Times'', June 29, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'', June 17, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jiang Zemin1.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Jiang Zemin]], the party secretary of Shanghai, where student protests were subdued largely without violence, was promoted to succeed [[Zhao Ziyang]] as the party [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] in 1989]]
[[Jiang Zemin]], then Party Secretary of Shanghai, was promoted to [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]]. Jiang's decisive actions in Shanghai involving the ''World Economic Herald'' and his having prevented deadly violence in the city won him support from party elders in Beijing. Having put the new leadership team in place and recognising his weakened position, Deng Xiaoping himself also bowed out of the party leadership—at least officially—by resigning his last leadership position as Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission]] later that year. He kept a low profile until 1992. According to diplomatic cables de-classified by Canada, the Swiss ambassador informed Canadian diplomats in confidence that over several months following the massacre, "every member of the Politburo Standing Committee has approached him about transferring very significant amounts of money to Swiss bank accounts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Phillips |first=Tom |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/11372052/Fresh-details-of-savage-Tiananmen-massacre-emerge-in-embassy-cables.html |title=Fresh details of 'savage' Tiananmen massacre emerge in embassy cables – Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2015-01-27 |accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bao Tong]], Zhao Ziyang's aide, was the highest-ranking official to be formally charged with a crime in connection with 1989 demonstrations. He was convicted in 1992 of "revealing state secrets and counter-revolutionary propagandizing" and served seven years in prison. To purge sympathizers of Tiananmen demonstrators among the party's rank-and-file, the party leadership initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long rectification program to "deal strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalization". Four million people were reportedly investigated for their role in the protests. More than 30,000 Communist officers were deployed to assess 'political reliability' of more than one million government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, James (1997). ''The Legacy of Tiananmen: China in Disarray''. University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|978-0-472-08451-7}}. pp. 27–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities arrested tens if not hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Some were seized in broad daylight while they walked in the street; others were arrested at night. Many were jailed or sent to labor camps. They were often denied access to see their families and often put in cells so crowded that not everyone had space to sleep. Dissidents shared cells with murderers and rapists, and torture was not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, James (1997). ''The Legacy of Tiananmen: China in Disarray''.

=== Media coverage ===
==== Chinese media ====
{{see also|People's Daily during the 1989 Student Movement}}
The suppression on June 4 marked the end of a period of relative press freedom in China and media workers—both foreign and domestic—faced heightened restrictions and punishment in the aftermath of the crackdown. State media reports in the immediate aftermath were sympathetic to the students. As a result, those responsible were all later removed from their posts. Two news anchors [[Xue Fei (host)|Xue Fei]] and [[Du Xian (news anchor)|Du Xian]], who reported this event on June 4 in the daily ''[[Xinwen Lianbo]]'' broadcast on [[China Central Television]] were fired because they displayed sad emotions. Wu Xiaoyong, the son of former foreign minister [[Wu Xueqian]] was removed from the English Program Department of [[Chinese Radio International]], ostensibly for his sympathies towards protesters. Editors and other staff at ''[[People's Daily]]'', including director [[Qian Liren]] and Editor-in-Chief Tan Wenrui, were also sacked because of reports in the paper which were sympathetic towards the protesters. Several editors were arrested.&lt;ref name="VOA"&gt;{{cite news |title=北京避谈1989年天安门屠杀纪念日 (Chinese) |url=https://www.voachinese.com/a/voa-china-internal-silence-june-4-anniversary/4423612.html |accessdate=8 June 2018 |publisher=Voice of America (China) |date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the imposition of martial law, the Chinese government cut off the satellite transmissions of foreign broadcasters such as CNN and CBS.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=3366 Assignment:China – Tiananmen Square]'' for footage of the shutting down of CNN.&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasters tried to defy these orders by reporting via telephone.

==== Obscure dissidents ====
Not all of the 21 most wanted are as well known as Chai Ling or Wang Dan. Others such Zhang Zhiqing have essentially disappeared. After his initial arrest in January 1991 and subsequent release, nothing further is known about his situation and where he lives now.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Zhang Zhiqing's role and reason for being listed on the list of 21 most wanted is generally unknown; this is the case for many others on the list such Wang Chaohua. Other dissidents that are not as well known to the public include Zhou Fengsuo and Wang Zhengyun. Zhou Fengsuo was a physics student at Tsinghua University and a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Students Autonomous Federation during the protests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fengsuo was turned in by his sister and arrested on June 13, 1989 in Xi'an.&lt;ref name="Cheng 2009 p276"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Standoff At Tiananmen|last=Cheng|first=Eddie|publisher=Sensys Corp|year=2009|isbn=|location=|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was imprisoned for one year before being released in 1990 due to international pressures, along with 97 other political prisoners.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Leaving China for the United States, he attended the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/tiananmens-most-wanted/?mtrref=web.archive.org&amp;mtrref=web.archive.org|title=Tiananmen's Most Wanted|last=Jacobs|first=Andrew|date=June 3, 2014|work=Sinosphere, New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415080207/https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/tiananmens-most-wanted/?mtrref=web.archive.org&amp;mtrref=web.archive.org|archive-date=2018-04-15|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steady in his activist roots he co-founded Humanitarian China, an organization that promotes rule of law in China and also raises money for Chinese political prisoners.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Wang Zhengyun was a student of the [[Central University for Nationalities]] and was the only member of the [[Kucong|Kucon]] ethnicity minority group to be studying at a university.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Zhengyun was arrested on July 1989 and released two years later.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was sent back to his village in the Yunnan countryside.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In December 1998, Wang was one of 19 dissidents, including Zhai Weimin, who staged a hunger strike to protest the oppression of [[Democracy Party of China|CDP]] members and other dissidents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ma Shaofang and Yang Tao are another pair of dissidents that lack public attention despite their constant activist efforts. Ma Shaofang was a student of the Beijing Film Academy during the protests and turned himself in on 13 June 1989.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheng 2009 p276"/&gt; In October 1990 he was sentenced to three years in prison for counterrevolutionary incitement.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrichina.org/en/content/3747|title=Tiananmen's Most Wanted—Where Are They Now?|last=Mosher|first=Stacy|date=May 26, 2004|website=HRI China|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413071105/https://www.hrichina.org/en/content/3747|archive-date=2018-04-13|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1994, he participated with Wang Dan and other dissidents in a petition to the National People's Congress calling for a reassessment of 4 June.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; He has had issues in attempting to open a business and has had a series of short lived jobs ever since and is living in Shenzhen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/china/scholars/t15/mashaofang.htm|title=Where Are Some of the "Most Wanted" Participants Today?|last=|first=|date=May 24, 2004|website=Human Rights Watch Asia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416181118/https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/china/scholars/t15/mashaofang.htm|archive-date=2018-04-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Yang Tao, who was at one time the head of Beijing University's Autonomous Student Federation, remains in China today.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/china/scholars/t15/yangtao.htm|title=Where Are Some of the "Most Wanted" Participants Today?|last=|first=|date=May 24, 2005|website=Human Rights Watch Asia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416181529/https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/china/scholars/t15/yangtao.htm|archive-date=2018-04-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially charged as being an instigator of the counterrevolutionary rebellion and imprisoned for one year on 16 June 1989.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; In 1998, he wrote an open letter asking for the release of Wang Youcai.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; His continued efforts landed him in prison in 1999 after lobbying for the government to reverse the labeling of the protest as a "counterrevolutionary rebellion".&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; He was originally arrested on charges of "incitement to overthrow state political power."&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; However, he was indicted on amended charges of tax evasion on 23 December due to lack of evidence and on 5 January 2003 was sentenced to four years in prison.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; He was released in May 2003.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Yang too has had trouble earning a living.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

Among the student leaders, [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Zhao Changqing]] were arrested. As a lesser figure in the demonstrations, Zhao was released after six months in prison. However, he was once again incarcerated for continuing to petition for political reform in China. Wang Dan was sent to prison, then allowed to emigrate to the United States in 1998 on the grounds of [[medical parole]]. He eventually received a PhD from Harvard University and went on to teach modern Chinese history at [[National Tsing Hua University]] in [[Hsinchu]], Taiwan. [[Wu'erkaixi]] fled to [[Taiwan]] and has since become a political commentator on Taiwanese national radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_51/b3762058.htm Listening to China's Dissidents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628204604/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_51/b3762058.htm |date=June 28, 2011 }}, ''Bloomberg BusinessWeek'', December 17, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chai Ling]] fled to France and then went on to the United States to study at Princeton and Harvard.

=== Domestic political developments ===
{{see|Political purges during and after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests}}
The protests led to a strengthened role for the state. In its aftermath, many of the freedoms introduced during the 1980s were rescinded, as the party returned to a conventional Leninist mold and re-established firm control over the press, publishing, and mass media. The protests were also a blow to the separation of powers model established by the 1982 Constitution and by convention, whereby the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] was a symbolic position ([[figurehead]]), and the real centres of power of the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of the State Council]] and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] were [[Separation of powers|intended to be different people]], to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule.

However, when President [[Yang Shangkun]] asserted his [[reserve powers]] with his post of [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] and openly split with general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] over the use of force to side with Premier [[Li Peng]] and Central Military Commission chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]], official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. In 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military Commission Chairman and President were all consolidated into the same office, reverting to the previous Maoist distribution of power that had previously existed since 1972.

In 1989, neither the Chinese military nor the Beijing police had sufficient anti-riot gear, such as rubber bullets and tear gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9906/02/tiananmen/MacKinnon/zhu.muzhi.html Chinese human rights official says the crackdown 'completely correct'] Rebecca MacKinnon, "Tiananmen Ten Years Later." CNN, June 2, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Tiananmen Square protests, riot police in Chinese cities were equipped with non-lethal equipment for riot control. The protests led to increased spending on internal security and expanded the role of the People's Armed Police in suppressing urban protests.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The aftermath of the protests saw the resurgence of conservative attitudes towards reform among policymakers, intended to slow the rapid changes that were said to have contributed to the causes of the protest.&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt; Deng Xiaoping, the "architect" of the reform policy, saw his influence significantly reduced following the protests, forcing him into making concessions with socialist hardliners.&lt;ref name="macfarquhar"&gt;''The Politics of China'' By Roderick MacFarquhar&lt;/ref&gt; In dismissing Zhao Ziyang, who shared Deng's vision for economic reform but disagreed with him over politics, Deng had lost the foremost champion of his own economic vision. Facing pressure from the conservative camp, Deng distanced himself from state affairs.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;

This slow pace of reform was met with stiff resistance from provincial governors and broke down completely in the early 1990s as a result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Deng's Southern Tour of 1992, designed by the ailing but influential leader as a means to reinstate his economic reform agenda.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; On the tour, Deng criticized the leftist hardliners that had gained power following the protests, and praised entrepreneurship and other market-driven policies. Initially ignored by Beijing, the Chinese Politburo eventually sided with Deng and economic reforms again gained prominence.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Hong Kong ===
[[File:2009candlevigil1.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Candlelight vigil]] in Hong Kong in 2009 on 20th anniversary of the June 4th incident]]
In Hong Kong, the Tiananmen square protests led to fears that China would renege on its commitments under [[one country, two systems]] following the impending handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997. In response, Governor [[Chris Patten]] tried to expand the [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], which led to friction with Beijing. For many Hong Kongers, Tiananmen served as a turning point for when they lost trust in the Beijing government. The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong|a sizeable exodus of Hong Kongers]] to Western countries such as Canada and Australia prior to 1997.

There have been [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|large candlelight vigils attended by tens of thousands in Hong Kong every year since 1989]] even after the transfer of power to China in 1997. The [[June 4th Museum]] closed in July 2016, after only two years in its location. The group that runs the museum, the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China|Hong Kong Alliance]], has started to crowdfund money to open the museum in a new location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/11/asia/hong-kong-china-tiananmen-museum-closes/index.html |title = Hong Kong's Tiananmen Museum to close |last = Kam |first = Vivian |date=2016-07-11 |publisher = CNN |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170111005706/http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/11/asia/hong-kong-china-tiananmen-museum-closes/ |archive-date = 2017-01-11 |dead-url = no |access-date = 2017-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on China's national image ===
The Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests. In its immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a [[pariah state]], increasingly isolated internationally. This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. However, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Deng et al., "Minutes of the CCP Central Politburo Standing Committee Meeting", in The Tiananmen Papers: The Chinese Leadership's Decision to use Force Against their own People – In their Own Words, eds. Zhang Liang, Andrew J. Nathan, and Perry Link (New York: Perseus, 2001), 424.&lt;/ref&gt; From there on, China would work domestically as well as internationally to reshape its national image from that of a repressive regime to a benign global economic and military partner.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Cabestan, "How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself on the International Stage and Re-Engage the World after Tiananmen", in The Impact of China's 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, ed. Jean-Philippe Beja (New York: Routledge, 2011), 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Domestic trends ====
During the early 1990s, officials such as Yang Shangkun, Li Peng and others sought to return to a planned economy. Deng Xiaoping largely stayed out of politics until his groundbreaking 1992 "southern tour", which was intended to re-instate policies of economic liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;Cabestan, "How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself", 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the liberalization came the loosening of state control in many areas of daily life. Privately run print media flourished. Private newspapers increased from 250 in the 1980s to over 7,000 by 2003. Provincially run satellite TV stations sprung up all over the country and challenged the market share of state-run CCTV.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Kurlantzick, "The Dragon Still Has Teeth: How the West Winks at Chinese Repression", World Policy Journal, 20 no. 1 (2003): 50, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40209847&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership also stepped away from promoting communism as an all-encompassing belief system. State-approved religious organizations increased their membership significantly, and traditional beliefs suppressed during the Mao era re-appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlantzick, "The Dragon Still Has Teeth", 50.&lt;/ref&gt; This state-sanctioned plurality also created the environment for unsanctioned forms of spirituality and worship to grow.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kurlantzick, "The Dragon Still Has Teeth", 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reduce the need for controversial methods of state control, while Protestants, Buddhists, and Taoists were largely left alone, the state often used these 'approved' denominations to "fight against cults" such as [[Falun Gong]], playing sects off each other.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

As the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Cabestan, "How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself", 199.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's "national pride", turning public opinions in its favour.&lt;ref&gt;Cabestan, "How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself", 201.&lt;/ref&gt; This is perhaps most prominently seen in May 1999, when the United States [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Link, "June Fourth: Memory and Ethics", 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The bombings saw an outpouring of nationalist sentiment and increased support for the party as the foremost advocate of China's national interest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

==== International perception ====
Facing global condemnation for their handling of the protests in 1989, China has endeavored to demonstrate its willingness to participate in international economic and defense institutions in order to secure investment for continued economic reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Link, "June Fourth: Memory and Ethics", 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of 1991, China normalized ties with the Russian government's newly elected president, [[Boris Yeltsin]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Cabestan, "How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself", 196.&lt;/ref&gt; China also welcomed Taiwanese business as a replacement for Western investment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Further, China expedited negotiations with the [[World Trade Organization]] as well as established relations with Indonesia, Israel, South Korea and others in 1992.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Regarding defense alignments, the government signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1992, the [[Chemical Weapons Convention|Convention on Chemical Weapons]] in 1993 and the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Whereas China had been a member of just 30 international organizations in 1986, this membership increased to over 50 by 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Cabestan, "How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself", 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, while China was a net recipient of aid throughout the 1980s, its growing economic and military role transformed it into a provider of aid, with $100 million given to Thailand in 1997 alone.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Kurlantzick, "The Dragon Still Has Teeth", 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the government has successfully promoted China as an attractive destination for investment by emphasizing the country's skilled workers, comparatively lower wages, established infrastructure, and sizeable consumer base.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlantzick, "The Dragon Still Has Teeth", 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased foreign investment in the country led many world leaders to believe that by constructively engaging China in the global marketplace, political reforms would inevitably follow.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; At the same time, the explosion of commercial interest in the country opened the way for multinational corporations to turn a blind eye to politics and human rights in favour of doing business. Since then, Western leaders who were previously critical of China have generally paid lip service to the legacy of Tiananmen, but the substance of bilateral relationships focus on business and trade interests.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

In Hong Kong, the events of Tiananmen in 1989 have become permanently etched in the public consciousness, perhaps more than anywhere else outside mainland China. The events continue to have a strong impact on perceptions of China, its government, attitudes towards democracy, and the extent to which Hong Kongers should identify as Chinese. The events of 4 June are seen as emblematic of the Chinese brand of authoritarianism and is prominently discussed in Hong Kong's political circles, often in relation to democratic reform in Hong Kong and the territory's relationship with Beijing. Academic studies indicate that those who supported the rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square movement had a tendency to support democratization in the territory{{Sfn|Lee|2012|p=152}} as well as the election of pro-democracy parties.{{Sfn|Lee|2012|p=155}}

=== Economic impact ===
There was a significant impact on the Chinese economy after the incident. The ramifications of the Tiananmen Square protests led to changes in China's economic direction, and these reverberated not only internationally, but also domestically from within the Chinese government themselves. These events led to the Chinese government concentrating power, especially over the direction of the economy. While there was a slowdown immediately after the massacre, the economy quickly rebounded during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impact of China's 1989 Tiananmen Massacre|last=Naughton|first=Barry|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=9781136906848|editor-last=Béja|editor-first=Jean-Philippe|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Tiananmen Square protests, many analysts downgraded their outlook of China's economic future.&lt;ref name="barry2007"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chinese economy : transitions and growth|last=Barry.|first=Naughton,|date=2007|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262640640|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=70839809}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Communist Party's response to the protests was one of the factors that led to a delay in China's acceptance to the [[World Trade Organization]] and China did not become a member until twelve years later on 11 December 2001.&lt;ref name="barry2007"/&gt; Furthermore, bilateral aid to China decreased from $3.4 billion in 1988 to $1.5 billion in 1989, and to $0.7 billion in 1990.&lt;ref name="worldcat1948"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rights beyond borders : the global community and the struggle over human rights in China|last=1948-|first=Foot, Rosemary,|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198297765|location=New York|oclc=47008462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loans to China were suspended by the [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank]], and foreign governments;&lt;ref&gt;Thakur, M., Burton, G.

L. &amp; Shenkar, O. ''International Business in China''. Routledge, 1993. pp. 120–122. {{ISBN|978-0-415-05345-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush administration]] had wanted to normalize and improve relations with China, the violent crackdown of the protests on June 4, 1989, led to his administration banning all sales of weapons to China on June 5. Similar to the Bush administrations initiatives, other countries imposed their own sanctions in response to Tiananmen.&lt;ref name="worldcat1948"/&gt; By July 1989, the [[Group of Seven|G7]] had halted $10 billion in foreign aid, loans from Japan as well as $780 million in bank loans by the [[World Bank]] for the end of June. These coordinated actions hurt the Chinese economy, leading to a decline in international investment, a reduction in the number of tourists, as well as a decline in China's credit rating.&lt;ref name="worldcat1948"/&gt; However, most of these sanctions were eased and lifted by the early 1990s and China's economy rebounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-30/news/mn-2555_1_united-states|title=Many 1989 U.S. Sanctions on China Eased or Ended|last=MANN|first=JIM|date=1991-06-30|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the mainly negative [[Reactions to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|world reaction]] to China's Tiananmen response, as well as internal conflict regarding whether China should continue on a path of economic liberalization, leadership in China pursued a self-imposed enforcement of party discipline. Although political liberals were purged from the Chinese Communist Party, many of those who were economically liberal remained.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This led to a restructuring within the Chinese Communist Party. Even though more reformed-minded leaders such as [[Zhao Ziyang]] were purged from the Communist Party ranks by leaders like [[Deng Xiaoping]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2015/06/why-chinas-political-reforms-failed/|title=Why China's Political Reforms Failed|last=Diplomat|first=Wu Wei, The|work=The Diplomat|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the economically liberal side prevailed as it helped the Chinese economy regain and later surpass the slowdown it had experienced after the Tiananmen Square protests.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Deng was of the main forces behind [[Chinese economic reform|China's economic reform]].

Chinese Premier Li Peng visited the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 31 January 1992 and argued that the economic and arms embargoes on China were a violation of national sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, W. C. ''The United Nations at the Crossroads of Reform''. M. E. Sharpe, 1994. p. 167. {{ISBN|978-1-56324-400-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union and United States arms embargo ===
{{main|European Union arms embargo on the People's Republic of China}}
The European Union and United States embargo on armament sales to China, put in place as a result of the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, remains in place today. China has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from European Union members. Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as "outdated" and damaging to China–European Union relations. In early 2004, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] spearheaded a movement within the European Union to lift the ban, which was supported by German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]. However, the passing of the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] in March 2005 increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban and several European Union Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban. Moreover, Schröder's successor [[Angela Merkel]] opposed lifting the ban. Members of the United States Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the European Union if the latter lifted the ban. The United Kingdom also opposed the lifting of the embargo when it took charge of the European Union presidency in July 2005.

In addition, the [[European Parliament]] has consistently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo to China. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many argue it reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options from where it may seek military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former [[Soviet bloc]] that it had a strained relationship with as a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/11/27/afx4376482.html "Japan concerned by call to lift China embargo – official"] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071128105735/http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/11/27/afx4376482.html |date = November 28, 2007 }}, ''Forbes'', November 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's official stance towards the incident is that the use of force was necessary in order to control a "political disturbance"&lt;ref name="Human"&gt;Human Rights Watch, "China: Tiananmen's Unhealed Wounds", https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/05/12/china-tiananmen-s-unhealed-wounds&lt;/ref&gt; and that it ensured the stability necessary for economic prosperity.&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;''International Herald Tribune'', "Relatives of dead at Tiananmen seek review", https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/29/world/asia/29iht-china.1839321.html&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese leaders, including former [[paramount leader]]s [[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Hu Jintao]], reiterate this line when questioned by foreign press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&amp;no=228397&amp;rel_no=1&amp;isSerial=&amp;sort_name=&amp;ip_sort=221.154.106.74&amp;page=1 "Hong Kong's Long-Haired' Provocateur"] OhmyNews International, David Kootnikoff&lt;/ref&gt;

Public memory of the Tiananmen Square protests has been suppressed by the authorities since 1989. Print media containing reference to the protests must be consistent with the government's version of events.&lt;ref name="Human"/&gt; Currently, many Chinese citizens are reluctant to speak about the protests because of potential repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=CNN |title=China's Youth post-Tiananmen: Apathy a fact or front? |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-03/world/china.post.tiananmen.generation_1_tiananmen-uprising-post-tiananmen-beijing-s-tiananmen-square/2? |accessdate=July 28, 2012 |df= }}{{dead link|date=November 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Gifford held that many young people born after 1980 are unfamiliar with the events and are apathetic about politics.

"No Longer Relying on Heaven." ''[[China Road]]''. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

While public discussion of the events has become a social taboo, private discussions continue to take place despite frequent interference and harassment from the authorities. Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]] remained in China to speak out about Tiananmen in the 1990s despite offers of asylum; he faced constant surveillance. [[Zhang Xianling]] and [[Ding Zilin]], mothers of victims who lost their lives in 1989, founded the [[Tiananmen Mothers]] organization and were particularly outspoken on the humanitarian aspects of the subject.&lt;ref name="Reporters"/&gt; The authorities mobilize security forces, including members of the [[People's Armed Police]], every year on June 4 to prevent public displays of remembrance, with especially heavy security for major anniversaries such as the [[20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|20th anniversary in 2009]] and the 25th anniversary in 2014.&lt;ref name="Bristow"&gt;Michael Bristow, "Journalists banned from Tiananmen". BBC News, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8082407.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists have been frequently denied entry to the Square on anniversaries.&lt;ref name="Bristow"/&gt; In addition, the authorities are known to have detained foreign journalists and increase surveillance on prominent human rights activists during this time of year.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31086212/ns/world_news-asia-pacific "Security tight on Tiananmen Anniversary: China clamps down on Web access 20 years after bloody crackdown"] [[MSNBC]]/[[Associated Press]], June 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet searches of 4 June Tiananmen Square made within China return censored results or result in temporarily severed server connections.&lt;ref name="Reporters"&gt;Reporters Without Borders, "All references to Tiananmen Square massacre closely censored for 20 years", http://en.rsf.org/china-all-references-to-tiananmen-square-02-06-2009,33198.html&lt;/ref&gt; Specific web pages with select keywords are censored while other websites, such as those of overseas Chinese democracy movements, are blocked wholesale.&lt;ref name="Alexa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reporters" /&gt; The censorship, however, has been inconsistent—with many sites being blocked, unblocked and re-blocked over the years, including YouTube, Wikipedia and Flickr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090430/FOREIGN/704299900/1103/NEWS China eases its Tiananmen taboo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707095153/http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090430/FOREIGN/704299900/1103/NEWS |date=July 7, 2009 }}, ''The National'', April 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the policy is much more stringent with Chinese-language sites than foreign-language ones.

=== Calls to reverse the verdict ===
Over the years some Chinese citizens have called for a reassessment of the protests and compensation from the government to victims' families. One group in particular, [[Tiananmen Mothers]], seeks compensation, vindication for victims and the right to receive donations from within the mainland and abroad.&lt;ref name="IHT"/&gt; Zhang Shijun, a former soldier who was involved in the military crackdown, had published an open letter to President Hu Jintao seeking to have the government reevaluate its position on the protests. He was subsequently arrested and taken from his home.&lt;ref&gt;Tania Branigan, "Chinese detain soldier who spoke out against Tiananmen Square massacre". ''The Guardian'', http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/20/tiananmen-square-china-zhang-shijun&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Chinese government never officially acknowledged relevant accusations when it came to the incident, in April 2006 a payment was made to the mother of one of the victims, the first publicized case of the government offering redress to a Tiananmen-related victim's family. The payment was termed a "hardship assistance", given to Tang Deying (唐德英) whose son Zhou Guocong ({{zh|s=周国聪|t=周國聰}}) died at age 15 years while in police custody in [[Chengdu]] on 6 June 1989, two days after the Chinese Army dispersed the Tiananmen protesters. She was reportedly paid CNY70,000 (approximately US$10,250). This has been welcomed by various Chinese activists, but it was regarded by some as a measure to maintain social stability and not believed to herald a changing of the party's official position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4960762.stm|title=China makes 1989 Tiananmen payout|date=April 30, 2006|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaders voicing regret ===
Before his death in 1998, Yang Shangkun told army doctor [[Jiang Yanyong]] that 4 June was the most serious mistake committed by the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang himself could not correct, but one that certainly will eventually be corrected.&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese) [http://www.voachinese.com/content/yangbaibing-20130117/1585554.html "镇压六四主将、党内斗争牺牲品杨白冰病逝" Voice of America] January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao Ziyang remained under house arrest until his death in 2005. Zhao's aide [[Bao Tong]] has repeatedly called on the government to reverse the verdict for the demonstrations. Chen Xitong, the mayor of Beijing, who read the martial law order and was later disgraced by a political scandal, expressed regret for the death of innocent civilians in 2012, a year before his death.&lt;ref name=nytchen&gt;{{cite news |last1=Buckley |first1 = Chris |title = Chen Xitong, Beijing Mayor During Tiananmen Protests, Dies at 82 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/world/asia/chen-xitong-mayor-during-tiananmen-protests-dies.html|accessdate = June 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] reportedly suggested reversing the government's position on Tiananmen in party meetings prior to his departure from politics in 2013, only to be rebuffed by his colleagues.&lt;ref name="ja4"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Anderlini |first1=Jamil |title=Wen lays ground for Tiananmen healing |url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/13c6fcb2-7285-11e1-9be9-00144feab49a.html |accessdate=June 6, 2014 |date = March 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations report ===
The [[UN Committee Against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] met for its 41st session from 3–21 November 2008 to consider reports submitted by member states under article 19 of the [[UN Convention Against Torture|Convention]]. The Committee found that China's response to the 1989 Democracy movement was worrying. The Committee was concerned that despite the multiple requests by relatives of people "killed, arrested or disappeared on or following the&amp;nbsp;4 June 1989 Beijing suppression", there was a lack of investigations into these matters. It was also concerned with the failure of the Chinese government to inform families of the fate of relatives involved, and it regretted that those responsible for the use of excessive force have not "faced any sanction, administrative or criminal."&lt;ref name="UN4"&gt;5. [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/docs/CAT.C.CHN.CO.4.pdf Committee Against Torture, "Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties Under Article 19 of the Convention: China"], CAT/C/CHN/CO/4, page 8, paragraph 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee recommended the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The State party should conduct a full and impartial investigation into the suppression of the Democracy Movement in Beijing in June
1989, provide information on the persons who are still detained from that period, inform the family members of their findings, offer apologies and reparation as appropriate and prosecute those found responsible for excessive use of force, torture and other illtreatment.&lt;ref name="UN4"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 2009, the Chinese government responded to the Committee's recommendations by saying that the government had closed the case concerning the "political turmoil in the spring and summer of 1989."&lt;ref name="UN5"&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/docs/followup/CAT.C.CHN.CO.4.Add2.pdf "Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties Under Article 19 of the Convention: Comments by the Government of the People's Republic of China concerning the Concluding Observations and Recommendations of the Committee Against Torture"], Committee Against Torture, CAT/C/CHN/CO/4/ADD.2, page 13, paragraph 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It also stated that the "practice of the past 20 years has made it clear that the timely and decisive measures taken by the Chinese Government at the time were necessary and correct." It claimed that the labelling of the "incident as 'the Democracy Movement'" is a "distortion in the nature of the incident." According to the Chinese Government these observations were "inconsistent with the Committee's responsibilities."&lt;ref name="UN5"/&gt;

=== Documentaries ===
In 1995, Richard Gordon and Carma Hinton produced ''[[The Gate of Heavenly Peace]]'' an award-winning three-hour documentary film about the Tiananmen Square protests. The film contains interviews with Liu Xiaobo, Wang Dan, Wu'erkaixi, Han Dongfang, Ding Zilin, Chai Ling, Dai Qing, Feng Congde, and Hou Dejian.

The same year saw the release of [[Moving the Mountain (1994 film)|''Moving the Mountain'']] a feature documentary directed by [[Michael Apted]] and produced by [[Trudie Styler]], with cinematography by [[Maryse Alberti]]. The film takes its title from the memoir by [[Li Lu]], one of the student leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests. Though Li Lu is a central figure in the finished film, the project set out to provide a comprehensive understanding of the events leading up to and following the protests and features many other interviews.

A primetime special hosted by [[Tom Brokaw]] honored both the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing and the [[Downfall of Berlin Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, a momentous year for human rights around the world.

In April 2006, the [[PBS]] series ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' produced an episode titled ''[[The Tank Man (film)|The Tank Man]]'', which examined his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests and the change that has overtaken China economically and politically since.

On 3 June 2009, the [[BBC]] aired the documentary ''Kate Adie returns to Tiananmen'' in which documented reporter [[Kate Adie]]'s return to China, where Adie recalls the events she witnessed in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00l17sy "Kate Adie returns to Tiananmen"].

Since Tiananmen, the iconic "Tank Man" image has become a worldwide symbol for civil disobedience. What happened to the "Tank Man" following the demonstration is not known. Some say he was pulled away and went into hiding, others say he was executed by the authorities.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm Picture Power:Tiananmen Standoff] BBC News. Last updated October 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' dubbed him "The Unknown Rebel" and later named him one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most influential people of the 20th century]]. In an interview with United States media, then Chinese paramount leader Jiang Zemin said he did not think the man was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Iyer |first=Pico |title=TIME 100: The Unknown Rebel |work=Time |date=April 13, 1998 |url = http://205.188.238.181/time/time100/leaders/profile/rebel2.html |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110512174903/http://205.188.238.181/time/time100/leaders/profile/rebel2.html |archivedate = May 12, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''abstract structure''' is a [[formal object]] that is defined by a set of laws, properties and relationships in a way that is logically if not always historically independent of the structure of contingent experiences, for example, those involving physical objects.  Abstract structures are studied not only in [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] but in the fields that apply them, as [[computer science]], and in the studies that reflect on them, such as [[philosophy]] (especially the [[philosophy of mathematics]]).  Indeed, modern mathematics has been defined in a very general sense as the study of abstract structures (by the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] group: see discussion there, at [[algebraic structure]] and also [[structure (category theory)|structure]]).

An abstract structure may be represented (perhaps with some degree of approximation) by one or more physical objects{{snd}} this is called an implementation or [[Instantiation principle|instantiation]] of the abstract structure. But the abstract structure itself is defined in a way that is not dependent on the properties of any particular implementation.

An abstract structure has a richer structure than a [[concept]] or an [[idea]]. An abstract structure must include precise rules of behaviour which can be used to determine whether a candidate implementation actually matches the abstract structure in question. Thus we may debate how well a particular government fits the concept of [[democracy]], but there is no room for debate over whether a given sequence of moves is or is not a valid game of chess.   

==Examples==   
* A [[sorting algorithm]] is an abstract structure, but a [[recipe]] is not, because it depends on the properties and quantities of its ingredients.
* A simple [[melody]] is an abstract structure, but an [[orchestration]] is not, because it depends on the properties of particular instruments.
* [[Euclidean geometry]] is an abstract structure, but the theory of [[continental drift]] is not, because it depends on the geology of the [[Earth]].
* A [[formal language]] is an abstract structure, but a [[natural language]] is not, because its rules of grammar and syntax are open to debate and interpretation.

Agriculturalism was suppressed during the [[Qin Dynasty]] and most original texts are now lost.
However, concepts originally associated with Agriculturalism have influenced [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; Agriculturalism has significantly influenced Chinese thought, and has been viewed as an essence of the Chinese identity.&lt;ref name="dg"&gt;{{cite book|last= Gladney |first=Dru|year=2004 | page= 300|title=Dislocating China|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Hundred Schools of Thought}}
[[Image:Shennong3.jpg|thumb|To the Agriculturalists, the governance and focus on agriculture by the legendary ruler [[Shennong]] served as a model of the ideal government.]]
Agriculturalism dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States period]], during a period known as the "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]" which flourished from 770 to 221 BC. Throughout this period, competing states, seeking to war with one another and unite China as a single country, patronized philosophers, scholars, and teachers. The competition by scholars for the attention of rulers led to the development of different schools of thought, and the emphasis on recording teachings into books encouraged their spread.&lt;ref name="pe"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ebrey |first=Patricia|year=2010 | page= 42|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was an era characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments.&lt;ref name="pe"/&gt; The major philosophies of China, [[Confucianism]], [[Mohism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Taoism]], all originated from this period.

Chinese tradition attributes the origin of Agriculturalism to the Chinese minister [[Hou Ji]], a figure known for his innovations in agriculture.&lt;ref name="js"&gt;{{cite book|last= Sellmann |first=James Daryl|year=2010 | page= 76|title=Timing and rulership in Master Lü's Spring and Autumn annals|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agriculturalists also emphasized the role of [[Shennong]], the divine farmer, a semi-mythical ruler of early China credited by the Chinese as the inventor of agriculture. Shennong was seen as a proto-Agriculturalist, whose governance and focus on agriculture served as a model of the ideal Agriculturalist government.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

[[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]], a philosopher who defended Agriculturalism, settled with a group of followers in the state of [[Teng (state)|Teng]] in about 315 BC. A disciple of his visited the Confucian philosopher [[Mencius]], and a short report of their conversation discussing Xu Xing's philosophy survives.&lt;ref name=graham&gt;{{cite journal |title=The "Nung-chia" 農 家 'School of the Tillers' and the Origins of Peasant Utopianism in China|author=A. C. Graham|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|volume=42|number=1|year=1979|pages=66–100|jstor=614828|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00108468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the [[Qin Dynasty]] in 221 BC saw the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purge of the Hundred Schools of Thought]], including Agriculturalism. The Legalist Qin dynasty was intolerant of other schools of thought, seeking to burn any text that did not adhere to the Legalist philosophy.&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ong |first= Siew Chey|year=2005 | page= 16|title=China condensed: 5000 years of history &amp; culture |publisher=Marshall Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, few Agriculturalist texts exist, and most of what is known of Agriculturalism comes from critical assessments by other philosophical schools.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

The bibliography of the [[Book of Han]] (2nd century AD) presents Agriculturalism as one of 10 philosophical schools and lists 9 books belonging to that school.&lt;ref name=graham/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Agriculturalism is primarily a social, economic, and political philosophy. The philosophy is founded on the notion that human society originates with the development of [[agriculture]], and societies are based upon "people's natural prospensity to farm."&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; The Agriculturalists described the ancient political system, seen as ideal, as one where "the means by which the early sage kings led their people was to put agriculture before all other affairs.. the reason why Hou Ji undertook agriculture was because he considered it to be the root of instructing the masses."&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

===Political===
To the Agriculturalists, the ideal society, modeled after that of [[Shennong]]'s, is [[communalism|communal]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]], and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]].&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt; The Agriculturalist believed that the ideal government is led by a benevolent king, one who works alongside the people in tilling the fields. The Agriculturalist king is not paid by the government through its treasuries; his livelihood is derived from the profits he earns working in the fields and cooking his own meals, not his leadership.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; Said [[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]], a prominent Agriculturalist:
{{quote|The ruler of Teng is an upright and worthy ruler. However, he has yet to hear the Way. A wise ruler tills the land together with his people to make his living. He governs while cooking his own meals. Now, that Teng has granaries and treasuries means that [the ruler] inflicts hardship on the people to fatten himself. How can he be a worthy ruler?|Xu Xing&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;}}

===Economic===
Unlike the Confucians, the Agriculturalists did not believe in the [[division of labour]], arguing instead that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian [[self sufficiency]].&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; The Agriculturalists supported the [[price fixing|fixing of prices]], in which all similar goods, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price. They suggested that people should be paid the same amount for the same services, a policy criticized by the Confucians as encouraging products of low quality, which "destroys the earnest standards of craftmanship."&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;

==Reception==
Agriculturalism was criticized extensively by rival philosophical schools, including the [[Mohist]] [[Mo Zi]], the Confucian [[Mencius]], and [[Yang Zhu]].&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; [[Mencius]] criticized its chief proponent [[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]] for advocating that rulers should work in the fields with their subjects, arguing that the Agriculturalist egalitarianism ignored the [[division of labour]] central to society. He points out that other early Chinese rulers did not work in fields, yet were equally as successful and revered as Shennong.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; Mencius dismisses Xu Xing as a "Southern barbarian with a twittering tongue."&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite book|last= Denecke|first=Wiebke|year=2011 | page= 38|title=The Dynamics of Masters Literature: Early Chinese Thought from Confucius to Han Feizi|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
{{see also|Agrarianism}}
The Legalist [[Qin Dynasty]] [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purged rival philosophical schools]], including Agriculturalism, burning many Agriculturalist texts. However, Agriculturalism in its heyday heavily influenced the agrarian policies of [[Confucianism]], Legalism, and other philosophical schools,&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; so many concepts originally associated with the Agriculturalists continued to exist in Chinese philosophy. The transmission and translation of Chinese philosophical texts in Europe during the 18th century had a heavy influence on the development of [[Agrarianism]] in [[Europe]]. The French agrarianist philosophy, a predecessor to modern Agrarianism, of [[François Quesnay]] and the [[Physiocrats]], are said to have been modeled after the agrarian policies of Chinese philosophy.&lt;ref name="lam"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Maverick|first1= Lewis A.|year=1938|title= Chinese Influences Upon the Physiocrats|journal=Economic History|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grief]] is “a multifaceted response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed”. A common emotion amongst [[human]]s, grief is also apparent in [[animal]]s, known as '''animal grief'''. In the late 19th century, research started to show grief in [[chimpanzee]]s and the connection between animal and human grief. However, until recently, grief has never been the focus of [[research]]. [[Marc Bekoff]], a scientist, has spent his time researching emotions in animals, including grief. Combined with other research, the following animals have been seen to grieve: [[Gray wolf|wolves]], chimpanzees, [[magpie]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[otter]]s, [[Goose|geese]], [[sea lion]]s, and many more.

Grief can be caused by many things and one of the things to understand is animal pain and emotions.

== What is Animal Pain? ==
Bernard E. Rollin says that the ability to experience '''pain''' is something we have to feel to be considered moral (Rollin, 2010). It can result from something such as a wound or abuse causing physical pain. Animals can also experience pain mentally, such as experiencing grief as well as sadness due to anxiety. Animal pain can be understood once we understand the nature of a certain animal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=41486940|title=Animal Pain: What It is and Why It Matters|journal=The Journal of Ethics|volume=15|issue=4|pages=425–437|last1=Rollin|first1=Bernard E|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when somebody is caring for a dog as a pet the individual understands their actions, their traits and emotions. While taking care of an animal we are then able to understand that specific animal and their way of grieving or their happiness per se.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The difference in pain from humans and animals is how one is willing to bear pain for a better lifestyle. Rollin mentions an example of extending life. This example states that the owner may think pain will be a small price to pay for the life of their pet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since an animal cannot express their pain or how much something may hurt these emotions or decisions are hard to conclude. Pain felt can sometimes be unbearable to the point where humans have the decision or thought to choose death over the continuation of that pain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Animal Emotions ==
A question that is asked is if animals have any emotions? Marc Bekoff defines emotion as something that helps behavioral control and management (Bekoff, 2000).&lt;ref name="Bekoff2010" /&gt; It is known that humans have emotions and that it is something fundamental and important in our lives, however it is hard to say if that is true for animals or just some. There are different ways you can tell the emotion of animal: how they’re acting or how they’re looking at someone or something.

=== Primary Emotions and Secondary Emotions ===
There are different “categories” of emotions known as primary and secondary emotions. Bekoff explains that primary emotions are similar to reflex or something along the lines of fear or fight-or-flight response. Therefore, it is something that animals react to such as loud noises, unknown objects, or odors (Bekoff, 2000).&lt;ref name="Bekoff2010" /&gt; Having primary emotions is crucial because reactions to these are important for an animal's survival. The part of the brain that is responsible for primary emotions is the limbic system (Bekoff, 2000).&lt;ref name="Bekoff2010" /&gt;

Secondary emotions are part of an experience. These emotions are taking part in the central cortex of the brain because of the requirement of different and higher brain centers. With secondary emotions it allows one (in this case the animals that do feel grief) to create the connection between feelings and actions.

==Early Research on Animal Grief==
In 1879, Arthur E. Brown studied how a male chimpanzee reacted after the death of his female counterpart. He saw the male chimpanzee display grief and "a cry which the keeper of the animals assures [Brown] he had never heard before").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Arthur E. |title=Grief in the Chimpanzee |journal=The American Naturalist |date=1879 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=173–175 |jstor=2448772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing to the next day, the chimpanzee sulked and barely moved. Brown deciphered that the male chimpanzee was [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] after the female chimpanzee died. However, Brown concluded that any permanent grief is only found in man, as the chimpanzee seemed fine after a couple of days.

[[William Emerson Ritter|William E. Ritter]] (1925) connects animal and human [[emotion]] to provide evidence of [[Human evolution|human descent]] from the animal kingdom. He mentions the [[James–Lange theory|James-Lange theory]], where "all emotional stages as of joy, grief, fear, anger, jealousy, love, are associated with more or less characteristic bodily manifestation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ritter |first1=William E. |title=The Emotions in Man and Animals |journal=The Scientific Monthly |date=1925 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=137–138 |jstor=7499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritter proposes new evidence to the theory, mentioning that no item on the above list is exclusive to humans, and most are common to the animal world. He argues that because the connection between human emotion and [[Emotion in animals|animal emotion]] is so strong, humans have descended from the animal kingdom.

==Marc Bekoff's Recent Research on Animal Grief==
Marc Bekoff is a professor of [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]] at the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado-Boulder]]. He has spent his life studying animals and their emotions, finding that animals grieve quite frequently. Such examples of grieving animals are:
*Bekoff found that '''sea lion''' mothers squeal eerily when they watch their babies be eaten by [[killer whale]]s.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2000&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/50/10/861/233998|title=Animal Emotions: Exploring Passionate Natures {{!}} BioScience {{!}} Oxford Academic|website=academic.oup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Even after their calves have died, '''dolphin''' mothers have been seen to save them and grieve when they confirm the death.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2000/&gt;
*'''Elephants''' have been "observed to stand guard over a stillborn baby for days with their head and ears hanging down". Orphan elephants, who have watched their mothers be killed, have been shown to wake up screaming.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2000/&gt;
* A '''wolf''' "sniffed [her dead companion], then sat back and gave the most soulful and heart-wrenching howl I've ever heard!"; After a pack member died, the wolves let their tails and heads hang low while walking slowly.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2010&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Emotional_Lives_of_Animals.html?id=TIW2D7eR_Y8C|title=The Emotional Lives of Animals: A Leading Scientist Explores Animal Joy, Sorrow, and Empathy--and why They Matter|last=Bekoff|first=Marc|date=2010|publisher=New World Library|isbn=9781577313489|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chimpanzee''' orphans can die while in the state of grieving.&lt;ref name=Bekoff2010/&gt; [[Jane Goodall]] (1990) followed [[Flint (chimpanzee)|Flint]], a chimpanzee, for a few days after the death of Flint's friend Flo. She noted that Flint "walked along one of the branches, then stopped and stood motionless, staring down at an empty nest". Flint had been lethargic, even refusing food. Per Goodall, Flint was "hollow-eyed, gaunt and utterly depressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Through_A_Window.html?id=Gc59YpamCvgC|title=Through a Window: 30 years observing the Gombe chimpanzees|last=Goodall|first=Jane|date=2011|publisher=Orion|isbn=9780297865360|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Magpies''' have been seen to mourn over their dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755458609000541|title=Animal emotions, wild justice and why they matter: Grieving magpies, a pissy baboon, and empathic elephants - ScienceDirect|website=sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*After a fellow goose died, [[Konrad Lorenz]] noted that other '''geese''' had their "eyes sink deep into their sockets, and the individual ha[d] an overall drooping experience, literally letting the head hang".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Minding_Animals.html?id=Or4TDAAAQBAJ|title=Minding Animals: Awareness, Emotions, and Heart|last=Bekoff|first=Marc|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195150773|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Bekoff2010" /&gt; The previous example shows that animals can express their grief and it is possible for an individual to identify that. Bekoff mentions an experience of a bird that lost its partner. It showed many signs of depression before it ended up passing away in a vegetative state similar to the one his partner ended up dying in (Bekoff, 2010). Many animals can show grief when they have lost a loved one of their own.

== How Long Do Animals Feel Grief? ==
One of the questions that can be asked aside from does animals grief is how long do they grieve for or if these animals show signs of mourning. Anthropologist Barbra J King mentions how animals might sleep less or change their ways in their daily life styles. These animals might also end up staying close to their companion's corpse for a long time as well (Safina, 2015).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/nature/animal-grief/|title=The Depths of Animal Grief — NOVA Next {{!}} PBS|date=2015-07-08|work=NOVA Next|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Something we know is that emotions in a human can change one day they can be sad and the other happy. Actions are taken days after one of our loved ones die such as time of school, work or any social interaction (Safina, 2015).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is actually the same for animals. An example that can be shown is in chimpanzees.

A case is shown with one names Amos. The day before he died he spent the day in his nest and did not move until a female chimpanzee Daisy went up to him (Safina, 2015).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When Amos died, one of the chimpanzees who was more sociable than the rest as well as a “higher rank” than the rest did not want to be with the group for weeks. As shown here it also depends on who passed away on how long an animal can grieve. Though through the time spent mourning many signs can appear of an animals grief and agony of the loss of their companion.

Another example mentioned is the dog Hachiko from Tokyo. In this case the dog was no grieving due to the death of an animal, but of the loss of its owner. It is known that this dog went to the station where his owner would come home to every day for around ten years.

==Other Research on Animal Grief==
Though Bekoff is the face of recent research on animal grief, other scientists are starting to look more into it. Some studies have looked at depression in animals, with Paul Willner finding that there are eighteen [[animal models of depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00427414|title=The validity of animal models of depression|journal=Psychopharmacology|volume=83|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1007/BF00427414|pmid=6429692|year=1984|last1=Willner|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter J. Fashing &amp; Nga Nguyen (2012) found that a group of chimpanzees groomed and caressed a grieving, older chimpanzee. They also found that "the dying female [elephant] was approached by the matriarch of another group who repeatedly attempted to bring her to her feet using her tusks". Even otters grieve, where members of a group caught fish for months and brought them to the matriarch who had failing vision and poor mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthro.fullerton.edu/_resources/pdf/nga/FashingandNguyen2011.pdf|title=Behavior toward the dying, diseased, or disabled among animals and its relevance to paleopathology|website=anthro.fullerton.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications of Research==
Though grief in animals may seem questionable, evidence shows it is abundant. From chimpanzees to otters to sea lions, animals grieve just like humans do. Researchers like Bekoff, Fashing, Nguyen, and others, are studying every day to help better understand how and why animals grieve. With increased knowledge, humans can have better relationships with animals. For example, zoo caretakers can study chimpanzee grief habits and better notice when a chimpanzee mother is mourning. The caretakers can then help the mother cope and live a healthy and successful life. Research shows grief in animals, and understanding that can help humans form closer, healthier connections with them.

'''''Bandha''''' (also ''karma-bandha'') in Jainism, is the mutual intermingling of the [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] and ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' (fine matter).{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=7}} ''Bandha'' (Bondage) comes immediately after the ''[[asrava]]'' (influx of ''karmas'').{{sfn|S. A. Jain|1992|p=215}}

== Overview ==
According to the Jain text [[Tattvartha sutra]], the activities that causes the bondage (or ''bandha'') are:{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=113}}
*Wrong belief
*Non-abstinence
*Negligence
*Passions

According to the Jain text ''[[Samayasāra]]'', a right believer is free from the ''karma-bandha'' i.e. bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jain|first=Vijay K.|title=Acharya Kundkund's Samayasara|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwPT79iyRHMC|year=2012|publisher=Vikalp Printers|isbn=978-81-903639-3-8|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Champat Rai Jain]], an influential Jain writer of the 20th century in his book ''The Key of Knowledge'' wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|title=The Key Of Knowledge|date=1975|publisher=Today and Tomorrow's Printers|location=New Delhi|edition=Third|url=https://archive.org/details/keyofknowledge|p=622–626}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The next thing to understand in this connection is the effect of the action of matter on the soul. We have said that the fusion of spirit and matter results in the bondage of the soul. This is literally true; for the union of substances always tends to limit their natural functions, though new properties and faculties arise in consequence of it. As hydrogen and oxygen, which are gaseous by nature, are robbed of their natural ‘freedom’, i.e., of their gaseous nature, by combining with each other in the form of water, so does the soul become crippled in respect of its natural functions in consequence of its union with matter. This is the bondage, meaning, as it does, the suspension and vitiation of the natural functions and properties of the soul-substance, which are held in check for the time being...}}

== Classification ==
The bondage is of four kinds:{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=114}}
# according to the nature or species of karma
# depending upon the duration of karma
# Fruition of karma, and
# The quantity of space-points of karma

A '''battery electric vehicle''' ('''BEV'''), '''pure electric vehicle''' or '''all-electric vehicle''' is a type of [[electric vehicle]] (EV) that uses [[chemical energy]] stored in [[rechargeable battery]] [[battery pack|packs]]. BEVs use [[electric motor]]s and [[motor controller]]s instead of [[internal combustion engine]]s (ICEs) for propulsion. They derive all power from battery packs and thus have no internal combustion engine, [[fuel cell]], or [[fuel tank]]. BEVs include - but are not limited to&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/|title=FAQ|website=The Boring Company|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"literally hundreds of electric thrusters now operating in orbit on communications satellites, and ion and Hall thrusters both having  been  successfully  used..." -https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/SciTechBook/series1/Goebel__cmprsd_opt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; - motorcycles, bicycles, scooters, skateboards, rail cars, watercraft, forklifts, buses, trucks, and cars.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Hybrid electric vehicle|Plug-in hybrid|Plug-in electric vehicle}}
Vehicles using both electric motors and internal combustion engines are examples of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, and are not considered pure or all-electric vehicles because they cannot be externally charged (operate in charge-sustaining mode) and instead they are continually recharged with power from the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[regenerative braking]].&lt;ref name=PEVs/&gt;

[[Hybrid vehicle]]s with batteries that can be charged externally to displace some or all of their internal combustion engine power and [[gasoline]] fuel are called [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicles (PHEV), and run as BEVs during their [[charge-depleting]] mode. PHEVs with a [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain#Series hybrid|series]] [[powertrain]] are also called range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs), such as the [[Chevrolet Volt]] and [[Fisker Karma]].

[[Plug-in electric vehicle]]s (PEVs) are a subcategory of [[electric vehicle]]s that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and [[electric vehicle conversion]]s of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles.&lt;ref name=PEVs&gt;{{cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|editor=[[David B.

In China, plug-in electric vehicles, together with hybrid electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).&lt;ref name=NEVs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTNEWSCHINESE/Resources/3196537-1202098669693/EV_Report_en.pdf|title=The China New Energy Vehicles Program - Challenges and Opportunities |author=PRTM Management Consultants |publisher=World Bank |date=April 2011|accessdate=2012-02-29}} ''See Acronyms and Key Terms, pp. v''&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s (NEVs) are battery electric vehicles that are legally limited to roads with posted speed limits no higher than 45 miles per hour (72&amp;nbsp;km/h), are usually built to have a top speed of 30 miles per hour (48&amp;nbsp;km/h), and have a maximum loaded weight of 3,000&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/02/06/greenlings-what-is-a-neighborhood-electric-vehicle-nev/|title=What is a neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV)?|date=2009-02-06|publisher= AutoblogGreen| accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicles by type==
The concept of battery electric vehicles is to use charged [[electric vehicle battery|batteries]] on board vehicles for propulsion. Battery electric cars are becoming more and more attractive with the advancement of new battery technology ([[Lithium Ion]]) that have higher power and [[energy density]] (i.e., greater possible acceleration and more range with fewer batteries) and higher oil prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4futureenergy.com/BatteryElectric.htm|title=-|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205073246/http://www.4futureenergy.com/BatteryElectric.htm|archivedate=5 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BEVs include [[automobile]]s, [[Truck#Light trucks|light trucks]], and [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s.

A battery-powered [[electric car]] is an [[automobile]] which is [[ground propulsion|propelled]] by [[electric motor]]s.

Although electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed, the lower [[specific energy]] of production batteries available in 2015 compared with [[carbon-based fuel]]s means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges. Recharging can also take significant lengths of time. For journeys within a single battery charge, rather than long journeys, electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight.

[[Formula E]] is a fully electric international single seater championship. The series was conceived in 2012, and the inaugural championship started in Beijing on 13 September 2014. The series is sanctioned by the FIA. Alejandro Agag is the current CEO of Formula E.

The Formula E championship is currently contested by ten teams with two drivers each (after the withdrawal of Team Trulli, there are temporarily only nine teams competing). Racing generally takes place on temporary city-center street circuits which are approximately 2 to 3.4&amp;nbsp;km (1.2 to 2.1&amp;nbsp;mi) long. Currently, only the Mexico City ePrix takes place on a road course, a modified version of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.

===Environmental benefits of the use of electric vehicles===
Electric vehicles produce no [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions, at the tailpipe.
So they are considered 'green' because they have no emissions in the place where they are used.
However, battery electric vehicles can be considered [[Zero emission engines]] only locally, because they generally produce GHG in the power plants where electricity is generated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-exec-summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two factors driving these GHG emissions of Battery Electric Vehicles are:
* the Carbon intensity of the electricity used to recharge the Electric Vehicle (commonly expressed in grams of CO2 per kWh)
* the consumption of the specific vehicle (in kilometers/kWh)
The Carbon Intensity of electricity can largely vary, depending on the electricity mix of the geographic region where electricity is consumed (a Country with high shares of renewables in his electricity mix will have a low C.I.).
In the European Union, in 2013, the Carbon Intensity had a strong geographic variability, but in almost all the Member States Electric vehicles were "greener" than conventional ones. On average, Electric car saved 50%-60% of CO2 emissions compared to diesel and gasoline fuelled engines. 
Moreover, the de-carbonisation process is constantly reducing the GHG emissions due to the use of Electric Vehicles. In the European Union, on average, between 2009 and 2013 there was a reduction of the electricity Carbon Intensity of 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Lonza L|title=Electricity carbon intensity in European Member States: Impacts on GHG emissions of electric vehicles|journal=Transportation Research part D, 2017|doi=10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Life-cycle assessment]] perspective, considering the GHG necessary to build the battery and its end-of-life, the GHG savings are 10-13% lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Helmers E|title=A new hybrid method for reducing the gap between WTW and LCA in the carbon footprint assessment of electric vehicles|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess (2017) 22: 4|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0954-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special-purpose vehicles===
[[File:Special people Electric Vehicle.jpg|thumb|Electric vehicles for disabled people in [[Årdalstangen]], Norway|alt=Electric vehicles for the disabled, in Årdalstangen, Norway]]
{{See also|Electrathon}}
[[Special-purpose vehicle]]s come in a wide range of types, ranging from relatively common ones such as [[golf cart]]s, things like [[electric golf trolley]]s, [[milk float]]s, [[all-terrain vehicle]]s, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s, and a wide range of other devices. Certain manufacturers specialize in electric-powered "in plant" work machines.

===Electric motorcycles, scooters and rickshaws===
{{main|Electric motorcycles and scooters}}
Three-wheeled vehicles include [[electric rickshaw]]s, a powered variant of the [[cycle rickshaw]].

China is the world's leading manufacturer of e-bikes, with 22.2 million units produced in 2009. Some of the biggest manufacturers of E-bikes in the world are [[BYD Company|BYD]], Geoby.

===Personal transporters===
An increasing variety of [[personal transporter]]s are being manufactured, including the one-wheeled [[self-balancing unicycle]]s, [[self-balancing scooter]]s, [[electric kick scooter]]s, and [[electric skateboard]]s.

===Motor controllers===
{{Main|Motor controller}}
The motor controller receives a signal from [[potentiometers]] linked to the accelerator pedal, and it uses this signal to determine how much electric power is needed&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork"&gt;{{cite web |title=How Exactly Do Electric Cars Work? |url=https://www.greencarfuture.com/electric/2018/11/11/how-exactly-do-electric-cars-work.html|website=Green Car Future |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This [[DC power]] is supplied by the battery pack, and the controller regulates the power to the motor, supplying either variable pulse width DC or variable frequency variable amplitude AC, depending on the motor type. The controller also handles [[regenerative braking]], whereby electrical power is gathered as the vehicle slows down and this power recharges the battery&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;. In addition to power and motor management, the controller performs various safety checks such as anomaly detection, functional safety tests and failure diagnostics&lt;ref name="HitachiReview"&gt;{{cite web |title=Components and Systems for Electric Vehicles (HEVs/EVs) |url=http://www.hitachi.com/rev/archive/2018/r2018_01/10b02/index.html|website=Hitachi Review |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


===Battery Pack===
{{main|Battery (electricity)}}

Most electric vehicles today use an [[electric battery]], consisting of [[electrochemical cell]]s with external connections in order to provide power to the vehicle.&lt;ref name=battRef2000&gt;
{{cite book |title=Battery Reference Book |edition=third|last=Crompton|first=T. R. |date=2000-03-20 |publisher=Newnes |page=Glossary 3 |isbn=0080499953 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QmVR7qiB5AUC&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;ots=ckHhIPVdcC&amp;dq=battery%20one%20or%20more%20cells&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2016-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Battery technology for EVs has developed from early [[lead-acid batteries]] used in the late 19th Century to the 2010s, to [[lithium-ion batteries]] which are found in most EVs today&lt;ref name="HitachiReview" /&gt;. The overall battery is referred to as a [[battery pack]], which is a group of multiple battery modules and cells. The battery pack powering modern EVs can have as little as 96 battery cells to as many as 2,976 cells&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;.

===Motors===
{{Main|Traction motor}}
Electric cars have traditionally used series wound DC motors, a form of [[brushed DC electric motor]]. Separately excited and permanent magnet are just two of the types of DC motors available. More recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of [[AC motor]] types, as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out. These are usually [[induction motor]]s or [[brushless AC electric motor]]s which use permanent magnets. There are several variations of the permanent magnet motor which offer simpler drive schemes and/or lower cost including the [[brushless DC electric motor]].

Once electric power is supplied to the motor (from the controller), the magnetic field interaction inside the motor will turn the [[drive shaft]] and ultimately the vehicle's wheels&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;.

'''Brown waste''' is any [[biodegradable waste]] that is predominantly [[Carbon#Compounds|carbon]] based. The term includes such items as grass cuttings, dry leaves, twigs, hay, paper, sawdust, corn cobs, cardboard, pine needles or cones, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://compostguide.com/ How to Make Compost, a Composting Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
Carbon is necessary to [[composting]], which uses a combination of [[green waste]] and brown waste to promote the microbial processes involved in the decomposition process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/organics/Homecompost/ California Integrated Waste Management Board - Home Composting]&lt;/ref&gt; The composting of brown waste [[sustainably]] returns the carbon to the [[carbon cycle]].

The '''calculation of glass properties''' ('''glass modeling''') is used to predict [[glass]] properties of interest or glass behavior under certain conditions (e.g., during production) without experimental investigation, based on past data and experience, with the intention to save time, material, financial, and environmental resources, or to gain scientific insight. It was first practised at the end of the 19th century by A. Winkelmann and [[Otto Schott|O. Schott]]. The combination of several glass models together with other relevant functions can be used for [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[six sigma]] procedures. In the form of [[statistical analysis]] glass modeling can aid with [[accreditation]] of new data, experimental procedures, and measurement institutions (glass laboratories).

==History==
Historically, the calculation of glass properties is directly related to the founding of glass [[science]]. At the end of the 19th century the physicist [[Ernst Abbe]] developed equations that allow calculating the design of optimized optical [[microscope]]s in [[Jena]], [[Germany]], stimulated by co-operation with the optical workshop of [[Carl Zeiss]]. Before Ernst Abbe's time the building of [[microscope]]s was mainly a work of art and experienced craftsmanship, resulting in very expensive optical [[microscope]]s with variable quality. Now Ernst Abbe knew exactly how to construct an excellent microscope, but unfortunately, the required [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] and [[Prism (optics)|prisms]] with specific ratios of [[refractive index]] and [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] did not exist. Ernst Abbe was not able to find answers to his needs from glass artists and engineers; glass making was not based on science at this time.&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite book |author=Vogel, Werner |title=Glass chemistry |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |year=1994 |isbn=3-540-57572-3 |edition=2nd revised }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879 the young glass engineer [[Otto Schott]] sent Abbe glass samples with a special composition ([[lithium]] silicate glass) that he had prepared himself and that he hoped to show special [[optics|optical]] properties. Following measurements by Ernst Abbe, Schott's glass samples did not have the desired properties, and they were also not as homogeneous as desired. Nevertheless, Ernst Abbe invited Otto Schott to work on the problem further and to evaluate all possible glass components systematically. Finally, Schott succeeded in producing homogeneous glass samples, and he invented [[borosilicate glass]] with the optical properties Abbe needed.&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt; These inventions gave rise to the well-known companies [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] and [[Schott Glass]] (see also [[Timeline of microscope technology]]). Systematic glass research was born. In 1908, Eugene Sullivan founded glass research also in the United States ([[Corning (city), New York|Corning]], [[New York (state)|New York]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.corning.com/inside_corning/our_heritage.aspx# |title=Eugene Sullivan and Corning Glass Works |access-date=2007-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013152045/http://corning.com/inside_corning/our_heritage.aspx# |archive-date=2007-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of glass research it was most important to know the relation between the glass composition and its properties. For this purpose Otto Schott introduced the '''additivity principle''' in several publications for calculation of glass properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winkelmann A. |author2=Schott O. |title=Über die Elastizität und über die Druckfestigkeit verschiedener neuer Gläser in ihrer Abhängigkeit von der chemischen Zusammensetzung |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=51 |pages=697 |year=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winkelmann A. |author2=Schott O. |title=Über thermische Widerstandscoefficienten verschiedener Gläser in ihrer Abhängigkeit von der chemischen Zusammensetzung |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=51 |issue= |pages=730 |year=1894 |doi=10.1002/andp.18942870407|bibcode = 1894AnP...287..730W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winkelmann A. |author2=Schott O. |title=Über die specifischen Wärmen verschieden zusammengesetzter Gläser |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=49 |page=401 |year=1893 |doi=10.1002/andp.18932850702|bibcode = 1893AnP...285..401W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle implies that the relation between the glass composition and a specific property is linear to all glass component concentrations, assuming an [[ideal mixture]], with ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' representing specific glass component concentrations and related coefficients respectively in the equation below. The additivity principle is a simplification and only valid within narrow composition ranges as seen in the displayed diagrams for the refractive index and the viscosity. Nevertheless, the application of the additivity principle lead the way to many of Schott’s inventions, including optical glasses, glasses with low thermal expansion for cooking and laboratory ware ([[borosilicate glass|Duran]]), and glasses with reduced freezing point depression for mercury [[thermometer]]s. Subsequently, English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=English S. |title=The effect of composition on the viscosity of glass. Part II |journal=J. Soc. Glass Technol. |volume=8 |pages=205–48 |year=1924 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |title=... Part III Some Four-component Glasses |journal=J. Soc.

Barth-Verlag, Leipzig, 1924, p 376.&lt;/ref&gt; published similar additive glass property calculation models. Schott’s additivity principle is still widely in use today in glass research and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lakatos T. |author2=Johansson L.G. |author3=Simmingsköld B. |title=Viscosity temperature relations in the glass system SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-CaO-MgO in the composition range of technical glasses |journal=Glass Technology |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=88–95 |date=June 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Terese Vascott |author2=Thomas P.

Schott and many scientists and engineers afterwards applied the additivity principle to experimental data measured in their own laboratory within sufficiently narrow composition ranges ('''local glass models'''). This is most convenient because disagreements between laboratories and non-linear glass component interactions do not need to be considered. In the course of several decades of systematic glass research thousands of [[glass]] compositions were studied, resulting in millions of published glass properties, collected in [[glass databases]]. This huge pool of experimental data was not investigated as a whole, until Bottinga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2475/ajs.272.5.438 |author1=Bottinga Y. |author2=Weill D.F. |title=The viscosity of magmatic silicate liquids: a model for calculation |journal=Am.

In contrast to the models by Schott the global models consider many independent data sources, making the model estimates more reliable. In addition, global models can reveal and quantify ''non-additive'' influences of certain glass component combinations on the properties, such as the ''mixed-alkali effect'' as seen in the adjacent diagram, or the ''boron anomaly''. Global models also reflect interesting developments of glass property measurement [[accuracy]], e.g., a decreasing accuracy of experimental data in modern scientific literature for some glass properties, shown in the diagram. They can be used for accreditation of new data, experimental procedures, and measurement institutions (glass laboratories). In the following sections (except melting enthalpy) ''[[empirical]]'' modeling techniques are presented, which seem to be a successful way for handling huge amounts of experimental data. The resulting models are applied in contemporary engineering and research for the calculation of glass properties.

Non-empirical (''[[deductive]]'') glass models exist.&lt;ref&gt;Milos B. Volf: "Mathematical Approach to Glass" Glass Science and Technology, vol. 9, Elsevier, 1988, {{ISBN|0-444-98951-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often not created to obtain reliable glass property predictions in the first place (except melting enthalpy), but to establish relations among several properties (e.g. [[atomic radius]], [[atomic mass]], [[Chemical bond|chemical bond strength and angles]], [[Valence (chemistry)|chemical valency]], [[heat capacity]]) to gain scientific insight. In future, the investigation of property relations in deductive models may ultimately lead to reliable predictions for all desired properties, provided the property relations are well understood and all required experimental data are available.

==Methods==
Glass properties and glass behavior during production can be calculated through [[statistical analysis]] of [[glass databases]] such as GE-SYSTEM&lt;ref name="GE-SYSTEM"&gt;[http://www.smartdata.cn/en/ges2010/index.html GE-SYSTEM]&lt;/ref&gt;
SciGlass&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciglass.info/ SciGlass] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016044859/http://www.sciglass.info/ |date=2007-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Interglad,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newglass.jp/interglad_n/gaiyo/info_e.html Interglad]&lt;/ref&gt; 
sometimes combined with the [[finite element method]]. For estimating the melting enthalpy thermodynamic databases are used.

===Linear regression===
[[Image:refractive index SiO2 Na2O.gif|250px|thumb|Refractive index in the system SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. [[dummy variable (statistics)|Dummy variables]] can be used to quantify systematic differences of whole dataseries from one investigator.&lt;ref name=errors/&gt;]]

If the desired glass property is not related to [[crystallization]] (e.g., [[liquidus temperature]]) or [[phase separation]], [[linear regression]] can be applied using common [[polynomial]] functions up to the third degree. Below is an example equation of the second degree. The ''C''-values are the glass component concentrations like Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or CaO in percent or other fractions, the ''b''-values are coefficients, and ''n'' is the total number of glass components. The glass main component [[silica]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is excluded in the equation below because of over-parametrization due to the constraint that all components sum up to 100%. Many terms in the equation below can be neglected based on [[correlation]] and [[Statistical significance|significance]] analysis. Systematic errors such as seen in the picture are quantified by [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variables]]. Further details and examples are available in an online tutorial by Fluegel.&lt;ref&gt;A. Fluegel: [http://glassproperties.com/principle/Statistics_Glass_2007.pdf Statistical Regression Modeling of Glass Properties - A Tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Glass Property} = b_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n \left( b_iC_i + \sum_{k=i}^n b_{ik}C_iC_k \right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Non-linear regression===
[[Image:TL-SiO2-Na2O-CaO.gif|250px|thumb|Liquidus surface in the system SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-CaO using disconnected peak functions based on 237 experimental datasets from 28 investigators. Error = 15 °C.&lt;ref name=liquidus&gt;[http://glassproperties.com/liquidus/ Glass Liquidus Temperature Calculation using disconnected peak functions]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[liquidus temperature]] has been modeled by [[non-linear regression]] using [[neural networks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-3093(02)01859-8|title=A machine learning approach to the estimation of the liquidus temperature of glass-forming oxide blends|year=2003|last1=Dreyfus|first1=C|journal=Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids|volume=318|pages=63|bibcode = 2003JNCS..318...63D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and disconnected peak functions.&lt;ref name=liquidus/&gt; The disconnected peak functions approach is based on the observation that within one [[primary crystalline phase]] field linear regression can be applied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hanni J.B. |author2=Pressly E. |author3=Crum J.V. |author4=Minister K.B.C. |author5=Tran D. |author6=Hrma P. |author7=Vienna J.D. |title=Liquidus temperature measurements for modeling oxide glass systems relevant to nuclear waste vitrification |journal=Journal of Materials Science |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=3346–57 |year=2005 |doi=10.1557/JMR.2005.0424|bibcode = 2005JMatR..20.3346H }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at eutectic points sudden changes occur.

===Glass melting enthalpy===
The glass melting enthalpy reflects the amount of energy needed to convert the mix of raw materials ([[glass batch|batch]]) to a melt glass. It depends on the batch and glass compositions, on the efficiency of the furnace and heat regeneration systems, the average residence time of the glass in the furnace, and many other factors. A pioneering article about the subject was written by Carl Kröger in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kröger, Carl |title=Theoretischer Wärmebedarf der Glasschmelzprozesse (Theoretical heat demand of glass melting processes) |journal=Glastechnische Berichte |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=202–14 |year=1953 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finite element method===
For modeling of the glass flow in a glass melting furnace the [[finite element method]] is applied commercially,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsl.cz/en/products/furnace-design.html Glass Service, Furnace Design]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brochure: [http://www.fluent.com/solutions/brochures/glass.pdf Flow modeling software for the glass industry]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Fluent Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; based on data or models for [[viscosity]], [[density]], [[thermal conductivity]], [[heat capacity]], absorption spectra, and other relevant properties of the glass melt. The finite element method may also be applied to glass forming processes.

===Optimization===
It is often required to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimize]] several glass properties simultaneously, including production costs.
&lt;ref name="GE-SYSTEM"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://glassproperties.com/optimization/ Glass property optimization]&lt;/ref&gt; This can be performed, e.g., by [[simplex search]], or in a spreadsheet as follows:
# Listing of the desired properties;
# Entering of models for the reliable calculation of properties based on the glass composition, including a formula for estimating the production costs;
# Calculation of the squares of the differences (errors) between desired and calculated properties;
# Reduction of the sum of square errors using the Solver option&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solver.com/suppstdsolver.htm Excel Solver]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Microsoft Excel]] with the glass components as variables. Other software (e.g. Microcal [[Origin (data analysis software)|Origin]]) can also be used to perform these [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimizations]].
It is possible to weight the desired properties differently.

Four '''cardinal virtues ''' were recognized in [[classical antiquity]] and in traditional [[Christian theology]]:
*[[Prudence]] ({{lang|grc|φρόνησις}}, ''phronēsis''; {{lang-la|prudentia}}; also [[Wisdom]], ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]'', ''sapientia''), the to ability to discern the appropriate course of action to be taken in a given situation at the appropriate time.
*[[Courage]] ({{lang|grc|ἀνδρεία}}, ''andreia''; {{lang-la|fortitudo}}): also termed fortitude, forbearance, strength, endurance, and the ability to confront fear, uncertainty, and intimidation
*[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] ({{lang|grc|σωφροσύνη}}, ''sōphrosynē''; {{lang-la|temperantia}}): also known as restraint, the practice of self-control, abstention, discretion, and moderation tempering the [[appetition]]. ''Sōphrosynē'' can also be translated as sound-mindedness. 
*[[Justice (virtue)|Justice]] ({{lang|grc|δικαιοσύνη}}, ''dikaiosynē''; {{lang-la|iustitia}}): also considered as fairness, the most extensive and most important virtue;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theplatonist.com/cardinal_virtues.htm|title=Cardinal Virtues of Plato, Augustine and Confucius|work=theplatonist.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074259/http://www.theplatonist.com/cardinal_virtues.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Greek word also having the meaning righteousness
These [[virtue]]s derive initially from [[Plato]]'s scheme, discussed in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' Book IV, 426–435  (and see ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' 330b, which also includes [[piety]] (''hosiotes'')). [[Cicero]] expanded on them, and [[Ambrose]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'' II(I).61&lt;/ref&gt; adapted them while adding a set of [[theological virtues]].

The term ''cardinal'' comes from the Latin {{lang|la|cardo}} (hinge);&lt;ref&gt;{{etymonline|cardinal}}&lt;/ref&gt; virtues are so called because they are regarded as the basic virtues required for a virtuous life. They also relate to the [[Quadrivium]].

==In classical antiquity==

The four cardinal virtues appear as a group (sometimes included in larger lists) long before they are later given this title.

Plato identified the four cardinal virtues with the classes of the city described in  ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', and with the faculties of man. Plato narrates a discussion of the character of a good city where the following is agreed upon.  “Clearly, then, it will be wise, brave, temperate [literally: healthy-minded], and just.”  (427e; see also 435b) '''[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]''' was common to all classes, but primarily associated with the producing classes, the farmers and craftsmen, and with the animal appetites, to whom no special virtue was assigned; '''[[courage|fortitude]]''' was assigned to the warrior class and to the spirited element in man; '''[[prudence]]''' to the rulers and to reason.  '''[[Justice]]''' stands outside the class system and divisions of man, and rules the proper relationship among the three of them.

Plato sometimes (e.g., ''[[Protagoras_(dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' 349b; cf. 324e, 329c, 330b, 331a-c) lists [[wikt:Special:Search/holiness|holiness]] (''hosiotes'', ''eusebeia'', ''aidos'') amongst the cardinal virtues. He especially associates holiness with justice, but leaves their precise relationship unexplained.

In Aristotle's ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' we read: “The forms of Virtue are justice, courage, temperance, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, prudence, wisdom.”  (''Rhetoric'' 1366b1)

The Roman philosopher and statesman [[Cicero]] (106–43 BC), like Plato, limits the list to four virtues: {{quote|“Virtue may be defined as a habit of mind (''animi'') in harmony with reason and the order of nature.  It has four parts: wisdom (''prudentiam''), justice, courage, temperance.” (''De Inventione'', II, LIII) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/inventione2.shtml#159|title=Cicero: de Inventione II|work=thelatinlibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Cicero discusses these further in ''[[De Officiis]]'' (I, V and following).

The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] discusses these in Book V:12 of ''[[Meditations]]'' and views them as the "goods" that a person should identify in one's own mind, as opposed to "wealth or things which conduce to luxury or prestige."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcus Aurelius|title=Meditations|date=1976|publisher=Penguin Classics trans. by Maxwell Staniforth|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cardinal virtues are listed in the Bible.  The deuterocanonical book [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]] 8:7 reads, "She [Wisdom] teaches temperance, and prudence, and justice, and fortitude, which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life."

They are also found in the Biblical [[apocrypha]]. [[4 Maccabees]] 1:18–19 relates: “Now the kinds of wisdom are right judgment, justice, courage, and self-control.  Right judgment is supreme over all of these since by means of it reason rules over the emotions.”

[[Catholic moral theology|Catholic moral philosophy]] drew from all of these sources when developing its thought on the virtues.

==In Christian tradition==
{{Thomism}}
[[Ambrose]] (AD&amp;nbsp;330s–397) was the first to use the expression “cardinal virtues.”  “And we know that there are four cardinal virtues temperance, justice, prudence, fortitude.”   (''Commentary on Luke'', V, 62)

[[Augustine of Hippo]], discussing the morals of the church, described them:
{{quote|For these four virtues (would that all felt their influence in their minds as they have their names in their mouths!), I should have no hesitation in defining them: that temperance is love giving itself entirely to that which is loved; fortitude is love readily bearing all things for the sake of the loved object; justice is love serving only the loved object, and therefore ruling rightly; prudence is love distinguishing with sagacity between what hinders it and what helps it. (''De moribus eccl.,'' Chap. xv)}}

The "cardinal" virtues are not the same as the [[Theological virtues|three theological virtues]]: Faith, Hope and Charity ([[Agape|Love]]), named in [[1 Corinthians 13]]. 
''And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.''
Because of this reference, a group of seven attributes is sometimes listed by adding the four cardinal virtues (prudence, temperance, fortitude, justice) and three theological virtues (faith, hope, charity).
Together, they comprise what is known as the [[seven virtues]].  While the first four date back to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers and were applicable to all people seeking to live moral lives, the ''theological virtues'' appear to be specific to [[Christian]]s as written by Paul in [[The New Testament]].

Efforts to relate the cardinal and theological virtues differ. Augustine sees faith as coming under justice.  Beginning with a wry comment about the moral mischief of pagan deities, he writes:
{{quote|They [the pagans] have made Virtue also a goddess, which, indeed, if it could be a goddess, had been preferable to many.  And now, because it is not a goddess, but a gift of God, let it be obtained by prayer from Him, by whom alone it can be given, and the whole crowd of false gods vanishes.  For as much as they have thought proper to distribute virtue into four divisions – prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance – and as each of these divisions has its own virtues, faith is among the parts of justice, and has the chief place with as many of us as know what that saying means, ‘The just shall live by faith.’ ([[City of God (book)|''City of God'']], IV, 20)}}

Later, in the High Middle Ages, some authors opposed the seven virtues (cardinal plus theological) to the seven capital sins.  However, “treatises exclusively concentrating on both septenaries are actually quite rare.” and “examples of late medieval catalogues of virtues and vices which extend or upset the double heptad can be easily multiplied.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Bejczy |first1= István P. |title= The Cardinal Virtues in the Middle Ages: A Study in Moral Thought from the Fourth to the Fourteenth Century |date=2011|publisher= Brill |location=Boston|pages=228, 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And there are problems with this parallelism.
{{quote|The opposition between the virtues and the vices to which these works allude despite the frequent inclusion of other schemes may seem unproblematic at first sight.  The virtues and the vices seem to mirror each other as positive and negative moral attitudes, so that medieval authors, with their keen predilection for parallels and oppositions, could conveniently set them against each other. . . . Yet artistic representations such as Conrad’s trees are misleading in that they establish oppositions between the principal virtues and the capital vices which are based on mere juxtaposition.  As to content, the two schemes do not match each other.  The capital vices of lust and avarice, for instance, contrast with the remedial virtues of chastity and generosity, respectively, rather than with any theological or cardinal virtue; conversely, the virtues of hope and prudence are opposed to despair and foolishness rather than to any deadly sin.  Medieval moral authors were well aware of the fact.  Actually, the capital vices are more often contrasted with the remedial or contrary virtues in medieval moral literature than with the principal virtues, while the principal virtues are frequently accompanied by a set of mirroring vices rather than by the seven deadly sins.&lt;ref&gt;Bejczy, 2011, pp. 232-33&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary Thought==
Jesuit scholars Daniel Harrington and James Keenan in their ''Paul and Virtue Ethics'' (2010) argue for seven "new virtues" to replace the classical cardinal virtues in complementing the three theological virtues, listed as "be humble, be hospitable, be merciful, be faithful, reconcile, be vigilant, and be reliable,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrington|first1=Daniel|last2=Keenan|first2=James|title=Paul and Virtue Ethics|date=2010|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, MD|pages=125–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they don't explain why it has to be an either/or matter of replacing the cardinal virtues rather than supplementing them.

==Allegory==

[[File:John Hotham Tomb South Dalton.jpg|right|thumb|The Tomb of [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]], supported by figures of the cardinal virtues.]]
[[File:Vertus cardinales par Germain Pilon (Louvre).jpg|thumbnail|Four cardinal virtues; Louvre, Paris. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]

The Cardinal Virtues are often depicted as female [[Allegorical sculpture|allegorical figures]] and were a popular subject for funerary sculpture. The attributes and names of these figures may vary according to local tradition.

In many churches and artwork the Cardinal Virtues are depicted with symbolic items:

* '''Justice''' – sword, balance and scales, and a crown
* '''Temperance''' – wheel, bridle and reins, vegetables and fish, cup, water and wine in two jugs
* '''Fortitude''' – armor, club, with a lion, palm, tower, yoke, broken column
* '''Prudence''' – book, scroll, mirror (occasionally attacked by a serpent)

Notable depictions include sculptures on the [[tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany]] and the tomb of [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]]. They were also depicted in the garden at [[Edzell Castle]].

A humorous depiction of the four cardinal virtues appears in the children's book "Masterpiece" written by [[Elise Broach]] and illustrated by [[Kelly Murphy]].

'''Class (locomotive)''' refers to a group of locomotives built to a common design for a single railroad.  Often members of a particular class had detail variations between individual examples, and these could lead to subclasses.  Sometimes technical alterations (especially [[rebuilding]], superheating, re-engining, etc.) move a locomotive from one class to another. Different railways had different systems, and sometimes one railway (or its successors) used different systems at different times and for different purposes, or applied those classifications inconsistently. Sometimes therefore it is not clear where one class begins and another ends. The result is a classic example of the [[lumpers and splitters|Lumper splitter problem]].

==Development==
As locomotives became more numerous the need arose to deal with them in groups of similar engines rather than as named or numbered individuals. These groups were named "classes" and at first tended to reflect capability rather than design. For example, the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] grouped its roster into four classes before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], though they had by that point dozens of different designs.

Later classes were based on design. A group of locomotives built off the same blueprints constituted a class, and if some of the locomotives in the class were sufficiently modified, a new class might be established for the modified examples. When electric locomotives were introduced, the same scheme was applied to them.

Since steam and early electric locomotives were usually custom built, classes were assigned by the railroad, and each railroad had its own system. Mergers of lines and sales of locomotives brought about changes of class. Early diesels were often fitted into the locomotive class system, but since they were generally not custom built the use of manufacturer model designations overtook the class system and made it irrelevant, except for historical discussion.

==Class system organization==
Usually the class system for a railroad was built on a simply hierarchy which assigned each class a code.

==First level: Wheel arrangement==
The first level was usually for the [[wheel arrangement]] and was usually coded by a letter of the alphabet. Different railroads used different codes, so that "J" on the [[New York Central Railroad]] meant a [[4-6-4]] (Hudson), while on the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] it mean a [[4-8-4]] (Northern), and on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] it denoted a [[4-4-0]] with a [[Wootten firebox]].

[[Articulated locomotives]] were handled through two different methods. On many railroads each wheel arrangement was assigned its own unique letter, due to the limited number of arrangements that had to be represented. On other railroads this was insufficient, and commonly articulated locomotives were represented with a two letter code, one letter for the arrangement of each half. Therefore, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad GG1]] ([[International Union of Railways|UIC]] 2Co+Co2) is represented as if it were two ten-wheelers ([[4-6-0]]) coupled tail-to-tail.

==Second level: Sequential model==
A sequence number was often added to distinguish different designs of the same wheel arrangement. As a rule the first design for a given arrangement had no sequence number, so that numbering stated at 1 with the second design for the wheel arrangement. For example, there were two main classes of [[2-10-2]] locomotives on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;O]], labelled "S" and "S-1".

==Third level: Variants==
Letter suffixes were often used to indicate variants in a basic design. Sometimes these also referred to specific characteristics; for example, for many years the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] used a "s" suffix to indicate [[superheater|superheating]], while on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;O]] a "t" suffix indicated an engine with an oversize [[Tender locomotive|tender]].

==Sub-Classes==
Sub-classes are groups of locomotives that many have different mechanical characteristics between the sub-class of locomotives and the original design of those locomotives.
For example: when [[New South Wales C30 class|NSWGR C30 class]] suburban tank engines where displaced because of the electrification of Sydney suburban railways, many were converted to tender engines adding the prefix of “t” to C30. Some were even converted to superheighted engines, adding another prefix of “s” to either C30 or C30T to become C30S or C30TS.

==Class names==
Most locomotives were given simple codes, but some classes were named, formally or not.
*The [[Union Pacific Big Boy]] class was said to have been given that name when it was scrawled on the smokebox of one at the factory.
*The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] P-7 class was referred to as the "President" class because initially each locomotive had the name of a [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] on the cab.
*Also on the B&amp;O, the S and S-1 classes were referred to as "Big Sixes" because the road numbers began with 6.

==British practice==
* For recent practice see: [[British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification]]

The old railway companies had various systems of classification. Taking the "Big Four" companies which operated from 1923 to 1947:

===Great Western Railway===
The class number was usually taken from the first member of each class, e.g. "5700 Class" or "57XX Class" for locomotives in the number series beginning 5700.
* See: [[GWR locomotive numbering and classification]]

==Southern Railway==
Each class was given a letter or number but these were not very meaningful. For example, "700" Class locomotives were [[0-6-0]]s, but so were "Q" Class engines. See:
* [[SR locomotive numbering and classification]]
* [[SR multiple unit numbering and classification]]

==London, Midland and Scottish Railway==
Each locomotive was given a [[power classification]], e.g. "3F".  However, many different classes would have the same power classification so this was not helpful for identifying classes.
* See: [[LMS locomotive numbering and classification]]

==London and North Eastern Railway==
The LNER's classification system was the most helpful to railway enthusiasts. Each [[Whyte notation|wheel arrangement]] was given a letter (e.g. A for 4-6-2, B for 4-6-0, etc.) and this was followed by a number denoting the class (e.g. A1, B1, etc.).

The '''cultural theory of risk''', often referred to simply as '''Cultural Theory''' (with capital letters; not to be confused with [[culture theory]]), consists of a conceptual framework and an associated body of empirical studies that seek to explain societal conflict over risk. Whereas other theories of [[risk perception]] stress economic and cognitive influences, Cultural Theory asserts that structures of social organization endow individuals with perceptions that reinforce those structures in competition against alternative ones. This theory was first elaborated in the book ''[[Natural Symbols]]'', written by anthropologist [[Mary Douglas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dustinstoltz.com/blog/2014/06/04/diagram-of-theory-douglas-and-wildavskys-gridgroup-typology-of-worldviews|title=Diagram of Theory: Douglas and Wildavsky’s Grid/Group Typology of Worldviews|newspaper=Dustin S. Stoltz|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970. Douglas later worked closely with the political scientist [[Aaron Wildavsky]], to clarify the theory. Cultural Theory has given rise to a diverse set of research programs that span multiple social science disciplines and that have in recent years been used to analyze policymaking conflicts generally.

==Theory and evidence==
===Risk and blame, group and grid===
Two features of Douglas’s work inform the basic structure of Cultural Theory. The first of these is a general account of the social function of individual perceptions of societal dangers. Individuals, Douglas maintained, tend to associate societal harms—from sickness to famine to natural catastrophes—with conduct that transgresses societal norms. This tendency, she argued, plays an indispensable role in promoting certain social structures, both by imbuing a society’s members with aversions to subversive behavior and by focusing resentment and blame on those who defy such institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#puritydanger|Douglas (1966)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#riskblame|Douglas (1992)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The second important feature of Douglas’s work is a particular account of the forms that competing structures of social organization assume. Douglas maintained that cultural ways of life and affiliated outlooks can be characterized (within and across all societies at all times) along two dimensions, which she called “group” and “grid”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#natsymbols|Douglas (1970)]], pp. 54–68.&lt;/ref&gt; A “high group” way of life exhibits a high degree of collective control, whereas a “low group” one exhibits a much lower one and a resulting emphasis on individual self-sufficiency. A “high grid” way of life is characterized by conspicuous and durable forms of stratification in roles and authority, whereas a “low grid” one reflects a more egalitarian ordering.&lt;ref&gt;[[#rayner|Rayner (1992)]], p 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although developed in Douglas’s earlier work, these two strands of her thought were first consciously woven together to form the fabric of a theory of risk perception in her and Wildavsky’s 1982 book, ''Risk and Culture : An Essay on the Selection of Technical and Environmental Dangers''. Focusing largely on political conflict over air pollution and nuclear power in the United States, ''Risk and Culture'' attributed political conflict over environmental and technological risks to a struggle between adherents of competing ways of life associated with the group–grid scheme: an egalitarian, collectivist (“low grid”, “high group”) one, which gravitates toward fear of environmental disaster as a justification for restricting commercial behavior productive of inequality; and individualistic ("low group") and hierarchical ("high grid") ones, which resist claims of environmental risk in order to shield private orderings from interference, and to defend established commercial and governmental elites from subversive rebuke.

Later works in Cultural Theory systematized this argument. In these accounts, group–grid gives rise to either four or five discrete ways of life, each of which is associated with a view of nature (as robust, as fragile, as capricious, and so forth) that is congenial to its advancement in competition with the others.&lt;ref&gt;[[#mama|Mamadouh (1999)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson, Ellis 1990"&gt;[[#ct|Thompson, Ellis &amp; Wildvasky (1990)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey studies===
A variety of scholars have presented survey data in support of Cultural Theory. The first of these was Karl Dake, a graduate student of Wildavsky, who correlated perceptions of various societal risks—environmental disaster, external aggression, internal disorder, market breakdown—with subjects’ scores on attitudinal scales that he believed reflected the “cultural worldviews” associated with the ways of life in Douglas’s group–grid scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dake|Dake (1991)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later researchers have refined Dake’s measures and have applied them to a wide variety of environmental and technological risks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Langford|Langford, Georgiu, Bateman, Day &amp; Turner (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#peters|Peters &amp; Slovic (1996)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#poortinga|Poortinga (2002)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies furnish an indirect form of proof by showing that risk perceptions are distributed across persons in patterns better explained by culture than by other asserted influences.

===Case studies===
Other scholars have presented more interpretive empirical support for Cultural Theory. Developed in case-study form, their work shows how particular risk-regulation and related controversies can plausibly be understood within a group-grid framework.&lt;ref&gt;[[#clumsy|Verweij &amp; Thompson (2006)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plt.sagepub.com/content/11/3/242.abstract Hartmann, T. (2012).Wicked problems and clumsy solutions: Planning as expectation management. Planning Theory, 11(3), 242–256. doi: 10.1177/1473095212440427]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other risk perception theories==
Cultural Theory is an alternative to two other prominent theories of risk perception. The first, which is grounded in [[rational choice theory]], treats risk perceptions as manifesting individuals’ implicit weighing of costs and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[[#starr|Starr (1969)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas and Wildavsky criticized this position in ''Risk and Culture'', arguing that it ignores the role of cultural ways of life in determining what states of affairs individuals see as worthy of taking risks to attain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#riskculture|Douglas &amp; Wildavsky (1982)]], pp. 194–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The second prominent theory, which is grounded in social psychology and [[behavioral economics]], asserts that individuals’ risk perceptions are pervasively shaped, and often distorted by heuristics and biases.&lt;ref&gt;[[#kahneman|Kahneman, Slovic &amp; Tversky (1982)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas maintained that this “psychometric” approach naively attempted to “depoliticize” risk conflicts by attributing to cognitive influences beliefs that reflect individuals’ commitments to competing cultural structures.&lt;ref&gt;[[#depoliticization|Douglas (1997)]], pp. 123–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, some scholars, including [[Paul Slovic]], a pioneer in the development of the psychometric theory, and [[Dan Kahan]] have sought to connect the psychometric and cultural theories. This position, known as the [[cultural cognition]] of risk, asserts that the dynamics featured in the psychometric paradigm are the mechanisms through which group-grid worldviews shape risk perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[#feardemoc|Kahan, Slovic, Braman &amp; Gastil (2006)]], p. 1084.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering such a program, Douglas herself thought it unworkable, saying that “[i]f we were invited to make a coalition between group-grid theory and psychometrics, it would be like going to heaven”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#depoliticization|Douglas (1997)]], p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Such deeply ironic statements are scattered through her work as indicating an unattainable mirage of 'positionlessness': understanding and knowledge must, for Douglas, always emerge from a particular, partial, position, as is evident from the opening chapters of her 1982 book with Wildavsky.

==Application beyond risk perception==

Theorists working with Cultural Theory have adapted its basic components, and in particular the group-grid typology, to matters in addition to risk perception. These include [[political science]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#ctps|Thompson, Grendstate &amp; Selle (1999)]].&lt;/ref&gt; public policy,&lt;ref&gt;[[#swedlow|Swedlow (2002)]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[public management]] and [[organizational studies]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#hood|Hood (1998)]].&lt;/ref&gt; law&lt;ref&gt;[[#feardemoc|Kahan, Slovic, Braman &amp; Gastil (2006)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index1177.html Thompson, M. (2011) “Sustainability is an essentially contested concept”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''4''' (1) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Cultural Theory of risk has been subject to a variety of criticisms. Complexities and ambiguities inherent in Douglas’s group-grid scheme, and the resulting diversity of conceptualizations among cultural theorists, lead Åsa Boholm to believe the theory is fatally opaque.&lt;ref&gt;[[#boholm|Boholm (2003)]], p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; She also objects to the theory’s embrace of [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]],&lt;ref name="Thompson, Ellis 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#hit|Douglas (1986)]]&lt;/ref&gt; a controversial mode of analysis that sees the needs of collective entities (in the case of Cultural Theory, the ways of life defined by group-grid), rather than the decisions of individuals about how to pursue their own ends, as the principal causal force in social relations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#boholm|Boholm (2003)]], pp. 68, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, both Boholm and {{Harvcoltxt|van der Linden|2015}} note that cultural theory is circular in its logic. Commentators have also critiqued studies that purport to furnish empirical evidence for Cultural Theory, particularly survey studies, which some argue reflect unreliable measures of individual attitudes and in any case explain only a modest amount of the variance in individual perceptions of risk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#marris|Marris, Langford, &amp; O'Riordan (1998)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#sjoberg|Sjöberg (1998)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, some resist Cultural Theory on political grounds owing to Douglas and Wildavsky’s harsh denunciation of environmentalists in ''Risk and Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#winner|Winner (1982)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16129">'''Data-driven control systems''' are a broad family of [[Control theory|control systems]], in which the [[System identification|identification]] of the process model and/or the design of the controller are based entirely on ''experimental data'' collected from the plant &lt;ref&gt;Bazanella, A.S., Campestrini, L., Eckhard, D. (2012). Data-driven controller design: the &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; approach. Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-007-2300-9}}, 208 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In many control applications, trying to write a mathematical model of the plant is considered a hard task, requiring efforts and time to the process and control engineers. This problem is overcome by ''data-driven'' methods, which allow to fit a system model to the experimental data collected, choosing it in a specific models class. The control engineer can then exploit this model to design a proper controller for the system. However, it is still difficult to find a simple yet reliable model for a physical system, that includes only those dynamics of the system that are of interest for the control specifications. The ''direct'' data-driven methods allow to tune a controller, belonging to a given class, without the need of an identified model of the system. In this way, one can also simply weight process dynamics of interest inside the control cost function, and exclude those dynamics that are out of interest.

== Overview ==

The ''standard'' approach to control systems design is organized in two-steps: 
# Model identification aims at estimating a nominal model of the system &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G} = G\left(q; \widehat{\theta}_N\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the unit-delay operator (for discrete-time transfer functions representation) and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\theta}_N&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of parameters of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; identified on a set of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; data. Then, validation consists in constructing the ''uncertainty set'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; that contains the true system &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; at a certain probability level.
# Controller design aims at finding a controller &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; achieving closed-loop stability and meeting the required performance with &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt;.
Typical objectives of [[System Identification|system identification]] are to have &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; as close as possible to &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;, and to have &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; as small as possible. However, from an [[System identification#Identification for control|identification for control]] perspective, what really matters is the performance achieved by the controller, not the intrinsic quality of the model.

One way to deal with uncertainty is to design a controller that has an acceptable performance with all models in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, including &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;. This is the main idea behind [[robust control]] design procedure, that aims at building frequency domain uncertainty descriptions of the process. However, being based on worst-case assumptions rather than on the idea of averaging out the noise, this approach typically leads to ''conservative'' uncertainty sets. Rather, data-driven techniques deal with uncertainty by working on experimental data, and avoiding excessive conservativism.

In the following, the main classifications of data-driven control systems are presented.

=== Indirect and direct methods ===
There are many methods available to control the systems. 
The fundamental distinction is between '''indirect''' and '''direct''' controller design methods. The former group of techniques is still retaining the standard two-step approach, ''i.e.'' first a model is identified, then a controller is tuned based on such model. The main issue in doing so is that the controller is computed from the estimated model &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; (according to the [[Stochastic control#Certainty equivalence|certainty equivalence]] principle), but in practice &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G} \neq G_0&lt;/math&gt;. To overcome this problem, the idea behind the latter group of techniques is to map the experimental data ''directly'' onto the controller, without any model to be identified in between.

=== Iterative and noniterative methods ===

Another important distinction is between '''iterative''' and '''noniterative''' (or '''one-shot''') methods. In the former group, repeated iterations are needed to estimate the controller parameters, during which the [[Optimization_problem|optimization problem]] is performed based on the results of the previous iteration, and the estimation is expected to become more and more accurate at each iteration. This approach is also prone to on-line implementations (see below). In the latter group, the (optimal) controller parametrization is provided with a single optimization problem. This is particularly important for those systems in which iterations or repetitions of data collection experiments are limited or even not allowed (for example, due to economic aspects). In such cases, one should select a design technique capable of delivering a controller on a single data set. This approach is often implemented off-line (see below).

=== On-line and off-line methods ===

Since, on practical industrial applications, open-loop or closed-loop data are often available continuously, '''on-line''' data-driven techniques use those data to improve the quality of the identified model and/or the performance of the controller each time new information is collected on the plant. Instead, '''off-line''' approaches work on batch of data, which may be collected only once, or multiple times at a regular (but rather long) interval of time.

== Iterative feedback tuning ==

The iterative feedback tuning (IFT) method was introduced in 1994 &lt;ref&gt;Hjalmarsson, H., Gevers, M., Gunnarsson, S., &amp; Lequin, O. (1998). Iterative feedback tuning: theory and applications. IEEE control systems, 18(4), 26–41.&lt;/ref&gt;, starting from the observation that, in identification for control, each iteration is based on the (wrong) certainty equivalence principle.

IFT is a model-free technique for the direct iterative optimization of the parameters of a fixed-order controller; such parameters can be successively updated using information coming from standard (closed-loop) system operation.

Let &lt;math&gt;y^d&lt;/math&gt; be a desired output to the reference signal &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; the error between the achieved and desired response is &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}(\rho)=y(\rho)-y^d&lt;/math&gt;. The control design objective can be formulated as the minimization of the objective function:

:&lt;math&gt; J(\rho) = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{t=1}^N E\left[\tilde{y}(t,\rho)^2\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Given the objective function to minimize, the ''quasi-Newton method'' can be applied, i.e. a gradient-based minimization using a gradient search of the type:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_{i+1} = \rho_i - \gamma_i R_i^{-1}  \frac{d\widehat{J}}{d\rho}(\rho_i). &lt;/math&gt;

The value &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the step size, &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate positive definite matrix and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\widehat{J}}{d\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is an approximation of the gradient; the true value of the gradient is given by the following:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dJ}{d\rho} (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \left[\tilde{y}(t,\rho)\frac{\delta y}{\delta \rho}(t,\rho)\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta y}{\delta \rho}(t,\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained through the following three-step methodology:

# Normal Experiment: Perform an experiment on the closed loop system with &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; as controller and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; as reference; collect N measurements of the output &lt;math&gt;y(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y^{(1)} (\rho) &lt;/math&gt;.
# Gradient Experiment: Perform an experiment on the closed loop system with &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; as controller and 0 as reference &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; inject the signal &lt;math&gt;r-y^{(1)} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt; such that it is summed to the control variable output by &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, going as input into the plant. Collect the output, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y^{(2)} (\rho) &lt;/math&gt;.
# Take the following as gradient approximation: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta \widehat{y}}{\delta \rho} (\rho) = \frac{\delta C}{\delta \rho} (\rho) y^{(2)} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

A crucial factor for the convergence speed of the algorithm is the choice of &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;; when &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt; is small, a good choice is the approximation given by the Gauss–Newton direction:

: &lt;math&gt; R_i = \frac 1 N \sum_{t=1}^N \frac{\delta \widehat{y}}{\delta \rho} (\rho_i) \frac{\delta \widehat{y}^T}{\delta \rho} (\rho_i).&lt;/math&gt;

== Noniterative correlation-based tuning ==

Noniterative correlation-based tuning (nCbT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller&lt;ref&gt;van Heusden, K., Karimi, A. and Bonvin, D. (2011), Data-driven model reference control with asymptotically guaranteed stability. Int. J. Adapt. Control Signal Process., 25: 331–351. doi:10.1002/acs.1212&lt;/ref&gt;. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; denotes an unknown LTI stable SISO plant, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a user-defined reference model and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a user-defined weighting function. An LTI fixed-order controller is indicated as &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)=\beta^T \rho&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \rho \in \mathbb R ^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of LTI basis functions. Finally, &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal LTI controller of any structure, guaranteeing a closed-loop function &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; when applied to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The goal is to minimize the following objective function:

: &lt;math&gt;J(\rho)=\left\| F \bigg( \frac{ K^* G-K(\rho)G }{ (1+K^* G)^2 } \bigg) \right\|_2^2. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;J(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is a convex approximation of the objective function obtained from a model reference problem, supposing that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ (1+K(\rho)G) } \approx \frac{1}{ (1+K^*G) }&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is stable and minimum-phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the scheme in figure.

[[File:Noniterative Correlation-based Tuning Scheme.svg|thumb|483x180px|The idea is that, when ''G'' is stable and minimum phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The input signal &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; is supposed to be a persistently exciting input signal and &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; to be generated by a stable data-generation mechanism. The two signals are thus uncorrelated in an open-loop experiment; hence, the ideal error &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t,\rho^* )&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated with &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The control objective thus consists in finding &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t,\rho^* )&lt;/math&gt; are uncorrelated.

The vector of ''instrumental variables'' &lt;math&gt;\zeta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \zeta(t)=[r_W (t+\ell_1 ),r_W (t+\ell_1-1),\ldots,r_W (t),\ldots,r_W (t-\ell_1) ]^T &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; is large enough and &lt;math&gt;r_W (t)=Wr(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate filter.

The correlation function is:

: &lt;math&gt;f_{N,\ell_1} (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \zeta(t) \varepsilon(t,\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

and the optimization problem becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho} = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J_{N,\ell_1}(\rho) = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} f_{N,\ell_1}^T f_{N,\ell_1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Denoting with &lt;math&gt;\phi_r (\omega)&lt;/math&gt; the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;, it can be demonstrated that, under some assumptions, if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is selected as:

:&lt;math&gt;W(e^{-j\omega}) = \frac{F(e^{-j\omega})(1-M(e^{-j\omega}))}{\phi_r (\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;

then, the following holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N,\ell_1 \to \infty, \ell_1/N \to \infty} \widehat{\rho} = \rho^*.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Stability constraint ===

There is no guarantee that the controller &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes &lt;math&gt;J_{N,\ell_1}&lt;/math&gt; is stable. Instability may occur in the following cases:

* If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is non-minimum phase, &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; may lead to cancellations in the right-half complex plane.
* If &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; (even if stabilizing) is not achievable, &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; may not be stabilizing.
* Due to measurement noise, even if &lt;math&gt;K^*=K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is stabilizing, data-estimated &lt;math&gt;\widehat{K}(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; may not be so.

Consider a stabilizing controller &lt;math&gt;K_s&lt;/math&gt; and the closed loop transfer function &lt;math&gt;M_s=\frac{K_s G}{1+K_s G}&lt;/math&gt;.
Define:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(\rho) := M_s - K(\rho) G (1-M_s) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta(\rho) := \left\| \Delta(\rho) \right\|_\infty. &lt;/math&gt;

:'''Theorem''' 
:''The controller &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes the plant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if

# &lt;math&gt; \Delta(\rho) &lt;/math&gt; is stable
# &lt;math&gt;\exist \delta_N \in (0,1) &lt;/math&gt; s.t. &lt;math&gt; \delta (\rho) \leq \delta_N. &lt;/math&gt;''

Condition 1. is enforced when:

* &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is stable
* &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; contains an integrator (it is canceled).

The model reference design with stability constraint becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_s = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J(\rho) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \text{s.t. } \delta(\rho) \leq \delta_N. &lt;/math&gt;

A '''convex data-driven estimation''' of &lt;math&gt;\delta(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained through the [[discrete Fourier transform]]. 

Define the following:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \widehat{R}_r (\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N r(t-\tau) r(t) \text{ for } \tau = -\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_2 \\[4pt]
&amp; \widehat{R}_{r\varepsilon} (\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N r(t-\tau) \varepsilon(t,\rho) \text{ for } \tau = -\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_2.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For '''stable minimum phase plants''', the following '''convex data-driven oprimization problem''' is given:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\widehat{\rho} &amp; = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J_{N,\ell_1}(\rho) \\[3pt]
&amp; \text{s.t.} \\[3pt]
&amp; \bigg| \sum_{\tau=-\ell_2}^{\ell_2} \widehat{R}_{r\varepsilon} (\tau,\rho) e^{-j\tau\omega_k} \bigg| \leq \delta_N \bigg| \sum_{\tau=-\ell_2}^{\ell_2} \widehat{R}_r (\tau,\rho) e^{-j\tau\omega_k} \bigg| \\[4pt]
\omega_k &amp; = \frac{2 \pi k}{2\ell_2+1}, \qquad k=0,\ldots,\ell_2+1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Virtual reference feedback tuning ==

Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.

VRFT was first proposed &lt;ref&gt;Guardabassi, Guido O., and Sergio M. Savaresi. "Approximate feedback linearization of discrete-time non-linear systems using virtual input direct design." Systems &amp; Control Letters 32.2 (1997): 63–74.&lt;/ref&gt; as &lt;math&gt;VRD^2&lt;/math&gt; and then fixed and extended  for LTI &lt;ref&gt;Campi, Marco C., Andrea Lecchini, and Sergio M. Savaresi. "Virtual reference feedback tuning: a direct method for the design of feedback controllers." Automatica 38.8 (2002): 1337–1346.&lt;/ref&gt; and LPV &lt;ref&gt;Formentin, S., Piga, D., Tóth, R., &amp; Savaresi, S. M. (2016). Direct learning of LPV controllers from data. Automatica, 65, 98–110.&lt;/ref&gt; systems.

The main idea is to define a desired closed loop model &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and to use its inverse dynamics to obtain a virtual reference &lt;math&gt;r_v (t)&lt;/math&gt; from the measured output signal &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning Scheme.svg|thumb|483x180px|The main idea is to define a desired closed loop model M and to use its inverse dynamics to obtain a virtual reference from the measured output signal y.]]

The virtual signals are &lt;math&gt;r_v (t)=M^{-1} y(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; e_v (t)=r_v (t) - y(t). &lt;/math&gt;

The optimal controller is obtained from noiseless data by solving the following optimization problem:

: &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho}_\infty = \underset{\rho}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \lim_{N \to \infty} J_{vr} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

where the optimization function is given as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; J_{vr}^N (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \left(u(t)-K(\rho) e_v(t) \right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Discoverability''' is the degree to which of something, especially a piece of content or information, can be found in a search of a file, database, or other information system. Discoverability is a concern in [[library and information science]], many aspects of digital media, software and web development, and in marketing, since something (e.g., a website, product, service, etc.) cannot be used if people cannot find it or do not understand what it can be used for. [[Metadata]], or "information about information," such as a book's title, a product's description, or a website's keywords, affects how discoverable something is on a database or online. In the 2010s, adding metadata to a product that is available online can make it easier for [[end user]]s to find the product. For example, if a song file is made available online, making the title, name of the band, genre, year of release, and other pertinent information available in connection with this song file will make it easier for users to find this song file. Organizing information by putting it into alphabetical order or including it in a search engine is an example of how to improve discoverability. Discoverability is related to, but different from, [[accessibility]] and [[usability]], other qualities that affect the usefulness of a piece of information.
==Etymology==
The concept of "discoverability" in an information science and online context is a loose borrowing from the concept of the similar name in the legal profession. In law, "discovery" is a pre-trial procedure in a [[lawsuit]] in which each party, through the law of [[civil procedure]], can obtain evidence from the other party or parties by means of discovery devices such as a request for answers to [[interrogatories]], [[Request for production|request for production of document]]s, request for admissions and [[Deposition (law)|deposition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Conducting Discovery in a Civil Lawsuit|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/civil-litigation/conducting-discovery-civil-lawsuit|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=30 September 2017|date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discovery can be obtained from non-parties using [[subpoena]]s.  When a discovery request is objected to, the requesting party may seek the assistance of the court by filing a [[motion to compel]] discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwarzner|first1=William W.|title=The Federal Rules, the Adversary Process, and Discovery Reform|journal=University of Pittsburgh Law Review|date=1988|volume=50|page=703|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/upitt50&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The usability of any piece of information directly relates to how discoverable it is, either in a "[[walled garden (technology)|walled garden]]" database or on the open Internet. The quality of information available on this database or on the Internet depends upon the quality of the meta-information about each item, product, or service. In the case of a service, because of the emphasis placed on service reusability, opportunities should exist for reuse of this service. However, reuse  is only possible if information is discoverable in the first place. To make items, products, and services discoverable, the following set of activities need to be performed:

# Document the information about the item, product or service (the metadata) in a consistent manner.
# Store the documented information (metadata) in a searchable repository.
# Enable yourself and others to search for the documented information in an efficient manner.

Regarding number 2, storing the information in a searchable repository: while technically a human-searchable repository, such as a printed paper list would qualify, in the 2010s, "searchable repository" is usually taken to mean a computer-searchable repository, such as a [[database]] that a human user can search using some type of [[search engine]] or "find" feature. Number 3 further supports this analysis of number 2, because while reading through a printed paper list by hand might be feasible in a theoretical sense, it is not time and cost-efficient in comparison with computer-based searching.

Apart from increasing the reuse potential of the services, discoverability is also required to avoid development of solution logic that is already contained in an existing service. To design services that are not only discoverable but also provide interpretable information about their capabilities, the service discoverability principle provides guidelines that could be applied during the [[Service-oriented modeling|service-oriented analysis]] phase of the service delivery process.

===Specific to digital media===
In relation to audiovisual content, according to the meaning given by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) for the purpose of its 2016 Discoverability Summit, discoverability can be summed up to the intrinsic ability of given content to "stand out of the lot", or to position itself so as to be easily found and discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discoverability Summit|url=http://www.discoverability.ca|website=Discoverability Summit|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A piece of audiovisual content can be a movie, a TV series, music, a book ([[eBook]]), an audio book or podcast. When audiovisual content such as a digital file for a TV show, movie, or song, is made available online, if the content is "tagged" with identifying information such as the names of the key artists (e.g., actors, directors and screenwriters for TV shows and movies; singers, musicians and record producers for songs) and the genres (e.g., for movies genres such as action, drama or comedy; for songs, genres such as heavy metal music, hip hop music, etc.), this makes it easier for end users to find the content they are interested in.

In the 2010s, when users interact with online content, [[algorithm]]s typically determine what types of content the user is interested in, and then a computer program suggests "more like this", which is other content that the user may be interested in. Different websites and systems have different algorithms, but one approach, used by Amazon for its online store, is to indicate to a user, once the user searches for or looks at content/product ''x'' that "other users who purchased ''x'' also purchased the following items". This example is oriented around online purchasing behaviour, but an algorithm could also be programmed to provide suggestions based on other factors (e.g., searching, viewing, etc.). 

In the 2010s, discoverability is typically referred to in connection with [[search engine]]s. A highly "discoverable" piece of content (e.g., a certain movie) would be a movie that appears at the top, or near the top of a user's search results. A related concept is the role of "recommendation engines", which are computer programs which give a user recommendations based on his/her online activity. In the 2010s, "discoverabilty" applies to desktop and laptop computers and do the increasingly widening range of devices that can access the Internet, including various [[console video game]] systems and mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. When organizations make an effort to promote certain content (e.g., a TV show, film, song, or video game), they can use "traditional marketing" (billboards, TV ads, radio ads) and digital ads (pop-up ads, pre-roll ads, etc.), or a mix of traditional and digital marketing.

Even before the user’s intervention by searching for a certain content or type of content, discoverability is the prime factor which contributes to whether a piece of audiovisual content will be likely to be found in the various digital modes of content consumption. As of 2017, modes of searching include looking on [[Netflix]] for movies, [[Spotify]] for music, Audible for audio books, etc., although the concept can also more generally be applied to content found on [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Instagram]] and other websites. It involves more than a content’s mere presence on a given platform; it can involve associating this content with "keywords" (tags), search algorithms, positioning within different categories, metadata, etc. Thus, discoverability enables as much as it promotes. For audiovisual content broadcast or streamed on digital media using the Internet, discoverability includes the underlying concepts of information science and programming architecture, which are at the very foundation of the search for a specific product, information or content.

==Applications==

===Within a webpage===
Within a specific webpage or software application ("app"), the discoverability of a feature, content or link depends on a range of factors, including the size, colour, highlighting features, and position within the page. When colour is used to communicate the importance of a feature or link, designers typically use other elements as well, such as shadows or bolding, for individuals who cannot see certain colours. Just as traditional paper printing created other physical locations that stood out, such as being "above the fold" of a newspaper versus "below the fold", a web page or app's screenview may have certain locations that give features additional visibility to users, such as being right at the bottom of the web page or screen. 

The positional advantages or disadvantages of various locations depend on different cultures and languages (e.g., left to right vs. right to left). Some locations have become established, such as having toolbars at the top of a screen or webpage. Some designers have argued that commonly used features (e.g., a print button) should be much more visually prominent than very rarely used features. Some features cannot be seen, but there is a convention that if the user places the mouse cursor in a certain area, then a toolbar or function option will become visible. In general, because of the smaller screen of mobile devices, controls are often not placed right in the centre of the screen, because that is where the user views content or text.

Some organizations try to increase the discoverability of a certain feature by adding animation, such as a moving "click here" icon. As of 2017, the addition of motion sensors and geotracking to mobile devices has made webpage design for discoverability more complex, because smartphones and tablets are typically capable of having many more inputs from the user than a 1980s era desktop, including "swiping" the [[touchscreen]], touching images on the screen, or tilting the device. One of the challenges in webpage and app design is that the degree of sophistication and experience of users with navigating in the webpage or app environment varies a great deal, from individuals who are new to using these applications at one extreme to experienced computer users.

===Internet search===
For items that are searched for online, the goal of discoverability is to be at or near the top of the search results. Organizations may make efforts to make it more likely that "their" content or webpages are at the top, or close to the top, of search results; these approaches are often collectively called [[search engine optimization]] (SEO). Note that when an organization takes action to increase the SEO of its website, this does not normally involve changes to the search engine itself; rather, it involves adding metadata tags and original content, among other strategies, to increase the "visibility" of the website to search engine algorithms.

====Services====
In a service delivery context, the application of this principle requires collecting information about the service during the service analysis phase as during this phase; maximum information is available about the service’s functional context&lt;ref name="FuncContext"&gt;The overall purpose of the service&lt;/ref&gt; and the capabilities of the service. At this stage, the domain knowledge of the business experts could also be enlisted to document meta-data about the service. In the [[Service-oriented modeling|service-oriented design]] phase, the already gathered meta-data could be made part of the service contract.&lt;ref name='servicecontract'&gt;[http://www.whatissoa.com/p11.php Service Contract]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OASIS SOA Reference Model|OASIS SOA-RM]] standard specifies ''service description'' as an artifact that represents service meta-data.&lt;ref name='Michael Poulin'&gt;Michael Poulin. [http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/service_oriented/2009/02/evolution_of_principles_of_service_orientation_service_composability_and_discoverability_part_7.php Evolution of principles of Service Orientation: Service Composability and Discoverability, part 7]. Date accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the service meta-data accessible to interested parties, it must be centrally accessible. This could either be done by publishing the service-meta to a dedicated 'service registry'&lt;ref name='Reddy'&gt;Reddy, et al. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/36107373037136n2/fulltext.pdf Evaluating legacy assets in the context of migration to SOA]. pp 58. Date accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or by simply placing this information in a 'shared directory'.&lt;ref name='DW'&gt;Dennis Wisnosky.[http://www.soamag.com/I25/0109-2.php Principles and Patterns at the U.S. Department of Defense]. Date Accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In case of a 'service registry', the repository can also be used to include QoS, SLA and the current state of a service.&lt;ref name='VS'&gt;.Vinod Sarma, Srinivas Rao Bhagavatula. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753196.1753204&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=85839924&amp;CFTOKEN=41778190 Freeway patterns for SOA systems]. Date accessed: 28 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metadata types==

===Functional===
This is the basic type of meta-information that expresses the functional context of the service and the details about the product, content, or service’s capabilities. The application of the [[standardized service contract]] principle helps to create the basic functional meta-data in a consistent manner. The same standardization should be applied when the same meta-information is being outside the technical contract&lt;ref name='technicalcontract'&gt;[http://www.whatissoa.com/p11.php technical contract]&lt;/ref&gt; of the service e.g. when publishing information to a service registry.&lt;ref name="SvcRegistry"&gt;A repository that contains meta-data about services in a specific format e.g. classification of service, its location, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

For general items, the data that might be used to categorize them may include:
* Name of product, content or service (for audiovisual content, this would be song name, or TV show/movie title)
* Name of manufacturer, designer, creators (for audiovisual content, this would be names of director/producer/artists)
* Technical data (size, weight, height for physical items, or in the case of digital files, compression approach, file size)
* For items which can identify their location via embedded sensors (such as with [[Internet of things]] [[geolocation]] data), location of use/access)

===Quality of service===
For services, to know about the service behavior and its limitations,&lt;ref name='Jim Murphy'&gt;Jim Murphy. [http://www.soamag.com/I5/0307-2.php Essential Components of an SOA Quality Foundation]. Date accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and about the user's service experience, all of this information needs to be documented within the service registry. This way potential consumers can use this meta-information by comparing it against their performance requirements.

==Considerations==
===Services===
The effective application of this design principle requires that the meta-information recorded against each service needs to be consistent and meaningful. This is only possible if organization-wide standards exist that enforce service developers to record the required meta-data in a consistent way. The information recorded as the meta-data for the service needs to be presented in a way so that both technical and non-technical IT experts can understand the purpose and the capabilities of the service, as an evaluation of the service may be required by the business people before the service is authorized to be used.

This principle is best applied during the service-oriented analysis phase as during this time, all the details about the service’s purpose and functionality are available. Although most of the service design principles support each other in a positive manner, however, in case of [[service abstraction]] and service discoverability principle, there exists an inversely proportional relationship. This is because as more and more details about the service are hidden away from the service consumers, less discoverable information is available for discovering the service. This could be addressed by carefully recording the service meta-information so that the inner workings of the service are not documented within this meta-information.
===Algorithms===
In the online economy, sophisticated computer programs called algorithms analyse the ways that end users search for, access and use different content or products online. Thus, not only is metadata created regarding the content or product (e.g., the author and genre of an e-book), but also data is generated about specific human users' interaction with this content. If an organization such as a [[social media]] website has a user profile for a given person, indicating demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location of residence, employment status, education, etc.), then this social media website can collect and analyse information about tendencies of a given user or a given subcategory of users. When social media websites are collecting data about human users' online activities and preferences, this may raise potential privacy concerns. 

Algorithms have been called “[[black box]]es”, because the factors used by the leading  websites in their algorithms are typically proprietary information which is not released to the public. While a number of [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) firms offer the services of attempting to increase the ranking of a client’s web content or website, these SEO firms do not typically know the exact algorithms used by Google and Facebook. Ghosh et al found that algorithm "[[web crawler]]"s can only access 26% of new online content "...by recrawling a constant fraction of the entire web". &lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Anirban; Ghosh, Arpita; Kumar, Ravi; Olston, Christopher; Pandey, Sandeep; and Tomkins, Andrew. ''The Discoverability of the Web''. http://www.arpitaghosh.com/papers/discoverability.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, one concern raised with the increasing role of algorithms on search engines and databases, is that once a specific person indicates a preference for a certain type of content or product, the computer algorithm may increasingly focus on making recommendations in this type of content. To give a practical example, if a person searches for comedy movies online, a search engine algorithm may start mainly recommending comedies to this user, and not showing him or her the range of other films (e.g., drama, documentary, etc.). On the positive side, if this person only likes comedy films, then this restricted "filter" will reduce the information load of scanning through vast numbers of films. However, various cultural stakeholders have raised concerns about how these filter algorithms may restrict the diversity of material that is discoverable to users. Concerns about the dangers of "filter bubbles" have been raised in regards to online news services, which provide types of news, news sources, or topics to a user based on his/her previous online activities. Thus a person who has previously searched for Fox TV content will mainly be shown more Fox TV content and a person who has previously searched for PBS content will be shown more PBS search results, and so on. This could lead to news readers becoming only aware of a certain news source's viewpoints.

The search behaviour of video content viewers has changed a great deal since the widespread popularity of video sharing websites and video streaming. Whereas a typical TV show consumer of the 1980s would read a print edition of ''[[TV Guide]]'' to find out what shows were on, or click from channel to channel ("channel surfing") to see if any shows appealed to them, in the 2010s, video content consumers are increasingly watching on screens (either [[smart TV]]s, [[tablet computer]] screens or [[smartphone]]s) that have a computerized search function and often automated algorithm-created suggestions for the viewer. With this search function, a user can enter the name of a TV show, producer, actor, screenwriter or genre to help them find content of interest to them. If the user is searching on a search engine on a device (laptop, tablet computer, smartphone) they own, the device may transmit information about the user's preferences and previous online searches to the website. Continuing with this 1980s to 2010s comparison, in the 1980s, the type or brand of television a user was watching on did not affect his/her viewing habits. However, a person searching for TV shows in the 2010s on different brands of computerized [[smart TV]]s will probably get different search results for the same search term.

===Limitations===
For organizations that are trying to get maximal user uptake of their product, content or service online, discoverability has become an important goal. However, achieving discovery does not automatically translate into market success. For example, if the hypothetical online game "xyz" is easily discoverable, but it will not function on most mobile devices, then this video game will not perform well in the mobile game market, despite it being at the top of search results. As well, even if the product functions, that is it runs or plays properly, as well, users may not like the product. 

In the case that a user does like a certain online product or service, the discoverability has to be repeatable. If the user cannot find the product or service on a subsequent search, she or he may no longer look for this product/service, and instead shift to a substitute that is easily and reliably findable. It is not enough to make the online product or service discoverable for only a short period, unless the goal is only to create “viral” content as part of a short-term marketing campaign.

{{Buddhism}}

The English term '''''enlightenment''''' is the western translation of the abstract noun '''''bodhi''''', ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|d|i}}; [[Sanskrit]]: [[wikt:बोधि#Sanskrit|बोधि]]; [[Pali]]: ''bodhi''), the knowledge or wisdom, or awakened intellect, of a Buddha.&lt;ref name="MN_bodhi"/&gt; The verbal root ''budh-'' means "to awaken," and its literal meaning is closer to "awakening." Although its most common usage is in the context of [[Buddhism]], the term ''[[buddhi]]'' is also used in other Indian philosophies and traditions. The term "enlightenment" was popularised in the Western world through the 19th century translations of [[Max Müller]]. It has the western connotation of a sudden insight into a transcendental truth or reality.

The term is also being used to translate several other Buddhist terms and concepts, which are used to denote insight (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]'', ''[[kensho]]'' and ''[[satori]]'');{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=5051, lemma "bodhi"}} knowledge (''[[vidhya]]''); the "blowing out" (''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]]'') of disturbing emotions and desires and the subsequent freedom or release (''[[vimutti]]''); and the attainment of [[Buddhahood]], as exemplified by [[Gautama Buddha]].

What exactly constituted the Buddha's awakening is unknown. It may probably have involved the knowledge that liberation was attained by the combination of mindfulness and ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'', applied to the understanding of the arising and ceasing of craving. The relation between ''dhyana'' and insight is a core problem in the study of Buddhism, and is one of the fundamentals of Buddhist practice.

In the western world the concept of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|(spiritual) enlightenment]] has taken on a romantic meaning. It has become synonymous with [[self-realization]] and the [[true self and false self]], being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning.{{sfn|Carrette|King|2005}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

==Etymology==
''Bodhi'', [[Sanskrit]] बोधि,&lt;ref name="SDSS_bodhi"&gt;Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=bodhi&amp;direct=au ''bodhi'']&lt;/ref&gt; "awakening,"{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=50}} "perfect knowledge,"&lt;ref name="SDSS_bodhi"/&gt; "perfect knowledge or wisdom (by which a man becomes a बुद्ध [Buddha&lt;ref name="SDSS_budh"/&gt;] or जिन [''jina'', ''arahant''; "victorious," "victor"&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php ''jina'']&lt;/ref&gt;], the illuminated or enlightened intellect (of a Buddha or जिन)."&lt;ref name="MN_bodhi"&gt;Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php ''bodhi'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an [[abstract noun]], formed from the verbal root ''*budh-'',{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=50}} Sanskrit बुध,&lt;ref name="SDSS_budh"&gt;Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=budh&amp;direct=au ''budh'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW_budh"/&gt; "to awaken, to know,"{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=50}} "to wake , wake up , be awake,"&lt;ref name="MW_budh"&gt;Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php ''budh'']&lt;/ref&gt; "to recover consciousness (after a swoon),"&lt;ref name="MW_budh"/&gt; "to observe , heed , attend to."&lt;ref name="MW_budh"/&gt;

It corresponds to the verbs ''bujjhati'' (Pāli) and ''bodhati'', बोदति, "become or be aware of, perceive, learn, know, understand, awake"&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=bodhati&amp;direct=au ''bodhati'']&lt;/ref&gt;or ''budhyate'' (Sanskrit).

The feminine Sanskrit noun of ''*budh-'' is बुद्धि, ''[[buddhi]]'', "prescience, intuition, perception, point of view."&lt;ref name="SDSS_budh"/&gt;

==Translation==
Robert S. Cohen notes that the majority of English books on Buddhism use the term "enlightenment" to translate the term ''bodhi''.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=1}} The root ''budh'', from which both ''bodhi'' and ''Buddha'' are derived, means "to wake up" or "to recover consciousness".{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=1}} Cohen notes that ''bodhi'' is not the result of an ''[[Illuminationism|illumination]]'', but of a path of realization, or coming to understanding.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=1}} The term "enlightenment" is event-oriented, whereas the term "awakening" is process-oriented.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=1}} The western use of the term "enlighten" has Christian roots, as in Calvin's "It is God alone who enlightens our minds to perceive his truths".{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=2}}

Early 19th century ''bodhi'' was translated as "intelligence".{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=2}} The term "enlighten" was first being used in 1835, in an English translation of a French article,{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=2-3}} while the first recorded use of the term 'enlightenment' is credited (by the Oxford English Dictionary) to the ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' (February, 1836). In 1857 ''The Times'' used the term "the Enlightened" for the Buddha in a short article, which was reprinted the following year by [[Max Müller]].{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=3}} Thereafter, the use of the term subsided, but reappeared with the publication of Max Müller's ''Chips from a german Workshop'', which included a reprint from the ''Times''-article. The book was translated in 1969 into German, using the term "der Erleuchtete".{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=9}} Max Müller was an [[Perennial philosophy|essentialist]], who believed in a [[natural religion]], and saw religion as an inherent capacity of human beings.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=4}} "Enlightenment" was a means to capture natural religious truths, as distinguished from mere mythology.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=6-7}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://www.here-now4u.de/eng/theosophy_or_pantheism__friedr.htm Lourens Peter van den Bosch, ''Theosophy or Pantheism? Friedrich Max Müller's Gifford Lectures on Natural Religion'']: "The three principal themes of his Gifford lectures on natural religion were the discovery of God, the discovery of the soul, and the discovery of the oneness of God and soul in the great religions of the world."}}

By the mid-1870s it had become commonplace to call the Buddha "enlightened", and by the end of the 1880s the terms "enlightened" and "enlightenment" dominated the English literature.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=3}}

==Related terms==

===Insight===

====Bodhi====
''[[Bodhi]]'' (Sanskrit, Pāli), from the verbal root ''budd'', "to awaken", "to understand",{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=40}} means literally "to have woken up and understood".{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} According to [[Johannes Bronkhorst]],{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} Tillman Vetter,{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} and K.R. Norman,{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}} ''bodhi'' was at first not specified. K.R. Norman:
{{quote|It is not at all clear what gaining ''bodhi'' means. We are accustomed to the translation "enlightenment" for ''bodhi'', but this is misleading ... It is not clear what the buddha was awakened to, or at what particular point the awakening came.&lt;ref name="Norman2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norman|first=K. R.|title=Buddhist Forum Volume V: Philological Approach to Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYyRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-75154-8|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}}--&gt;

According to Norman, ''bodhi'' may basically have meant the knowledge that ''nibbana'' was attained,{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=30}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxix, xxxi}} due to the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Originally only "prajna" may have been mentioned,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} and Tillman Vetter even concludes that originally dhyana itself was deemed liberating, with the stilling of pleasure of pain in the fourth jhana, not the gaining of some perfect wisdom or insight.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Gombrich also argues that the emphasis on insight is a later development.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}

In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, ''bodhi'' refers to the realisation of the [[four stages of enlightenment]] and becoming an  [[Arahant]].{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} In Theravada Buddhism, ''bodhi'' is equal to supreme insight, and the realisation of the four noble truths, which leads to deliverance.{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} According to Nyanatiloka,
{{quote|(Through Bodhi) one awakens from the slumber or stupor (inflicted upon the mind) by the defilements (''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kilesa]]'', q.v.) and comprehends the [[Four Noble Truths]] (''[[sacca]]'', q.v.)''.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=40}}}}

This equation of ''bodhi'' with the four noble truths is a later development, in response to developments within Indian religious thought, where "liberating insight" was deemed essential for [[Moksha|liberation]].{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} The four noble truths as the liberating insight of the Buddha eventually were superseded by [[Pratītyasamutpāda]], the twelvefold chain of causation, and still later by anatta, the emptiness of the self.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}

In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, ''bodhi'' is equal to ''prajna'', insight into the [[Buddha-nature]], [[sunyata]] and [[tathatā]].{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=51}} This is equal to the realisation of the non-duality of [[Two truths doctrine|absolute and relative]].{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=51}}

====Prajna====
In Theravada Buddhism ''pannā'' (Pali) means "understanding", "wisdom", "insight".{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=150}} "Insight" is equivalent to ''[[vipassana]]''', insight into the three marks of existence, namely ''[[anicca]]'', ''[[dukkha]]'' and ''[[anatta]]''.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=150}} Insight leads to the four stages of enlightenment and Nirvana.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=150}}

In Mahayana Buddhism [[Wisdom in Buddhism|Prajna]] (Sanskrit) means "insight" or "wisdom", and entails insight into ''sunyata''. The attainment of this insight is often seen as the attainment of  "enlightenment".{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=281}}{{Request quotation|date=January 2015}}

====Kensho and satori====
''[[Kensho]]'' and ''[[Satori]]'' are Japanese terms used in [[Zen]] traditions. ''Kensho'' means "seeing into one's true nature." ''Ken'' means "seeing", ''sho'' means "nature", "essence",{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}} c.q Buddha-nature. ''Satori'' (Japanese) is often used interchangeably with kensho, but refers to the ''experience'' of kensho.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}} The [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] tradition sees ''kensho'' as essential to the attainment of [[Buddhahood]], but considers [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|further practice]] essential to attain Buddhahood.

East-Asian (Chinese) Buddhism emphasizes insight into Buddha-nature. This term is derived from Indian tathagata-garbha thought, "the womb of the thus-gone" (the Buddha), the inherent potential of every sentient being to become a Buddha. This idea was integrated with the Yogacara-idea of the ''ālaya vijñāna'', and further developed in Chinese Buddhism, which integrated Indian Buddhism with native Chinese thought. Buddha-nature came to mean both the potential of awakening ''and'' the whole of reality, a dynamic interpenetration of absolute and relative. In this awakening it is realized that observer and observed are not distinct entities, but mutually co-dependent.{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998}}{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

===Knowledge===
The term ''vidhya'' is being used in contrast to ''[[avidhya]]'', ignorance or the lack of knowledge, which binds us to [[samsara]]. The ''Mahasaccaka Sutta''{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya chapter 36}} describes the three knowledges which the Buddha attained:{{sfn|Bikkhu Nanamoli|1995|p=340-342}}{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=47–48}}{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=27}}
# Insight into his past lives
# Insight into the workings of [[Karma]] and [[Reincarnation]]
# Insight into the [[Four Noble Truths]]

According to Bronkhorst, the first two knowledges are later additions, while insight into the four truths represents a later development, in response to concurring religious traditions, in which "liberating insight" came to be stressed over the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}

===Freedom===
Vimutti, also called moksha, means "freedom",{{sfn|Bowker|1997}} "release",{{sfn|Bowker|1997}}{{refn|group=note|See [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O101-Vimutti.html Encyclopedia.com, ''Vimutti'']}} "deliverance".{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=239}} Sometimes a distinction is being made between ''ceto-vimutti'', "liberation of the mind", and ''panna-vimutti'', "liberation by understanding".{{sfn|Gombrich|2005|p=147}} The Buddhist tradition recognises two kinds of ''ceto-vimutti'', one temporarily and one permanent, the last being equivalent to ''panna-vimutti''.{{sfn|Gombrich|2005|p=147}}{{refn|group=note|According to Gombrich, this distinction is artificial, and due to later, too literal, interpretations of the suttas.{{sfn|Gombrich|2005|p=147-148}}}}

[[Yogacara]] uses the term ''āśraya parāvŗtti'', "revolution of the basis",{{sfn|Park|1983|p=126-132}} 
{{quote|... a sudden revulsion, turning, or re-turning of the [[Eight Consciousnesses#Ālayavijñāna|ālaya vijñāna]] back into its original state of purity [...] the Mind returns to its original condition of non-attachment, non-discrimination and non-duality".{{sfn|Park|1983|p=127}}}}

===Nirvana===
Nirvana is the "blowing out" of disturbing emotions, which is the same as liberation.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin"&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/sutra/level2_lamrim/intermediate_scope/nirvana_enlightenment/transcript.html Dr. Alexander Berzin, ''Nirvana and enlightenment'']&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the term "enlightenment" to translate "nirvana" was popularized in the 19th century, due, in part, to the efforts of Max Muller, who used the term consistently in his translations.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=8}}

==Buddha's awakening==

===Buddhahood===
[[Buddhahood#The 3 Types of Buddhahood|Three types of buddha]] are recognized:{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}} 
* [[Arhat (Buddhism)|Arhat]] ([[Pali]]: ''arahant''), those who reach Nirvana by following the teachings of the Buddha.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}} Sometimes the term [[Savakabuddha|Śrāvakabuddha]] (Pali: ''sāvakabuddha'') is used to designate this kind of awakened person{{citation needed|date=December 2011}};
* [[Pratyekabuddha]]s (Pali: ''paccekabuddha''), those who reach Nirvana through self-realisation, without the aid of spiritual guides and teachers, but don't teach the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]];{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}}
* Samyaksambuddha (Pali: ''samma sambuddha''), often simply referred to as ''Buddha'', one who has reached Nirvana by his own efforts and wisdom and teaches it skillfully to others.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}}

[[Siddhartha Gautama]], known as the Buddha, is said to have achieved full awakening, known as ''samyaksaṃbodhi'' (Sanskrit; Pāli: ''sammāsaṃbodhi''), "perfect Buddhahood", or ''anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi'', "highest perfect awakening".{{sfn|Mäll|2005|p=83}}

The term buddha has acquired somewhat [[Buddhology|different meanings]] in the various Buddhist traditions. An equivalent term for [[Buddha]] is [[Tathāgata]], "the thus-gone". The [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|way to Buddhahood]] is somewhat differently understood in the various buddhist traditions.

===The awakening of the Buddha===

====Canonical accounts====
In the [[suttapitaka]], the Buddhist canon as preserved in the [[Theravada]] tradition, a couple of texts can be found in which the Buddha's attainment of liberation forms part of the narrative.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=45-50}}&lt;ref name="faure_1991"&gt;{{harvcolnb|Faure|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See Majjhima Nikaya chapter 4, 12, 26 &amp; 36}}

The ''Ariyapariyesana Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 26) describes how the Buddha was dissatisfied with the teachings of [[Alara Kalama]] and [[Uddaka Ramaputta]], wandered further through Magadhan country, and then found "an agreeable piece of ground" which served for striving. The sutra then only says that he attained Nibbana.{{sfn|Bikkhu Nanamoli|1995|p=259}}

In the ''Vanapattha Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 17){{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli|1995}} the Buddha describes life in the jungle, and the attainment of awakening. The ''Mahasaccaka Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 36) describes his ascetic practices, which he abandoned. There-after he remembered a spontaneous state of jhana, and set out for jhana-practice. Both suttras narrate how, after destroying the [[Sankhara|disturbances of the mind]], and attaining [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|concentration of the mind]], he attained three knowledges (vidhya):{{sfn|Bikkhu Nanamoli|1995|p=340-342}}{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=47–48}}{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=27}}
# Insight into his past lives
# Insight into the workings of [[Karma]] and [[Reincarnation]]
# Insight into the [[Four Noble Truths]]

Insight into the [[Four Noble Truths]] is here called awakening.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=47-48}} The monk (''[[bhikkhu]]'') has {{quote|...attained the unattained supreme security from bondage.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli|1996|p=199}}}}

Awakening is also described as synonymous with [[Nirvana]], the extinction of the passions whereby suffering is ended and no more rebirths take place.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=49}} The insight arises that this liberation is certain:
{{quote|Knowledge arose in me, and insight: my freedom is certain, this is my last birth, now there is no rebirth.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=49}}}}

====Critical assessment====
Schmithausen{{refn|group=note|In his often-cited article ''On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of 'Liberating Insight' and 'Enlightenment' in Early Buddhism''}} notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Bronkhorst notices that 
{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}

It calls in question the reliability of these accounts, and the relation between ''dhyana'' and insight, which is a core problem in the study of early Buddhism.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} Originally the term ''prajna'' may have been used, which came to be replaced by the four truths in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhanas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}} Bronkhorst also notices that the conception of what exactly this "liberating insight" was developed throughout time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified, later on the four truths served as such, to be superseded by ''pratityasamutpada'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}} And Schmithausen notices that still other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon: 
{{quote|"that the five Skandhas are impermanent, disagreeable, and neither the Self nor belonging to oneself";{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26}} "the contemplation of the arising and disappearance (''udayabbaya'') of the five Skandhas";{{refn|group=note|Anguttara Nikaya II.45 (PTS)}} "the realisation of the Skandhas as empty (''rittaka''), vain (''tucchaka'') and without any pith or substance (''asaraka'').{{refn|group=note|Samyutta Nikaya III.140-142 (PTS)}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}}}

An example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42-43, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=102-103}}

==Understanding of ''bodhi'' and Buddhahood in Buddhism==
The term bodhi acquired a variety of meanings and connotations during the development of Buddhist thoughts in the various schools.

===Early Buddhism===
{{Main|Early Buddhism}}

In early Buddhism, ''bodhi'' carried a meaning synonymous to ''[[nirvana]]'', using only some different metaphors to describe the insight, which implied the extinction of ''[[lobha]]'' (greed), ''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|dosa]]'' (hate) and ''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'' (delusion). 

===Theravada===
{{See also|Dhyāna in Buddhism#Contemporary reassessment - the "Jhana wars"|l1=Non-reactive and lucid awareness}}

In [[Theravada Buddhism]], bodhi and nirvana carry the same meaning, that of being freed from greed, hate and delusion. In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, ''bodhi'' refers to the realisation of the [[four stages of enlightenment]] and becoming an  [[Arahant]].{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} In Theravada Buddhism, ''bodhi'' is equal to supreme insight, the realisation of the four noble truths, which leads to deliverance.{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} Reaching full awakening is equivalent in meaning to reaching [[Nirvāṇa]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma6/enlightnirvana.html Kusala Bhikshu (3/2008), ''Buddhist Enlightenment vs Nirvana'']{{As of|2010|09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attaining Nirvāṇa is the ultimate goal of Theravada and other śrāvaka traditions.&lt;ref group=web&gt;"[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/26715.htm David Loy (2010), ''Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?'']{{As of|2010|09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the abandonment of the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|ten fetters]] and the cessation of dukkha or suffering. Full awakening is reached in four stages. According to Nyanatiloka,
{{quote|(Through Bodhi) one awakens from the slumber or stupor (inflicted upon the mind) by the defilements (''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kilesa]]'', q.v.) and comprehends the [[Four Noble Truths]] (''[[sacca]]'', q.v.)''.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=40}}}}

Since the 1980s, western Theravada-oriented teachers have started to question the primacy of insight. According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], ''jhana'' and ''vipassana'' (insight) form an integrated practice.{{sfn|Quli|2008}} Polak and Arbel, following scholars like Vetter and Bronkhorst, argue that [[right effort]], c.q. the [[Four Right Exertions|four right efforts]] (sense restraint, preventing the arising of [[Five hindrances|unwholesome states]], and the generation of [[Seven factors of awakening|wholesome states]]), mindfulness, and ''[[Dhyana in Buddhism|dhyana]]'' form an integrated practice, in which ''dhyana'' is the actualisation of insight, leading to an awakened awareness which is "non-reactive and lucid."{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}}

===Mahayana===
{{Main|Mahayana}}

In Mahayana-thought, bodhi is the realisation of the inseparability of [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]],{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=51}} and the unity of subject and object.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=51}} It is similar to [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], to [[kensho|realizing the Buddha-nature]], realizing [[sunyata]] and realizing [[suchness]].{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=51}} In time, the Buddha's awakening came to be understood as an immediate full awakening and liberation, instead of the insight into and certainty about the way to follow to reach enlightenment. However, in some Zen traditions this perfection came to be relativized again; according to one contemporary Zen master, "Shakyamuni buddha and Bodhidharma are still practicing."{{sfn|Harris|p=103|2004}}

Mahayana discerns three forms of awakened beings:{{sfn|Schreiber|2008|p=51}}
# [[Arahat]] – Liberation for oneself;{{refn|group=note|This also includes [[Pratyekabuddha]], but is not being mentioned by Fischer-Schreiber et al.}}
# [[Bodhisattva]] – Liberation for living beings;
# [[Buddhahood|Full Buddhahood]].

Within the various Mahayana-schools exist various further explanations and interpretations.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=51}} In [[Mahāyāna]] Buddhism the [[Bodhisattva]] is the ideal. The ultimate goal is not only of one's own liberation in Buddhahood, but the liberation of all living beings. But Mahayana Buddhism also developed a cosmology with a wide range of buddhas and bodhisattvas, who assist humans on their way to liberation.

[[Nichiren Buddhism]] regards Buddhahood as a state of perfect freedom, in which one is awakened to the eternal and ultimate truth that is the reality of all things. This supreme state of life is characterized by boundless wisdom and infinite compassion. The Lotus Sutra reveals that Buddhahood is a potential in the lives of all beings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/G/66|title=Buddhahood – Dictionary of Buddhism – Nichiren Buddhism Library|website=www.nichirenlibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddha-nature====
In the [[Tathagatagarbha]] and [[Buddha-nature]] doctrines bodhi becomes equivalent to the universal, natural and pure state of the mind:
{{quote|''Bodhi'' is the final goal of a Bodhisattva's career [...] ''Bodhi'' is pure universal and immediate knowledge, which extends over all time, all universes, all beings and elements, conditioned and unconditioned. It is absolute and identical with Reality and thus it is [[Tathata]]. ''Bodhi'' is immaculate and non-conceptual, and it, being not an outer object, cannot be understood by discursive thought. It has neither beginning, nor middle nor end and it is indivisible. It is non-dual (''advayam'') [...] The only possible way to comprehend it is through [[samadhi]] by the yogin.{{sfn|Sebastian|2005|p=274}}}}

According to these doctrines bodhi is always there within one's mind, but requires the defilements to be removed. This vision is expounded in texts such as the [[Shurangama Sutra]] and the [[Uttaratantra]].

In [[Shingon]] Buddhism, the state of Bodhi is also seen as naturally inherent in the mind. It is the mind's natural and pure state, where no distinction is being made between a perceiving subject and perceived objects. This is also the understanding of Bodhi found in [[Yogacara]] Buddhism.

To achieve this vision of non-duality, it is necessary to recognise one's own mind:
{{quote|... it means that you are to know the inherent natural state of the mind by eliminating the split into a perceiving subject and perceived objects which normally occurs in the world and is wrongly thought to be real. This also corresponds to the Yogacara definition&amp;nbsp;... that emptiness (''sunyata'') is the absence of this imaginary split{{sfn|Hodge|2003|p=31-32}}}}

====Harmonisation of the various terms and meanings====
During the development of Mahayana Buddhism the various strands of thought on Bodhi were continuously being elaborated. Attempts were made to harmonize the various terms. The Buddhist commentator [[Buddhaguhya]] treats various terms as synonyms:
{{quote|For example, he defines emptiness (''sunyata'') as suchness (''tathata'') and says that suchness is the intrinsic nature (''svabhava'') of the mind which is Enlightenment (''[[Bodhicitta|bodhi-citta]]''). Moreover, he frequently uses the terms suchness (''tathata'') and Suchness-Awareness (''tathata-jnana'') interchangeably. But since Awareness (''jnana'') is non-dual, Suchness-Awareness is not so much the Awareness of Suchness, but the Awareness which ''is'' Suchness. In other words, the term Suchness-Awareness is functionally equivalent to Enlightenment. Finally, it must not be forgotten that this Suchness-Awareness or Perfect Enlightenment ''is'' Mahavairocana [the Primal Buddha, uncreated and forever existent]. In other words, the mind in its intrinsic nature is Mahavairocana, whom one "becomes" (or vice versa) when one is perfectly enlightened.{{sfn|Hodge|2003|p=31-32}}}}

==Western understanding of enlightenment==
{{See also|Buddhist modernism|Transcendentalism|Perennial philosophy}}

In the western world the concept of ''enlightenment'' has taken on a romantic meaning.{{sfn|Carrette|King|2005}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} It has become synonymous with [[self-realization]] and the [[True self and false self|true self]], being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning.{{sfn|Carrette|King|2005}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}

===Enlightenment as "Aufklärung"===
The use of the western word ''enlightenment'' is based on the supposed resemblance of ''bodhi'' with ''[[Age of Enlightenment|Aufklärung]]'', the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world. In fact there are more resemblances with [[Romanticism]] than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=181-183}}

===Awakening===
The equivalent term "awakening" has also been used in a Christian context, namely the [[Great Awakening]]s, several periods of [[Christian revival|religious revival]] in [[Religion in the United States|American religious history]]. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these "Great Awakenings" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.

===Romanticism and transcendentalism===
The romantic idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized especially by [[D.T. Suzuki]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/whose%20zen_sharf.pdf Robert H. Sharf, ''Whose Zen? Zen Nationalism Revisited'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Chan_in_China.html Hu Shih: Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism in China. Its History and Method]&lt;/ref&gt; Further popularization was due to the writings of [[Heinrich Dumoulin]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/McRaeIntroduction.pdf Critical introduction by John McRae to the reprint of Dumoulin's ''A history of Zen'']&lt;/ref&gt; Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the expression of a transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes anatta.{{sfn|Dumonlin|2000}} This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of [[Ken Wilber]].{{sfn|Wilber|1996}}

In the oldest Buddhism this essentialism is not recognizable.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=116-124}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/nlarc/Pruning_the_bodhi_tree.htm Nanzan Institute: Pruning the bodhi Tree]&lt;/ref&gt; According to critics it doesn't really contribute to a real insight into Buddhism:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://meaningness.wordpress.com/2011/08/12/effing-the-ineffable/ David Chapman: Effing the ineffable]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...most of them labour under the old cliché that the goal of Buddhist psychological analysis is to reveal the hidden mysteries in the human mind and thereby facilitate the development of a transcendental state of consciousness beyond the reach of linguistic expression.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992a|p=xi}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Enlightenment and experience===
A common reference in western culture is the notion of "enlightenment ''experience''". This notion can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768-1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. Schleiermacher used the notion of "religious experience" to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique.

It was popularised by the [[Transcendentalists]], and exported to Asia via missionaries.{{sfn|King|2002}} Transcendentalism developed as a reaction against 18th Century rationalism, [[John Locke]]'s philosophy of [[Sensualism]], and the predestinationism of New England [[Calvinism]]. It is fundamentally a variety of diverse sources such as Hindu texts like the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]],{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}} various religions, and [[German idealism]].{{sfn|Hart|1995}}

It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for western interpretations and expectations regarding "enlightenment", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protetstant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion.{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196-197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}

The notion of "experience" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}} Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience "altered states" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference point for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the "path".{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C|p=1}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The notion of "experience" introduces a false notion of duality between "experiencer" and "experienced", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the "[[non-duality]]" of observer and observed.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}}{{dead link|date=May 2014}} {{sfn|Samy|1998|p=82}} "Pure experience" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80-82}} The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what "experience" someone has, which means that this "experience" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by "cleaning the doors of perception" as per romantic poet [[William Blake]]{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thru' narrow chinks of his cavern."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2653 Quote DB]&lt;/ref&gt;}}, would, according to Mohr, be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=284}}

==Bodhi Day==
Sakyamuni's Buddhahood is celebrated on [[Bodhi Day]]. In Sri Lanka and Japan different days are used for this celebration.

According to the Theravada tradition in Sri Lanka, Sakyamuni reached Buddhahood at the [[full moon]] in May. This is celebrated at [[Poya|Wesak Poya]], the full moon in May, as [[Sambuddhatva jayanthi]] (also known as Sambuddha jayanthi).&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://dedunu.wordpress.com/2008/06/12/vesak-full-moon-poya-day/ Vesak full moon poya day]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Zen tradition, the Buddha reached his decisive insight on 8 December. This is celebrated in Zen monasteries with a very intensive eight-day session of [[Bodhi Day#Rohatsu|''Rōhatsu'']].

'''Extelligence''' is a term coined by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] in their 1997 book ''[[Figments of Reality]]''. They define it as the [[cultural capital]] that is available to us in the form of external media (e.g. tribal [[legend]]s, [[folklore]], [[nursery rhyme]]s, [[book]]s, [[videotape]]s, [[CD-ROM]]s, etc.)

They contrast extelligence with [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], or the [[knowledge]] and cognitive processes within the [[brain]]. Furthermore, they regard the ‘complicity’ of extelligence and intelligence as fundamental to the development of [[consciousness]] in [[evolutionary]] terms for both the [[species]] and the [[individual]]. ‘Complicity’ is a combination of complexity and simplicity, and Cohen and Stewart use it to express the interdependent relationship between knowledge-inside-one's-[[head]] and knowledge-outside-one's-head that can be readily accessed.

Although Cohen's and Stewart's respective disciplines are [[biology]] and [[mathematics]], their description of the complicity of intelligence and extelligence is in the tradition of [[Jean Piaget]], Belinda Dewar and [[David A. Kolb]]. Philosophers, notably [[Karl Popper|Popper]], have also considered the relation between subjective knowledge (which he calls world 2), objective knowledge (world 1) and the knowledge represented by man-made artifacts (world 3).

One of Cohen and Stewart's contributions is the way they relate, through the idea of complicity, the individual to the sum of human knowledge. From the mathematics of [[complexity]] and [[game theory]], they use the idea of [[phase space]] and talk about extelligence space. There is a total phase space (intelligence space) for the human race, which consists of everything that can be known and represented. Within this there is a smaller set of what is known at any given time. Cohen and Stewart propose the idea that each individual can access the parts of the extelligence space with which their intelligence is complicit.

In other words, there has to be, at some level, an appreciation of what is out there and what it means. Much of this ‘appreciation’ falls into the category of [[tacit knowledge]]&lt;ref&gt;(Polanyi 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; and social and cultural learning.&lt;ref&gt;(Lave and Wenger 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, a [[dictionary]] may contain definitions of many [[word]]s. But only those definitions that can be understood by the reader.

In engineering, a '''factor of safety''' ('''FoS'''), also known as (and used interchangeably with) '''safety factor''' ('''SF'''), expresses how much stronger a system is than it needs to be for an intended load. Safety factors are often calculated using detailed analysis because comprehensive testing is impractical on many projects, such as bridges and buildings, but the structure's ability to carry a load must be determined to a reasonable accuracy.

Many systems are intentionally built much stronger than needed for normal usage to allow for emergency situations, unexpected loads, misuse, or degradation ([[reliability engineering|reliability]]).

== Definition ==
There are two definitions for the factor of safety:  

#The ratio of a structure's absolute strength (structural capability) to actual applied load; this is a measure of the [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of a particular design. This a calculated value, and is sometimes referred to, for the sake of clarity, as a ''realized factor of safety''.
#A constant required value, imposed by [[law]], [[Technical standard|standard]], [[specification]], [[contract]] or [[Convention (norm)|custom]], to which a structure must conform or exceed. This can be referred to as a ''design factor'', ''design factor of safety'' or ''required factor of safety''.

The realized factor of safety must be greater than the required ''design factor of safety''. However, between various industries and engineering groups usage is inconsistent and confusing; it is important to be aware of which definition(s) are being used. The cause of much confusion is that various reference books and standards agencies use the factor of safety definitions and terms differently. Design codes and [[structural engineering|structural]] and [[mechanical engineering]] textbooks often use "Factor of Safety" to mean the fraction of total structural capability over that needed and are ''realized factor of safety''&lt;ref&gt;Young, W.: ''Roark's Formulas for Stress and Strain'', 6th edition. McGraw-Hill, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shigley, J and Mischke, C: ''Standard Handbook of Machine Design'', page 2-15. McGraw-Hill, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASME BTH-1: ''Design of Below-the-Hook Lifting Devices'', Section 1-5, ASME, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; (first use). Many undergraduate [[Strength of Materials]] books use "Factor of Safety" as a constant value intended as a minimum target for design&lt;ref&gt;Beer, F and Johnson, R: ''Mechanics of Materials'', second edition. McGraw-Hill,1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timoshenko, S: ''Strength of Materials'', Volume 1. Krieger, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, G: ''Mechanics of Materials'', Page 55. Holt, Reinhart, and Watson,1988.&lt;/ref&gt; (second use).

== Calculation ==
There are several ways to compare the factor of safety for structures. All the different calculations fundamentally measure the same thing: how much extra load beyond what is intended a structure will actually take (or be required to withstand). The difference between the methods is the way in which the values are calculated and compared. Safety factor values can be thought of as a standardized way for comparing strength and reliability between systems.

The use of a factor of safety does not imply that an item, structure, or design is "safe".  Many [[quality assurance]], [[engineering design]], [[manufacturing]], installation, and end-use factors may influence whether or not something is safe in any particular situation.

=== Design factor and safety factor ===

The difference
between the safety factor and design factor (design safety factor) is as follows: The safety factor, or yield stress, is how much the designed part actually will be able to withstand (first "use" from above). The design factor, or working stress, is what the item is required to be able to withstand (second "use"). The design factor is defined for an application (generally provided in advance and often set by regulatory code or policy) and is not an actual calculation, the safety factor is a ratio of maximum strength to intended load for the actual item that was designed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Factor of Safety}=\frac{\text{yield stress}}{\text{working stress}}&lt;/math&gt;
*Design load being the maximum load the part should ever see in service.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By this definition, a structure with a FOS of exactly 1 will support only the design load and no more. Any additional load will cause the structure to fail. A structure with a FOS of 2 will fail at twice the design load.

=== Margin of safety ===

Many government agencies and industries (such as aerospace) require the use of a '''margin of safety''' ('''MoS''' or '''M.S.''') to describe the ratio of the strength of the structure to the requirements. There are two separate definitions for the margin of safety so care is needed to determine which is being used for a given application.  One usage of M.S. is as a measure of capability like FoS.  The other usage of M.S. is as a measure of satisfying design requirements (requirement verification).  Margin of safety can be conceptualized (along with the reserve factor explained below) to represent how much of the structure's total capability is held "in reserve" during loading.

'''M.S. as a measure of structural capability:''' This definition of margin of safety commonly seen in textbooks&lt;ref&gt;Burr, A and Cheatham, J: ''Mechanical Design and Analysis'', 2nd edition, section 5.2. Prentice-Hall, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juvinall, R: ''Stress, Strain, and Strength'',  section 14.13, Page 295. McGraw-Hill, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; basically says that if the part is loaded to the maximum load it should ever see in service, how many more loads of the same force can it withstand before failing. In effect, this is a measure of excess capability. If the margin is 0, the part will not take any additional load before it fails, if it is negative the part will fail before reaching its design load in service. If the margin is 1, it can withstand one additional load of equal force to the maximum load it was designed to support (i.e. twice the design load).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Margin of Safety}=\frac{\text{Failure Load}}{\text{Design Load}}-1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Margin of Safety}={\text{Factor of Safety}}-1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''M.S. as a measure of requirement verification:'''  Many agencies and organizations such as [[NASA]]&lt;ref&gt;NASA-STD-5001: ''Structural Design and Test Factors for Spaceflight Hardware'', section 3. NASA, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AIAA]]&lt;ref&gt;AIAA S-110: ''Space Systems - Structures, Structural Components, and Structural Assemblies'', section 4.2. AIAA, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; define the margin of safety including the design factor, in other words, the margin of safety is calculated after applying the design factor. In the case of a margin of 0, the part is at exactly the '''required''' strength (the safety factor would equal the design factor). If there is a part with a required design factor of 3 and a margin of 1, the part would have a safety factor of 6 (capable of supporting two loads equal to its design factor of 3, supporting six times the design load before failure). A margin of 0 would mean the part would pass with a safety factor of 3. If the margin is less than 0 in this definition, although the part will not necessarily fail, the design requirement has not been met. A convenience of this usage is that for all applications, a margin of 0 or higher is passing, one does not need to know application details or compare against requirements, just glancing at the margin calculation tells whether the design passes or not. This is helpful for oversight and reviewing on projects with various integrated components, as different components may have various design factors involved and the margin calculation helps prevent confusion.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Design Safety Factor  = [Provided as requirement]
&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Margin of Safety}=\frac{\text{Failure Load}}{\text{Design Load × Design Safety Factor}}-1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Margin of Safety}=\frac{\text{Realized Factor of Safety}}{\text{Design Safety Factor}}-1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For a successful design, the Realized Safety Factor must always equal or exceed the Design Safety Factor so the Margin of Safety is greater than or equal to zero.  The Margin of Safety is sometimes, but infrequently, used as a percentage, i.e., a 0.50 M.S is equivalent to a 50% M.S.  When a design satisfies this test it is said to have a "positive margin," and, conversely, a “negative margin” when it does not.

In the field of Nuclear Safety (as implemented at U.S. government owned facilities) the Margin of Safety has been defined as a quantity that may not be reduced without review by the controlling government office. The U.S. Department of Energy publishes DOE G 424.1-1, "Implementation Guide for Use in Addressing Unreviewed Safety Question Requirements" as a guide for determining how to identify and determine whether a margin of safety will be reduced by a proposed change.  The guide develops and applies the concept of a qualitative margin of safety that may not be explicit or quantifiable, yet can be evaluated conceptually to determine whether an increase or decrease will occur with a proposed change. This approach becomes important when examining designs with large or undefined (historical) margins and those that depend on 'soft' controls such as programmatic limits or requirements. The commercial U.S. nuclear industry utilized a similar concept in evaluating planned changes until 2001, when 10 CFR 50.59 was revised to capture and apply the information available in facility-specific risk analyses and other quantitative risk management tools.

=== Reserve factor ===

A measure of strength frequently used in Europe is the '''Reserve Factor (RF)'''.  With the strength and applied loads expressed in the same units, the Reserve Factor is defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
RF = Proof Strength / Proof Load
&lt;br/&gt;
RF = Ultimate Strength / Ultimate Load
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The applied loads have any factors, including factors of safety applied.

== Yield and ultimate calculations ==

For ductile materials (e.g. most metals), it is often required that the factor of safety be checked against both [[yield strength|yield]] and [[ultimate strength|ultimate]] strengths. The yield calculation will determine the safety factor until the part starts to [[Plastic deformation|plastically deform]]. The ultimate calculation will determine the safety factor until failure. On brittle materials these values are often so close as to be indistinguishable, so is it usually acceptable to only calculate the ultimate safety factor.

== Choosing design factors ==

Appropriate design factors are based on several considerations, such as the [[accuracy]] of predictions on the imposed [[Structural load|loads]], strength, [[wear]] estimates, and the [[Environment (systems)|environmental]] effects to which the product will be exposed in service; the consequences of engineering failure; and the cost of over-engineering the component to achieve that factor of safety. For example, components whose [[failure]] could result in substantial financial loss, serious injury, or death may use a safety factor of four or higher (often ten).  Non-critical components generally might have a design factor of two. [[Risk analysis (engineering)|Risk analysis]], [[failure mode and effects analysis]], and other tools are commonly used. Design factors for specific applications are often mandated by law, policy, or industry standards.

Buildings commonly use a factor of safety of 2.0 for each structural member.  The value for buildings is relatively low because the loads are well understood and most structures are [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant]]. [[Pressure vessel]]s use 3.5 to 4.0, automobiles use 3.0, and aircraft and spacecraft use 1.2 to 3.0 depending on the application and materials.  [[Ductility|Ductile]], metallic materials tend to use the lower value while [[brittle]] materials use the higher values.  The field of [[aerospace engineering]] uses generally lower design factors because the costs associated with structural weight are high (i.e. an aircraft with an overall safety factor of 5 would probably be too heavy to get off the ground). This low design factor is why aerospace parts and materials are subject to very stringent [[quality control]] and strict preventative maintenance schedules to help ensure reliability. A usually applied Safety Factor is 1.5, but for pressurized fuselage it is 2.0, and for main landing gear structures it is often 1.25.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, A and Cheatham, J: Mechanical Design and Analysis, 2nd edition, section 5.2. Prentice-Hall, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases it is impractical or impossible for a part to meet the "standard" design factor. The penalties (mass or otherwise) for meeting the requirement would prevent the system from being viable (such as in the case of aircraft or spacecraft). In these cases, it is sometimes determined to allow a component to meet a lower than normal safety factor, often referred to as "waiving" the requirement. Doing this often brings with it extra detailed analysis or quality control verifications to assure the part will perform as desired, as it will be loaded closer to its limits.

For loading that is cyclical, repetitive, or fluctuating, it is important to consider the possibility of [[metal fatigue]] when choosing factor of safety.  A cyclic load well below a material's yield strength can cause failure if it is repeated through enough cycles.

In physics, the '''field effect''' refers to the modulation of the [[electrical conductivity]] of a material by the application of an external [[electric field]].

In a [[metal]], the electron density that responds to applied fields is so large that an external electric field can penetrate only a very short distance into the material. However, in a [[semiconductor]] the lower density of [[electron]]s (and possibly [[Electron hole|hole]]s) that can respond to an applied field is sufficiently small that the field can penetrate quite far into the material. This field penetration alters the conductivity of the semiconductor near its surface, and is called the ''field effect''. The field effect underlies the operation of the [[Schottky diode]] and of [[field-effect transistor]]s, notably the [[MOSFET]], the [[JFET]] and the [[MESFET]].&lt;ref name=Acronyms&gt;The acronyms stand for ''M''etal ''O''xide ''S''emiconductor ''F''ield ''E''ffect ''T''ransistor, ''J''unction ''F''ield ''E''ffect ''T''ransistor, and ''ME''tal ''S''emiconductor ''F''ield ''E''ffect ''T''ransistor. For a discussion see, for example, {{cite book |title=Fundamentals of semiconductor devices |author=M K Achuthan K N Bhat |year=2007 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill |isbn=007061220X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REQkwBF4cVoC&amp;pg=PA475 |pages=475 ''ff'' |chapter=Chapter 10: Metal semiconductor contacts: Metal semiconductor and junction field effect transistors}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Surface conductance and band bending==
The change in surface conductance occurs because the applied field alters the energy levels available to electrons to considerable depths from the surface, and that in turn changes the occupancy of the energy levels in the surface region. A typical treatment of such effects is based upon a [[Band bending|''band-bending diagram'']] showing the positions in energy of the ''band edges'' as a function of depth into the material. 

An example band-bending diagram is shown in the figure. For convenience, energy is expressed in [[Electronvolt|eV]] and voltage is expressed in volts, avoiding the need for a factor ''q'' for the [[elementary charge]]. In the figure, a two-layer structure is shown, consisting of an [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]] as left-hand layer and a semiconductor as right-hand layer. An example of such a structure is the ''[[MOS capacitor]]'', a two-terminal structure made up of a metal ''gate'' contact, a semiconductor ''body''  (such as silicon) with a body contact, and an intervening insulating layer (such as [[silicon dioxide]], hence the designation ''O''). The left panels show the lowest energy level of the conduction band and the highest energy level of the valence band. These levels are "bent" by the application of a positive voltage ''V''. By convention, the energy of electrons is shown, so a positive voltage penetrating the surface ''lowers'' the conduction edge. A dashed line depicts the occupancy situation: below this [[Fermi level]] the states are more likely to be occupied, the conduction band moves closer to the Fermi level, indicating more electrons are in the conducting band near the insulator.

===Bulk region===
The example in the figure shows the Fermi level in the bulk material beyond the range of the applied field as lying close to the valence band edge. This position for the occupancy level is arranged by introducing impurities into the semiconductor. In this case the impurities are so-called ''acceptors'' which soak up electrons from the valence band becoming negatively charged, immobile ions embedded in the semiconductor material. The removed electrons are drawn from the valence band levels, leaving vacancies or ''holes'' in the valence band. Charge neutrality prevails in the field-free region because a negative acceptor ion  creates a positive deficiency in the host material: a hole is the absence of an electron, it behaves like a positive charge. Where no field is present, neutrality is achieved because the negative acceptor ions exactly balance the positive holes.

===Surface region===
Next the band bending is described. A positive charge is placed on the left face of the insulator (for example using a metal "gate" electrode). In the insulator there are no charges so the electric field is constant, leading to a linear change of voltage in this material. As a result, the insulator conduction and valence bands are therefore straight lines in the figure, separated by the large insulator energy gap. 

In the semiconductor at the smaller voltage shown in the top panel, the positive charge placed on the left face of the insulator lowers the energy of the valence band edge. Consequently, these states are fully occupied out to a so-called ''depletion depth'' where the bulk occupancy reestablishes itself because the field cannot penetrate further. Because the valence band levels near the surface are fully occupied due to the lowering of these levels, only the immobile negative acceptor-ion charges are present near the surface, which becomes an electrically insulating region without holes (the ''depletion layer''). Thus, field penetration is arrested when the exposed negative acceptor ion charge balances the positive charge placed on the insulator surface: the depletion layer adjusts its depth enough to make the net negative acceptor ion charge balance the positive charge on the gate. 

===Inversion===
The conduction band edge also is lowered, increasing electron occupancy of these states, but at low voltages this increase is not significant. At larger applied voltages, however, as in the bottom panel, the conduction band edge is lowered sufficiently to cause significant population of these levels in a narrow surface layer, called an ''inversion'' layer because the electrons are opposite in polarity to the holes originally populating the semiconductor. This onset of electron charge in the inversion layer becomes very significant at an applied ''threshold'' voltage, and once the applied voltage exceeds this value charge neutrality is achieved almost entirely by addition of electrons to the inversion layer rather than by an increase in acceptor ion charge by expansion of the depletion layer. Further field penetration into the semiconductor is arrested at this point, as the electron density increases exponentially with band-bending beyond the threshold voltage, effectively ''pinning'' the depletion layer depth at its value at threshold voltages.

A '''gravitational singularity''' or '''spacetime singularity''' is a location in [[spacetime]] where the [[gravitational]] field of a celestial body becomes [[Infinity|infinite]] in a way that does not depend on the [[coordinate system]]. The quantities used to measure gravitational field strength are the [[Curvature invariant (general relativity)|scalar invariant]] [[Curvature of Riemannian manifolds|curvature]]s of spacetime, which includes a measure of the density of matter. Since such quantities become infinite within the singularity, the laws of normal spacetime cannot exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/topics_blackholes_singularities.html|title=Blackholes and Wormholes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/singularities|title=Spacetime Singularities|author=Claes Uggla|journal=Einstein Online |volume=2 |year=2006 |number=1002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravitational singularities are mainly considered within [[general relativity]], where [[density]] apparently becomes infinite at the center of a [[black hole]], and within [[astrophysics]] and [[cosmology]] as the [[Initial singularity|earliest state of the universe]] during the [[Big Bang]].  Physicists are undecided whether the prediction of singularities means that they actually exist (or existed at the start of the Big Bang), or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe what happens at such extreme densities.

General relativity predicts that any object collapsing beyond a certain point (for [[star]]s this is the [[Schwarzschild radius]]) would form a black hole, inside which a singularity (covered by an event horizon) would be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-singularities/|title=Singularities and Black Holes|last=Curiel|first=Erik|publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University|author2=Peter Bokulich|last-author-amp=yes|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems]] define a singularity to have [[Geodesic (general relativity)|geodesics]] that cannot be extended in a [[Smooth function|smooth]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moulay |first=Emmanuel |title=The universe and photons |url=http://www.fqxi.org/data/essay-contest-files/Moulay_Photon_2.pdf |publisher=FQXi Foundational Questions Institute |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The termination of such a geodesic is considered to be the singularity.

The initial state of the [[universe]], at the beginning of the [[Big Bang]], is also predicted by modern theories to have been a singularity.&lt;ref&gt;Wald, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the universe did not collapse into a black hole, because currently-known calculations and density limits for gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as stars, and do not necessarily apply in the same way to [[metric expansion of space|rapidly expanding space]] such as the Big Bang. Neither [[general relativity]] nor [[quantum mechanics]] can currently describe the [[Planck epoch|earliest moments of the Big Bang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hawking |first=Stephen |title=The Beginning of Time |url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-beginning-of-time.html |work=Stephen Hawking: The Official Website |publisher=[[Cambridge University]] |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in general, quantum mechanics does not permit particles to inhabit a space smaller than their wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zebrowski |first=Ernest |title=A History of the Circle: Mathematical Reasoning and the Physical Universe |date=2000 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |location=Piscataway NJ |isbn=978-0813528984 |page=180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2twRfiUwkxYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

Many theories in physics have [[mathematical singularities]] of one kind or another.  Equations for these physical theories predict that the ball of mass of some quantity becomes infinite or increases without limit. This is generally a sign for a missing piece in the theory, as in the [[ultraviolet catastrophe|Ultraviolet Catastrophe]], [[renormalization|re-normalization]], and instability of a hydrogen atom predicted by the [[Larmor formula]].

Some theories, such as the theory of [[loop quantum gravity]] suggest that singularities may not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Rodolfo Gambini |author2=Javier Olmedo |author3=Jorge Pullin |arxiv=1310.5996|title=Quantum black holes in Loop Quantum Gravity|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=095009 |year=2013 |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/31/9/095009 |bibcode=2014CQGra..31i5009G }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true for such classical unified field theories as the  [[Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations]]. The idea can be stated in the form that due to [[quantum gravity]] effects, there is a minimum distance beyond which the force of gravity no longer continues to increase as the distance between the masses becomes shorter, or alternatively that interpenetrating particle waves mask gravitational effects that would be felt at a distance.

==Types==
There are different types of singularities, each with different physical features which have characteristics relevant to the theories in which they originally emerged from, such as the different shape of the singularities, ''conical and curved''. They have also been hypothesized to occur without Event Horizons, structures which delineate one spacetime section from another in which events cannot affect past the horizon; these are called ''naked.''

===Conical===

A conical singularity occurs when there is a point where the limit of every [[Diffeomorphism invariance|diffeomorphism invariant]] quantity is finite, in which case spacetime is not smooth at the point of the limit itself. Thus, spacetime looks like a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] around this point, where the singularity is located at the tip of the cone. The metric can be finite everywhere if a suitable [[coordinate system]] is used.

An example of such a conical singularity is a [[cosmic string]] and a [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild black hole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=hep-th/0312067 |bibcode=2004JHEP...06..013C |doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2004/06/013 |title=Cosmic F- and D-strings |year=2004 |last1=Copeland |first1=Edmund J |last2=Myers |first2=Robert C |last3=Polchinski |first3=Joseph |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |volume=2004 |issue=6 |pages=013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curvature===
[[File:Black hole details.svg|right|thumb|200px|A simple illustration of a non-spinning [[black hole]] and its singularity ]]
Solutions to the equations of [[general relativity]] or another theory of [[gravity]] (such as [[supergravity]]) often result in encountering points where the [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] blows up to infinity. However, many of these points are completely [[Smooth function|regular]], and the infinities are merely a result of [[Coordinate singularity|using an inappropriate coordinate system at this point]]. In order to test whether there is a singularity at a certain point, one must check whether at this point [[Diffeomorphism invariance|diffeomorphism invariant]] quantities (i.e. [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]s) become infinite. Such quantities are the same in every coordinate system, so these infinities will not "go away" by a change of coordinates.

An example is the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild]] solution that describes a non-rotating, [[Electric charge|uncharged]] black hole. In coordinate systems convenient for working in regions far away from the black hole, a part of the metric becomes infinite at the [[event horizon]]. However, spacetime at the event horizon is [[Smooth function|regular]].  The regularity becomes evident when changing to another coordinate system (such as the [[Kruskal coordinates]]), where the metric is perfectly [[Smooth function|smooth]]. On the other hand, in the center of the black hole, where the metric becomes infinite as well, the solutions suggest a singularity exists. The existence of the singularity can be verified by noting that the [[Kretschmann scalar]], being the square of the [[Riemann tensor]] i.e. &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;, which is diffeomorphism invariant, is infinite.

While in a non-rotating black hole the singularity occurs at a single point in the model coordinates, called a "point singularity", in a rotating black hole, also known as a [[Kerr black hole]], the singularity occurs on a ring (a circular line), known as a "[[ring singularity]]". Such a singularity may also theoretically become a [[wormhole]].&lt;ref&gt;If a rotating singularity is given a uniform electrical charge, a repellent force results, causing a [[ring singularity]] to form. The effect may be a stable [[wormhole]], a non-point-like puncture in spacetime that may be connected to a second ring singularity on the other end. Although such wormholes are often suggested as routes for faster-than-light travel, such suggestions ignore the problem of escaping the black hole at the other end, or even of surviving the immense [[tidal force]]s in the tightly curved interior of the wormhole.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, a spacetime is considered singular if it is [[Geodesic (general relativity)#Geodesic incompleteness and singularities|geodesically incomplete]], meaning that there are freely-falling particles whose motion cannot be determined beyond a finite time, being after the point of reaching the singularity. For example, any observer inside the [[event horizon]] of a non-rotating black hole would fall into its center within a finite period of time. The classical version of the [[Big Bang]] [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] model of the [[universe]] contains a causal singularity at the start of [[time]] (''t''=0), where all time-like geodesics have no extensions into the past. Extrapolating backward to this hypothetical time 0 results in a universe with all spatial dimensions of size zero, infinite density, infinite temperature, and infinite spacetime curvature.

===Naked singularity===
Until the early 1990s, it was widely believed that [[general relativity]] hides every singularity behind an [[event horizon]], making naked singularities impossible. This is referred to as the [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]]. However, in 1991, physicists Stuart Shapiro and [[Saul Teukolsky]] performed computer simulations of a rotating plane of dust that indicated that general relativity might allow for "naked" singularities. What these objects would actually look like in such a model is unknown. Nor is it known whether singularities would still arise if the simplifying assumptions used to make the simulation were removed. However, it is hypothesized that light entering a singularity would similarly have its geodesics terminated, thus making the [[naked singularity]] look like a black hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M.

Disappearing event horizons exist in the&amp;nbsp;[[Kerr metric]], which is a spinning black hole in a vacuum. Specifically, if the&amp;nbsp;[[angular momentum]]&amp;nbsp;is high enough, the event horizons could disappear. Transforming the Kerr metric to&amp;nbsp;[[Boyer–Lindquist coordinates]], it can be shown &lt;ref&gt;Hobson, et al., ''General Relativity an Introduction for Physicists'', Cambridge University Press 2007, p. 300-305&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;that the&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;coordinate (which is not the radius) of the event horizon is, &lt;math&gt;r_{\pm}= \mu \pm (\mu^{2}-a^{2})^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, where&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mu = G M / c^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;a=J/M c&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, "event horizons disappear" means when the solutions are complex for&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;r_{\pm}&lt;/math&gt;, or&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mu^{2} &lt; a^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Disappearing event horizons can also be seen with the&amp;nbsp;[[Reissner–Nordström metric|Reissner–Nordström]]&amp;nbsp;geometry of a charged black hole. In this metric, it can be shown&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, et al., ''General Relativity an Introduction for Physicists'', Cambridge University Press 2007, p. 320-325&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;that the singularities occur at &lt;math&gt;r_{\pm}= \mu \pm (\mu^{2}-q^{2})^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, where&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mu = G M / c^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q^{2} = G Q^{2}/(4 \pi \epsilon_{0} c^{4})&lt;/math&gt;. Of the three possible cases for the relative values of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, the case where&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mu^{2} &lt; q^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;causes both&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;r_{\pm}&lt;/math&gt; to be complex. This means the metric is regular for all positive values of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, or in other words, the singularity has no event horizon.

== Entropy==
{{further|Black hole|Hawking radiation|Entropy}}
Before [[Stephen Hawking]] came up with the concept of [[Hawking radiation]], the question of black holes having entropy had been avoided. However, this concept demonstrates that black holes can radiate (perhaps, negative) energy, which conserves entropy and solves the incompatibility problems with the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Entropy, however, implies heat and therefore temperature. The loss of energy also suggests that black holes do not last forever, but rather evaporate or decay slowly. Small black holes tend to be hotter whereas larger ones tend to be colder{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}. All known black hole candidates are so large that their temperature is far below that of the cosmic background radiation, so they all tend to gain entropical energy, and they will not begin to lose their energy until a [[cosmological redshift]] of more than one million is reached{{why|date=October 2018}}, rather than the thousand or so since the background radiation formed.{{reference needed|date=October 2018}}

[[File:GHS-pictogram-skull.svg|thumb|[[Skull and crossbones (poison)|Skull and crossbones]], a common symbol for poison and other sources of [[Death|lethal danger]] ([[GHS hazard pictograms]])]]

'''Hazard symbols''' or '''warning symbols''' are recognisable [[symbol]]s designed to warn about hazardous or dangerous materials, locations, or objects, including electric currents, poisons, and [[radioactivity]]. The use of hazard symbols is often regulated by law and directed by [[standards organisation]]s. Hazard symbols may appear with different colors, backgrounds, borders and supplemental information in order to specify the type of hazard and the level of threat (for example, [[toxicity class]]es).  Warning symbols are used in many places in lieu of or addition to written warnings as they are quickly recognized (faster than reading a written warning) and more commonly understood (the same symbol can be recognized as having the same meaning to speakers of different languages).

==Generic warning symbol==
{{further|Warning sign}}
[[Image:Achtung.svg|thumb|80px|alt=German road warning sign|German road warning symbol]]

On roadside [[warning sign]]s, an [[exclamation mark]] is often used to draw attention to a generic warning of danger, hazards, and the unexpected. In Europe, this type of sign is used if there are no more-specific signs to denote a particular hazard.&lt;ref name="A series european traffic signs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/traffic/signs/Aa.html|title=A series european traffic signs}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used for traffic signs, it is accompanied by a supplementary sign describing the hazard, usually mounted under the exclamation mark.

This symbol has also been more widely adopted for generic use in many other contexts not associated with road traffic. It often appears on hazardous equipment or in instruction manuals to draw attention to a precaution, when a more-specific warning symbol is not available.

==Poison symbol==
{{Main|Skull and crossbones (poison)}}
[[Image:Skull and crossbones.svg|thumb|80px|alt=Skull and crossbones|Skull and crossbones]]
The skull-and-crossbones symbol (☠), consisting of a [[human skull]] and two bones crossed together behind the skull, is today generally used as a warning of danger, particularly in regard to [[poison]]ous substances.

The symbol, or some variation thereof, specifically with the bones (or swords) below the skull, was also featured on the [[Jolly Roger]], the traditional [[flag]] of European and American seagoing [[pirate]]s. It is also part of the Canadian [[Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System|WHMIS]] home symbols placed on containers to warn that the contents are poisonous.

In the United States, due to concerns that the skull-and-crossbones symbol's association with pirates might encourage children to play with toxic materials, the [[Mr. Yuk]] symbol is also used to denote poison.

==Ionizing radiation symbol== 	 &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Trefoil]] --&gt;
{{anchor|ISO 21482|Radioactive sign}}
The '''international radiation symbol''' (also known as the [[trefoil]]) first appeared in 1946, at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|University of California, Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="Origin of the Radiation Warning Symbol (Trefoil)"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/radwarnsymbstory.htm|title=Origin of the Radiation Warning Symbol (Trefoil)}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was rendered as [[magenta]], and was set on a [[blue]] background. The original version used in America is magenta against a yellow background, and it is drawn with a central circle of radius ''R'', an internal radius of 1.5''R'' and an external radius of 5''R'' for the blades, which are separated from each other by 60°. The trefoil is black in the international version, which is also used in America.&lt;ref name="Biohazard and radioactive symbol, design and proportions"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_WSH_part476_54539_7.pdf |title=Biohazard and radioactive symbol, design and proportions |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231181252/http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_WSH_part476_54539_7.pdf |archivedate=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign is commonly referred to as a [[radioactivity]] warning sign, but it is actually a warning sign of [[ionizing radiation]]. Ionizing radiation is a much broader category than radioactivity alone, as many non-radioactive sources also emit potentially dangerous levels of ionizing radiation. This includes x-ray apparatus, radiotherapy linear accelerators, and particle accelerators. [[Non-ionizing radiation]] can also reach potentially dangerous levels, but this warning sign is different from the trefoil ionizing radiation warning symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carexcanada.ca/en/ionizing_radiation/#regulations_and_guidelines|title=Ionizing Radiation |publisher=CAREX Canada|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2007, two groups—the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO)—jointly announced the adoption of a new [[ionizing radiation]] warning symbol to supplement the traditional trefoil symbol. The new symbol, to be used on sealed radiation sources, is aimed at alerting anyone, anywhere to the danger of being close to a strong source of ionizing radiation.&lt;ref&gt;''This symbol is included in ISO 21482:2007. ISO International Standards are protected by copyright and may be purchased from ISO or its members (please visit www.iso.org for more information). ISO has not reviewed the accuracy or veracity of this information.'' {{Cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2007/radiationsymbol.html|title=New Symbol Launched to Warn Public About Radiation Dangers|accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts, on a red background, a black trefoil with waves of radiation streaming from it, along with a black [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]], and a running figure with an arrow pointing away from the scene. The radiating trefoil suggests the presence of radiation, while the red background and the skull and crossbones warn of the danger. The figure running away from the scene is meant to suggest taking action to avoid the labeled material. The new symbol is not intended to be generally visible, but rather to appear on internal components of devices that house radiation sources so that if anybody attempts to disassemble such devices they will see an explicit warning not to proceed any further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2007/radiationsymbol.html|title=New Symbol Launched to Warn Public About Radiation Dangers|work=IAEA|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Jun262007/snt200706259363.asp|title=Deccan Herald – Drop it|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210212755/http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Jun262007/snt200706259363.asp|archivedate=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''biohazard symbol''' is used in the labeling of biological materials that carry a significant health risk ([[Biological hazard|biohazards]]), including viral samples and used [[hypodermic needles]] (see [[sharps waste]]).&lt;ref name=BiohazardScience&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The biohazard symbol was developed by the [[Dow Chemical Company]] in 1966 for their containment products.&lt;ref name="waterloo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm|title=Biohazard Symbol History|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716160837/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charles Baldwin,&lt;ref name="waterloo"/&gt; an environmental-health engineer who contributed to its development: "We wanted something that was memorable but meaningless, so we could educate people as to what it means." In an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1967, the symbol was presented as the new standard for all biological hazards ("biohazards"). The article explained that over 40 symbols were drawn up by Dow artists, and all of the symbols investigated had to meet a number of criteria: "(i) striking in form in order to draw immediate attention; (ii) unique and unambiguous, in order not to be confused with symbols used for other purposes; (iii) quickly recognizable and easily recalled; (iv) easily stenciled; (v) symmetrical, in order to appear identical from all angles of approach; and (vi) acceptable to groups of varying ethnic backgrounds." The chosen scored the best on nationwide testing for memorability.&lt;ref name=BiohazardScience&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=CL|author2=Runkle, RS|title=Biohazards symbol: development of a biological hazards warning signal.|journal=Science|date=Oct 13, 1967|volume=158|issue=3798|pages=264–5|doi=10.1126/science.158.3798.264|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/1967-10-13-Science-paper-Biohazard-Symbol.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2011|pmid=6053882|bibcode=1967Sci...158..264B|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324190420/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/1967-10-13-Science-paper-Biohazard-Symbol.pdf|archivedate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
All parts of the biohazard sign can be drawn with a [[compass and straightedge]]. The basic outline of the symbol is a plain [[trefoil]], which is three circles overlapping each other equally like in a triple [[Venn diagram]] with the overlapping parts erased. The [[diameters|diameter]] of the overlapping part is equal to half the [[radii|radius]] of the three circles. Then three inner circles are drawn in with {{frac|2|3}} radius of the original circles so that it is [[tangent]] to the outside three overlapping circles. A tiny circle in center has a [[diameter]] {{frac|1|2}} of the radius of the three inner circles, and [[Arc (geometry)|arcs]] are erased at 90°, 210°, and 330°. The arcs of the inner circles and the tiny circle are connected by a line. Finally, the ring under is drawn from the distance to the [[perimeter]] of the [[equilateral triangle]] that forms between the centers of the three intersecting circles. An outer circle of the ring under is drawn and finally enclosed with the arcs from the center of the inner circles with a shorter radius from the inner circles.&lt;ref name="Biohazard and radioactive symbol, design and proportions"/&gt;

==Chemical symbols==
A '''chemical hazard symbol''' is a [[pictogram]] applied to containers of dangerous [[chemical compound]]s to indicate the specific hazard, and thus the required precautions. There are several systems of labels, depending on the purpose, such as on the container for end use, or on a vehicle during transportation. 

===GHS symbols and statements===
{{main|GHS hazard pictograms}}
The [[United Nations]] has designed [[GHS hazard pictograms]] and [[GHS hazard statements]] to [[Harmonization|internationally harmonize]] chemical hazard warnings. Several European countries have started to implement these new global standards, but older warning symbols are still used in many parts of the world.

===Europe===
{{main|European hazard symbols}}
European standards are set by:
* [[CLP Regulation|CLP regulation]] (2008) for chemical containers, following international GHS recommendations; see European [[GHS hazard statements|CLP/GHS hazard symbols]]
* [[European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road]] (ADR) for additional packaging for transportation. Vehicles carrying dangerous goods must be equipped with orange signs, where the upper code number identifies the type of hazard, and the lower code number identifies the specific substance. These symbols cannot be readily interpreted without the aid of a table to translate the numerical codes.

{{main|NFPA 704}}
{{see also|Toxic Substances Control Act}}

The US-based [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA) has a standard [[NFPA 704]] using a diamond with four colored sections each with a number indicating severity 0—4 (0 for no hazard, 4 indicates a severe hazard). The red section denotes flammability. The blue section denotes health risks. Yellow represents reactivity (tendency to explode). The white section denotes special hazard information. One example of a special hazard would be the capital letter W crossed out (pictured left), indicating it is water reactant.

==Non-standard symbols==
[[Image:High voltage warning sign Beromuenster.JPG|thumb|Sign on a fence around the [[Beromünster]] Reserve Broadcasting Tower in Switzerland, warning of high voltage and lethal danger]]
A large number of warning symbols with non-standard designs are in use around the world.

Some warning symbols have been redesigned to be more comprehensible to children, such as the [[Mr. Ouch]] (depicting an electricity danger as a snarling, spiky creature) and [[Mr. Yuk]] (a green frowny face sticking its tongue out, to represent poison) designs in the United States.

'''Hex signs''' are a form of [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] [[folk art]], related to [[Fraktur (Pennsylvania German folk art)|fraktur]], found in the [[Fancy Dutch]] tradition in [[Pennsylvania Dutch Country]].&lt;ref name="LancasterPA.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lancasterpa.com/hex-signs/|title=Hex Signs|publisher= LancasterPA.com|accessdate= January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barn paintings, usually in the form of "stars in circles", began to appear on the landscape in the early 19th century, and became widespread decades later when commercial paint became readily available. By the 1950s commercialized hex signs, aimed at the tourist market, became popular and these often include stars, [[compass rose]]s, stylized birds known as [[distelfink]]s, [[heart]]s, [[tulip]]s, or a [[tree of life]].  Two schools of thought exist on the meaning of hex signs.  One school ascribes a [[Amulet|talisman]]ic nature to the signs, the other sees them as purely decorative, or "Chust for nice" in the local dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Yoder and Graves, pp. 3-10&lt;/ref&gt; Both schools recognize that there are sometimes superstitions associated with certain hex sign themes, and neither ascribes strong magical power to them.&lt;ref&gt;Richman, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Amish]] do not use hex signs.&lt;ref name="Amish News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amishnews.com/featurearticles/Storyofhexsigns.htm|title= The Story of the Hex Sign|work= Amish Country News|first=Brad|last=Igou|date=October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form and use==
[[File:Mascot Mills Barn w Hexes LanCo PA.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Barn with [[compass rose]] hex signs at the historic [[Leacock Township, Pennsylvania|Mascot Mills]] in Lancaster County]]
Painted [[barn star]]s in circular borders are a common sight on Pennsylvania Dutch [[barn]]s in central and southeastern Pennsylvania, especially in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]], [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]] and [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]].  However, the modern decoration of barns is a late development in Pennsylvania Dutch folk art. Prior to the 1830s, the cost of paint meant that most barns were unpainted.&lt;ref name="About Hex Signs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hexsigns.org/about.htm|title=About Hex Signs|work=Pennsylvania Dutch Hex Tour Association|accessdate= November 3, 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As paint became affordable, the Pennsylvania Dutch began to decorate their barns much like they decorated items in their homes. Barn decorating reached its peak in the early 20th century, at which time there were many artists who specialized in barn decorating.&lt;ref name="About Hex Signs"/&gt; Drawn from a large repertoire of designs barn painters combined many elements in their decorations. The [[geometry|geometric]] patterns of [[quilts]] can be seen in the patterns of many hex signs. Hearts and tulips seen on barns are commonly found on elaborately lettered and decorated birth, baptism and marriage certificates known as [[Fraktur (Pennsylvania German folk art)|fraktur]].&lt;ref name="About Hex Signs"/&gt;

[[File:Souvenirs in Paradise PA.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Souvenir shop in Lancaster County selling hex signs]]
Throughout the 20th century, hex signs were often produced as commodities for the tourist industry in Pennsylvania. These signs could be bought and then mounted onto barns and used as household decorations. Jacob Zook of [[Paradise, Pennsylvania]] claimed to have originated the modern mountable sign in 1942, based on traditional designs, to be sold in souvenir gift shops to tourists along the [[Lincoln Highway]].&lt;ref name="Amish News"/&gt; William Schuster, Milton Hill, Johnny Ott, and Johnny and Eric Claypoole also contributed to this hex sign revival or adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Richman pp. 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; Modern artists may stress the symbolic meanings, for example, a horse head is used to protect animals from disease and the building from lightning, and a dove represents peace and contentment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hexsigns.com/pages/history|title=History|work=Jacob Zook hex Signs|accessdate= February 29, 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An unusual use is the official logo of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Radiation Protection, which incorporates the international symbol for radiation into its yellow-and-red adaptation of a traditional hex sign design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dep.state.pa.us/brp/default.htm |title=Bureau of Radiation Protection's Home Page |work=Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection |accessdate=February 29, 2012 |year=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214010449/http://www.dep.state.pa.us/brp/default.htm |archivedate=February 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over origins==
There are two opposing schools of belief regarding the derivation of the name. The term ''hex'' with occult connotations may derive from the [[Pennsylvanian German]] word "hex" (German "Hexe", Dutch "Heks"), meaning "[[Witchcraft|witch]]." However the term "hex sign" was not used until the 20th Century, after 1924 when Wallace Nutting's book ''Pennsylvania Beautiful'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dl8QAQAAIAAJ|title=Pennsylvania (eastern)|first=Wallace|last=Nutting|publisher= Old America Company|year= 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutting, who was not a Pennsylvania native, interviewed farmers about their distinctive barn decoration. Before this time there was no standardized term and many Pennsylvania German farmers simply called the signs "blumme" or "sterne" (meaning flowers or stars). However one farmer used the term "Hexefoos" in his description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxG9dirwRDIC|page=317|first=C.R.|last=Bilardi|title=The Red Church Or the Art of Pennsylvania German Braucherei|publisher= Pendraig Publishing|location= Sunland, CA|year=2009|isbn=9780982031858}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term became popular with Pennsylvania Germans themselves during the blossoming tourist trade of Southeastern Pennsylvania.

In recent years, hex signs have come to be used by non-Pennsylvania Dutch persons as talismans for [[folk magic]] rather than as items of decoration. Some believe that both the Pennsylvania German barn design and hex designs originate with the Alpine Germans.  They note that hexes are of [[Iron age|pre-Christian]] Germanic origin; for instance, a circled [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] is called the ''[[Sun of the Alps]]'' in [[Padania]] ([[Po Valley]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Lega Nord |title=Il significato del simbolo del Sole delle Alpi |url=http://www.prov-varese.leganord.org/doc/solealpi.htm |access-date=2014-01-12 |language=it |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112135050/http://www.prov-varese.leganord.org/doc/solealpi.htm |archivedate=2014-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this history, [[Neopagan]]s or Germanic heathens have taken up the practice of creating hex signs, incorporating other pre-Christian signs and symbols into the hex work. Gandee, in his book ''Strange Experience, Autobiography of a Hexenmeister'', described hex signs as "painted prayers".&lt;ref&gt;Gandee, pp. 305-320&lt;/ref&gt;

Some view the designs as decorative symbols of ethnic identification, possibly originating in reaction to 19th century attempts made by the government to suppress the [[Pennsylvania German language]].&lt;ref name="Amish News"/&gt;
[[Anabaptist]] sects (like the [[Amish]] and Mennonites) in the region have a negative view of hex signs.  It is not surprising that hex signs are rarely, and perhaps never, seen on an Amish or [[Mennonite]] household or farm.&lt;ref name="LancasterPA.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4828">The [[United Nations General Assembly]] proclaimed the first decade of the 21st century and the third millennium, the years 2001 to 2010, as the '''International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World'''.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES5325"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-53-25 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=53 |accessdate=2007-08-10 |date=10 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed resolutions about the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]] and the [[International Day of Peace]].

The action plan for the Decade proposes eight spheres of activities in which to work for the promotion of the Culture of Peace:
*To reinforce a culture of peace through [[peace education|education]]
*To promote economically and socially [[sustainable development]]
*To promote the respect of all [[human rights]]
*To ensure the [[gender equality|equality between women and men]]
*To support [[participatory democracy|democratic participation]]
*To develop comprehension, [[toleration|tolerance]] and [[solidarity]]
*To support participative communication and the [[freedom of information|freedom of movement of information]] and knowledge
*To promote international peace and safety

On 29 November 2000, the General Assembly decided to entrust [[UNESCO]] with the coordination "of the activities of the organizations of the United Nations system to promote a culture of peace, as well as liaison with other organizations concerned in this matter."{{Fact|date=August 2007}}. In 2009, the United Nations General Assembly, in a resolution on the International Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children of the World, endorsed the ongoing work of the [[Culture of Peace News Network]] as an important part of the ongoing commitment of the [[UN]] to a culture of peace.

==NGOs==

[[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and other civil society organizations were urged to contribute to a global movement for a culture of peace according to the Declaration and Programme of Action for a Culture of Peace, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1999.  In response, a mid-term report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/2005report.html 2005 Report of Civil Society]&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to the United Nations in 2005, included information from 700 organizations.  In 2010 at the conclusion of the Decade, the Report from the Civil Society&lt;ref&gt;[http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/2010_civil_society_report.pdf 2010 Report from the Civil Society]&lt;/ref&gt; was submitted to the United Nations with detailed information and photographs about the actions of 1,054 organizations from over 100 countries.  This information is the tip of an even larger iceberg, as indicated by the many partnerships listed by participating organizations which number in the many thousands.  

Some national NGOs coalitions promoting the Decade were established in several countries, including Austria, France, Italy and the Netherlands. These national coalitions along with international organizations decided to found the [[International Coalition for the Decade]] in June 2003.

Related to this UN Decade, in December 1998, the [[World Council of Churches]] adopted, at its 8th Assembly, in Harare (Zimbabwe), the [[Decade to Overcome Violence]] as one of its programmes for the decade 2000-2009.

Sue Gilmurray from the [[Anglican Pacifist Fellowship]] composed and recorded a cycle of songs to commemorate the decade.  The songs tackle a variety of subjects, and they include a critique of the use of [[child soldiers]] and an attack on the promotion and marketing of violent films and games towards children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paxchristi.org.uk/JustPeace/jp253_March-April06.pdf Paxchristi.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014193404/http://www.paxchristi.org.uk/JustPeace/jp253_March-April06.pdf |date=2006-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14934">In [[cognitive psychology]], '''intertrial priming''' is an accumulation of the [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] effect over multiple trials, where "priming" is the effect of the exposure to one stimulus on subsequently presented stimuli.  Intertrial priming occurs when a target feature (the characteristic that distinguishes targets from non-targets) is repeated from one trial to the next, and typically results in speeded response times to the target. A target is the stimulus participants are required to search for. For example, intertrial priming occurs when the task is to respond to either a red or a green target, and the response time to a red target is faster if the preceding trial also has a red target.&lt;ref name="mem&amp;cog"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maljkovic|first1=V|last2=Nakayama|first2=K|title=Priming of pop-out: I. Role of features|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|date=November 1994|volume=22|issue=6|pages=657–72|pmid=7808275|doi=10.3758/bf03209251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Top-down and bottom-up attention ==
Visual attention is influenced by [[Attention#Bottom-up versus top-down|top down and bottom up]] attentional processes. Top-down attention is  allocated based on an observer's current knowledge about the stimuli. Participants in an experiment might be instructed to search for, and respond to a target object presented in a display that is a different colour than the other objects presented simultaneously. Top down knowledge of the dimension of the target (i.e. colour) can speed response times to target identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treisman|first1=A|last2=Gormican|first2=S|title=Feature analysis in early vision: evidence from search asymmetries.|journal=Psychological Review|date=January 1988|volume=95|issue=1|pages=15–48|pmid=3353475|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.95.1.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottom-up attention is involuntarily and automatically directed towards salient features in the environment such as a bright colour among dull colours. In experimental settings, the more different a stimulus is from other stimuli in a visual display, the more salient it is. Bottom-up attention is typically not guided by observers' goals or knowledge, only by the physical properties of the stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connor|first1=Charles E.|last2=Egeth|first2=Howard E.|last3=Yantis|first3=Steven|title=Visual Attention: Bottom-Up Versus Top-Down|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=19|pages=R850–R852|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.09.041|pmid=15458666|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies employ various methods involving intertrial priming to assess the contribution of top down versus bottom up processes in guiding attention in visual search tasks.

=== Integrative framework ===
There are factors in [[visual search]] tasks that the top down versus bottom up dichotomy does not take into consideration. Not all selection biases can be explained by physical saliency (bottom up) or observer goals (top down).&lt;ref name="awh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Awh|first1=Edward|last2=Belopolsky|first2=Artem V.|last3=Theeuwes|first3=Jan|title=Top-down versus bottom-up attentional control: a failed theoretical dichotomy|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=16|issue=8|pages=437–443|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2012.06.010|pmid=22795563|pmc=3426354|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies that have found that stimuli that are equally salient and are connected with rewards and can draw a participants' attention, even if this choice doesn't match their selection goals. An alternative framework has been proposed where past selection history, current goals and physical salience are integrated in a model of attentional control.&lt;ref name="awh" /&gt;

== Measuring the effects of intertrial priming ==
Intertrial priming is an important aspect to consider in designing an experiment as it can influence the results if it is not considered/controlled. Intertrial priming is often measured using a visual search task. A typical visual search task involves participants searching for, and responding to, a target amongst a group of non-target items. Intertrial priming performance is generally measured by recording participants' reaction times to identify a target and comparing these times across trials. Different trial designs and visual search tasks can be employed to measure intertrial priming.

=== Blocked and mixed trials ===
Studies often compare blocked and mixed visual search trials to measure intertrial priming. [[Blocking effect|Blocked trial]]s are multiple, successively presented visual search trials that include the same target, and [[mixed trial]]s are a randomised series of trials, each trial consisting of different targets.&lt;ref name="hillstrom"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillstrom|first1=Anne P.|title=Repetition effects in visual search|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|volume=62|issue=4|pages=800–817|doi=10.3758/BF03206924|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a blocked trial condition may include searching for a green circle in trial 1, and in multiple successive preceding trials, whereas a mixed trial condition may include searching a for a green circle in trial 1, but a red circle in the proceeding trials. Blocking trials can control for effects of variability in targets. When a target with the same defining feature is repeated across trials (blocked conditions), participants reaction times are faster than when the target is not the same across trials (mixed conditions).&lt;ref name="hillstrom" /&gt;  This repetition effect is also cumulative. As the number of target repetitions increases, up to a certain point, participants reaction times are faster each time they are exposed to the same target in repeated trials.&lt;ref name="hillstrom" /&gt;  In mixed and blocked trials there can be a disparity in intertrial priming that results in faster reaction times in the blocked trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bravo|first1=Mary J.|last2=Nakayama|first2=Ken|title=The role of attention in different visual-search tasks|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|volume=51|issue=5|pages=465–472|doi=10.3758/BF03211642|year=1992|citeseerx=10.1.1.155.4133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction times may be faster in blocked trials because participants are required to respond to targets that differ in only one dimension from non-targets.

=== Cueing ===
A [[Sensory cue|cue]] is a presentation of a stimulus prior to a trial to inform the participant of an upcoming target feature. For example, a blue circle may be shown before a trial to signify a blue circle will be the target in the upcoming trial. Target relevant cues may be presented to participants to decrease their reaction time to the target in the display. These cues may be valid or invalid. Valid cues correctly predict the target stimulus but invalid cues do not. For example, if the target in an upcoming trial is a blue circle, a blue circle presented as a cue would be valid, but if a red circle was presented as a cue it would be invalid, as it doesn't correctly predict the blue circle target stimulus. Reaction times to valid cues are typically faster than reaction times to invalid cues.&lt;ref name="mem&amp;cog" /&gt; This phenomenon is known as a cueing effect.&lt;ref name="mem&amp;cog" /&gt;

=== Cue validity effect ===
When a valid cue has a low probability of correct target prediction, there can still be a reliable cueing effect for valid cues, and faster reaction times to valid cues than invalid cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Theeuwes|first1=Jan|last2=Reimann|first2=Brit|last3=Mortier|first3=Karen|title=Visual search for featural singletons: No top-down modulation, only bottom-up priming|journal=Visual Cognition|volume=14|issue=4–8|pages=466–489|doi=10.1080/13506280500195110|year=2006|citeseerx=10.1.1.78.1306}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the [[Contextual cueing|cueing effect]] is not affected by the predictive nature of the cue, and may not be due to top-down control. If top-down control is involved in the response selection then invalid trials should have a faster response than valid trials because participants are aware that the likelihood of being presented with a valid trial is very low.

== Types of visual search ==

=== Pop-out search ===
Pop-out search tasks include a target that differs in one dimension from a group of homogeneous non-target items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=Stefanie I.|title=The mechanism of priming: Episodic retrieval or priming of pop-out?|journal=Acta Psychologica|volume=127|issue=2|pages=324–339|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2007.07.005|pmid=17868628|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dimension is a categorical feature of a stimulus such as its colour (i.e. a red target among green non-targets), its shape (a square target among circle non-targets) or its orientation (a vertically presented target among horizontal non-targets). Response times in pop-out searches are generally faster to targets when the colour of both targets and distractors remains the same throughout trials, and slower when these colours are switched during trials.&lt;ref name="mem&amp;cog" /&gt;

=== Conjunctive search ===
{{Main article|Conjunctive query}}
A conjunctive search involves non-target stimuli that have more than one dimension in common with the target stimulus. For example, when a target is a green circle in a conjunctive search, non-targets (distractors) could be red circles and green squares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treisman|first1=Anne M.|last2=Gelade|first2=Garry|title=A feature-integration theory of attention|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=97–136|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(80)90005-5|pmid=7351125|date=January 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target will share one dimension in common with one set of non-targets (i.e. shape) and another dimension in common with the other non-target group (i.e. colour). If target and distractor features are the same over consecutive trials, response times are faster than when these dimensions are not repeated.&lt;ref name="geyer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geyer|first1=Thomas|last2=Müller|first2=Hermann J.|last3=Krummenacher|first3=Joseph|title=Cross-trial priming of element positions in visual pop-out search is dependent on stimulus arrangement.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|volume=33|issue=4|pages=788–797|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.33.4.788|pmid=17683228|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Why it occurs (major theories) ==

=== Dimension-weighting account theory ===
The "[[Pre-attentive processing#Vision|dimension-weighting account]]" of visual selection states that there is a limit to the [[Attentional bias|attentional weight]] that can be allocated to a particular dimension of an object at any one time. The dimensions of stimuli perceived as important to an observer are allocated more attentional weight (i.e. a target in a visual search), resulting in faster detection times.  If a target dimension is known in advance, this can increase the [[Salience (neuroscience)|saliency]] signals of the target. On the other hand, if the target dimension is unknown, attentional weight has to be shifted to the target dimension. When target dimensions remain the same across trials there is no change in attentional weight required, resulting in faster reaction times (intertrial facilitation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Found|first1=Andrew|last2=Müller|first2=Hermann J.|title=Searching for unknown feature targets on more than one dimension: Investigating a 'dimension-weighting' account|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|volume=58|issue=1|pages=88–101|doi=10.3758/BF03205479|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Priming of pop-out hypothesis ===
The priming of pop-out [[hypothesis]]&lt;ref name="mem&amp;cog" /&gt; suggests performance in a visual search task involving a pop-out target can be affected by the search history of specific target features in previous trials. If target and distractor features are repeated in subsequent trials, reaction times will be faster than if these features change across trials.&lt;ref name="mem&amp;cog" /&gt; The hypothesis proposes the repetition of a target used in a preceding trial makes its pop-out features more salient to an observer and therefore increases the likelihood the observer will attend to it.

=== Episodic retrieval hypothesis ===
The [[Negative priming#Episodic retrieval model|episodic retrieval model]]&lt;ref name="huang"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Liqiang|last2=Holcombe|first2=Alex|last3=Pashler|first3=Harold|title=Repetition priming in visual search:  Episodic retrieval, not feature priming|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|date=2004|volume=1|issue=32|pages=12–20|doi=10.3758/bf03195816}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests reduced response times in intertrial priming are due to the observers' retrieval of [[episodic memories]] relevant to the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olivers|first1=Christian N. L.|last2=Meeter|first2=Martijn|title=Feature priming in visual search does not depend on the dimensional context|journal=Visual Cognition|volume=16|issue=6|pages=785–803|doi=10.1080/13506280701428658|year=2008|hdl=1871/16531}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis states that visual search is composed of three successive stages of processing:
# search for a target,
# decide if the chosen target is the target of interest, and
# select and respond to the chosen target.&lt;ref name="huang" /&gt;
This hypothesis argues that when a target presented in a previous trial is presented again in the current trial, processing of the target is accelerated in the target decision stage of the model, so that after identification the target is verified to assess whether it matches the previous target stored in episodic memory.

=== Perceptual grouping of distractors account ===
Many theories focus on the repetition of target features as dominant explanation for the repetition effects seen in intertrial priming.  If target features are the same over consecutive trials but [[Object-based attention#Distractors|distractor feature]]s are changed, response times are not as fast as if both target and distractor features are kept constant over trials.&lt;ref name="geyer" /&gt;  This suggests that intertrial priming may mainly be due to distractor feature repetition, and target feature repetition influences this only slightly. This distractor-based priming may be due to faster perceptual grouping of distractors across trials. Perceptual grouping of distractors allows the target presence or absence to be distinguished more quickly.&lt;ref name="geyer" /&gt;  However, the repetition of target defining features cannot be excluded as a contributor to the priming effect found in conjunctive searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristjánsson|first1=Árni|last2=Wang|first2=DeLiang|last3=Nakayama|first3=Ken|title=The role of priming in conjunctive visual search|journal=Cognition|volume=85|issue=1|pages=37–52|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(02)00074-4|pmid=12086712|year=2002|citeseerx=10.1.1.116.8419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeanne Henriquez''' (born 1946) is an [[Afro-Curaçaoan]] educator, historian and activist. After teaching for over two decades, Henriquez, who had published articles and videos to balance the history and impact of colonialism in Curaçao became the director of the Center for the Protection of Women. She worked to alleviate domestic violence and provide educational and employment training for low-income women. She has worked with the National Archives and Museum Tula to develop materials to reclaim the history of Afro-Curaçaoans and the African diaspora throughout the Caribbean. She was awarded the Cross of Merit from the Government of Curaçao for her activism for women and the Afro-Curaçaoan communities.

==Early life==
Jeanne Dionise Henriquez was born in 1946 &lt;!--9 October 1946--&gt; in the neighborhood of [[Otrobanda]] in [[Willemstad]], Curaçao, which at the time was a part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]], to Carmita Nicolasia (née Hernandez) and Plinio Miguel Henriquez. Her father was an analyst for the laboratory at [[Shell Oil Company]] and her mother was a [[doll]]maker, whose designs celebrated the culture of Afro-Curaçaoans.{{sfn|Statia|2016}} Henriquez was the oldest daughter, having younger sisters Renee and Sarah.{{sfn|Holou|2016|p=153}} After completion of her secondary education, she began studying to be a teacher in 1962 in Curaçao. In 1967, she moved to [[Breda]] in the Netherlands, graduating from [[normal school]] in 1968.{{sfn|Statia|2016}} Continuing her schooling, Henriquez enrolled at the [[State University of Utrecht]], studying socio-economic history. She obtained a master's degree{{sfn|Holou|2016|p=153}} and completed a PhD in 1976 evaluating the social and economic impact of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] on the history of Curaçao.{{sfn|Statia|2016}}

==Career==
After completing her degree, Henriquez returned to Curaçao in 1976 and taught history at the Peter Stuyvesant College,{{sfn|Oostindie|1999|p=42}} now known as the Kolegio Alejandro Paula,{{sfn|Caraïbisch Uitzicht|2011}} Between 1979 and 1980, she left the school to work as the temporary head of the Central Historical Archives of the Netherlands Antilles. She returned to the high school in 1980{{sfn|Statia|2016}}{{sfn|Holou|2016|p=155}} and in 1984, when she was appointed as [[Dean (education)|dean]].{{sfn|Oostindie|1999|p=42}} Simultaneously between 1984 and 1989, Henriquez taught at the Teacher’s Training School in Willemstad.{{sfn|Statia|2016}}{{sfn|Holou|2016|p=155}} Influenced by [[Joceline Clemencia]], she wrote several articles during this time on the relationship of the island to the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and worked with women living in poverty.{{sfn|Statia|2016}} She also had a son in 1982, Ray Asim Henriquez, and chose to raise him as a single mother.{{sfn|Statia|2016}}{{sfn|Holou|2016|p=154}} Henriquez worked on the editorial staff of the Historical Archives of the Netherlands Antilles’ bi-annual journal ''Lanternu'' from 1984 to 1987.{{sfn|Holou|2016|p=155}} In the 1980s, she worked as the co-editor for the script on a series of fifteen videos, which aimed to present a balanced assessment on the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|colonial]] and [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] history of Curaçao without the [[Eurocentric]] view upon which previous textbooks had focused. After the series was presented, the transcripts were published as books.{{sfn|Statia|2016}}

Henriquez was the head of Peter Stuyvesant College until 1988, when she moved to [[Washington, D. C.]] to pursue her master's degree.{{sfn|Oostindie|1999|p=42}} Taking her son with her to the United States, she enrolled in the women's studies program at [[George Washington University]]. While she was in school, she worked in a youth program providing educational materials and information on HIV/AIDS for young adults and then through 1991, worked as an intern in a rape crisis center in Washington. Graduating with a master of arts degree in women's studies in 1991,{{sfn|Holou|2016|p=154}} she returned to Curaçao as the director of the Center for the Promotion of Women ([[Papiamento]]: Sentro pa Desaroyo di Hende Muhé, SDHM), where she worked until 1998.{{sfn|Statia|2016}} At SDHM, Henriquez primarily worked with low-income women, providing training and materials written in Papiamento, the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Netherlands Antilles, on the prevention and crisis intervention for domestic violence. She also provided counseling on education and job opportunities.{{sfn|Holou|2016|p=155}}

During her tenure at SDHM, Henriquez published several works focused on women and their lives. Included were testimonies of single mothers in Curaçao (1990); a poem ''Appeal from a Mother'' (1992); video scripts regarding the lives of working women (1994); and biographies of six female prisoners (1996). In 1998, she left SDHM and headed the public relations for the National Archives of Curaçao. In that capacity, she staged an exhibit on one of Curaçao's pioneering feminists, Adèle Rigaud, in 1999 and expanded the program to then cover other influential feminists.{{sfn|Statia|2016}} In 2002, she led a cooperative conference with [[UNESCO]] on the [[African diaspora]]. The conference evaluated new methods to study slavery and its impact for the Caribbean.{{sfn|Holou|2016|p=156}}

Henriquez retired in 2004 and worked as an independent historical researcher and consultant for the study of Curaçaoan emancipation for two years, volunteering at organizations to combat violence against women.{{sfn|Statia|2016}} Between 2006 and 2010, Henriquez served at a board member of the Network for Women's Health in Latin America and the Caribbean ({{lang-es|Red de la Salud de Mujeres de Latin America y del Caribe (RSMLAC)}}) and simultaneously from 2009 worked as president of Dedima Foundation, an organization which protects the human rights of Curaçao’s women and children.{{sfn|Holou|2016|p=157}} Between 2005 and 2013, she served as project manager and coordinator of Museum Tula, a former plantation, which bears the name of [[Tula (Curaçao)|Tula]], who led the [[Curaçao Slave Revolt of 1795]]. The museum strives to exhibit materials focused on the socio-economic development of not only Afro-Curaçaoans but the broader Caribbean region. She worked on projects to collect oral history and published a manual on methodologies of oral history in 2013. That same year, she led a project to reconstruct a slave dwelling for the Museum of Afro-Curaçaoan Heritage and assisted with the establishment of the Slavery Heritage Knowledge Centre located at the museum.{{sfn|Statia|2016}}

Henriquez received the Foundation Cultrual Bando Bou Award in 2013 for her work at Museum Tula and was the recipient of the Government of Curaçao’s Cross of Merit in 2015.{{sfn|Holou|2016|p=157}}

In [[logic]], the '''law of identity''' states that each thing is identical with itself. By this it is meant that each thing (be it a [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] or a [[particular]]) is composed of its own unique set of characteristic qualities or features, which the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] called its [[essence]]. It is the first of the [[three classical laws of thought]].

In its [[symbol|symbolic]] representation, "''a''=''a''", "E''pp''", or "For all ''x'': ''x'' = ''x''". 

== Overview ==

In logical discourse, violations of the law of identity result in the [[informal logical fallacy]] known as [[equivocation]].&lt;ref&gt;Things are said to be named 'equivocally' when, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each.&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, we cannot use the same term in the same discourse while having it signify different senses or meanings – even though the different meanings are conventionally prescribed to that term.  [[Corollary|Corollaries]] of the law of identity, "E''pp''", "''p'' [[if and only if]] ''p''", are the [[law of noncontradiction]], "NE''p''N''p''", "not that ''p'' if and only if not ''p''"; and the [[law of excluded middle]], "J''p''N''p''", "''p'' or not ''p'', exclusively",&lt;ref&gt;[[Jozef Maria Bochenski]] (1959), ''Precis of [[Mathematical Logic]]'', rev., Albert Menne, ed. and trans., Otto Bird, New York:  Gordon and Breach, Part II, "The Logic of Sentences", Sect. 3.32, p. 11, and Sect. 3.92, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[prefix]] "J" represents the [[exclusive or]], the [[negation]] of the prefix "E", the [[logical biconditional]].  

In everyday language, violations of the law of identity introduce [[Semantic ambiguity|ambiguity]] into the discourse, making it difficult to form an interpretation at the desired level of specificity. The law of identity also allows for [[Substitution (logic)|substitution]].

== History ==

The earliest recorded use of the law appears to occur in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (185a), wherein [[Socrates]] attempts to establish that what we call "sounds" and "colours" are two different classes of thing:

{{quote|Socrates: With regard to sound and colour, in the first place, do you think this about both: do they exist? &lt;br&gt;Theaetetus: Yes.&lt;br&gt;Socrates: Then do you think that each differs to the other, and ''is identical to itself''?&lt;br&gt;Theaetetus: Certainly.&lt;br&gt;Socrates: And that both are two and each of them one?&lt;br&gt;Theaetetus: Yes, that too.}}

[[Aristotle]] takes recourse to the law of identity—though he does not identify it as such—in an attempt to negatively demonstrate the [[law of non-contradiction]]. However, in doing so, he shows that the law of non-contradiction is not the more fundamental of the two:

{{quote|First then this at least is obviously true, that the word 'be' or 'not be' has a definite meaning, so that not everything will be 'so and not so'. Again, if 'man' has one meaning, let this be 'two-footed animal'; by having one meaning I understand this:-if 'man' means 'X', then if A is a man 'X' will be what 'being a man' means for him. It makes no difference even if one were to say a word has several meanings, if only they are limited in number; for to each definition there might be assigned a different word. For instance, we might say that 'man' has not one meaning but several, one of which would have one definition, viz. 'two-footed animal', while there might be also several other definitions if only they were limited in number; for a peculiar name might be assigned to each of the definitions. If, however, they were not limited but one were to say that the word has an infinite number of meanings, obviously reasoning would be impossible; for not to have one meaning is to have no meaning, and if words have no meaning our reasoning with one another, and indeed with ourselves, has been annihilated; for it is impossible to think of anything if we do not think of one thing; but if this is possible, one name might be assigned to this thing.|Aristotle|source = ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book IV, Part 4, 1006a–b}}

It is used explicitly only once in Aristotle, in a proof in the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h6FTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137|title=From Mathematics to Philosophy (Routledge Revivals)|first=Hao|last=Wang|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ndjfl/1093891315|title=On a passage of Aristotle.|first=Ivo|last=Thomas|date=1 April 1974|publisher=|journal=Notre Dame J. Formal Logic|volume=15|issue=2|pages=347–348|via=Project Euclid|doi=10.1305/ndjfl/1093891315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When A belongs to the whole of B and to C and is affirmed of nothing else, and B also belongs to all C, it is necessary that A and B should be convertible: for since A is said of B and C only, and B is affirmed both of itself and of C, it is clear that B will be said of everything of which A is said, except A itself.|Aristotle|source = ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Book II, Part 22, 68a}}

Both [[Thomas Aquinas]] (''Met.'' IV, lect. 6) and [[Duns Scotus]] (''Quaest. sup. Met.'' IV, Q. 3) follow Aristotle. [[Antonius Andreas]], the Spanish disciple of Scotus (d. 1320), argues that the first place should belong to the law "Every Being is a Being" (''Omne Ens est Ens'', Qq. in Met. IV, Q. 4), but the late scholastic writer [[Francisco Suárez]] (''Disp. Met.'' III, § 3) disagreed, also preferring to follow Aristotle.

Another possible allusion to the same principle may be found in the writings of [[Nicholas of Cusa]] (1431-1464) where he says: {{quote|... there cannot be several things exactly the same, for in that case there would not be several things, but the same thing itself. Therefore all things both agree with and differ from one another.&lt;ref&gt;De Venatione Sapientiae, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] claimed that the law of identity (sometimes called "Leibniz'Law"), which he expresses as "Everything is what it is", is the first primitive truth of reason which is affirmative, and the [[law of noncontradiction]] is the first negative truth (''Nouv. Ess.'' IV, 2, § i), arguing that "the statement that a thing is what it is, is prior to the statement that it is not another thing" (''Nouv. Ess.'' IV, 7, § 9). [[Wilhelm Wundt]] credits [[Gottfried Leibniz]] with the symbolic formulation, "A is A".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Curley |first1=E. M. |date=October 1971 |title=Did Leibniz State "Leibniz'Law"? |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=497-501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Boole]], in the introduction to his treatise ''[[The Laws of Thought]]'' made the following observation with respect to the nature of language and those principles that must inhere naturally within them, if they are to be intelligible:

{{quote|There exist, indeed, certain general principles founded in the very nature of language, by which the use of symbols, which are but the elements of scientific language, is determined. To a certain extent these elements are arbitrary. Their interpretation is purely conventional: we are permitted to employ them in whatever sense we please. But this permission is limited by two indispensable conditions, first, that from the sense once conventionally established we never, in the same process of reasoning, depart; secondly, that the laws by which the process is conducted be founded exclusively upon the above fixed sense or meaning of the symbols employed.|}}

[[John Locke]] (''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' IV. vii. iv. ("Of Maxims") says:

{{quote|[...] whenever the mind with attention considers any proposition, so as to perceive the two ideas signified by the terms, and affirmed or denied one of the other to be the same or different; it is presently and infallibly certain of the truth of such a proposition; and this equally whether these propositions be in terms standing for more general ideas, or such as are less so: e.g., whether the general idea of Being be affirmed of itself, as in this proposition, "whatsoever is, is"; or a more particular idea be affirmed of itself, as "a man is a man"; or, "whatsoever is white is white" [...]}}

[[Afrikan Spir]] proclaims the law of identity as the fundamental law of knowledge, which is opposed to the changing appearance of the empirical reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Forschung nach der Gewissheit in der Erkenntniss der Wirklichkeit'', Leipzig, J.G. Findel, 1869 and ''Denken und Wirklichkeit: Versuch einer Erneuerung der kritischen Philosophie'', Leipzig, J. G. Findel, 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;

When observing spectral lines, different [[Doppler effect|Doppler shifts]] can be observed along a given spectral line, leading to velocity profiles of the object along the slit.]]

In [[astronomy]], '''long-slit spectroscopy''' involves observing an elongated [[Astronomical object|celestial object]] (such as a nebula or along the [[major axis]] of a [[disc galaxy]] at high [[inclination]]) through an elongated slit aperture, and [[refraction|refracting]] this light with a [[Prism (optics)|prism]] or [[diffraction grating]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This type of spectrograph causes the [[Doppler effect#Astronomy|Doppler shift]]-induced frequency distribution of the collected light to manifest as a spatial distribution through differential refraction, revealing the amplitude of the rotation curve.

==Velocity profiles==
[[File:Nebula velocity profiles.jpg|thumb|300px|Typical velocity profiles of several nebulae observed using long-slit spectroscopy.]]
This technique can be used to observe the [[rotation curve]] of a galaxy, as those stars moving towards the observer are [[blueshift|blue-shifted]], while stars moving away are [[redshift|red-shifted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Long-slit spectroscopy can also be used to observe the expansion of [[optical depth|optically-thin]] nebulae. When the spectrographic slit extends over the diameter of a nebula, the lines of the velocity profile meet at the edges. In the middle of the nebula, the line splits in two, since one component is redshifted and one is blueshifted. The blueshifted component will appear brighter as it is on the "near side" of the nebula, and is as such subject to a smaller degree of [[attenuation]] as the light coming from the far side of the nebula. The tapered edges of the velocity profile stem from the fact that the material at the edge of the nebula is moving perpendicular to the line of sight and so its line of sight velocity will be zero relative to the rest of the nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Several effects can contribute to the transverse broadening of the velocity profile. Individual stars themselves rotate as they orbit, so the side approaching will be blueshifted and the side moving away will be redshifted. Stars also have random (as well as [[orbit]]al) motion around the galaxy, meaning any individual star may depart significantly from the rest relative to its neighbours in the rotation curve. In [[Spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]] this random motion is small compared to the [[Orbital eccentricity|low-eccentricity]] orbital motion, but this is not true for an [[elliptical galaxy]]. Molecular-scale [[Doppler broadening]] will also contribute.

==Advantages==
Long-slit spectroscopy can ameliorate problems with [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] when observing structures near a very [[Luminosity#In astronomy|luminous]] source. The structure in question can be observed through a slit, thus [[Occultation|occulting]] the luminous source and allowing a greater [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. An example of this application would be the observation of the [[kinematics]] of [[Herbig–Haro object|Herbig-Haro objects]] around their parent star.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8091">The '''marketplace of ideas''' is a rationale for [[freedom of expression]] based on an [[analogy]] to the [[economics|economic]] concept of a [[free market]]. The marketplace of ideas holds that the [[truth]] will emerge from the competition of ideas in free, transparent public discourse, and concludes that ideas and ideologies will be culled according to their superiority or inferiority and widespread acceptance among the population. The concept is often applied to discussions of [[patent law]] as well as [[freedom of the press]] and the responsibilities of the media in a [[liberal democracy]].

The marketplace of ideas [[metaphor]] is founded in the philosophy of [[John Milton]] in his work "[[Areopagitica]]" in 1644 and also [[John Stuart Mill]]  in his book, ''[[On Liberty]]'' in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ingber |first1=Stanley |title=The Marketplace of Ideas: A Legitimizing Myth |journal=Duke Law Journal |date=February 1984 |issue=1 |page=3 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fa1b/c9ef33f67d03637b24dad1b305a6a7b937b9.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2018 |format=PDF |quote=... this classic image of competing ideas and robust debate dates back to English philosophers John Milton and John Stuart Mill ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later used in opinions by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The first reference to the "free trade in ideas" within "the competition of the market" appears in Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]'s dissent in ''[[Abrams v. United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Abrams v. United States]]'', 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "marketplace of ideas" first appears in a concurring opinion by Justice [[William O. Douglas]] in the Supreme Court decision ''[[United States v. Rumely]]'' in 1953: "Like the publishers of newspapers, magazines, or books, this publisher bids for the minds of men in the market place of ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=First Amendment Fellow |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/holmes%E2%80%99-idea-marketplace-%E2%80%93-its-origins-legacy |title=Holmes’ idea marketplace – its origins &amp; legacy &amp;#124; First Amendment Center – news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition |publisher=Firstamendmentcenter.org |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court's 1969 decision in ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' enshrined the marketplace of ideas as the dominant public policy in [[Freedom of speech in the United States|American free speech law]] (that is, against which narrow exceptions to freedom of speech must be justified by specific countervailing public policies). While the previous cases dealt with natural persons,{{fact|date=September 2018}} the 1976 decision ''[[Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council]]'' expanded it to corporations by creating a curtailed corporate commercial speech right, striking down a government regulation of advertising in the process.&lt;ref name="WeTheCorporations"&gt;{{Cite book |title=We the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights |last=Winkler |first=Adam |publisher=Liveright |year=2018 |isbn=978-0871407122}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has not been seriously questioned since in United States jurisprudence,{{fact|date=September 2018}} but the legacy of those decisions have lead to subsequent decisions like ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' that curtailed the government's ability to regulate corporate speech&lt;ref name="WeTheCorporations"/&gt; and much more expansive advertising campaigns, commercial and political, than Americans had experienced previously.&lt;ref name="Adcreep"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Adcreep: The Case Against Modern Marketing |last=Bartholomew |first=Mark |publisher=Stanford Law Books |year=2017 |isbn=978-0804795814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general idea that free speech should be tolerated because it will lead toward the truth has a long history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1691952 "How Much Does a Belief Cost? Revisiting the Marketplace of Ideas"], Gregory Brazeal, ''Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal'', vol. 21 no. 1, pp. 2–10 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The English poet [[John Milton]] suggested that restricting speech was not necessary because "in a free and open encounter", truth would prevail.&lt;ref&gt;John Milton, ''Areopagitica'', in ''Areopagitica and Of Education'' 1, 50 (Harlan Davidson, Inc. 1951) [1644].&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] argued that it is safe to tolerate "error of opinion ... where reason is left free to combat it".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, ''First Inaugural Address'' (Mar. 4, 1801), in ''Writings'' 492, 493 (Merrill D. Peterson ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrick Siebert echoed the idea that free expression is self-correcting in ''Four Theories of the Press'': "Let all with something to say be free to express themselves. The true and sound will survive. The false and unsound will be vanquished. Government should keep out of the battle and not weigh the odds in favor of one side or the other."&lt;ref&gt;Siebert, Fred S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Q-oePDdcC8C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=siebert+%22true+and+sound%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F20MjjnSpZ&amp;sig=7yvt6AILK4WtDh9aSTKF8iMjaLw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UShsTJKDMoP7lwedorDyAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=true%20and%20sound&amp;f=false "The Libertarian Theory"] in Fred S. Siebert, Theodore Peterson, and Wilbur Schramm's ''Four Theories of the Press: The Authoritarian, Libertarian, Social Responsibility, and Soviet Communist Concepts of What the Press Should Be and Do'', p. 45. Chicago: University of Illinois Press. (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; These writers did not rely on the economic analogy to a market.

If beliefs such as [[religion]]s are considered as ideas, the marketplace of ideas concept favors a marketplace of religions rather than forcing a state religion or forbidding incompatible beliefs. In this sense, it provides a rationale for [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ullman Chiswick|first=Carmel|title=Competition vs. Monopoly in the Religious Marketplace: Judaism in the United States and Israel|url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp7188.pdf|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years questions have arisen regarding the existence of markets in ideas. Several scholars have noted differences between the way ideas are produced and consumed and the way more traditional goods are produced and consumed.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1691952 ''How Much Does a Belief Cost? Revisiting the Marketplace of Ideas''], Gregory Brazeal, ''Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal'', vol. 21 no. 1, p. 1 (2011); ''The Competition of Ideas: Market or Garden?'', Robert Sparrow &amp; Robert Goodin, Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy, vol. 4 no. 2, p. 45 (2001); ''Speech, Truth, and the Free Market for Ideas'', Alvin I. Goldman &amp; James C. Cox, Legal Theory, vol. 2, p. 1 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that the idea of the marketplace of ideas as applied to religion "incorrectly assumes a level playing field" among religions.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Makau Mutua, [http://www.manushi-india.org/pdfs_issues/PDF%20Files%20150/Sankrant%20Sanu.%204-12.pdf ''Facilitating Freedom of Religion or Belief, A Deskbook.'']&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the idea of a marketplace of ideas has been applied to the study of scientific research as a social institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uned.es/dpto_log/jpzb/abstracts.html#The_economics_of_scientific_knowledge |title=Jesús Zamora Bonilla &amp;#124; Dpto.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5572">The '''No–no paradox''' is a distinctive [[paradox]] belonging to the family of the [[semantics|semantic]] paradoxes (like the [[Liar paradox]]). It derives its name from the fact that it consists of two sentences each simply denying what the other says.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==

A variation on the paradox occurs already in [[Thomas Bradwardine]]’s ''Insolubilia''.&lt;ref&gt;Bradwardine, T. (1970), ''Insolubilia'', pp. 304–305, in Roure, M.-L. (1970). ‘La problématique des propositions insolubles au XIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle et au début du XIV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;, suivie de l’édition des traités de W. Shyreswood, W. Burleigh et Th. Bradwardine’, ''Archives d’Histoire Doctrinale et Littéraire du Moyen Âge'' '''37''', pp. 205–326.&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox itself appears as the eighth sophism of chapter 8 of [[John Buridan]]’s ''Sophismata''.&lt;ref&gt;Buridan, J. (2001), ''Summulae de Dialectica'', tr. G. Klima, New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 971.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the paradox has gone largely unnoticed even in the course of the 20th-century revival of the semantic paradoxes, it has recently been rediscovered (and dubbed with its current name) by the US philosopher [[Roy Sorensen]],&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, R. (2001), ''Vagueness and Contradiction'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now appreciated for the distinctive difficulties it presents.&lt;ref&gt;Greenough, P. (2011), 'Truthmaker gaps and the no-no paradox', ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'' '''82''', pp. 547–563.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation==

The notion of [[truth]] seems to be governed by the naive schema:

:(T): The sentence ' ''P'' ' is true if and only if ''P''

(where we use single quotes to refer to the linguistic expression inside the quotes). Consider however the two sentences:

:(N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is not true

:(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not true

Reasoning in [[classical logic]], there are four possibilities concerning (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):

# Both (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are true
# Both (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are not true
# (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is true and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is not true
# (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not true and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is true

Yet, possibilities 1. and 2. are ruled out by the instances of (T) for (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). To wit, possibility 1. is ruled out because, if (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is true, then, by (T), (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is not true; possibility 2. is ruled out because, if (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not true, then, by (T), (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is true. It would then seem that either of possibilities 3. and 4. should obtain. Yet, both of those possibilities would also seem repugnant, as, on each of them, two perfectly symmetrical sentences would mysteriously diverge in [[truth value]].

==Discussion==

Generally speaking, the paradox instantiates the problem of determining the status of ungrounded sentences that are not [[consistency|inconsistent]].&lt;ref&gt;Herzberger, H. (1970), 'Paradoxes of grounding in semantics', ''The Journal of Philosophy'' '''67''', pp. 145–167&lt;/ref&gt; More in particular, the paradox presents the challenge of expanding one’s favourite theory of truth with further principles which either express the symmetry intuition against possibilities 3. and 4.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, G. (2005), 'Words without knowledge', ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'' '''71''', pp. 686–694.&lt;/ref&gt; or make them acceptable in spite of their intuitive repugnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, R. (2001), ''Vagueness and Contradiction'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 165–184.&lt;/ref&gt; Because (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) do not lead to inconsistency, a certain strand in the discussion of the paradox has been willing to assume both the relevant instances of (T) and classical logic, thereby deriving the conclusion that either possibility 3. or possibility 4. holds.&lt;ref&gt;Armour-Garb, B. and J. Woodbridge (2006), 'Dialetheism, semantic pathology, and the open pair', ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy'' '''84''', pp. 395–416.&lt;/ref&gt; Such conclusion has in turn been taken to have momentous consequences for certain influential philosophical theses. Consider, for example, the thesis of [[truthmaker]] maximalism:

:(TM): If a sentence is true, there is something that makes it true&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, D. (2004), ''Truth and Truth-Makers'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

If, as per possibilities 3. and 4., one of (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) or (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is true and the other one is not true, then, given the symmetry between the two sentences, it might seem that there is nothing that makes true whichever of the two is in fact true. If so, (TM) would fail.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, R. (2001), ''Vagueness and Contradiction'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; These and similar conclusions have however been contested by other philosophers on the grounds that, as evidenced by [[Curry's paradox]], joint reliance on (T) and classical logic might be problematic even when it does not lead to inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;López de Sa, D. and E. Zardini (2007), 'Truthmakers, knowledge and paradox', ''Analysis'' '''67''', pp. 242–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Para Brahman''' ([[Sanskrit]]:परब्रह्मन्) ([[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Para Brahman}}'') is the "Highest [[Brahman]]" that which is beyond all descriptions and conceptualisations. It is described in Hindu texts as the formless (in the sense that it is devoid of [[Maya (religion)|Maya]]) spirit (soul) that eternally pervades everything, everywhere in the universe and whatever is beyond.&lt;ref name="PalHuyler2016p55"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pratapaditya Pal|author2=Stephen P. Huyler|author3=John E. Cort et al|title=Puja and Piety: Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist Art from the Indian Subcontinent |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXolDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55  |year=2016|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-28847-8|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus conceptualize the Para Brahman in diverse ways. In the Advaita Vedanta tradition, ''Nirguna Brahman'' (Brahman without qualities) is Para Brahman. In other Vedanta traditions, it is ''[[Saguna brahman|Saguna Brahman]]'' (Brahman with qualities). In [[Vaishnavism]],[[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]],[[Vishnu]],  [[Shiva]] and [[Devi]] respectively, are Para Brahman.{{sfn|White|1970|p=156}}

==Etymology==
''Para'' is a Sanskrit word that means "higher" in some contexts, and "highest or supreme" in others.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European languages, Oxford University Press, Article on ''Para''&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brahman'' connotes the Highest Universal Principle in [[Hinduism]], the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Ultimate Reality]] in the universe.&lt;ref name=james122&gt;James Lochtefeld, ''Brahman'', The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ptraju&gt;PT Raju (2006), Idealistic Thought of India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1406732627}}, page 426 and Conclusion chapter part XII&lt;/ref&gt; In major schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] it is the material, efficient, formal and final [[Four causes|cause]] of all that exists.&lt;ref name=ptraju/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mariasusai Dhavamony (2002), Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Theological Soundings and Perspectives, Rodopi Press, {{ISBN|978-9042015104}}, pages 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fxclooney&gt;For dualism school of Hinduism, see: Francis X. Clooney (2010), Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries between Religions, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199738724}}, pages 51-58, 111-115;&lt;br&gt;For monist school of Hinduism, see: B Martinez-Bedard (2006), Types of Causes in Aristotle and Sankara, Thesis - Department of Religious Studies (Advisors: Kathryn McClymond and Sandra Dwyer), Georgia State University, pages 18-35&lt;/ref&gt; Brahman is a key concept found in [[Vedas]], and extensively discussed in the early [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref name=sphilips&gt;Stephen Philips (1998), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Brahman to Derrida (Editor; Edward Craig), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415187077}}, pages 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Para Brahman means the "Highest Brahman". It is found in early Advaita Vedanta literature.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Comans (2002), The Method of Early Advaita Vedānta, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120817227}}, pages 129-130, 216-231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advaita Vedanta - Nirguna Brahman==
''Nirguna Brahman'' ([[Devanagari]] निर्गुण ब्रह्मन्, ''Nirguṇa Brahman''), Brahman without form or qualities,{{sfn|Sullivan|2001|p=148}} is Para Brahman, the highest Brahman. According to [[Adi Shankara]], Nirguna Brahman is Para Brahman,{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=116}}{{sfn|Malkovsky|1997|p=541}} and is a state of complete knowledge of self as being identical with the transcendental Brahman, a state of mental-spiritual enlightenment (Jnana yoga).{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}} It contrasts with Saguna Brahman which is a state of loving awareness (Bhakti yoga).{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}} Advaita Vedanta non-dualistically holds that Brahman is divine, the Divine is Brahman, and this is identical to that which is [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (one's soul, innermost self) and nirguna (attribute-less), infinite, love, truth, knowledge, "being-consciousness-bliss".{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|pp=9-14}}

According to Eliot Deutsch, ''Nirguna Brahman'' is a "state of being"{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=12}} in which all dualistic distinctions between one's own soul and Brahman are obliterated and are overcome.{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}} In contrast, ''Saguna Brahman'' is where the distinctions are harmonized after duality between one's own soul and Brahman has been accepted.{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}}

Advaita describes the features of a nondualistic experience,{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}} in which a subjective experience also becomes an "object" of knowledge and a phenomenal reality. The Absolute Truth is both subject and object, so there is no qualitative difference:
* "Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavān." ([[Bhagavata Purana]] 1.2.11)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iskconpress.com/books/sb/1/2/11|title=Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 1.2.11|last=A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|''vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam, yaj jnanam advayam brahmeti paramatmeti, bhagavan iti sabdyate''}}
* "Whoever realizes the Supreme Brahma attains to supreme felicity. That Supreme Brahma is Eternal Truth (satyam), Omniscient (jnanam), Infinite (anantam)." ([[Taittiriya Upanishad]] 2.1.1){{refn|group=note|''brahma-vid apnoti param, tad eshabhyukta, satyam jnanam anantam brahma''}}

The Upanishads state that the Supreme Brahma is Eternal, Conscious, and Blissful [[Satcitananda|sat-chit-ânanda]]. The realisation of this truth is the same as ''being'' this truth:
* "The One is Bliss. Whoever perceives the Blissful One, the reservoir of pleasure, becomes blissful forever." ([[Taittiriya Upanishad]] 2.7.1-2){{refn|group=note|''raso vai sa, rasam hy evayam labdhvanandi bhavati''}}
* "Verily know the Supreme One to be Bliss." ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 2.9.28)

==Vaishnavism ==
In [[Vaishnavism]], [[Vishnu]] or [[Krishna]] (among other incarnations of Vishnu) is considered as Para Brahman.Vishnu in his Mahavishnu form is considered to be the supreme. According to Bhagavat Purana,when Arjuna asked the true reality about Krishna,he revealed his Mahavishnu form showing that he is the supreme form of souls,demons,deities and qualities,namely,Sattva,Rajas and Tamas.

==Shaivism==
In [[Shaivism]], [[Shiva]] is Para Brahman.Parashiva,the supreme form of Lord Shiva,is considered to the Para Brahman.According to mythology, Parashiva is not much significant in Vedas and Upanishads, but it is said that Lord Parashiva is the single incarnation of all souls and deities.He is also depicted as the only Adipurusha or Mahadeva.

==Shaktism==
In [[Shaktism]], Devi [[Kali|Mahakali]], the supreme form of Devi [[Adi parashakti]], is considered to the Para Brahman, ultimate reality, inseparably. According to Devi Suktam in [[Rigveda]] she is the womb of all creation. Thus Kali is epithets is Brahmamayi, meaning "She Whose Essence is Brahman". Her eternal abode is [[Manidvipa]].

== Sikhism ==
Parbrahm is regarded as the supreme reality in [[Sikhism]]. It is also known as "Akaal purakh" (immortal being) and is also known by mantra "[[Waheguru]]" . 

Sikh scripture and the last sikh guru, [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]] refers to Parbrahm with a variety of adjectives and nouns , such as Nirankar, Niranjan, Bhagat Vachhal , Kirpal , Dayal, Deen Dayal , Madho, Raam, Hari, Allah, Rahim, Karim, Rehman, Parvardigar, Sahib, Malik , etc.....

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20806">A '''plot twist''' is a [[literary technique]] that introduces a radical change in the direction or expected outcome of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] in a work of fiction.&lt;ref name="SingletonConrad2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ralph Stuart Singleton|author2=James A.

Co.|isbn=978-1-58065-022-9|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it happens near the end of a story, it is known as a '''twist''' or '''surprise ending'''.&lt;ref name="KayGelshenen2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Judith Kay|author2=Rosemary Gelshenen|title=Discovering Fiction Student's Book 2: A Reader of American Short Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7Wov3lQ4K8C&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=27 July 2013|date=26 February 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00351-3|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may change the audience's perception of the preceding events, or introduce a new conflict that places it in a different context. A plot twist may be [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]], to prepare the audience to accept it. There are a variety of methods used to execute a plot twist, such as withholding information from the audience or misleading them with ambiguous or false information.

Revealing a plot twist to readers or viewers in advance is commonly regarded as a "[[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]", since the effectiveness of a plot twist usually relies on the audience not expecting it. Even revealing the fact that a work contains plot twists – especially at the ending – can also be controversial, as it changes the audience's expectations. However, at least one study suggests that this does not affect the enjoyment of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Lehrer, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/ Spoilers Don’t Spoil Anything], '' Wired Science Blogs''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early examples==
An early example of the romance genre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–2|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale "[[The Three Apples]]". It begins with a fisherman discovering a locked chest. The first twist occurs when the chest is broken open and a dead body is found inside. The initial search for the murderer fails, and a twist occurs when two men appear, separately claiming to be the murderer. A complex chain of events finally reveals the murderer to be the investigator's own slave.

==Mechanics==
{{section refimprove|date=September 2014}}
Literary analysts have identified several common categories of plot twists, based on how they are executed.

===Anagnorisis===
''[[Anagnorisis]]'', or discovery, is the protagonist's sudden recognition of their own or another character's true identity or nature.&lt;ref name="Baldick2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this technique, previously unforeseen character information is revealed. A notable example of anagnorisis occurs in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'': [[Oedipus]] kills his father and marries his mother in ignorance, learning the truth only toward the climax of the play.&lt;ref&gt;John MacFarlane, "Aristotle's Definition of Anagnorisis." ''American Journal of Philology'' - Volume 121, Number 3 (Whole Number 483), Fall 2000, pp. 367-383.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of this device as a twist ending in a [[crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] discovers by chance a key item towards the end of the story that reveals the culprit behind the murder to be his own slave all along.&lt;ref name=Pinault&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marzolph&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s 1999 film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', a main character, who struggles with his failure to help a former patient who shot him, resolves his conflict by helping a boy who believes he communicates with dead people, only to discover that he didn't survive the shooting and is one of the dead people being helped. In the 2001 film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]],'' a mother is convinced that her house is being haunted; at the end of the film, she learns that she and her children are really the ghosts. In the episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' titled "[[Five Characters in Search of an Exit]]", the viewer discovers at the climax that the characters are discarded toys in a [[clothing bin|donation bin]].&lt;!-- This fact is self evident by watching the episode.--&gt; In ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', [[Edward Norton]]'s character realizes that Tyler Durden ([[Brad Pitt]]) is his own [[multiple personality]]. A mental patient in the horror film ''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'' reveals that the three persons she is talking to are all actually herself. Sometimes the audience may discover that the true identity of a character is, in fact, unknown, as in ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' or the eponymous assassins in ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]''.

===Flashback===
[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]], or analepsis, a sudden, vivid reversion to a past event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, surprises the reader with previously unknown information that solves a mystery, places a character in a different light, or reveals the reason for a previously inexplicable action. The [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' employed this type of surprise ending. Sometimes this is combined with the above category, as the flashback may reveal the true identity of one of the characters, or that the protagonist is related to one of the villain's past victims, as [[Sergio Leone]] did with [[Charles Bronson]]'s character in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' or [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s ''[[The Odessa File]]''. The TV series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' and manga (twice made into a movie) ''[[Old Boy (manga)|Old Boy]]'' uses similar twists.

===Unreliable narrator===
An [[unreliable narrator]] twists the ending by revealing, almost always at the end of the narrative, that the narrator has manipulated or fabricated the preceding story, thus forcing the reader to question their prior assumptions about the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA347|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Motif (literature)|motif]] is often used within [[noir fiction]] and [[Film noir|films]], notably in the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. An unreliable narrator motif was employed by Agatha Christie in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', a novel that generated much controversy due to critics' contention that it was unfair to trick the reader in such a manipulative manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011224193140/http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-12-24 |title=The ubiquitous unreliable narrator |publisher=My.en.com |date=1996-03-26 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of unreliable narration is a character who has been revealed to be insane and thus causes the audience to question the previous narrative; notable examples of this are in the [[Terry Gilliam]] film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (and [[David Fincher]]'s [[Fight Club|film adaptation]]), [[Gene Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[Book of the New Sun]]'', the second episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', [[Iain Pears]]'s ''[[An Instance of the Fingerpost]]'', ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' and [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[Life's Lottery]]''.

===Peripeteia===
''[[Peripeteia]]'' is a sudden reversal of the protagonist's fortune, whether for good or ill, that emerges naturally from the character's circumstances.&lt;ref name="PayneBarbera2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Payne|author2=Jessica Rae Barbera|title=A Dictionary of Cultural and Critical Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjSl5y_i8TEC&amp;pg=PA689|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=31 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-2346-7|page=689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the ''deus ex machina'' device, peripeteia must be logical within the frame of the story. An example of a reversal for ill would be [[Agamemnon]]'s sudden murder at the hands of his wife [[Clytemnestra]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia]]'' or the inescapable situation [[Kate Hudson]]'s character finds herself in at the end of ''[[The Skeleton Key]]''. This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', most effectively in the episode "[[Time Enough at Last]]" where [[Burgess Meredith]]'s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his glasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton's suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]''.

===Deus ex machina===
''[[Deus ex machina]]'' is a Latin term meaning "god out of the machine." It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot.&lt;ref name="Shipley1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=156|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theater]], the "deus ex machina" ('ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (μηχανῆς—''mechanes''), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god's will. In its modern, figurative sense, the "deus ex machina" brings about an ending to a narrative through unexpected (generally happy) resolution to what appears to be a problem that cannot be overcome (see [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[History of the World, Part I]]''). This device is often used to end a bleak story on a more positive note.

===Poetic justice===
[[Poetic justice]] is a literary device in which [[virtue]] is ultimately rewarded or [[vice]] punished in such a way that the reward or punishment has a logical connection to the deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA439|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=439|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern literature, this device is often used to create an [[Irony|ironic]] twist of fate in which the villain gets caught up in his/her own trap. For example, in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'', Prince Rabadash climbs upon a mounting block during the battle in Archenland. Upon jumping down while shouting "The bolt of [[Tash (Narnia)|Tash]] falls from above," his [[hauberk]] catches on a hook and leaves him hanging there, humiliated and trapped. Another example of poetic justice can be found in [[John Boyne]]'s ''[[The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas]]'', in which a [[concentration camp]] commander's son is mistakenly caught up with inmates rounded up for gassing, or in [[Chris Van Allsburg]]'s picture book, ''[[The Sweetest Fig]]'', where a cold-hearted dentist is cruel to his dog, and ends up getting his comeuppance.

===Chekhov's gun===
[[Chekhov's gun]] refers to a seemingly minor character or plot element introduced early in the narrative that suddenly acquires great importance to the narrative. One example of this is the beggar woman in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]''. At the end of the musical, she is revealed to be the main character's wife.&lt;ref name="BergmanLambert2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gregory Bergman|author2=Josh Lambert|title=Geektionary: From Anime to Zettabyte, An A to Z Guide to All Things Geek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbYLQfZrUPcC&amp;pg=PA201|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=18 December 2010|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4405-1188-2|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar mechanism is the "plant", a preparatory device that repeats throughout the story. During the resolution, the true significance of the plant is revealed.

===Red herring===
A [[red herring]] is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution.&lt;ref name="Asong2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linus Asong|title=Detective Fiction and the African Scene: From the Whodunit? to the Whydunit?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGH1BpSyI2AC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-02-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device usually appears in [[detective fiction|detective novels]] and [[mystery fiction]]. The red herring is a type of [[wikt:misdirection|misdirection]], a device intended to distract the [[protagonist]], and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film ''[[Gupt: The Hidden Truth]]'' cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named "Bishop Aringarosa" draw attention away from the true master villain ("Aringarosa" literally translates as "pink herring"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel [[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]] (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].

=== False protagonist ===
A [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins.

===In medias res===
''[[In medias res]]'' ([[Latin]] for "into the middle of things") is a literary technique in which narrative proceeds from the middle of the story rather than its beginning.&lt;ref name="Clifford2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Clifford|title=The Middle School Writing Toolkit: Differentiated Instruction Across the Content Areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofntq_pjaocC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Maupin House Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929895-75-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information such as characterization, setting, and motive is revealed through a series of [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s. This technique creates a twist when the cause for the inciting incident is not revealed until the climax. This technique is used within the film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' in which the opening scenes show one of the main characters drowning and the other being imprisoned. Subsequent scenes reveal the events leading up to these situations through a series of flashbacks. In ''[[Monsters (2010 film)|Monsters]]'', a similar beginning proves to be a flashforward as it is the linear conclusion of the events that then follow; this is not apparent until the end. ''In medias res'' is often used to provide a [[narrative hook]].

===Non-linear narrative===
A [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.&lt;ref name="Steiff2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc. Productions |publisher=Plotsinc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse chronology===
[[Reverse chronology]] works by revealing the plot in reverse order, i.e., from final event to initial event.&lt;ref name="Philips2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Edward Philips|title=Writing African History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq5wGaae5qkC&amp;pg=PA507|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2006|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-256-3|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike chronological storylines, which progress through causes before reaching a final effect, reverse chronological storylines reveal the final effect before tracing the causes leading up to it; therefore, the initial cause represents a "twist ending". Examples employing this technique include the films ''[[Irréversible]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' and ''[[5x2]]'', the play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Harold Pinter]], and [[Martin Amis]]' ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]''. [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[George Furth|George Furth's]] [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]] and the [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(play)|1934 Kaufman and Hart play]] that inspired it both tell the story of the main characters in reverse order.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9038">'''The process theory of composition''' (hereafter referred to as "process") is a field of [[composition studies]] that focuses on writing as a process rather than a product. Based on Janet Emig's breakdown of the [[writing process]],&lt;ref&gt;Emig, Janet. The Composing Processes of Twelfth Graders. Urbana: NCTE, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; the process is centered on the idea that students determine the content of the course by exploring the craft of writing using their own interests, language, techniques, voice, and freedom, and where students learn what people respond to and what they don't.&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;Murray, Donald. "Teach Writing as a Process Not a Product." 1972. Reprinted in ''Cross-Talk in Comp Theory: A Reader''. Ed. Victor Villanueva. 2nd ed. Urbana: NCTE, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. "Writing Without Teachers." Oxford: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; Classroom activities often include peer work where students themselves are teaching, reviewing, brainstorming, and editing.&lt;ref name="murray" /&gt;

== How process began ==
Historically, the ideas behind process were born out of increased college enrollment thanks to the GI Bill following World War II. Writing instructors began giving students more group work and found that, with guidance, students were able to identify and recognize areas that needed improvement in other students' papers, and that criticism also helped students recognize their own areas to strengthen [cite]. Composition scholars such as Janet Emig, Peter Elbow, and Donald Murray began considering how these methods could be used in the writing classroom. Emig, in her book, The Composing Processes of Twelfth Graders, broke down writing into distinct parts; these were later simplified into a basic three-step process by Murray: prewriting, writing, and rewriting (also called "revision").[2]

Process also gained prominence in the collegiate world as a reaction against the formalism composition methods, sometimes called "current-traditional" methods, that encouraged adherence to established modes of writing, such as the five-paragraph essay.

== Teaching methods and implications ==
Process can be taught using a variety of methods intended to strengthen the relationship between students and instructor. In other words, classroom discussion and activities center on students' ability to mimic what has come before in hopes that they will understand what good writing is and learn to mimic it. Some of the methods include:
&lt;br /&gt;'''Prewriting activities.''' These could include brainstorming and/or other freewriting activities, drawing conceptual maps, participating in an ethnographic study, research, and more.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Drafting.''' Class time can be spent writing papers, and students can ask instructors for ideas or help.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Revision.''' Instructors can designate class time for the revision of drafts and direct students to focus on rhetorical strategies.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Portfolio-based assessment.''' Students are given a deadline, such as the end of a semester, and a goal, such as demonstrating skills like rhetorical awareness, conventional thinking, and source acceptance and integration. The intervening time is spent drafting and revising papers. Composition instructors serve as final authorities on the quality of work, helping students explore areas foreign to them, rather than more free wheeling teachers who tell students how to express their individuality. From among the papers they work on in the semester, students choose the papers the instructor considers to be their best and put them in a portfolio, which is graded by the instructor. Often students are graded on their drafts during the semester as well as on the work they produce at the end of it.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Reflection''' on the writing process.

== Critiques of Process ==
Thomas Kent argues that process theories insist, “writing can be captured by a generalized process or a Big Theory,” and that process theory makes three central claims about writing: “(1) writing is private; (2) writing is not up for interpretation; and (3) writing can, and should be, highly organized.” &lt;ref name="kent"&gt;Kent, Thomas. "Post-Process Theory: Beyond the Writing Process Paradigm." Southern Illinois University: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

When writing is conceived of and taught as a prescriptive and generalizable “process,” according to Gary Olson, useful implications arise in the creation of a Theory of Writing, a master narrative that attempts to “systematize something that simply is not susceptible to systematization.” &lt;ref name="kent" /&gt;

Similarly, George Pullman positions the writing process movement as a rhetorical narrative, positioned in history as a result of writing as an undervalued, utilitarian skill that could be universally transmitted in higher education (17). This emerged from “current traditional rhetoric” that originated at Harvard in the 1880s and peaked in the late 1960s. Writing became a highly scientific affair, rooted exclusively in empirical observation. Post-process theorists argue, however, that if the writing process “were really the way all successful writers write regardless of context, then unless all writing is somehow supportive of a single ideological system, there would be no obfuscatory ideological baggage attending the process." &lt;ref name="kent" /&gt;

Theorists continue to discuss pedagogical and systemic implications of both process and post-process approaches to composition.

Process theorists themselves have had to identify and work around certain constraints the process method brings with it; namely:

=== Constraints for students ===
If papers are not graded throughout the semester, students don't have any idea of the grade they are earning. Also, students might not be inclined to take control of the class content and decide what they want to explore; they may expect the instructor to provide material for them. Additionally, students may not improve their grammar and other writing conventions if content is emphasized over form.

=== Constraints for composition instructors ===
Composition classes are often overfilled, so instructors have to spend much of their time reading through drafts. Power can also be a struggle, for if student grades depend on a portfolio, then instructors have to find ways of encouraging and/or enforcing attendance.
And if there are no rules as to what students may and may not write about, instructors have to be well-versed in a variety of discourses and ready to deal with conflict that may arise when two or more discourses meet (sometimes called a [[contact zone]]). Instructors must also find ways to encourage each student to explore and bring content to the course and must deal with diversity and a range of opinions on what should be done in the course.

Process rose to prominence in composition classrooms during the late 1960s and enjoyed its status as the gold standard method of teaching through the 1980s and into the 1990s. Many of its tenets are still used today; however, its popularity and methods have brought criticism from different composition theorists, such as [[post-process (theory of composition)|post-process]] theorists, who charge that:
*Process theory is rules-oriented just like the current-traditional method it had sought to escape.&lt;ref name="tobin"&gt;Tobin, Lad. "Process Pedagogy." A Guide to Composition Pedagogies. Ed. Tate, et al. Oxford UP: 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
*It doesn't teach basic skills and conventions (grammar, style, etc.).&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt;
*It doesn't acknowledge issues of race/class/gender because it was so focused on the writer's language and experience.&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt;
*It doesn't recognize the significance of context, again because it was focused on the writer's experience.&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt;

TESL Canada Journal [Online], 32.1 (2014): 1.&lt;/ref&gt; has explored the pedagogical potentials of post-process theory in an article entitled "[http://teslcanadajournal.ca/index.php/tesl/article/view/1196 A Practice-Oriented Definition of Post-Process Second Language Writing Theory]".

'''S.M.S''' (Shit Must Stop) is a collection of artist's portfolios that are conceived by [[William Copley (artist)|William Copley]] and [[Dimitri Petrov]] as they speak about the long relationships with the artists. The collection has been published biweekly from February to December 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.M.S Homepage|url=http://sms.sensatejournal.com/|website=S.M.S|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each issue is composed of diverse art pieces, created by individual artist that were important at that period. The portfolios has a wide range of different aspects such as [[dada]], [[surrealism]], and [[pop art]] that includes photography, sound, drawings and writings.

This project has been inspired by the [[Fluxus|Fluxus movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boivent|first1=Marie|title=La revue d’artiste – Enjeux et spécificités d’une pratique artistique|date=2015|edition=Incertain Sens|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which encouraged diverse artists to come together as a form of a protest against galleries, not agreeing to them having the authority to determine the value of art. So by bringing artist together without any establishments, which by means, without being judged and determined, played equally in their specific art areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SMS|url=http://www.colophon.com/SMS|website=Colophon|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each portfolio within the issue, is a dossier about the subject of personal impressions, and the way to establish their relationship between artist’s impulse and impersonal meanings of practical reproduction. After merging them with the daily life, "Shit must Stop" shows the artist how to come to terms with forces that often drive them into the seclusion of the studio.

== Publication ==

=== Shit Must Stop N°1 ===

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.M.S Artist's Book|url=http://cdm.reed.edu/cdm4/artbooks/sms.php|website=Reed Digital Collection|accessdate=5 May 2016}}{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First edition of Shit Must Stop contains 11 different portfolios from important artists, ([[Irving Petlin]], [[Su Braden]], [[James Lee Byars]], [[Christo]], [[Walter De Maria|Walter de Maria]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Kaspar Koening]], [[Julien Levy]], [[Sol Mednick]], [[Nancy Reitkopf]], [[La Monte Young]] &amp; [[Marian Zazeela]]). The artists scaled their project into similar format, in this edition, into a small size packet. In this case, Christo who works with large environmental collaborations, scaled down his works in order to create a small sized two dimensinal diorama. Julian Levy also contributed a list of prescriptions for faux medications, capsules for artists he determined in need of treatment. Both of these allow for the artist's voice to shine through, while still maintaining the integrity of William Copley's project. This issue reads more like a journal than the following issue that seems more interactive.

=== Shit Must Stop N°2 ===
This Second issue is more experimental with [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Nicolas Calas]], [[Bruce Conner]], Marcia Herscovitz, [[Alain Jacquet]], [[Ray Johnson]], [[Lee Lozano]], [[Meret Oppenheim]], Bernard Pfreim, [[George Reavey|George Reavevy]], [[Clovis Trouille]].

The cover, designed by Marcel Duchamp, is a white folder with a playable record album attached to the front. Printed on the record itself is ESQUIVONS LES ECCHYMOSES DES ESQUIMAUX AUX MOTS EXQUIS, which roughly translates to “dodge the Eskimo bruises with exquisite words,” but functions as a sort of French tongue twister. Duchamp seems to be playfully addressing the restrictions inherent in more traditional portfolio design in order to redefine this practice. The record has aesthetic appeal, but it similarly has far greater use value than the first issue’s front cover, which was a reproduction of a painting. Another particularly provocative work in Shit Must Stop N°2 is Bruce Connor’s Legal Tender. Connor mimics the design of American currency with his stack of eighteen “dollar bills,” which seem more reminiscent of Monopoly money than American legal tender. This element allows for the whole issue to feel like a game, as if you could trade Connor’s money for something more valuable.

=== Shit Must Stop N°3 ===
Third publication is conceived by 12 artists ([[John Battan]], [[Aftograf]], [[Enrico Baj]], [[Billy Copley]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Roland Penrose]], [[Man Ray]], [[H C Westermann|H.C Westermann]], [[Hannah Weiner]], [[Terry Riley]].

It contains the widest variety of objects. It features two Terry Riley cassettes, four pieces of mail from H.C. Westermann seemingly addressed to the reader, and even an original Man Ray readymade. Terry Riley, who is famously known for his innovative avant-garde musical compositions, contributed two beautifully packaged cassettes, which feel like gifts in their own right. H.C. Westermann, who is known for his playful line drawings, mailed four drawings to William Copley, who reproduced them to an exact degree in this issue. In the sealed envelopes are four proposals, with Westermann’s own notes included. Opening these letters feels as though we are receiving mail from Westermann ourselves, which seems to have been Copley’s intention by including in the issue exactly what he received from Westermann.

=== Shit Must Stop N°4 ===
Artist ([[Robert C. Stanley|Robert Stanley]], [[Arman]], Paul Bergtold, [[John Cage]], [[Hollis Frampton]], [[On Kawara]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Lil Picard]], Domenico Rotella, [[Robert Watts]], Princess Winifred, [[La Monte Young]], [[Marian Zazeela]])

Each piece is laden with a conceptual mythology that can be thoroughly investigated or just taken at face value, which seems a great leap from the playful nature of the first few issues. A particularly interesting work from Shit Must Stop N°4 is Lil Picard’s burned bowtie. Each bowtie was hand burned, thus each number in the edition is slightly varied. The maroon and white polka dotted tie first appears as a joyful addition, but the burned edges seem a quite poignant dissenting argument. Other interesting works are Rotella’s prison poems, which were clandestinely written on scraps of paper during a five-month prison sentence in Rome, Italy. The tactile nature of the poems as works of art in their own right seems important for the overall impact of the piece, which elegantly replicates a minute part of Rotella’s prison experience.

=== Shit Must Stop N°5 ===
Participated artists are, Congo, [[William Anthony (artist)|William Anthony]], Wall Batterton, [[William Copley (artist)|William Copley]], [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]], [[Neil Jenney|Neil Jenny]], [[Angus MacLise]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Mel Ramos]], Robert Rohm, [[William Schwendler|William Schwedler]], [[Diane Wakoski]], [[Lawrence Weiner]]

Unlike the previous issues, this one doesn’t appear to be projecting a specific sensibility upon the reader, thus making it seem more disparate than the others. This seems to be best exemplified by Yoko Ono’s contribution, entitled Mend Piece for John, which instructs, “Take your favourite cup. Break it in many pieces with a hammer. Repair it with this glue and this poem.” Included is a cardboard box containing a ribbon, plastic bag, instructions, a poem, and a tube of glue. Although Ono created this piece years before the Beatles disbanded, it seems almost precognitive of the years to come. Another similarly disparate piece from this issue is the front cover, which was painted by Congo, the chimpanzee, for a study of the creative potential of apes. It has been noted that Congo was the only chimpanzee who appeared to make aesthetic decisions about his painting, and thus could be featured alongside these other artists for the issue. Like Ono’s piece, Congo’s painting seems eerily foreboding with its large red and black smears of paint.

=== Shit Must Stop N°6 ===
The last issue produced makes a valorous attempt at preserving the initial integrity of the project that includes, [[Richard Artschwager]], [[Ed Bereal]], [[Diter Rot]], [[Betty Dodson]], Ronoldo Ferri, [[John Giorno]], Toby Mussman, Adrian Nutbeem, [[Claes Oldenburg]], Mischa Petrov, Jean Reavey, [[Bernar Venet]].

[[Richard Artschwager]]’s cover design is a simple image of a black shape reproduced on each surface of the cover, both inside and out, with reproductions of the exact coffee stains he accidentally made when producing the original. By approving of this accident, and reproducing it for the cover, Artschwager, and [[William Copley (artist)|Copley]] seem to be making an argument about the place of beauty and mistake in the contemporary art world. The rest of the pieces in this final issue seem to be playful and mischievous manifestations of this same idea, with Adrian Nutbeem’s unsolvable crossword as well as Claes Oldenburg’s Unattended Lunches. The issue also comes with an apology, which reads, “The publishers of the Letter Edged in Black Press, Inc. regretfully announce that this is the last issue of Shit Must Stop that will appear. We have appreciated your support and hope you will remember our effort with appreciation.” The vague nature of the card supports the mischievous nature of this issue’s contents, while still maintaining the sincerity of the project.

* Damien Keown: "Although Buddhist doctrine holds that neither the beginning of the process of cyclic rebirth nor its end can ever be known with certainty, it is clear that the number of times a person may be reborn is almost infinite. This process of repeated rebirth is known as saṃsāra or 'endless wandering', a term suggesting continuous movement like the flow of a river. All living creatures are part of this cyclic movement and will continue to be reborn until they attain nirvana."{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle locations 702-706}}
* Ajahn Sucitto: "This continued movement is [...] what is meant by samsāra, the wandering on. According to the Buddha, this process doesn't even stop with death—it's like the habit transfers almost genetically to a new consciousness and body."{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|pp=37-38}}}} Samsara is characterized by ''[[dukkha]]'' ("unsatisfactory," "painful").{{refn|group=note|Samsara is characterized by ''dukkha'':

===Mechanism===
The Saṃsāra doctrine of Buddhism asserts that while beings undergo endless cycles of rebirth, there is no changeless soul that transmigrates from one lifetime to another - a view that distinguishes its Saṃsāra doctrine from that in [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]].{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=58, Quote: "Buddhism shares with Hinduism the doctrine of Samsara, whereby all beings pass through an unceasing cycle of birth, death and rebirth until they find a means of liberation from the cycle.

==Cause and end==
Samsara is perpetuated by one's karma, which is caused by craving and [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]] (''avidya'').{{sfn|Keown|2004|pp=81, 281}}{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=39–42}}{{refn|group=note|name="Ignorance and craving"}}

===Karma===
{{Main|Karma in Buddhism}}

Samsara is perpetuated by karma.{{refn|group=note|The driving force behind rebirth in the six realms of samsara is karma:
* Peter Harvey: "The movement of beings between rebirths is not a haphazard process but is ordered and governed by the law of karma, the principle that beings are reborn according to the nature and quality of their past actions; they are 'heir' to their actions (M.III.123)."{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=39}}
* Damien Keown: "In the cosmology [of the realms of existence], karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. Individuals are thus the sole authors of their good and bad fortune."{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Location 794-797}}
* Sogyal Rinpoche states: "The kind of birth we will have in the next life is determined, then, by the nature of our actions in this one. And it is important never to forget that the effect of our actions depends entirely upon the intention or motivation behind them, and not upon their scale."{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|p=97}}
* Rupert Gethin: "What determines in which realm a being is born? The short answer is karma (Pali kamma): a being’s intentional ‘actions’ of body, speech, and mind—whatever is done, said, or even just thought with definite intention or volition. In general, though with some qualification, rebirth in the lower realms is considered to be the result of relatively unwholesome (akuśala/akusala), or bad (pāpa) karma, while rebirth in the higher realms the result of relatively wholesome (kuśala/kusala), or good (puṇya/puñña) karma."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=119}}
* Paul Williams: "short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one's own karma; this endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath is ''Saṃsāra''."{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=74-75}}}} Karma or 'action' results from an intentional physical or mental act, which causes a future consequence.{{refn|group=note|Aṅguttara Nikāya III.415: "It is "intention" that I call karma; having formed the intention, one performs acts (karma) by body, speech and mind.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p= 120}}}} Gethin explains:
{{quote|Thus acts of body and speech are driven by an underlying intention or will ([[cetanā]]), and they are unwholesome or wholesome because they are motivated by unwholesome or wholesome intentions. Acts of body and speech are, then, the end products of particular kinds of mentality. At the same time karma can exist as a simple 'act of will', a forceful mental intention or volition that does not lead to an act of body or speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rupert Gethin|title=The Foundations of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUwSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-289223-2|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Buddhist view, therefore, the type of birth one has in this life is determined by actions or ''karma'' from the previous lives; and the circumstances of the future rebirth are determined by the actions in the current and previous lives.{{refn|group=note|Padmasambhava: "If you want to know your past life, look into your present condition; if you want to know your future life, look at your present actions."{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|p=97}} }}

===Craving and ignorance===
Inconsistencies in the oldest texts show that the Buddhist teachings on craving and ignorance, and the means to attain liberation, evolved, either during the lifetime of the Buddha, or thereafter.{{refn|group=note|See:&lt;br&gt;* Erich Frauwallner (1953), ''Geschichte der indischen Philosophie'', Band  ''Der Buddha und der Jina'' (pp. 147-272)&lt;br&gt;* Andre Bareau (1963), ''Recherches sur la biographie du Buddha dans les Sutrapitaka et les Vinayapitaka anciens'', Ecole Francaise d'Extreme-Orient&lt;br&gt;* Schmithausen, ''On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of 'Liberating Insight' and 'Enlightenment' in Early Buddhism''&lt;br&gt;* K.R.

The later Buddhist tradition considers [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]] (''avidya'') to be the root cause of samsara.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi}}{{sfn|Keown|2004|pp=81, 281}}{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=39–42}} Avidya is misconception and ignorance about reality, leading to grasping and clinging, and repeated rebirth.{{sfn|Edelglass|2009|p=3-4}}{{sfn|Laumakis|2008|p=136}} According to Paul Williams, "it is the not-knowingness of things as they truly are, or of oneself as one really is."{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2012|p=46–47}} It can be overcome by insight into the true nature of reality. In the later Buddhist tradition "liberating insight" came to be regarded as equally liberating as the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, this happened in response to other religious groups in India, who held that a liberating insight was an indispensable requisite for ''moksha'', liberation from rebirth.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxii, xxxiii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}{{refn|group=note|Tillmann Vetter: "Very likely the cause was the growing influence of a non-Buddhist spiritual environment·which claimed that one can be released only by some truth or higher knowledge. In addition, the alternative (and perhaps sometimes competing) method of discriminating insight (fully established after the introduction of the four noble truths) seemed to conform so well to this claim."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiii}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Bronkhorst, this happened under influence of the "mainstream of meditation," that is, Vedic-Brahmanical oriented groups, which believed that the cessation of action could not be liberating, since action can never be fully stopped. Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions. By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating. What exactly was regarded as the central insight "varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}}}

The ideas on what exactly constituted this "liberating insight" evolved over time.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chapter 7}} Initially the term ''prajna'' served to denote this "liberating insight." Later on, ''prajna'' was replaced in the suttas by the [[Four Noble Truths|four truths]].{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} This happened in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhanas, and where this practice of the four jhanas then culminates in "liberating insight."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}}{{refn|group=note|In the Nikayas the four truths are given as the "liberating insight" which constituted the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], or "enlightenment" of the Buddha. When he understood these truths, he was "enlightened," and liberated, as reflected in Majjhima Nikaya 26:42: "his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=268}} Typically, the four truths refer here to the eightfold path as the means to gain liberation, while the attainment of insight in the four truths is portrayed as liberating in itself.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}}} The four truths were superseded by ''pratityasamutpada'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}} And Schmithausen states that still other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon: 
{{quote|"that the five Skandhas are impermanent, disagreeable, and neither the Self nor belonging to oneself";{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26}} "the contemplation of the arising and disappearance (''udayabbaya'') of the five Skandhas";{{refn|group=note|Anguttara Nikaya II.45 (PTS)}} "the realisation of the Skandhas as empty (''rittaka''), vain (''tucchaka'') and without any pith or substance (''asaraka'').{{refn|group=note|Samyutta Nikaya III.140-142 (PTS)}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}}}

Some Buddhist texts suggest that rebirth occurs through the transfer of ''[[Consciousness (Buddhism)|vinnana]]'' (consciousness) from one life to another. When this consciousness ceases, then liberation is attained.{{sfn|Waldron|2003|p=22}} There is a connection between consciousness, karmic activities, and the cycle of rebirth, argues William Waldron, and with the destruction of vinnana, there is "destruction and cessation of "karmic activities" (anabhisankhara, S III, 53), which are considered in Buddhism to be "necessary for the continued perpetuation of cyclic existence."{{sfn|Waldron|2003|p=22}}

While Buddhism considers the liberation from samsara as the ultimate spiritual goal, in traditional practice, Buddhists seek and accumulate merit through good deeds, donations to monks and various Buddhist rituals in order to gain better rebirths rather than nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael D.

According to Chogyam Trungpa the realms of samsara can refer to both "psychological states of mind and physical cosmological realms".{{refn|group=note|Chogyam Trungpa states: "In the Buddhist system of the six realms, the three higher realms are the god realm, the jealous-god realm, and the human realm; the three lower realms are the animal realm, the hungry ghost realmm, and the hell realm. These realms can refer to psychological states or to aspects of Buddhist cosmology."{{sfn|Chogyam Trungpa|2009|p=127}} }}

Gethin argues, rebirth in the different realms is determined by one's [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]], which is directly determined by one's psychological states. The Buddhist cosmology may thus be seen as a map of different realms of existence and a description of all possible psychological experiences.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=119-120}} The psychological states of a person in current life lead to the nature of next rebirth in Buddhist cosmology.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=121}}

Paul Williams acknowledges Gethin's suggestion of the "principle of the equivalence of cosmology and psychology," but notes that Gethin is not asserting the Buddhist cosmology is really all about current or potential states of mind or psychology.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=78-79}} The realms in Buddhist cosmology are indeed realms of rebirths. Otherwise rebirth would always be into the human realm, or there would be no rebirth at all. And that is not traditional Buddhism, states Williams.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=78-79}}

David McMahan concludes that the attempts to construe ancient Buddhist cosmology in modern psychological terms is modernistic reconstruction, "detraditionalization and demythologization" of Buddhism, a sociological phenomenon that is seen in all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David L. McMahan|title=The Making of Buddhist Modernism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XU6HNwlxhCAC|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972029-3|pages=45–48, 57–58}}, '''Quote:''' "Clearly, the interaction of Buddhism with psychology exhibits aspects of both detraditionalization and demythologization as already described.

{{Semantics}}

'''Semantics''' (from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:σημαντικός|σημαντικός]]}} ''sēmantikós'', "significant")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|shmantiko/s|σημαντικός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|σημαντικός}} (''semantikos''), "related to meaning, significant", from {{lang|grc|σημαίνω}} ''semaino'', "to signify, to indicate", which is from {{lang|grc|σῆμα}} ''sema'', "sign, mark, token". The plural is used in analogy with words similar to ''physics'', which was in the neuter plural in Ancient Greek and meant "things relating to nature".}} is the [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[philosophical]] study of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], in [[language]], programming languages, formal logics, and [[semiotics]]. It is concerned with the relationship between ''signifiers''—like [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[sign]]s, and [[symbol]]s—and what they stand for, their [[denotation]].

In [[international scientific vocabulary]] semantics is also called ''[[semasiology]]''. The word ''semantics'' was first used by [[Michel Bréal]], a French philologist.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Biographical Dictionary, 5e.1990, p.202&lt;/ref&gt; It denotes a range of ideas—from the popular to the highly technical. It is often used in ordinary language for denoting a problem of understanding that comes down to word selection or [[connotation]]. This problem of understanding has been the subject of many formal enquiries, over a long period of time, especially in the field of [[formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]]. In [[linguistics]], it is the study of the interpretation of signs or symbols used in [[agent (grammar)|agents]] or [[community|communities]] within particular circumstances and contexts.&lt;ref name="Neurath1955" /&gt; Within this view, sounds, facial expressions, body language, and [[proxemics]] have semantic (meaningful) content, and each comprises several branches of study. In written language, things like paragraph structure and punctuation bear semantic content; other forms of language bear other semantic content.&lt;ref name="Neurath1955"&gt;{{cite book

The formal study of semantics intersects with many other fields of inquiry, including [[lexicology]], [[syntax]], [[pragmatics]], [[etymology]] and others. Independently, semantics is also a well-defined field in its own right, often with synthetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;Cruse, Alan; ''Meaning and Language: An introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics'', Chapter 1, Oxford Textbooks in Linguistics, 2004; Kearns, Kate; ''Semantics'', [[Palgrave MacMillan]] 2000; Cruse, D. A.; ''Lexical Semantics'', Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[philosophy of language]], semantics and [[reference]] are closely connected. Further related fields include [[philology]], [[communication]], and [[semiotics]]. The formal study of semantics can therefore be manifold and complex.

Semantics contrasts with [[syntax]], the study of the combinatorics of units of a language (without reference to their meaning), and [[pragmatics]], the study of the relationships between the symbols of a language, their meaning, and the users of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantics as a field of study also has significant ties to various representational theories of meaning including truth theories of meaning, coherence theories of meaning, and correspondence theories of meaning. Each of these is related to the general philosophical study of reality and the representation of meaning. In 1960s psychosemantic studies became popular after [[Charles E. Osgood|Osgood]]'s massive cross-cultural studies using his [[semantic differential]] (SD) method that used thousands of nouns and adjective bipolar scales. A specific form of the SD, Projective Semantics method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trofimova|first=I|title=Observer bias: how temperament matters in semantic perception of lexical material|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2014|volume=9 |issue=1|pages=e85677|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0085677}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses only most common and neutral nouns that correspond to the 7 groups (factors) of adjective-scales most consistently found in cross-cultural studies (Evaluation, Potency, Activity as found by Osgood, and Reality, Organization, Complexity, Limitation as found in other studies). In this method, seven groups of bipolar adjective scales corresponded to seven types of nouns so the method was thought to have the object-scale symmetry (OSS) between the scales and nouns for evaluation using these scales. For example, the nouns corresponding to the listed 7 factors would be: Beauty, Power, Motion, Life, Work, Chaos, Law. Beauty was expected to be assessed unequivocally as “very good” on adjectives of Evaluation-related scales, Life as “very real” on Reality-related scales, etc. However, deviations in this symmetric and very basic matrix might show underlying biases of two types: scales-related bias and objects-related bias. This OSS design meant to increase the sensitivity of the SD method to any semantic biases in responses of people within the same culture and educational background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Trofimova |first=I |title= How people of different age sex and temperament estimate the world |journal= Psychological Reports |year=1999 |volume=85/2 |pages= 533–552 |doi=10.2466/pr0.85.6.533-552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trofimova |first=I |title= Understanding misunderstanding: a study of sex differences in meaning attribution |journal= Psychological Research |year=2012 |volume=77/6 |pages= 748–760 |doi= 10.1007/s00426-012-0462-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistics==
In [[linguistics]], '''semantics''' is the subfield that is devoted to the study of meaning, as inherent at the levels of words, phrases, sentences, and larger units of [[discourse]] (termed ''texts'', or ''narratives''). The study of semantics is also closely linked to the subjects of representation, reference and denotation. The basic study of semantics is oriented to the examination of the meaning of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], and the study of relations between different linguistic units and [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]]: [[homonym]]y, [[synonym]]y, [[antonym]]y, [[hypernym]]y, [[hyponym]]y, [[meronymy]], [[metonymy]], [[holonymy]], paronyms. A key concern is how meaning attaches to larger chunks of text, possibly as a result of the composition from smaller units of meaning. Traditionally, semantics has included the study of ''[[word sense|sense]]'' and denotative ''[[reference]]'', [[truth condition]]s, argument structure, [[thematic relation|thematic roles]], [[discourse analysis]], and the linkage of all of these to syntax.

==Montague grammar==

In the late 1960s, [[Richard Montague]] proposed a system for defining semantic entries in the lexicon in terms of the [[lambda calculus]]. In these terms, the syntactic [[parsing|parse]] of the sentence ''John ate every bagel'' would consist of a subject (''John'') and a predicate (''ate every bagel''); Montague demonstrated that the meaning of the sentence altogether could be decomposed into the meanings of its parts and in relatively few rules of combination. The logical predicate thus obtained would be elaborated further, e.g. using truth theory models, which ultimately relate meanings to a set of [[Alfred Tarski|Tarskian]] universals, which may lie outside the logic. The notion of such meaning atoms or primitives is basic to the [[language of thought]] hypothesis from the 1970s.

Despite its elegance, [[Montague grammar]] was limited by the context-dependent variability in word sense, and led to several attempts at incorporating context, such as:
* [[Situation semantics]] (1980s): [[truth-value]]s are incomplete, they get assigned based on context
* [[Generative lexicon]] (1990s): categories (types) are incomplete, and get assigned based on context

==Dynamic turn in semantics==

{{linguistics}}
In [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] linguistics there was no mechanism for the learning of semantic relations, and the [[psychological nativism|nativist]] view considered all semantic notions as inborn. Thus, even novel concepts were proposed to have been dormant in some sense. This view was also thought unable to address many issues such as [[metaphor]] or associative meanings, and [[semantic change]], where meanings within a linguistic community change over time, and [[qualia]] or subjective experience. Another issue not addressed by the nativist model was how perceptual cues are combined in thought, e.g. in [[mental rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Barsalou, L.; ''Perceptual Symbol Systems'', Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22(4), 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of semantics, as an innate finite meaning inherent in a [[lexical unit]] that can be composed to generate meanings for larger chunks of discourse, is now being fiercely debated in the emerging domain of [[cognitive linguistics]]&lt;ref name="Langacker:1999"&gt;{{cite book

and also in the non-[[Jerry Fodor|Fodorian]] camp in [[philosophy of language]].&lt;ref

|last=Peregrin

|title=Meaning: The Dynamic Turn. Current Research in the Semantics/Pragmatics Interface
|publisher=Elsevier
|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main challenge is motivated by:
* factors internal to language, such as the problem of resolving [[indexical]] or [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] (e.g. ''this x'', ''him'', ''last week''). In these situations ''context'' serves as the input, but the interpreted utterance also modifies the context, so it is also the output. Thus, the interpretation is necessarily dynamic and the meaning of sentences is viewed as contexts changing potentials instead of [[proposition]]s.
* factors external to language, i.e. language is not a set of labels stuck on things, but "a toolbox, the importance of whose elements lie in the way they function rather than their attachments to things."&lt;ref name="Peregrin:2003" /&gt; This view reflects the position of the later [[Wittgenstein]] and his famous ''game'' example, and is related to the positions of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], and others.

A concrete example of the latter phenomenon is semantic [[underspecification]]&amp;nbsp;– meanings are not complete without some elements of context. To take an example of one word, ''red'', its meaning in a phrase such as ''red book'' is similar to many other usages, and can be viewed as compositional.&lt;ref name="Gardenfors:2000"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-585-22837-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the colours implied in phrases such as ''red wine'' (very dark), and ''red hair'' (coppery), or ''red soil'', or ''red skin'' are very different. Indeed, these colours by themselves would not be called ''red'' by native speakers. These instances are contrastive, so ''red wine'' is so called only in comparison with the other kind of wine (which also is not ''white'' for the same reasons). This view goes back to [[Ferdinand de Saussure|de Saussure]]:

{{quote|Each of a set of synonyms like ''redouter'' ('to dread'), ''craindre'' ('to fear'), ''avoir peur'' ('to be afraid') has its particular value only because they stand in contrast with one another. No word has a value that can be identified independently of what else is in its vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=de Saussure
|first=Ferdinand
|title=The Course of General Linguistics (Cours de linguistique générale)
|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
and may go back to earlier [[vyākaraṇa|Indian]] views on language, especially the [[Nyaya]] view of words as indicators and not carriers of meaning.&lt;ref name="Matilal"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Matilal
|first=Bimal Krishna
|authorlink=Bimal Krishna Matilal
|title=The Word and the World: India's Contribution to the Study of Language
|publisher=Oxford
|year=1990}} The [[Nyaya]] and [[Mimamsa]] schools in Indian [[vyākaraṇa]] tradition conducted a centuries-long debate on whether sentence meaning arises through composition on word meanings, which are primary; or whether word meanings are obtained through analysis of sentences where they appear. (Chapter 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to defend a system based on propositional meaning for semantic underspecification can be found in the [[generative lexicon]] model of [[James Pustejovsky]], who extends contextual operations (based on type shifting) into the lexicon. Thus meanings are generated "on the fly" (as you go), based on finite context.

==Prototype theory==

Another set of concepts related to fuzziness in semantics is based on [[prototype theory|prototypes]]. The work of [[Eleanor Rosch]] in the 1970s led to a view that natural categories are not characterizable in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, but are graded (fuzzy at their boundaries) and inconsistent as to the status of their constituent members. One may compare it with [[Jung]]'s [[archetype]], though the concept of [[archetype]] sticks to static concept. Some [[post-structuralists]] are against the fixed or static meaning of the [[words]]. [[Derrida]], following [[Nietzsche]], talked about slippages in fixed meanings.

Systems of categories are not objectively ''out there'' in the world but are rooted in people's experience. These categories evolve as [[learning theory (education)|learned]] concepts of the world&amp;nbsp;– meaning is not an objective truth, but a subjective construct, learned from experience, and language arises out of the "grounding of our conceptual systems in shared [[embodied philosophy|embodiment]] and bodily experience".&lt;ref name="LakoffJohnson"&gt;{{cite book

|oclc=93961754}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A corollary of this is that the conceptual categories (i.e. the lexicon) will not be identical for different cultures, or indeed, for every individual in the same culture. This leads to another debate (see the [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] or [[Eskimo words for snow]]).
&lt;!-- ==Logic and mathematics==

Many of the formal approaches to semantics in [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] originated in the study of [[philosophy of language]]. Initially, the most influential semantic theory stemmed from [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Frege and Russell are seen as the originators of a tradition in [[analytic philosophy]] to explain meaning via syntax and mathematical functionality. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], a former student of Russell, is also seen as one of the seminal figures in the analytic tradition. All three of these early philosophers of language were concerned with how sentences expressed information in the form of [[proposition]]s and with the truth values or [[truth conditions]] a given sentence has in virtue of the proposition it expresses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Theories in semantics==

===Formal semantics===

{{main|Formal semantics (linguistics)}}
Originates from Montague's work (see above). A highly formalized theory of natural language semantics in which expressions are assigned denotations (meanings) such as individuals, truth values, or functions from one of these to another. The truth of a sentence, and its logical relation to other sentences, is then evaluated relative to a model.

===Truth-conditional semantics===

{{main|Truth-conditional semantics}}
Pioneered by the philosopher [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], another formalized theory, which aims to associate each natural language sentence with a meta-language description of the conditions under which it is true, for example: 'Snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white. The challenge is to arrive at the truth conditions for any sentences from fixed meanings assigned to the individual words and fixed rules for how to combine them. In practice, truth-conditional semantics is similar to model-theoretic semantics; conceptually, however, they differ in that truth-conditional semantics seeks to connect language with statements about the real world (in the form of meta-language statements), rather than with abstract models.

===Conceptual semantics===

{{main|Conceptual semantics}}
This theory is an effort to explain properties of argument structure. The assumption behind this theory is that syntactic properties of phrases reflect the meanings of the words that head them.&lt;ref name="Levin, Beth 1991"&gt;Levin, Beth; Pinker, Steven; ''Lexical &amp; Conceptual Semantics'', Blackwell, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; With this theory, linguists can better deal with the fact that subtle differences in word meaning correlate with other differences in the syntactic structure that the word appears in.&lt;ref name="Levin, Beth 1991" /&gt; The way this is gone about is by looking at the internal structure of words.&lt;ref name="Jackendoff, Ray 1990"&gt;Jackendoff, Ray; ''Semantic Structures'', MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; These small parts that make up the internal structure of words are termed ''semantic primitives''.&lt;ref name="Jackendoff, Ray 1990" /&gt;

===Lexical semantics===

{{main|Lexical semantics}}
A linguistic theory that investigates word meaning. This theory understands that the meaning of a word is fully reflected by its context. Here, the meaning of a word is constituted by its contextual relations.&lt;ref name="Cruse, D. 1986"&gt;Cruse, D.; ''Lexical Semantics'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a distinction between degrees of participation as well as modes of participation are made.&lt;ref name="Cruse, D. 1986" /&gt; In order to accomplish this distinction any part of a sentence that bears a meaning and combines with the meanings of other constituents is labeled as a semantic constituent. Semantic constituents that cannot be broken down into more elementary constituents are labeled minimal semantic constituents.&lt;ref name="Cruse, D. 1986" /&gt;

===Computational semantics===

{{main|Computational semantics}}
Computational semantics is focused on the processing of linguistic meaning. In order to do this concrete algorithms and architectures are described. Within this framework the algorithms and architectures are also analyzed in terms of decidability, time/space complexity, data structures that they require and communication protocols.&lt;ref&gt;Nerbonne, J.; ''The Handbook of Contemporary Semantic Theory'' (ed. Lappin, S.), Blackwell Publishing, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==
{{main|Semantics (computer science)}}
In [[computer science]], the term ''semantics'' refers to the meaning of language constructs, as opposed to their form ([[syntax (logic)|syntax]]). According to Euzenat, semantics "provides the rules for interpreting the syntax which do not provide the meaning directly but constrains the possible interpretations of what is declared."&lt;ref&gt;Euzenat, Jerome. ''Ontology Matching.'' Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 2007, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; In ontology engineering, the term ''semantics'' refers to the meaning of concepts, properties, and relationships that formally represent real-world entities, events, and scenes in a logical underpinning, such as a [[description logic]], and typically implemented in the [[Web Ontology Language]]. The meaning of [[description logic]] concepts and roles is defined by their model-theoretic semantics, which are based on interpretations.&lt;ref name="Sikos 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts, properties, and relationships defined in [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] ontologies can be deployed directly in the web site markup as [[RDFa]], [[Microdata (HTML)|HTML5 Microdata]], or [[JSON-LD]], in [[graph databases]] as [[Semantic triple|RDF triples]] or [[Named graph|quads]], and dereferenced in [[Linked Open Data|LOD]] datasets.

===Programming languages===
The semantics of [[programming language]]s and other languages is an important issue and area of study in computer science. Like the [[syntax]] of a language, its semantics can be defined exactly.

For instance, the following statements use different syntaxes, but cause the same instructions to be executed, namely, perform an arithmetical addition of 'y' to 'x' and store the result in a variable called 'x':
{| class="wikitable sortable" style="font-size:90%; text-align: left; width: auto;"
|-
! Statement
! Programming languages
|-
| &lt;code&gt;x += y&lt;/code&gt;
| [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]],  [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], etc.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;$x += $y&lt;/code&gt;
| [[Perl]], [[PHP]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;x := x + y&lt;/code&gt;
| [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[ALGOL]], [[ALGOL 68]], [[BCPL]], [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Modula-2]], [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]], [[OCaml]], [[Object Pascal]] (Delphi), [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[SETL]], [[Simula]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Standard ML]], [[VHDL]], etc.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;MOV EAX,[y]&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;ADD [x],EAX&lt;/code&gt;
| [[Assembly language]]s: [[Intel 8086]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;LET X = X + Y&lt;/code&gt;
| [[BASIC]]: early
|-
| &lt;code&gt;x = x + y&lt;/code&gt;
| [[BASIC]]: most dialects; [[Fortran]], [[MATLAB]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]

&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Operational semantics]]: The meaning of a construct is specified by the computation it induces when it is executed on a machine. In particular, it is of interest ''how'' the effect of a computation is produced.
* [[Denotational semantics]]: Meanings are modelled by mathematical objects that represent the effect of executing the constructs. Thus ''only'' the effect is of interest, not how it is obtained.
* [[Axiomatic semantics]]: Specific properties of the effect of executing the constructs are expressed as ''assertions''. Thus there may be aspects of the executions that are ignored.

===Semantic models===
The [[Semantic Web]] refers to the extension of the [[World Wide Web]] via embedding added semantic [[metadata]], using semantic data modeling techniques such as [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) and [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL).
On the [[Semantic Web]], terms such as ''[[semantic network]]'' and ''[[semantic data model]]'' are used to describe particular types of data model characterized by the use of [[directed graph]]s in which the vertices denote concepts or entities in the world and their properties, and the arcs denote relationships between them. These can formally be described as [[description logic]] concepts and roles, which correspond to [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] classes and properties.&lt;ref name="Sikos 2017"/&gt;

==Psychology==
In [[psychology]], ''[[semantic memory]]'' is memory for meaning&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the aspect of memory that preserves only the ''gist'', the general significance, of remembered experience&amp;nbsp;– while [[episodic memory]] is memory for the ephemeral details&amp;nbsp;– the individual features, or the unique particulars of experience. The term 'episodic memory' was introduced by Tulving and Schacter in the context of 'declarative memory' which involved simple association of factual or objective information concerning its object. Word meaning is measured by the company they keep, i.e. the relationships among words themselves in a [[semantic network]]. The memories may be transferred intergenerationally or isolated in one generation due to a cultural disruption. Different generations may have different experiences at similar points in their own time-lines. This may then create a vertically heterogeneous semantic net for certain words in an otherwise homogeneous culture.&lt;ref&gt;Giannini, A. J.; ''Semiotic and Semantic Implications of "Authenticity"'', Psychological Reports, 106(2):611–612, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In a network created by people analyzing their understanding of the word (such as [[Wordnet]]) the links and decomposition structures of the network are few in number and kind, and include ''part of'', ''kind of'', and similar links. In automated [[ontologies]] the links are computed vectors without explicit meaning. Various automated technologies are being developed to compute the meaning of words: [[latent semantic indexing]] and [[support vector machines]] as well as [[natural language processing]], [[artificial neural network]]s and [[predicate calculus]] techniques.

[[Ideasthesia]] is a psychological phenomenon in which activation of concepts evokes sensory experiences. For example, in synesthesia, activation of a concept of a letter (e.g., that of the letter ''A'') evokes sensory-like experiences (e.g., of red color).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5972">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''sieve''' is a way of choosing arrows with a common [[codomain]].  It is a categorical analogue of a collection of open subsets of a fixed [[open set]] in [[topology]].  In a [[Grothendieck topology]], certain sieves become categorical analogues of [[open cover]]s in [[topology]]. Sieves were introduced by {{harvtxt|Giraud|1964}} in order to reformulate the notion of a Grothendieck topology.

==Definition==
Let '''C''' be a [[Category (mathematics)|category]], and let ''c'' be an object of '''C'''.  A '''sieve''' ''S'' on ''c'' is a [[subfunctor]] of Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''), i.e., for all objects ''c''&amp;prime; of '''C''', ''S''(''c''&amp;prime;) ⊆ Hom(''c''&amp;prime;, ''c''), and for all arrows ''f'':''c''&amp;Prime;→''c''&amp;prime;, ''S''(''f'') is the restriction of Hom(''f'', ''c''), the [[pullback]] by ''f'' (in the sense of precomposition, not of fiber products), to ''S''(''c''&amp;prime;).

Put another way, a sieve is a collection ''S'' of arrows with a common codomain which satisfies the functoriality condition, "If ''g'':''c''&amp;prime;&amp;rarr;''c'' is an arrow in ''S'', and if ''f'':''c''&amp;Prime;&amp;rarr;''c''&amp;prime; is any other arrow in '''C''', then the pullback {{nowrap|''S''(''f'')(''g'') {{=}} ''gf''}} is in ''S''."  Consequently sieves are similar to right [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s in [[ring theory]] or [[filter (mathematics)|filter]]s in [[order theory]].

==Pullback of sieves==
The most common operation on a sieve is ''pullback''.  Pulling back a sieve ''S'' on ''c'' by an arrow ''f'':''c''&amp;prime;→''c'' gives a new sieve ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S'' on ''c''&amp;prime;.  This new sieve consists of all the arrows in ''S'' which factor through ''c''&amp;prime;.

There are several equivalent ways of defining ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S''.  The simplest is:

:For any object ''d'' of '''C''', ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S''(''d'') = { ''g'':''d''&amp;rarr;''c''&amp;prime; | fg &amp;isin; ''S''(''d'')}

A more abstract formulation is:

:''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S'' is the image of the [[fibered product]] ''S''×&lt;sub&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c'')&lt;/sub&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''&amp;prime;) under the natural projection ''S''×&lt;sub&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c'')&lt;/sub&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''&amp;prime;)&amp;rarr;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''&amp;prime;).

Here the map Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''&amp;prime;)→Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c'') is Hom(''f'', ''c''&amp;prime;), the pullback by ''f''.

The latter formulation suggests that we can also take the image of ''S''×&lt;sub&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c'')&lt;/sub&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''&amp;prime;) under the natural map to Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c'').  This will be the image of ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S'' under composition with ''f''.  For each object ''d'' of '''C''', this sieve will consist of all arrows ''fg'', where ''g'':''d''→''c''&amp;prime; is an arrow of ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S''(''d'').  In other words, it consists of all arrows in ''S'' that can be factored through ''f''.

If we denote by &amp;empty;&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; the empty sieve on ''c'', that is, the sieve for which &amp;empty;(''d'') is always the empty set, then for any ''f'':''c''&amp;prime;→''c'', ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;empty;&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is &amp;empty;&lt;sub&gt;''c''&amp;prime;&lt;/sub&gt;.  Furthermore, ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c'') = Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''&amp;prime;).

==Properties of sieves==
Let ''S'' and ''S''&amp;prime; be two sieves on ''c''.  We say that ''S'' ⊆ ''S''&amp;prime; if for all objects ''c''&amp;prime; of '''C''', ''S''(''c''&amp;prime;) ⊆ ''S''&amp;prime;(''c''&amp;prime;).  For all objects ''d'' of '''C''', we define (''S'' ∪ ''S''&amp;prime;)(''d'') to be ''S''(''d'') ∪ ''S''&amp;prime;(''d'') and (''S'' ∩ ''S''&amp;prime;)(''d'') to be ''S''(''d'') ∩ ''S''&amp;prime;(''d'').  We can clearly extend this definition to infinite unions and intersections as well.

If we define Sieve&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''c'') (or Sieve(''c'') for short) to be the set of all sieves on ''c'', then Sieve(''c'') becomes a partially ordered under ⊆.  It is easy to see from the definition that the union or intersection of any family of sieves on ''c'' is a sieve on ''c'', so Sieve(''c'') is a [[complete lattice]].

A [[Grothendieck topology]] is a collection of sieves subject to certain properties.  These sieves are called ''covering sieves''.  The set of all covering sieves on an object ''c'' is a subset ''J''(''c'') of Sieve(''c'').  ''J''(''c'') satisfies several properties in addition to those required by the definition:

*If ''S'' and ''S''&amp;prime; are sieves on ''c'', ''S'' ⊆ ''S''&amp;prime;, and ''S'' ∈ ''J''(''c''), then ''S''&amp;prime; ∈ ''J''(''c'').
*Finite intersections of elements of ''J''(''c'') are in ''J''(''c'').

Consequently, ''J''(''c'') is also a [[distributive lattice]], and it is [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] in Sieve(''c'').

A '''snuff film''', or '''snuff movie''', is "a movie in a purported genre of movies in which a person is actually [[murder]]ed or commits [[suicide]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[American Heritage Dictionary]], ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt; It may or may not be made for financial gain, but is supposedly "circulated amongst a jaded few for the purpose of entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Snuff films false |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/snuff.asp |date=October 31, 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some filmed records of executions and murders exist, but in those cases, the death was not specifically staged for financial gain or entertainment.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/snuff.htm|title=Barbara Mikkelson, "A Pinch of Snuff", Snopes.com, 31 Oct 2006, accessed 8 April 2007|work=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first known use of the term ''snuff movie'' is in a 1971 book by [[Ed Sanders]], ''The Family: The Story of Charles Manson's Dune Buggy Attack Battalion''. He alleges that [[Charles Manson|The Manson Family]] was involved in making such a film in California to record their murders.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LloT4dmu7xMC extract from book]&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun ''snuff'' originally meant the part of a candle wick that has already burned; the verb ''snuff'' meant to cut this off, and by extension to extinguish or kill.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1st ed, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; The word has been used in this sense in English slang for hundreds of years. It was defined in 1874 as a "term very common among the lower orders of London, meaning to die from disease or accident".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Camden Hotten]], ''[[A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words]]'', 5th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Geoffrey O'Brien]], "whether or not commercially distributed 'snuff' movies actually exist, the possibility of such movies is implicit in the stock [[B-movie]] motif of the mad artist killing his models, as in ''[[A Bucket of Blood]]'' [1959], ''[[Color Me Blood Red]]'' [1965], or ''Decoy for Terror'' [1967]" also known as ''Playgirl Killer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Geoffrey O’Brien|O’Brien, Geoffrey]] |date=1993|title=Horror for Pleasure|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]}} (April 22 issue), n.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "snuff films" being made for profit became more widely known with the commercial film ''[[Snuff (film)|Snuff]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name="csicop.org"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/snuff_film_the_making_of_an_urban_legend/ |author=Stine, Scott Aaron |title=The Snuff Film: The Making of an Urban Legend |work=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=23.3 |date=1999 |accessdate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2p7i4oL6Dk |title=Do snuff movies exist? |series=Documentary, part 1 |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cook, David A. |title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in The Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam |page=233 |publisher=University of California Press |date=2000 |isbn= 0-520-23265-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low-budget [[exploitation film|exploitation]] horror film, originally titled ''Slaughter'', was directed by [[Michael and Roberta Findlay]].

==False snuff films==

===The ''Guinea Pig'' films===
{{Main article|Guinea Pig (film series)}}
The first two films in the Japanese ''Guinea Pig'' series are designed to look like snuff films; the video is grainy and unsteady, as if recorded by amateurs. The sixth film in the series, ''Mermaid in a Manhole'', allegedly served as an inspiration for Japanese serial killer [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]], who murdered several preschool girls in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, actor [[Charlie Sheen]] became convinced that ''[[Flower of Flesh and Blood]]'' (1985), the second film in the series, depicted an actual homicide and contacted the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;  The Bureau initiated an investigation but closed it after the series'  producers released a "making of" film demonstrating the special effects used to simulate the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=McDowell, R. |title=Movies to Die For|work= The San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 7, 1994|page= A5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cannibal Holocaust''===
{{Main article|Cannibal Holocaust}}
The Italian director [[Ruggero Deodato]] was charged after rumors that the depictions of the killing of the main actors in his film ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980) were real. He was able to clear himself of the charges after the actors made an appearance in court.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Ruggero Deodato (interviewee) |date=2003 | title=In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium=Documentary | location=Italy | publisher=Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and the genuine deaths of six animals onscreen and one off screen, issues which find ''Cannibal Holocaust'' in the midst of controversy to this day. It has also been claimed that ''Cannibal Holocaust'' is banned in over 50 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Cannibal Holocaust 25th Anniversary Edition |orig-year=1980 |others=[[Ruggero Deodato]] |page=back cover |publisher=[[VIPCO (Video Instant Picture Company)]] |location=UK |id=VIP666SE |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this has never been verified. In 2006, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine named ''Cannibal Holocaust'' as the 20th most controversial film of all-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1202224.html | title=The 25 Most Controversial Films of All-Time | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | accessdate=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, the [[sociology of knowledge]] studies the impact of human [[knowledge]] and the prevailing ideas on societies and relations between knowledge and the social context within which it arises.

[[Sociologist]]s of scientific knowledge study the development of a [[scientific field]] and attempt to identify points of contingency or interpretative flexibility where ambiguities are present. Such variations may be linked to a variety of [[political]], [[historical]], [[cultural]] or [[economic]] factors. Crucially, the field does not set out to promote [[relativism]] or to attack the scientific project; the aim of the researcher is to explain why one interpretation rather than another succeeds due to external social and historical circumstances.

The field emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s and at first was an almost exclusively British practice. Other early centers for the development of the field were in France, Germany, and the United States (notably at [[Cornell University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=Lk9T2HDmM1t6PHggWkXy9Ny7Cv75T9TskJwwvw8PyFgdmccphCr7!601689703!-129296667?docId=5000344671 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701102333/http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst |archivedate=2012-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major theorists include [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]], [[David Bloor]], [[Sal Restivo]], [[Randall Collins]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Paul Feyerabend]], [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]], [[Martin Kusch]], [[Bruno Latour]],  [[Mike Mulkay]], [[Derek J. de Solla Price]], [[Lucy Suchman]] and [[Anselm Strauss]].

==Programmes and schools==
The sociology of scientific knowledge  in its Anglophone versions emerged in the 1970s in self-conscious opposition to the sociology of science associated with the American  [[Robert K. Merton]], generally considered one of the seminal authors in the sociology of science.  Merton's was a kind of "sociology of scientists," which left the cognitive content of science out of sociological account; SSK by contrast aimed at providing sociological explanations of scientific ideas themselves, taking its lead from aspects of the work of Thomas S. Kuhn, but especially from established traditions in cultural anthropology (Durkheim, Mauss) as well as the later Wittgenstein.  [[David Bloor]], one of SSK's early champions, has contrasted the so-called 'weak programme' (or 'program' &amp;mdash; either spelling is used) which merely gives social explanations for erroneous beliefs, with what he called the '[[strong program]]me', which considers sociological factors as influencing all beliefs.

The ''weak'' programme is more of a description of an approach than an organised movement. The term is applied to historians, sociologists and philosophers of science who merely cite [[sociological]] factors as being responsible for those beliefs that went wrong. [[Imre Lakatos]] and (in some moods) [[Thomas Kuhn]] might be said to adhere to it.  The ''strong'' programme is particularly associated with the work of two groups: the 'Edinburgh School' ([[David Bloor]], Barry Barnes, and their colleagues at the Science Studies Unit at the [[University of Edinburgh]]) in the 1970s and '80s, and the 'Bath School' ([[Harry Collins]] and others at the [[University of Bath]]) in the same period. "Edinburgh sociologists" and "Bath sociologists" promoted, respectively, the Strong Programme and Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR). Also associated with SSK in the 1980s was discourse analysis as applied to science (associated with [[Michael Mulkay]] at the University of York), as well as a concern with issues of reflexivity arising from paradoxes relating to SSK's relativist stance towards science and the status of its own knowledge-claims (Steve Woolgar, Malcolm Ashmore).

The sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) has major international networks through its principal associations, 4S and EASST, with recently established groups in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Latin America.  It has made major contributions in recent years to a critical analysis of the biosciences and informatics.

==The sociology of mathematical knowledge==
Studies of [[mathematical practice]] and [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]] are also rightly part of the sociology of knowledge, since they focus on the community of those who practice [[mathematics]] and their common assumptions.  Since [[Eugene Wigner]] raised the issue in 1960 and [[Hilary Putnam]] made it more rigorous in 1975, the question of why fields such as [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] should agree so well has been debated. Proposed solutions point out that the fundamental constituents of mathematical thought, space, form-structure, and number-proportion are also the fundamental constituents of physics. It is also worthwhile to note that physics is nothing but a modeling of reality, and seeing causal relationships governing repeatable observed phenomena, and much of mathematics, especially in relation to the growth of the [[calculus]], has been developed precisely for the goal of developing these models in a rigorous fashion. Another approach is to suggest that there is no deep problem, that the division of human scientific thinking through using words such as 'mathematics' and 'physics' is only useful in their practical everyday function to categorize and distinguish.

Fundamental contributions to the sociology of mathematical knowledge have been made by [[Sal Restivo]] and [[David Bloor]]. Restivo draws upon the work of scholars such as [[Oswald Spengler]] (''The Decline of the West'', 1918), [[Raymond Louis Wilder]] and [[Leslie White|Leslie Alvin White]], as well as contemporary sociologists of knowledge and science studies scholars. [[David Bloor]] draws upon [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and other contemporary thinkers. They both claim that mathematical knowledge is socially constructed and has irreducible contingent and historical factors woven into it. More recently [[Paul Ernest]] has proposed a social constructivist account of mathematical knowledge, drawing on the works of both of these sociologists.

==Criticism==
SSK has received criticism from theorists of the [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT) school of [[science and technology studies]]. These theorists criticise SSK for sociological [[reductionism]] and a [[anthropocentrism|human centered]] universe. SSK, they say, relies too heavily on human actors and social rules and conventions settling scientific controversies. The debate is discussed in an article ''Epistemological Chicken''.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, H. M. and S. Yearley (1992). "Epistemological Chicken". In A. Pickering (Ed.) ''Science as Practice and Culture''. Chicago, Chicago University Press: 301-326.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13131">A '''solar bus''' or '''solar-charged bus''' is a [[bus]] which is powered exclusively or mainly by [[solar energy]].  A solar-powered bus service is referred to as a '''solar bus service'''.  The use of the term "solar bus" normally implies that solar energy is used not only for powering electric equipment on the bus, but also for the [[propulsion]] of the vehicle.

Existing solar buses are [[battery electric bus]]es or (in the case of hybrid solar buses) [[hybrid bus]]es equipped with [[Electric-vehicle battery|batteries]] which are recharged from solar (or other) power sources; a launch of a solar bus service often goes hand in hand with investments for large-scale installations of stationary [[solar panel]]s with [[photovoltaic cell]]s.  Similarly as other [[solar vehicle]]s, many solar buses have photovoltaic cells contained in [[solar panel]]s on the vehicle's roof which convert the [[sun]]'s energy directly into [[electric energy]] to be used by the engine.

The introduction of solar buses and other [[green vehicle]]s for purposes of [[public transport]] forms a part of [[sustainable transport]] schemes.

== About ==

=== Solar-only and solar-electric bus services ===
The distinction between a solar-only electric bus and an electro-solar bus is fluid, as the distinction depends on the actual usage: whether the bus is recharged from solar or other power sources.

Solar-only bus services involve recharging the bus from solar energy, usually from solar panel-covered [[bus station]] [[Canopy (building)|canopies]].  The concept is similar to that of [[solar parking plot]] for cars and bicycles, where vehicles can re-charge while parked.  The need for recharging poses constraints on the run and standstill times of the bus.  The implementation of a solar bus service benefits from an optimization of over-all requirements for the specific bus service.&lt;ref name="ait-2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ait.ac.at/fileadmin/cmc/downloads/Magazine/Neu/Tomorrow_Today_Dezember_2011_en.pdf |pages=22–25 |title=The right drive for e-mobility |publisher= |date=December 2011 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electro-solar buses are powered additionally from electric power [[Electric power transmission|transmitted]] from power plants; hybrid solar buses may be equipped with [[hybrid engine]]s.

=== Commercially available shuttle buses ===
Open air low-speed electric shuttle sightseeing buses equipped with a solar panel-covered roof are produced in series and are commercially available.  According to the producers, the solar panels save energy and prolong the battery life cycle.

== Use ==

=== Australia ===
The '''Tindo''' solar battery-charged bus ("Tindo", [[Kaurna language|Kaurna]] word for ''sun'') is an experimental [[battery electric vehicle]] that operates in [[Adelaide|Adelaide, Australia]]. It is the world's first solar bus, operating since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/photos/7-modern-solar-powered-vehicles/tindo-solar-bus |title=7 modern solar-powered vehicles: Tindo Solar Bus &amp;#124; MNN - Mother Nature Network |publisher=MNN |date= |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses 100% solar power, is equipped with a [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking system]] and air conditioning and can carry up to 40 persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Kien |last1=To |first2=John E. |last2=Fernández |title=Alternative urban technologies demonstration projects for innovative cities |work=Third International Engineering Systems Symposium, CESUN 2012, Delft University of Technology |date=18–20 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 25 of whom are seated.  The bus itself is not equipped with solar panels.  It receives electric power from a [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] system on Adelaide's central [[bus station]].  Hailed as the world's first bus service powered exclusively by solar power, the bus service connects Adelaide City and North Adelaide as part of Adelaide City's sustainable transport agenda.  The Tindo is part of the 98A and 98C bus service (until recently known as the Adelaide Connector) which is offered as [[free public transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1245/ |title=All-Electric, Solar-Powered, Free Bus!!! |publisher=Ecogeek.org |date=2007-12-27 |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908184215/http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1245/ |archivedate=2009-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yoursay.adelaidecitycouncil.com/city-connector-bus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222075212/http://yoursay.adelaidecitycouncil.com/city-connector-bus |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
Within the Chinese government's program for clean transport sector, [[China]]'s first solar hybrid buses were put in operation in July 2012 in the city of [[Qiqihar]]. Its engine is powered by [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] which are fed by solar panels installed on the bus roof. It is claimed that each bus consumes 0.6 to 0.7 kilowatt-hours of electricity per kilometer and can transport up to 100 persons, and that the use of solar panels prolongs the batteries' lifetime by 35 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naftcenews.wvu.edu/naftc_enews/2012/9/7/china-reveals-new-solar-buses |title=China Reveals New Solar Buses |publisher=[[West Virginia University]] |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009112858/http://naftcenews.wvu.edu/naftc_enews/2012/9/7/china-reveals-new-solar-buses |archivedate=2015-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Austria's first solar-powered bus was put in operation in the village of [[Perchtoldsdorf]]. Its [[powertrain]], operating strategy, and [[design specification]] were specifically optimized in view of its planned regular service routes.  It has been in trial operation since autumn 2011.&lt;ref name="ait-2013"/&gt;

The [[Hybrid electric bus#Tribrid Bus|tribrid bus]] is a [[hybrid electric bus]] developed by the [[University of Glamorgan]], [[Wales]], for use as student transport between the University’s different campuses.  It is powered by [[hydrogen fuel]] or [[solar cell]]s, batteries and [[ultracapacitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Green 'tribrid' minibus unveiled|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/7436908.stm |work=BBC |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Launch of Europe's First Tribrid Green Minibus |url=http://news.glam.ac.uk/news/en/2008/may/30/launch-europes-first-tibrid-green-minibus/ |work= |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UK ===

The first Solar Bus in the UK launched in [[Brighton]] April 2017. Following a marathon six week effort from hundreds of local people, [[The Big Lemon]] and [[Brighton Energy Coop]]'s joint Solar Bus project has won funding from the M&amp;S Community Energy Fund to cover the roof of [[The Big Lemon]]’s bus depot in solar panels to power the new electric buses on clean green renewable energy.  The bus was named by one of the Solar Roof partners, Viper IT Solutions and is called "Om Shanti".

The 120 solar panels will generate 30,000kW of electricity – the equivalent of 1.8 million boiled kettles. With no emissions, the Solar Buses will reduce noxious gases in some of Brighton and Hove’s most polluted areas and will power the 52 route between Woodingdean and [[Brighton]] on 100% renewable energy.

The Solar Bus project was one of 199 different applications to the scheme, 125 of which were shortlisted.  These were put to public vote for six weeks during September and October and the voting process also included the option to donate to the project via the Crowdfunding platform.

The Solar Bus project was one of 19 regional winners, with 1549 votes, 170 pledges, and a total of £13,325 raised through crowdfunding, almost half the total amount of £28,798 raised through the scheme nationally.  The project will benefit from £12,500 funding from M&amp;S Energy which, together with the £13,325 crowdfunding donations will fund the solar array on the roof of the bus depot.

===Uganda===
The Kayoola Solar Bus is a 35-seater electric solar bus with zero tailpipe emissions, a range of 80 km, with latent range extension from the real-time charging enabled by the roof mounted solar panels. The development of the Kayoola Solar Bus Concept represents the commitment of the Kiira Motors Project to championing the progressive development of local capacity for Vehicle Technology Innovation, a key ingredient for institutionalizing a sustainable Vehicle Manufacturing Industry in Uganda. &lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/15/africa/africa-solar-bus-kiira-uganda/index.html?iid=ob_lockedrail_topeditorial&amp;iref=obnetwork&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://kiiramotors.com/kayoola.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The Solar Buzz is a 14-seater US Electricar bus, made in 1994, that has been repurposed as the world's first truly solar bus in [[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico]] in 2011.  The Buzz has 2 KW in homemade solar panels on the roof, 40 golf cart batteries, 2 electric motors, and has no tailpipe.  The power required to go one mile is the same as the power required to make a pot of coffee:  around 700 Wh.  The Solar Buzz is an IntraCity bus approved by the state Public Regulation Commission (#56817) in 2015 and is a commercial daytime private shuttle service with a US$3 Fare, operated by Hot Springs Transit, LLC.  &lt;ref&gt;http://krqe.com/2016/01/28/new-mexico-woman-invents-states-first-solar-powered-bus/&lt;/ref&gt; Hot Springs Transit provides transit service to the 6100 person population of Truth or Consequences.

== Other forms of green bus transport ==

=== Non-solar powered engines ===
Solar panels are also used for powering electronic devices of the bus such as heating and air conditioning, even in buses with non-solar-powered engine. In the US, such buses are advertised to meet [[anti-idling]] regulations in several states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Bauer introduces solar bus powering system at BusCon |url=http://www.metro-magazine.com/news/story/2010/10/gary-bauer-introduces-solar-bus-powering-system-at-buscon.aspx |work=metro magazine |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refitting existing non-existing vehicles with photovoltaic panels that feed the original battery with additional electric power has been shown to have the potential for making a substantial contribution to [[CO2 emission]] mitigation and to the [[pollution prevention|reduction of pollution]].&lt;ref name="Donno-2012"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Monica |last1=Donno |first2=Aleck |last2=Ferrari |first3=Annalisa |last3=Scarpelli |first4=Pietro |last4=Perlo |first5=Alberto |last5=Bocca |title=Mechatronic system for energy efficiency in bus transport |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6176493&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6176493 |work=Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe Conference &amp; Exhibition, 2012 |pages=342–343 |date=12–16 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The thus transformed buses are however not solar buses in the strict sense of the word, as they do not use solar energy for propulsion.  The use of buses in public transport implies frequent stops with the opening and closing of doors, which influence the way the energy of the battery is used.&lt;ref name="Donno-2012"/&gt;

=== Renewable energy powered ===
In principle also [[trolleybus]]es or other non-autonomous electric buses or alternately powered buses such as [[fuel cell bus]]es or [[dual-mode bus]]es could be used for solar bus services, provided the origin of all or most of the energy used for propulsing the bus would be solar energy. In practice however such systems also draw on other sources of energy, at least also other [[renewable energy]] sources such as [[wind energy]]. An example is that the city of [[Hamburg]], Germany, received the 2011 [[European Green Capital Award]] for, among others, its fuel cell bus service that is claimed to be the world's largest hydrogen-powered bus fleet and is intended to use hydrogen generated from solar and wind energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hamburg_DE_LowResolution_DE-new1.pdf |page=8 |title=Hamburg, Preisträger 2011,  |publisher=[[European Commission]] |date= |language=German |accessdate=2013-01-13}}, {{DOI|10.2779/78216}}, {{ISBN|978-92-79-21368-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose X is a [[Tychonoff space]], also called a T&lt;sub&gt;3½&lt;/sub&gt; space, and C(X) is the algebra of continuous real-valued functions on X. Suppose P is a [[prime ideal]] in C(X).

If the prime ideal P is a maximal ideal, then F is a field of hyperreal numbers (Robinson's [[hyperreals]] being a very special case).

The aquatic to terrestrial transition of [[vertebrate]] organisms occurred in the late [[Devonian]] era and was an important step in the evolutionary history of modern land vertebrates. The transition allowed animals to escape [[Competition (biology)|competitive pressure]] from the water and explore [[ecological niche|niche]] opportunities on land. Fossils from this period have allowed scientists to identify some of the species that existed during this transition, such as [[Tiktaalik]]&lt;ref name=Tiktaalik&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/Q&amp;A.html#Q5 |title=Tiktaalik roseae: Q&amp;A Session with Neil Shubin |publisher=Tiktaalik.uchicago.edu |date=April 2006 |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Acanthostega]].&lt;ref name=Clack&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clack|first1=Jennifer A.|title=Gaining ground : the origin and evolution of tetrapods|date=2012|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-35675-8|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these species were also the first to develop adaptations suited to terrestrial over aquatic life, such as neck mobility and hindlimb locomotion.

The late Devonian vertebrate transition was preceded by the plant and invertebrate terrestrial invasion. These invasions allowed for the appropriate niche development that would ultimately facilitate the vertebrate invasion. While the late Devonian event was the first land invasion by vertebrate organisms, aquatic species have continued to develop adaptations suited to terrestrial life (and vice versa) from the late Devonian to the [[Holocene]].&lt;ref name=Symposium&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashley-Ross|first1=M. A.|last2=Hsieh|first2=S. T.|last3=Gibb|first3=A. C.|last4=Blob|first4=R.

== Overview of transition ==
The vertebrate species that were important to the initial water to land transition can be qualified as being in one of five groups: [[sarcopterygii|Sarcopterygian fishes]], prototetrapods, aquatic tetrapods, true tetrapods, and terrestrial tetrapods. Many morphological changes occurred throughout this transition. Mechanical support structures changed from fins to limbs, the method of locomotion changed from swimming to walking, respiratory structures changed from gills to lungs, feeding mechanisms changed from suction feeding to biting, and mode of reproduction changed from larval development to metamorphosis.&lt;ref name=Greatest&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=JA|last2=Gordon|first2=MS|title=The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology|date=September–October 2004|volume=77|issue=5|pages=700–719|doi=10.1086/425183|pmid=15547790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary timeline ==

[[Lungfish]] appeared approximately 400 million years ago. It is a species that endured rapid evolution during the Devonian era, which became known as the dipnoan renaissance. The [[Acanthostega]] species, known as the fish with legs, is considered a [[tetrapod]] by structural findings but is postulated to have perhaps never left the aquatic environment. Its legs are not well-suited to support its weight. The bones of its forearm, the radius and ulna, are very thin at the wrist and also unable to support it on land. It also lacks a [[sacrum]] and strong ligaments at the hip, which would be integral to supporting the animal against gravity. In this sense, the species is considered a tetrapod but not one that has adapted well enough to walk on land. Furthermore, its gill bars have a supportive brace characterized for use as an underwater ear because it can pick up noise vibrations through the water. Tetrapods that adapted to terrestrial living adapted these gill bones to pick up sounds through air, and they later became the middle ear bones seen in mammalian tetrapods. [[Ichthyostega]], on the other hand, is considered to be a fully terrestrial tetrapod that perhaps depended on water for its aquatic young. Comparisons between the skeletal features of Acanthostega and Ichthyostega reveal that they had different habits. Acanthostega is likely exclusive to an aquatic environment, while Ichthyostega is progressed in the aquatic to terrestrial transition by living dominantly on the shores.&lt;ref name=Clack/&gt;

An evolutionary timeline of the late Devonian vertebrate terrestrial invasion demonstrates the changes that took place. A group of fish from the [[Givetian]] stage began developing limbs, and eventually evolved into aquatic tetrapods in the [[Famennian]] stage. Pederpes, Westlothiana, Protogyrinus, and Crassigyrinus descended from these species into the carboniferous period and were the first land vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Greatest/&gt;

A particularly important transitional species is one known as Tiktaalik. It has a fin, but the fin has bones within it that are similar to mammalian tetrapods. It has an upper arm bone, a lower arm bone, forearm bones, a wrist, and fingerlike projections. Essentially, it is a fin that can support the animal. Similarly, it also has a neck  that allows independent head movement from the body. Its ribs are also able to support the body in gravity. Its skeletal features exhibit its ability as a fish that can live in shallow water and also venture onto land.&lt;ref name=Tiktaalik/&gt;

== Driving factors ==
It took many millions of years for vertebrates to transition out of water onto land. During this time, both the competitive pressures that would push species out of the water and the  [[Ecological niche|niche]] occupation incentives that would pull species onto land were slowly building. The culmination of these driving factors are what ultimately facilitated the vertebrate transition.

=== Evolutionary pushes ===
Scientists believe that a long period of time where biotic and abiotic factors in the aquatic environment were unfavourable to certain aquatic organisms is what pushed their transition to shallower waters. Some of these push factors are environmental [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], unfavourable aquatic temperatures, and increased salinity. Other constantly present factors such as predation, competition, waterborne diseases and parasites also contributed to the transition.&lt;ref name=Greatest/&gt;

A theory put forth by [[Joseph Barrell]] possibly helps explain what may have initiated these push factors to become relevant in the late Devonian. The extensive oxidized sediments that were present in Europe and North America during the late Devonian are evidence of severe droughts during this time. These droughts would cause small ponds and lakes to dry out, forcing certain aquatic organisms to move on land to find other bodies of water. Natural selection on these organisms eventually led to the evolution of the first terrestrial vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Clack/&gt;

=== Evolutionary pulls ===
The pull factors were secondary to the push factors, and only became significant once the pressures to leave the aquatic environment became significant. These were largely the niches and opportunities that were available for exploitation in the terrestrial environment, and include higher environmental oxygen partial pressures, favourable temperatures, and the lack of competitors and predators on land. The plants and invertebrates that had preceded the vertebrate invasion also provided opportunities in the form of abundant prey and lack of predators.&lt;ref name=Greatest/&gt;

== Barriers to transition ==
There were many challenges that the first land vertebrates faced. These challenges allowed for rapid natural selection and niche domination, resulting in an adaptive radiation that produced many different vertebrate land species in a relatively short period of time.

=== Sensory systems ===
Depending on the water depth at which a species lives, the visual perception of many aquatic species is better suited to darker environments than those on land. Similarly, hearing in aquatic organisms is better optimized for sounds underwater, where the speed and amplitude of sound is greater than in air.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt;

=== Homeostasis ===
[[Homeostasis]] was almost definitely a challenge for land invading vertebrates. [[Gas exchange]] and [[water balance]] are highly different in water and in air. Homeostasis mechanisms suitable for a terrestrial environment may have been necessary to develop before these organisms invaded land.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt;

=== Anatomy ===

The primary anatomical barrier is the development of lungs for proper gas exchange, however other anatomical barriers also exist. The stressors of the musculoskeletal system are different in air than they are in water, and the muscles and bones must be strong enough to withstand the increased effects of gravity on land.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt;

=== Behaviour ===

Many behaviours, such as reproduction, are specifically optimized to a wet environment. Navigation and locomotion are also highly different in aquatic environments compared to terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt;

== Notable adaptations ==

=== Placement of eyes on head ===

The ancestral species of tetrapods that lived entirely in water had tall and narrow skulls with eyes facing sideways and forwards to maximize visibility for predators and prey in the aquatic environment. As the ancestors of early tetrapods started inhabiting shallower waters, these species had flatter skulls with eyes at the tops of their heads, which made it possible to spot food above them. Once the tetrapods transitioned onto land, the lineages evolved to have tall and narrow skulls with eyes facing sideways and forwards again. This allowed them to navigate through the terrestrial environment and look for predators and prey.&lt;ref name=Berkely&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_04 |title=The origin of tetrapods |publisher=Evolution.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Head and neck mobility ===

Fish do not have necks, so the head is directly connected to the shoulders. In contrast, land animals use necks to move their heads so they can look down to see the food on the ground. The greater the mobility of the neck, the more visibility the land animal has. As lineages moved from completely aquatic environments to shallower waters and land, they gradually evolved vertebral columns that increased neck mobility. The first neck vertebra that evolved permitted the animals to have flexion and extension of the head so that they can see up and down. The second neck vertebra evolved to allow rotation of the neck for moving the head left and right. As tetrapod species continued to evolve on land, adaptations included seven or more vertebrae, allowing increasing neck mobility.&lt;ref name=Berkely/&gt;

=== Fused sacrum ===

The sacrum connects the pelvis and hindlimbs and is useful for motion on land. The aquatic ancestors of tetrapods did not have a sacrum, so it was speculated to have evolved for locomotive function exclusive to terrestrial environments. However, the Acanthostega species is one of the earliest lineages to have a sacrum, even though it is a fully aquatic species. Once species moved onto land, the trait was adapted for terrestrial locomotion support, which is evidenced by additional vertebrae fusing similarly to permit additional support. This is an example of exaptation, where a trait performs a function that did not arise through natural selection for its current use.&lt;ref name=Berkely/&gt;

=== Lost adaptations ===

As the lineages evolved to adapt to terrestrial environments, many lost traits that were better suited for the aquatic environment. Many lost their gills, which were only useful for obtaining oxygen in water. Their tail fins became smaller. They lost the [[lateral line]] system, a network of canals along the skull and jaw that are sensitive to vibration, which does not work outside of an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=Berkely/&gt;

== Future invasions ==

For successful land invasion, the species had several pre-adaptations like air-breathing and limb-based locomotion. Aspects such as reproduction and swallowing, however, have bound these species to the aquatic environment. These pre-adaptations have allowed vertebrates to venture onto land hundreds of times, but were not able to accomplish the same degree of prolific radiation into diverse terrestrial species.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt; To understand the potential of future invasions, studies must evaluate the models of evolutionary steps taken in past invasions. The commonalities to current and future invasions may then be elucidated to predict the effects of environmental changes.

{{Use British English|date=August 2011}}
'''Warwick Collins''' (born 14 December 1948 - 10 February 2013) was a British [[novelist]],&lt;ref&gt;Foreman, Amanda, [http://www.amanda-foreman.com/observer.shtml Love and Philosophy – with a Pinch of Salt] 2000, amandaforeman.com. Retrieved February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[screenwriter]], yacht designer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sailinganarchy.com/article.php?get=6425 Revolution? So Here is Something to Think about....] October 2010, sailinganarchy.com&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary theorist.
Collins was born in [[Johannesburg]] to English-speaking parents. His father, Robin Collins, was a novelist who wrote under the nom-de-plume Robin Cranford. Robin Collins's novels were written from a liberal perspective and one of them, ''My City Fears Tomorrow'', was banned by the South African apartheid regime. When Warwick Collins was eleven, his family moved to England, and Collins entered [[The King's School, Canterbury]]. He continued his education at the [[University of Sussex]], where he read [[Biology]]. He lived for many years in the Hampshire town of [[Lymington]] where he set two of his novels.

His early poetry was featured in ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' between 1968 and 1971.

==A Silent Gene Theory of Evolution==

Collins studied biology at [[The University of Sussex]], where his tutor was the leading theoretical biologist [[John Maynard Smith]]. In 1975 Collins voiced to Maynard Smith the view that [[natural selection]] could not drive evolution because it always acted to reduce variation in favour of an optimum type for any environment, whereas the central story of evolution was that of increasing variation and complexity. Collins quoted Charles Darwin in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' ("... unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing."),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |title=Online Variorum of Darwin's Origin of Species: second British edition (1860), page 82 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/Variorum/1860/1860-82-c-1859.html |website=Darwin Online |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that if variation must always occur before natural selection can act, then variation, and not natural selection, drives evolution. He asked Maynard Smith whether he could search for a "strong" theory of variation. Maynard Smith warned Collins that he could not support his efforts to pursue a rival theory to the theory that natural selection drives evolution. Collins replied that he thought the object of science was to question and examine everything, including hallowed theories such as the theory of natural selection. Maynard Smith asserted that, on the contrary, the strength of science was its capacity to agree on certain principles, and act collectively to pursue agreed aims. This difference of view with his tutor made Collins give up his scientific career and pursue other interests instead.

==Other careers==
After leaving university, Collins became a [[yacht]] designer and invented and patented the tandem [[keel]], which was conceived to create high performance at low draft, but which also remains one of the radical [[keel]]s in the [[America's Cup]]. He continued his interest in yacht design with an innovation in hull design called the Universal Hull. This fused together two classic hull types (the long, thin, easily  driven hull and the beamy commodious hull) in a form which yielded the chief virtues of both types of hull. The two hulls are joined above the waterline by a ledge which also acts as a spray ledge. The resulting shape is easily driven because of the long, thin underwater shape but enjoys the accommodation space (above the waterline) of a beamy hull.

In the 1990s Collins turned to fiction, publishing three sailing novels and then a series of more wide-ranging novels, including two (''The Rationalist'' and ''The Marriage of Souls'') which are set in 18th century Lymington. He published ten novels in all.

Collins's political views were liberal and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], but (in 1979) he was asked by [[Keith Joseph]] to join a Conservative party think tank chaired by [[John Hoskyns]] (who became Chief Political Adviser to [[Margaret Thatcher]]) to work on issues such as [[privatisation]]. Collins, though left of centre politically, always believed, in common with "classical liberals" such as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], that the free market is a superior means of distributing wealth than the state.

Collins's political views manifested themselves in his novel ''Gents'' (1996) which has recently been republished by [[The Friday Project]], and was reviewed as an all-time classic in the ''Times'' (8 September 2007). ''Gents'', which describes the lives of three West Indian immigrants who run a public urinal in London, is considered to be a leading fiction on tolerance. Collins claimed it was stimulated in part by his memories of apartheid when he lived as a child in South Africa.

Collins's other fictions include the somewhat luridly entitled ''Fuckwoman'', a spoof on the superhero genre which details the adventures of a feminist vigilante who hunts down men who commit crimes against women. Set in Los Angeles, it also satirises the movie industry, contrasting Hollywood's emphasis on the image over reality. It has been published in French, German and Italian translations and recently in English as ''F-Woman''.

His last novel was ''The Sonnets'', a fictional account of William Shakespeare's life from 1592–4, when the London theatres were closed by threat of plague, during which time many scholars believe that the main body of Shakespeare's sonnets were written.

A '''work of art''', '''artwork''', '''art piece''', '''piece of art''' or '''art object''' is an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[Physical body|physical item]] or [[art]]istic creation. Apart from "work of art", which may be used of any work regarded as [[art]] in its widest sense, including works from [[literature]] and [[music]], these terms apply principally to tangible, portable forms of [[Visual arts|visual art]]: 
*An example of [[fine art]], such as a [[painting]] or [[sculpture]]
*An object that has been designed specifically for its aesthetic appeal, such as a piece of [[jewellery]]
*An object that has been designed for aesthetic appeal as well as functional purpose, as in [[interior design]] and much [[folk art]] 
*An object created for principally or entirely functional, religious or other non-aesthetic reasons which has come to be appreciated as art (often later, or by [[Culture|cultural]] outsiders)
*A non-ephemeral [[photograph]], [[film]] or visual [[computer program]], such as a [[video game]] or [[computer animation]]
*A work of [[installation art]] or [[conceptual art]].
Used more broadly, the term is less commonly applied to:
*A fine work of [[architecture]] or [[landscape design]]
*A production of live [[performance]], such as [[theater]], [[ballet]], [[opera]], [[performance art]], musical [[concert]] and other [[performing arts]], and other ephemeral, non-tangible creations.

This article is concerned with the terms and concept as used in and applied to the visual arts, although other fields such as [[aural]]-[[music]] and written word-[[literature]] have similar issues and philosophies.  The term ''[[objet d'art]]'' is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings, prints, drawings or large or medium-sized sculptures, or architecture (e.g. household goods, figurines, etc., some purely aesthetic, some also practical).  The term '''''oeuvre''''' is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oeuvre Oeuvre] Merriam Webster Dictionary, Accessed April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A ''work of art'' in the visual arts is a physical two- or three- dimensional object that is professionally determined or otherwise considered to fulfill a primarily independent [[aesthetic]] function.  A singular art object is often seen in the context of a larger [[art movement]] or artistic [[era]], such as: a [[genre]], aesthetic [[convention (norm)|convention]], [[culture]], or regional-national distinction.&lt;ref name=gell1998/&gt; It can also be seen as an item within an artist's "body of work" or ''[[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]]''. The term is commonly used by: [[museum]] and [[cultural heritage management|cultural heritage]] [[curator]]s, the interested public, the [[patronage|art patron]]-private [[art collector]] community, and [[art gallery|art galleries]].&lt;ref name=macdonald2006/&gt;

Physical objects that document immaterial or [[conceptual art]] works, but do not conform to artistic conventions can be redefined and reclassified as art objects. Some [[Dada]] and [[Neo-Dada]] conceptual and [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] works have received later inclusion. Also, some [[architectural rendering]]s and [[architectural model|model]]s of unbuilt projects, such as by [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and [[Frank Gehry]], are other examples.

The products of [[environmental design]], depending on intention and execution, can be "works of art" and include: [[land art]], [[site-specific art]], [[architecture]], [[garden]]s, [[landscape architecture]], [[installation art]], [[rock art]], and [[megalith|megalithic monuments]].

Legal definitions of "work of art" are used in [[copyright]] law; ''see {{slink|Visual arts|United States of America copyright definition of visual art}}''.

==Theories==
[[Marcel Duchamp]] critiqued the idea that the work of art should be a unique product of an artist's labour, representational of their technical skill or artistic caprice.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Theorists have argued that objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something.&lt;ref name=Hall1997&gt;Hall, S (ed.) 1997, ''Cultural Representations and Signifying Practice'', Open University Press, London, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Michael Craig-Martin]], creator of ''[[An Oak Tree]]'', said of his work – ''"It's not a symbol. I have changed the physical substance of the glass of water into that of an oak tree. I didn't change its appearance. The actual [[oak|oak tree]] is physically present, but in the form of a glass of water."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/theres-no-need-to-be-afraid-of-the-present-625001.html "There's No Need to be Afraid of the Present"], ''The Independent'', 25 Jun 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|upright|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at his [[291 (art gallery)|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit.]]
Some [[Art criticism|art theorist]]s and writers have long made a distinction between the [[physical art|physical qualities of an art object]] and its identity-status as an artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/08/gabos3.shtm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804100009/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/08/gabos3.shtm |archivedate=August 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a painting by [[Rembrandt]] has a physical existence as an "oil painting on canvas" that is separate from its identity as a [[masterpiece]] "work of art" or the artist's ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rembrandtresearchproject.org/|title=Rembrandt Research Project - Home|work=rembrandtresearchproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many works of art are initially denied "museum quality" or artistic merit, and later become accepted and valued in museum and private collections. Works by the [[Impressionists]] and non-representational [[abstract art]]ists are examples. Some, such as the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|"Readymades" of Marcel Duchamp]] including his infamous urinal ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', are later reproduced as museum quality replicas.

There is an indefinite distinction, for current or historical aesthetic items: between "[[fine art]]" objects made by "[[artist]]s"; and  [[folk art]], [[handicraft|craft-work]], or "[[Applied arts|applied art]]" objects made by "first, second, or third-world" [[designer]]s, [[artisan]]s and [[Artisan|craftspeople]]. Contemporary and archeological [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous art]], [[industrial design]] items in limited or [[mass production]], and places created by [[environmental design]]ers and [[cultural landscape]]s, are some examples. The term has been consistently available for debate, reconsideration, and redefinition.

'''''Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle''''' (Zone of immaterial pictorial sensibility) is an [[artist's book]] and [[Performance art|performance]] by the French artist [[Yves Klein]]. The work involved the sale of documentation of ownership of empty space (the Immaterial Zone), taking the form of a cheque, in exchange for [[gold]]; if the buyer wished, the piece could then be completed in an elaborate ritual in which the buyer would burn the cheque, and Klein would throw half of the gold into the [[Seine]].&lt;ref name="Stich"&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz 1995, p156&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual would be performed in the presence of an art critic or distinguished dealer, an art museum director and at least two witnesses.&lt;ref name="Stich"/&gt;

Between the creation of the piece in 1959 and his death on June 6, 1962, eight ''Zones'' were sold,&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz, n93 p268&lt;/ref&gt; of which at least three involved the elaborate ritual.&lt;ref name="Stich"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Klein's receipts verify the existence of an invisible work of art, which prove that a formal sale has taken place. As Klein establishes in his 'Ritual Rules', each buyer has two possibilities; If he pays the amount of gold agreed upon in exchange for a receipt, Klein keeps all of the gold, and the buyer does not really acquire the "authentic immaterial value" of the work. The second possibility is to buy an immaterial zone for gold and then to burn the receipt. Through this act, a perfect, definitive immaterialization is achieved, as well as the absolute inclusion of the buyer in the immaterial.... Klein presents capitalist trading strategies and illuminates his ideas about the indefinable, incalculable value of art."&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen Hollein &amp; Pfeiffer, Hatje Kantz 2004 p221&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The piece is often seen as an early example of [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online, essay on Klein by Ulrike Lehmann&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://calendar.walkerart.org/canopy.wac?id=4489 Walker Art Gallery online] retrieved 1-11-08&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the ''Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility''==
Whilst on a trip to [[Cascia]], Klein had designed an aeromagnetic sculpture, partially as a response to [[Jean Cocteau|Jean Cocteau's]] assertion when visiting his exhibition ''La forêt d’éponges'', June 1959, that it would be even greater if the sponges hovered without supports.&lt;ref name="Stich3"&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz 1995, p168&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's new sculptural idea was to hollow out a sponge, fill it with a [[hydrogen]] or [[helium]] balloon and a piece of metal, and then place it above a concealed electromagnet to regulate the height at which it would hover. Whilst this idea was never implemented, Klein applied for- and received- a patent on June 30, 1959, and then wrote enthusiastically about this new idea to his dealer [[Iris Clert]], asking her in particular not to mention the invention to her friend, the artist [[Takis]], who had also been experimenting with air sculptures. This led to a serious argument with Clert, who tended to side with Takis, as well as re-opening a previous feud with [[Jean Tinguely]].&lt;ref name="Stich3"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Their disagreement was so strong that Klein had removed all of his art from Clert's gallery in August 1959 and had told her assistant to inform any interested buyers that his paintings were all invisible and that if a buyer wanted one, it would suffice to write a check. He further specified that the check had to be very visible."&lt;ref name="Stich2"&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz 1995, n90 p268&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Clert then told this anecdote to a number of visitors to her gallery, one of whom, Peppino Palazzoli, an Italian gallerist, expressed an interest in buying an invisible artwork from Klein; in an attempt to repair the friendship, Clert informed Klein of the sale.&lt;ref name="Stich2"/&gt; She also recommended that Klein design a 'proper receipt'.&lt;ref name="Stich2"/&gt; Palazzoli became the official owner of the first ''Zone'' on November 18 that year, having bought the work for 20 grams of gold, valued at $466.20 as of November 1, 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlygold.com/TutorialPages/Value_Of_Gold.asp Only Gold valuation website]&lt;/ref&gt; The reunion with Clert was to prove short-lived, however. By the end of 1959, he would sever his affiliation with her gallery, and the ''Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility'' would be their last collaboration. His next exhibition, the notorious ''Anthropométries de l'epoque bleue'', March 1960, (featuring models covered in blue paint pressing themselves on to canvases in front of an invited audience of notables) would be held in the considerably more upmarket Galerie Internationale d'Art Contemporain, on the [[Rive Droite]].

[[Image:ZoneImmaterielKlein2.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Yves Klein and [[Dino Buzzati]] engaged in the ritual transfer of immateriality, January 26, 1962]]

===The artist's book and Klein's use of gold===
The book took the form of a parody of a banker's chequebook. Klein printed eight books of these receipts of which five survive&lt;ref&gt;or at least claimed that he did; See Stich, n92, p268&lt;/ref&gt;- apart from the first book (which contained 31 unnumbered checks for an unspecified amount of gold), each book contains 10 numbered receipts for a set value of gold; series one cheques cost 20 grams of gold, series four cost 160 grams. The value of the seventh book's cheques was listed in the ''Antagonismes'' Exhibition, Paris 1960, at 1,280 grams. 

Any gold that wasn't thrown into the Seine ended up in Klein's concurrent series of Monogolds; large scale works made of gold leaf. He had first come across the material's use in art whilst working in a framing workshop, Robert Savage's, in London 1949-50; he was also to encounter it used in golden [[Buddha]]s and screens whilst visiting [[Japan]]. Curiously, these encounters led Klein to associate the precious metal with immateriality;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"And the gold, it was something! These leaves that literally fluttered with the least current of air on the flat cushion that one held in one hand, while the other hand caught them in the wind with a knife.... What a material!
The illumination of matter in its deep physical quality, I came to embrace it during that year at the 'Savage' frame shop." Klein&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, quoted in Stich, Cantz 1995, p193&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Ritual===
The use of ritual in Klein's work is a theme running through his work, from his exhibition ''Le Vide'' (The Void) 1958, in which he exhibited invisible works at Clert's gallery flanked by [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guards]], to his elaborately planned wedding ceremony in 1962 and his [[Votive deposit|votive]] offering to [[Rita of Cascia|Saint Rita of Cascia]] (see [http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_html/1961_B_us.html]). Klein was fascinated by [[Catholicism]] &amp; [[Buddhism]], as well as being an enthusiastic member of the archaic group the Knights of the Order of [[Saint Sebastian]].&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen Hollein &amp; Pfeiffer, Schirn 2004 p217&lt;/ref&gt;
The obsession with the void, or nothingness, also runs throughout his work, with ''Le Vide'' (The Void) being the most famous example; for his second major exhibition at Iris Clert's, he emptied the entire gallery, painted it white (using his patented medium) and then persuaded the French government to send Republican Guards to stand outside as sentries, at the end of a hallway painted [[International Klein Blue|ultramarine]], covered with blue curtains to ensure there would be no way of anticipating the gallery's contents. Anyone who didn't have an invitation was charged 1,500 frs. entrance fee.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Hayward Gallery, Cantz 1995, p134&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that between 2,500 and 3,000 people turned up for the opening,&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Hayward Gallery, Cantz 1995, p138&lt;/ref&gt; and Clert decided to prolong the exhibition for an extra week to accommodate the 'several hundred' visitors each day.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Hayward Gallery, Cantz 1995, p139&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Having rejected nothingness, I discovered the void. The meaning of the immaterial pictorial zones, extracted from the depth of the void which by that time was of a very material order. Finding it unacceptable to sell these immaterial zones for money, I insisted in exchange for the highest quality of the immaterial, the highest quality of material payment – a bar of pure gold. Incredible as it may seem, I have actually sold a number of these pictorial immaterial states . . . Painting no longer appeared to me to be functionally related to the gaze, since during the blue monochrome period of 1957 I became aware of what I called the pictorial sensibility. This pictorial sensibility exists beyond our being and yet belongs in our sphere. We hold no right of possession over life itself. It is only by the intermediary of our taking possession of sensibility that we are able to purchase life. Sensibility enables us to pursue life to the level of its base material manifestations, in the exchange and barter that are the universe of space, the immense totality of nature.” Yves Klein, from the ''Chelsea Hotel Manifesto'', 1961&lt;ref&gt;[http://theorynow.blogspot.com/2007/09/transaction-voided.html Quoted from Theory Now]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reception of the Work===
The French press delighted in calling the event 'a scandal' (''Klein Sells Wind!''), but others were more impressed;&lt;ref name="Stich"/&gt;
Various members of the group present to watch [[Michael Blankfort]]'s ritual transaction, for instance, on February 10, 1962, concurred that the event was 'extremely awe-inspiring',&lt;ref name="Stich"/&gt; ending with the noonday chimes ringing out from churches all around Paris. Blankfort, a Hollywood writer, wrote later of having "no other experience in art equal to the depth of feeling of [the sale ceremony]. It evoked in me a shock of self-recognition and an explosion of awareness of time and space."&lt;ref&gt;Blankfort quoted in Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz, 1995 p156&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the work is a response to [[Walter Benjamin|Walter Benjamin's]] essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://theorynow.blogspot.com/2007/09/transaction-voided.html Mark Cameron Boyd, Theory Now] retrieved 01-11-08&lt;/ref&gt; in which he wrote “The unique value of the ‘authentic’ work of art has its basis in ritual, the location of its original use value.”&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;[http://academic.evergreen.edu/a/arunc/compmusic/benjamin/benjamin.pdf "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" by Walter Benjamin]&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the ''Zones'' directly refute Benjamin's central argument, that modern mass production can finally "emancipate the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual".&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;
