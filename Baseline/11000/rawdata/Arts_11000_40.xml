In the [[music industry]], a '''360 deal''' (from '''360° deal''') is a business relationship between an artist and a music industry company. The company agrees to provide financial and other support for the artist, including direct advances as well as support in marketing, promotion, touring and other areas. In turn, the artist agrees to give the company a percentage of an increased number of their revenue streams, often including sales of recorded music, live performances, publishing and more. 

This business arrangement is an alternative to the traditional recording contract. In a 360 deal, a company typically provides support to an artist in more areas than covered by a traditional recording contract on the condition of receiving a percentage of revenue from these additional areas. During the first decade of the 21st century, revenues from recorded music fell dramatically and the profit margins traditionally associated with the record industry disappeared. The 360 deal reflects the fact that much of a musician's income now comes from sources other than recorded music, such as live performance and merchandise.

==History==
According to [[Jeff Hanson (music executive)|Jeff Hanson]], head of [[Silent Majority Group]], the first new artist 360° deal was created by Hanson along with attorneys Jim Zumwalt and Kent Marcus, and Jim's partner Orville.&lt;ref name="hitquarters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeffHanson_Interview_Part2.html |title=Interview with Jeff Hanson |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=September 20, 2010 |accessdate=October 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103105151/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_JeffHanson_Interview_Part2.html |archivedate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was submitted to [[Atlantic Records]] for the rock band [[Paramore]] while Hanson, Marcus and Zumwalt were employed by the label. Hanson has said there was strong resistance to the deal by both label and band and that he had to fight to make it happen, but believes his efforts were vindicated by the band's subsequent success, saying: "How else would a label have been patient enough to put the band on three straight [[Warped Tour]]s and down-streamed the band to [[Fueled by Ramen]] all while losing millions of dollars?"&lt;ref name="hitquarters"/&gt;

360 deals have been made by traditional record companies, as in [[Robbie Williams]]'s pioneering deal with [[EMI]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

They have also been made between artists and promoters, as with [[Live Nation]]'s 2007 deal with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

and 2008 deal with [[Jay-Z]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
360° deals have attracted criticism from various quarters. Panos Panay, CEO of online music platform Sonicbids, has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you want to find out the future of 360° deals, look at Motown in the late 60s. Motown was the pioneer of a 360° deal ... They owned your likeness, your touring, publishing, record royalties, told you what to wear, told you how to walk … It made for great entertainment but if you look at every one of those artists, what happened? Sooner or later they said, 'I’m not going to go on the road for 200 shows because you tell me so. I’m an artist! I’m a creative person!' Eventually all these artists left ... There’s two things we know about creativity: you can’t force it and you can’t really control it."&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Panos_Panay_Interview.html |title=Interview With Panos Panay |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=July 5, 2010 |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Art &amp; Australia''' Pty Ltd is a biannual print magazine, the country’s longest-running art journal, in print since 1963. 

== History ==

In May 2013, ''ARTAND Australia'' celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. First published by Sam Ure Smith in May 1963, it followed Sam’s father [[Sydney Ure Smith]]’s publication "[[Art in Australia]]", which was in print 1916–42.

From 1963 to 1983, [[Mervyn Horton]] was the magazine's founding editor. He was followed by Elwyn Lynn, Jennifer Phipps and Leon Paroissien, Dinah Dysart, Hannah Fink and Laura Murray Cree. In 2003, Eleonora Triguboff became Editor/Publisher of ''ARTAND Australia'', former editors include Laura Murray-Cree, Claire Armstrong, Katrina Schwarz, Michael Fitzgerald and Genevieve O'Callaghan. The magazine has also involved many distinguished editorial advisers.

Since 2004, winners of the ''ARTAND Australia'' / Credit Suisse Private Banking Contemporary Art Award – awarded to Australian and New Zealand emerging artists – have appeared on the magazine’s back cover. Since 2008, the magazine has partnered to host the [[Gertrude Contemporary Art Spaces|Gertrude Contemporary]] and ''ARTAND Australia'' Emerging Writers Program. ''ARTAND Australia'' also regularly collaborates with artists and designers to produce Artist Editions and Artist Projects.

In August 2013, the print magazine celebrated fifty years and its 200th issue. The 201st issue – volume 51, number 1 in August 2013 – featured a redesign by [[Melbourne]]-based design firm Fabio Ongarato Design.

''Art &amp; Australia'' continues to evolve in the exciting though turbulent world of converging media and art. In 2014 ''Art &amp; Australia'' launched a new website as a platform to share their archive of over fifty years and daily news. The response has been so overwhelmingly positive that they decided to migrate to a fully online presence and increase their focus on art book publication with Dott Publishing, an imprint of ''Art &amp; Australia''.

In 2015, Eleonora Triguboff donated ''Art &amp; Australia'' to the [[Victorian College of Arts]]. Triguboff's ARTAND Foundation retained Dott Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = ART &amp; AUSTRALIA GIFTED TO VICTORIAN COLLEGE OF THE ARTS| work = ARTAND FOUNDATION| accessdate = 2017-10-07| url = https://www.artandfoundation.com/projects/art-australia-donated-to-victorian-college-of-the-arts/art-australia-gifted-to-victorian-college-of-the-arts-1248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Artists Open House''' is a special example of an [[Open Studio]] whereby the studio is a residential venue, usually a house or a garden. The format of an Open House is very similar to an Open Studio, but the significantly lower cost of exhibiting in a residential venue than a studio or gallery provides more artists an opportunity to exhibit their work.

== History ==
Artists Open Houses are perhaps best known in [[Brighton and Hove]] in the [[UK]] as taking place alongside the [[Brighton Festival]] and [[Brighton Festival Fringe]]. 

In 1982 Ned Hoskins filled his home with his and other artists work in protest at the lack of visual arts in the Brighton Festival. 
Hoskins had started a new phenomenon. This became the Fiveways Artists Group, named after the area of the city known as [[Fiveways, Brighton|Fiveways]]. They were soon followed by other groupings of Artists' Open Houses in other areas around Brighton and Hove, including Beyond The Level, founded 1996 (from city area [[The Level]]) and Kemptown Artists (from city area [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]]). In 2008 there were around 1000 artists exhibiting work in over 200 houses, divided into 13 trails, together with many independent open houses. 

In 2002 the Artists Open Houses Festival broke away from the official and fringe Brighton Festivals to become an independent organisation, often simplified to just ''AOH'', producing its own brochure and website.

== Currently ==
In Brighton, the Artists Open Houses Festival still runs concurrently with the Brighton Festival and Brighton Festival Fringe. These three organisations, along with many other projects that happen during the three weeks of the festival, work together to create a diverse range of art available for display around the city. 

A similar organisation in [[Cheltenham]] also runs for a week at the beginning of June. Originally called Cheltenham Artists Open Houses, but now known as Cheltenham Art Festival &amp; Open Studios. 

The [[Helfa gelf]]/Art Trail that covers much of North Wales includes many Artists Open Houses amongst its participating studios.

Also unlinked Artists Open House events happen in other areas of the UK. [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]], [[Leicester]], [[Manchester]], [[Oxford]], [[Peterborough]], [[Stroud]], [[Somerset]] and [[Worthing]] all have ones of their own.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11293">'''Arts South Australia''' (previously Arts SA) Arts South Australia is responsible for managing the Government’s funding for the arts and cultural heritage.

Arts South Australia operates with an annual budget of $140 million, less than one percent of the state budget, and employs 30 staff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adelaidereview.com.au/arts/peter-louca-future-arts-south-australia/ The Adelaide Review]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a division of the [[Department of State Development (South Australia)|Department of State Development]], and is overseen by the Minister for the Arts.

Since 2015, Arts South Australia was headed by Peter Louca, former [[chief of staff]] to Minister [[Jack Snelling]] and one-time Labour Party candidate for the Federal Seat of Mayo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indaily.com.au/politics/2015/11/19/labor-power-plays-as-jay-keeps-faction-in-check/ "Labor Power Plays as Jay Keeps Faction in Check", inDaily]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adelaidereview.com.au/arts/peter-louca-future-arts-south-australia/|title=Peter Louca: "I think our best years are ahead of us." - The Adelaide Review|date=2016-08-10|work=The Adelaide Review|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Louca instigated the re-branding Arts SA to Arts South Australia in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adelaidereview.com.au/arts/peter-louca-future-arts-south-australia/|title=Peter Louca: "I think our best years are ahead of us." - The Adelaide Review|date=2016-08-10|work=The Adelaide Review|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later dismissed two weeks before the first budget of the [[Marshall Ministry]], possibly due to his long association with the [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://witnessperformance.com/bleeding-in-the-dark/|title=Bleeding in the dark » Witness Performance|date=2018-10-03|work=Witness Performance|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and his position of executive director abolished entirely. Previous [[Chief Executive|chief executives]] include Alexandra Reid and [[Greg Mackie]]. From 2010-2018, Arts South Australia managed Australia's oldest intact mainland theatre, [[Queen's Theatre, Adelaide|The Queens Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[http://www.queenstheatre.com.au/about/ GWB McFarlane Theatres &gt; About] Retrieved 30 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now managed by GWB McFarlane Theatres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queenstheatre.com.au/contact/ GWB McFarlane Theatres &gt; Contact] Retrieved 30 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Following significant federal funding cuts experienced by several South Australian small to medium arts organisations in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-20/$105m-budget-cut-caught-australia-council-by-surprise:-emails/7185900 "Australia Council budget cuts blindsided peak arts body's executive, documents show", ABC News]&lt;/ref&gt; Arts South Australia has been criticised by Arts Industry Council for South Australia for not providing enough financial support to the independent arts sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aicsa.net.au/state-budget-misses-the-mark-for-artists-in-south-australia/ "State Budget misses the mark for artists in South Australia", Arts Industry Council of South Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://indaily.com.au/news/2017/06/23/budget-fails-independent-arts-sector-aicsa/ "Budget Fails Independent Arts Sector", InDaily]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016 Arts South Australia established the campaign "Made In Adelaide" to export and promote South Australian artists at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://madeinadelaide.club/media/made-adelaide-grants-new-award-now-open/ "Made In Adelaide grants and a new award now open", Made In Adelaide Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Liberal Party came into government in 2018, the role of Arts South Australia was focused on provision of policy advice, with other administrative functions being incorporated into the Department of Premier and Cabinet, and significant aspects of the Arts South Australia portfolio being redirected to the Minister for Education and the Minister for Training and Further Education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aicsa.net.au/state-budget-sees-cuts-to-the-arts-and-significant-changes-to-arts-south-australia/|title=STATE BUDGET SEES CUTS TO THE ARTS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ARTS SOUTH AUSTRALIA - AICSA - Arts Industry Council of South Australia|work=AICSA - Arts Industry Council of South Australia|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Beloved''''' is a 1998 American [[horror film|horror]]-[[Drama (film and television)|drama film]]&lt;ref name="Beloved"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/436188/Beloved/|title=Beloved|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=April 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402134942/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/436188/Beloved/|archivedate=April 2, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Toni Morrison]]'s 1987 [[Beloved (novel)|novel of the same name]], directed by [[Jonathan Demme]] and starring [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Danny Glover]], and [[Thandie Newton]]. The plot centers on a former slave after the [[American Civil War]], her haunting by a [[poltergeist]], and the visitation of her [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] daughter whom she murdered out of desperation to save her from a slave owner. Despite being a [[box office bomb]],&lt;ref name="moviefone" /&gt; ''Beloved'' received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] for [[Colleen Atwood]], and both Danny Glover and [[Kimberly Elise]] received praise for their performances.

==Plot==
Sethe is a former [[slave]] living on the outskirts of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] shortly after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. An angry [[poltergeist]] terrorizes Sethe and her three children, causing her two sons to run away forever. Eight years later, Sethe ([[Oprah Winfrey]]) lives alone with her daughter, Denver ([[Kimberly Elise]]). Paul D. ([[Danny Glover]]), an old friend from Sweet Home, the [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] Sethe had escaped from years earlier, finds Sethe's home, where he drives off the angry spirit that inhabits it. Afterwards, Paul D. proposes that he should stay and Sethe responds favorably. Shortly after Paul D. moves in, a clean and seemingly mentally handicapped young woman ([[Thandie Newton]]) named Beloved finds her way into Sethe's yard and is taken in by her.

Denver is initially happy to have Beloved around, but learns that she is Sethe's [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] daughter. Nonetheless, she chooses not to divulge Beloved's origins to Sethe. One night, Beloved, aware that Paul D. dislikes her, immobilizes him with a spell and proceeds to rape him. Paul D. resolves to tell Sethe what happened, but instead tells what has happened to a co-worker, Stamp Paid ([[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]]). Stamp Paid, who has known Sethe for many years, pulls a newspaper clipping featuring Sethe and tells her story to the illiterate Paul D.

Years ago, Sethe was raped by the nephews of Schoolteacher, the owner of Sweet Home. She complained to Mrs. Garner, Schoolteacher's sister-in-law, who confronted him. In retaliation, Schoolteacher and his nephews brutally whip Sethe, leaving a "tree" of keloid scars on her back. Heavily pregnant with her fourth child, Sethe planned to escape. Her other children were sent off earlier to live with Baby Suggs, Sethe's mother-in-law, but Sethe stayed behind to look for her husband, Halle ([[Hill Harper]]). Sethe was assaulted while searching for him in the barn. The Schoolteacher's nephews held her down, raped her and forcibly took her breast milk.

When Halle failed to comply, Sethe ran off alone. She crossed paths with Amy Denver, a white girl who treated Sethe's injuries and delivered Sethe's child, whom Sethe named Denver after Amy. Sethe eventually reached Baby Suggs' home, but her initial happiness was short-lived when Schoolteacher came to claim Sethe and her children. In desperation, Sethe slits her older daughter's throat, and attempts to kill her other children. Stamp Paid manages to stop her and the disgusted Schoolteacher departs.

Paul D., horrified by the revelation and suddenly understanding the origin of the poltergeist, confronts Sethe. Sethe justifies her decision without apology, claiming that her children would be better off dead than enslaved. Paul D. departs shortly thereafter in protest. After Paul D.'s departure, Sethe realizes that Beloved is the reincarnation of her dead daughter. Feeling elated yet guilty, Sethe spoils Beloved with elaborate gifts while neglecting Denver. Beloved soon throws a destructive tantrum and her malevolent presence causes living conditions in the house to deteriorate. The women live in squalor and Sethe is unable to work, having become physically and mentally drained by Beloved's parasitic nature. Denver becomes depressed yet, inspired by a memory of her grandmother's confidence in her, she eventually musters the courage to leave the house and seek employment.

After Denver attains employment, women from the local church visit Sethe's house at the request of her new co-worker to perform an [[exorcism]]. Their motive for doing so is partly tempered with guilt; years before, they failed to warn Sethe of Schoolteacher's impending arrival. The women from the church comfort the family, and they are praying and singing loudly when Denver's new employer arrives to pick her up for work. Sethe sees him and, reminded of Schoolteacher's arrival, tries to attack him with an icepick, but is subdued by Denver and the women. During the commotion, Beloved disappears completely and Sethe, freed from Beloved's grip, becomes permanently bedridden.

Some months later, Paul D. encounters Denver at the marketplace. He notices she has transformed into a confident and mature young woman. When Paul D. later arrives at Sethe's house, he finds her suffering from a deep malaise. He assures Sethe that he and Denver will now take care of her. Sethe tells him that she doesn't see the point, as Beloved, her "best thing", is gone. Paul D. disagrees, telling Sethe that she herself is her own best thing.

==Production==
Prior to Morrison's receipt of the Pulitzer Prize for ''Beloved'', Winfrey purchased the rights to the novel in 1987; the translation to film then occurred a decade later.&lt;ref name="moviefone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2013/08/08/oprah-winfrey-lee-daniels-the-butler-interview/|work=Moviefone|date=2013-08-08|accessdate=2014-01-01|title=Oprah Winfrey on 'Lee Daniels' The Butler,' Returning to the Big Screen, and the Commercial Failure of 'Beloved'|author=Alex Suskind|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194042/http://news.moviefone.com/2013/08/08/oprah-winfrey-lee-daniels-the-butler-interview/|archivedate=2014-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a conflict over screenplay credit with [[Akosua Busia]] demanding sole credit and saying [[Adam Brooks (filmmaker)|Adam Brooks]] and [[Richard LaGravenese]] got too much. WGA gave credit to all three. Busia said they were all little more than script doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285239,00.html|title=Brawl Over 'Beloved'|date=1998-10-16|accessdate=2014-01-01|author=Daniel Fierman|work=Entertainment Weekly|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191939/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285239,00.html|archivedate=2014-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Praise for Winfrey===
During promotion of the film, [[Thandie Newton]] said to Vogue magazine, "Here we were working on this project with the heavy underbelly of political and social realism, and she managed to lighten things up ... I've worked with a lot of good actors, and I know Oprah hasn't made many films. I was stunned. She's a very strong technical actress and it's because she's so smart. She's acute. She's got a mind like a razor blade."&lt;ref&gt;(''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' October 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Critical reception was positive, with a 78% "fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 67 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beloved (1998)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1057370-beloved/|work=Rotten Tomatoes by Flixster|publisher=Flixster, Inc.|accessdate=2013-12-29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102212724/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1057370-beloved/|archivedate=2014-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, however, was a failure at the box office and could not come close to surpassing its $80 million budget.  According to BoxOfficeMojo.com and TheNumbers.com, the movie grossed only $8,165,551 on its opening weekend,&lt;ref name="thenumbers" /&gt; ranking #5 and being beat out by the horror movie ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' which ranked #2 and grossed approx $11,830,855 the same weekend. Winfrey has gone on public record stating that she ate 30 pounds of [[macaroni and cheese]] when she was informed the Saturday after the movie opened that "we got beat by something called Chucky."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2011/01/12/exp.Piers.Oprah.Biggest.Failure.cnn | work=CNN | title=CNN.com Video | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117105619/http://www.cnn.com/video/?%2Fvideo%2Fbestoftv%2F2011%2F01%2F12%2Fexp.Piers.Oprah.Biggest.Failure.cnn | archivedate=2011-01-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oprah also claimed that ''Beloved'''s failure at the box office was the worst moment in her career and brought her into a major depression. "It was the only time in my life that I was ever depressed, and I recognised that I (was) depressed because I've done enough shows (on the topic). 'Oh, this is what people must feel like who are depressed.'"&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

Director Jonathan Demme has commented, "''Beloved'' only played in theaters for four weeks. It made $22 million dollars -- I think that's a lot of money. And the only reason it left theaters after a month was because the Disney corporation that released the picture wanted all the ''Beloved'' theaters -- where we were doing very well, in a number of situations. The Walt Disney company wanted those theaters for [[Adam Sandler|Adam Sandler's]] ''[[The Waterboy|Waterboy]]''. So, we were told that they were gonna bring us back at the end of the year, and they didn't. But the picture did very respectfully. It was in the top ten its whole life."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first=Jonathan|last=Demme|work=Reelblack}} {{YouTube|oK6vM8dZJyg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Box office records have shown that Beloved remained in theaters into the holiday season, and by December 27, 1998, had grossed $22,746,521.&lt;ref name="thenumbers" /&gt; The film later returned to theaters for two weeks in March 1999, grossing an additional $1,000.&lt;ref name="thenumbers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Beloved#tab=box-office|title=Beloved:Theatrical Performance|work=The Numbers|accessdate=2014-10-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071322/http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Beloved#tab=box-office|archivedate=2014-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also no longer listed in the top ten on the box office chart by the November 6–8 weekend and had dropped to the rank of 12 on the chart by this point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1998&amp;wknd=45&amp;p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for November 6-8, 1998 - Box Office Mojo|author=|date=|website=www.boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916013613/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1998&amp;wknd=45&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=16 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Winfrey reflected on the film, saying: "To this day I ask myself, was it a mistake? Was it a mistake to not try and make [it] a more commercial film? To take some things out and tell the story differently so that it would be more palatable to an audience? Well, if you wanted to make a film that everybody would see, then that would be a mistake. But at the time, I was pleased with the film that we did because it represented to me the essence of the ''Beloved'' book."&lt;ref name="moviefone" /&gt;

The '''Christian music industry''' is a small part of the larger [[music industry]], that focuses on traditional [[Gospel music]], [[Southern gospel]], [[contemporary Christian music]], and [[alternative Christian music]]. It is sometimes called the '''gospel music industry''', although this designation is not a limitation on the musical styles represented.

Christian artists generally use secular styles, pairing them with lyrics that display faith and spirituality to varying degrees. Generally speaking, the industry is influenced by mainstream culture. Musical trends, for instance, follow those of the secular scene, though usually a few years behind.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_dct"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="dc Talk" p. 239.}} '''Quote:''' "Of ''course'' the Christian market was a few years behind the rest of the world... it always is." [original emphasis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCM_20_1_CS"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Urbanski |first=David |date=July 1997 |title=One Crazy Summer |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=24–32 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPCinA"/&gt; The Christian music industry carries the distinction of being the only music subculture whose content is labeled by its lyrical dimension rather than its music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Still, music within the industry is sold by its musical style rather than lyrical content.

Christian music's critics point to the divergent interests of commercialization and ministry, which have, according to some, [[wikt:polar opposite|polar opposite]] goals. Aspects of Christian music have long struggled to gain general acceptance, even within the Christian community. What some see as secularization and a lacking of direct theology, others see as artistic ministry. This opens up questions of the definition of "Christian music" that have lingered over the industry since its inception.

The Christian music industry experienced tremendous growth in the 1990s. Christian music sales grew to exceed those for classical, jazz, and new age music.&lt;ref name="GMA_OV_08"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmta.com/GMA_Industry_Overview_2008.pdf |title=GMA Industry Overview 2008 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Christian Music Trade Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the Christian music industry has experienced the same issues as the general market in recent years.

==History==
The contemporary Christian music industry has roots in the late 1960s and early 1970s [[Jesus movement]] and its [[Jesus music]] artists. The ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music'' points out three reasons that the Christian music industry developed as a parallel structure to the general music industry.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="Introduction" pp. 9–13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the Jesus movement produced a large number of bands in a very short period, which the general market was unable and/or unwilling to absorb.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"/&gt; This was in part due to a lack of appreciation for the ideology expressed by such artists.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"/&gt; Finally, Jesus music artists tended toward mistrust of secular corporations.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"/&gt; According to another critic, the industry in this period was defined by four characteristics: lack of audience acceptance for styles, inferior production, inefficient distribution, and lack of wide radio exposure.&lt;ref name="RPCinA"/&gt; [[Petra (band)|Petra]], for instance, struggled to find an audience for their hard rock sound, partially due to limited distribution to Christian bookstores.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"&gt;{{harvnb|Cusic|2002|loc=Part Four, pp. 279–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, the 1970s saw established corporations become involved in the Christian music market. [[Word Records]], founded in 1951, was bought in 1976 by [[ABC Records|ABC]].&lt;ref name="Mount_Web"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mount |first=Daniel J. |title=A City on a Hilltop? The History of Contemporary Christian Music |year=2005 |url=http://www.danielmount.net/ccm.html |accessdate=2007-02-12 |page=50 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203163712/http://www.danielmount.net/ccm.html |archivedate=February 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other music industry giants also got involved, [[Columbia Records|CBS]] started a short-lived Christian label, Priority Records, and [[MCA Records|MCA]] also fielded a label, Songbird Records, for a time.

While the Jesus movement had ended by the 1980s, the Christian music industry was maturing and transforming into a multimillion-dollar enterprise. The early 1980s saw an increase Christian booksellers taking product, and an increase in sales followed, despite [[Domestic policy of the Reagan administration#"Reaganomics" and the economy|the recession]].&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; As a percentage of gross sales, Christian music rose from 9% in 1976 to 23% in 1985.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; By [[Age to Age|her 1982 release]] [[Amy Grant]] had saturated the Christian marketplace and made significant inroads into the general market.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; [[Sandi Patti]] and [[Michael W. Smith]] also gained influence within Christian music, each playing significant roles in the development of the industry.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt;

Harder forms of Christian music, such as [[metal music|heavy metal]], also began to gain acceptance. This is largely credited to [[Stryper]], who had begun making inroads into the general market by 1985.&lt;ref name="Hale_93"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hale |first=Mark |title=Headbangers |year=1993 |publisher=Popular Culture, Ink. |location=[[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] |edition=First edition, second printing |isbn=1-56075-029-4 |chapter=2869 |page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, rock and [[Christian alternative rock|alternative]] acts faced a longer battle for acceptance than [[Contemporary Christian music|contemporary]] acts, as the form was opposed by prominent religious leaders such as [[Jimmy Swaggart]] and others on the [[Christian right]].&lt;ref name="CCM_28_5"&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 1985 |title=Christian Rock Wars: Evangelist [[Jimmy Swaggart]] Tells Why He Hates Today's Christian Rock |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=14–17 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DTT_CROCK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.av1611.org/articles.html#Crock |title=Articles / Christian Music |publisher=[[Dial-the-Truth Ministries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in 1981 total gospel music industry revenues were approximately $180&amp;nbsp;million, only ten years later they would total $680&amp;nbsp;million, according to ''CCM Magazine''.&lt;ref name="CCM_14_6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gascon |first=Ana |date=December 1991 |title=A Music Video Network That Needs To Be Zeen |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=14 |issue=6 |page=12 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to RIAA data, market share for sales of Christian music albums more than doubled between 1993 and 1997.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970317"/&gt; In the 1990s the Christian music industry became the fastest growing segment of the music industry.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970317"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gillespie |first=Natalie Nichols |title=Gospel Is Fastest-Growing Genre |journal=CCM Update |date=March 17, 1997|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to several factors, including consolidation of record labels, and independent Christian bookstores into chains.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt;

The Christian music industry began adopting SoundScan in 1995, although implementation was spotty even into the millennium. Even so, the adoption caused the visibility of Christian artists to increase significantly, and brought credibility to the industry as Christian albums became integrated into all [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]].&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCMU_19990712"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brasher |first=Joan |title=Christian Music's Mid-Year Sales Jump 21 Percent |journal=CCM Update |date=July 12, 1999|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCMU_1995_Review"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akins |first=Debra |title=The Year in Review: 1995 Broke New Ground for Christian Music |journal=CCM Update |year=1995|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, 90% of Christian music sales originated at Christian bookstores. By 1995, that number had dropped to 64%, with general retailers taking 21%, and the remainder accountable through other methods, such as direct mail.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; At that same time, the industry was estimated to gross $750&amp;nbsp;million, with $381&amp;nbsp;million in album sales.&lt;ref name="Econ_1995-08-19"&gt;{{cite journal|title=God's Own Country|publisher=The Economist|volume=336|issue=7928|date=August 19, 1995|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, general market retailers, especially big box stores such as [[Best Buy]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], and [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] began carrying a wider selection of Christian music products.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19980126"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=Lindy |title=CMTA Launches Dove Retail, Radio Campaign, Wal-Mart to expand Christian music sections |journal=CCM Update |date=January 26, 1998|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000 those stores had surpassed Christian retail in terms of the number of Christian albums sold, according to [[Soundscan]] numbers.&lt;ref name="CCMU_20020107"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Connor |first=Lizza |title=Christian Music Sales Set Record for 2001: Gap between general-market and Christian retailers widest in SoundScan history |journal=CCM Update |date=January 7, 2002|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCMU_20011119"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=Lindy |title=General-market Competition Focus for CBA Expo 2002 |journal=CCM Update |date=November 19, 2001|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon was partially responsible for crossover successes. [[P.O.D.]], for example, sold 1.4&amp;nbsp;million albums in 2001, although sales at Christian retail outlets accounted for only 10%.&lt;ref name="CCMU_20020107"/&gt;

The new millennium has brought [[2000s in music industry|challenges for the record industry]] as a whole, and these have affected the Christian music industry as well.&lt;ref name="CYTY_09_Recession"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Geil |first=Mark |title=Music in Recession |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |date=June 2, 2009|issn=0009-5753 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/commentaries/2009/musicinrecession.html |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contemporary worship music]], a long time staple of the industry, began to gain significant [[market share]] in about the year 2000.&lt;ref name="CR_46_8"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feinberg |first=Margaret |authorlink=Margaret Feinberg |title=Modern Worship Is Exploding |journal=Christian Retailing |date=April 15, 2000 |pages=45–56 |volume=46 |issue=8 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBAJ_32_7"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCabe |first=Ginny |title=Praise &amp; Worship Music Changing for the Millennium |journal=CBA Marketplace |date=July 1999 |volume=32 |issue=7 |page=222 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By focusing on marketing worship music to youth culture, this genre became a growth driver despite the downturn in the general music industry.&lt;ref name="BB_111_18"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=May 1, 1999 |title=Worship Music Targets Youth |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |issn=0006-2510 |volume=111 |issue=18 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BB_118_13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB_115_07"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=February 15, 2003 |title=Praise and Worship Genre Blessed With Global Growth |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |issn=0006-2510 |volume=115 |issue=7 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCMU_20000529"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Riddle |first=Melissa |title=Modern Worship Music Booms: Labels scramble to meet demand |journal=CCM Update |date=May 29, 2000|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|quote="The money is just drying up.&lt;br /&gt;And it's not being replaced."|source=John W. Styll, president, [[Gospel Music Association]] and longtime ''[[CCM Magazine|CCM]]'' publisher&lt;ref name="CYTY_09_Recession"/&gt;|width=25%}}

In 2009 a [[The New York Times]] [[op-ed]] placed the entire music industry on a "deathwatch,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles M. |last=Blow |authorlink=Charles M. Blow |title=Swan Songs? |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-09-23 |page=A17 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/opinion/01blow.html |date=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that new forms of media, piracy, and new pricing options are driving gross sales down. In another example of parallelism, the Christian music industry has experienced largely the same phenomenon. In the Christian marketplace, music consumption has risen by as much as 30% since 2005, but overall album sales have dropped to about half of their 1999 levels.&lt;ref name="CYTY_09_Recession"/&gt; However, some critics point out that the current downturn may have long term positive effects for the industry. [[John J. Thompson]] told ''[[Christianity Today]]'' that "The lack of monetary benefit has filtered out some of the people who should not have been doing this in the first place. If the people who are in it for the money are gone, it leaves more turf for those who had something a little bit loftier in mind."&lt;ref name="CYTY_09_Recession"/&gt;

==Criticisms==&lt;!-- Obviously, there are a great number of bands that could be listed in this section. Please try to limit these to relevant examples. --&gt;

==="Ghetto" assertion===
Christian music is sometimes cited as a "ghetto,"&lt;ref name="RPCinA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AoR1999"/&gt; meaning that the majority of artists in the industry are pigeonholed to operate solely in it. These artists are isolated from the mainstream public, to [[Christian media]], including radio, magazines, and book stores. For many this is a conscious choice, however others, not content to stay in an isolated industry segment, attempt to "cross over" and gain acceptance in the general market. For many artists, being called Christian becomes a [[wiktionary:stigma|stigma]].&lt;ref name="Hendershot2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendershot|2004|loc=pp. 39–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|caption=A 1997 survey looked at familiarity with "well-known" Christian artists. Self-identified Christian music listeners in are shown in green, and the general public in red.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970526_s"/&gt;
}}

A 1997 study revealed that a self-identified audience of "Christian music listeners" had what was considered a lacking recognition of Christian artists.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970526_s"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Consumer Survey Reveals Potential Markets for Christian Music |journal=CCM Update |date=May 26, 1997|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey was commissioned by the [[Christian Music Trade Association]] and [[Z Music Television]]. The study looked at several artists including [[Amy Grant]], [[BeBe Winans|BeBe]] and [[CeCe Winans]], [[Carman (singer)|Carman]], [[Steven Curtis Chapman]], [[dc Talk]], [[Sandi Patty]], and [[Michael W. Smith]]. At the time of the survey, each of these artists was active in Christian music and had been so for at least nine years, was a multiple [[Dove Award]] and/or [[Grammy Award]] winner, and had albums [[RIAA certification|certified]] Gold or higher.

Even so, the survey found that the Christian music audience was no more familiar with artists in the field than they were with [[Hootie &amp; The Blowfish]], a popular act at that time. The study concluded that the word "Christian" was the problem, causing a stigma. "It's the label, not the music, that dissuades," one Christian music executive was quoted as saying, agreeing with the survey.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970526_s"/&gt;

Another aspect of the "ghetto" is that some artists have trouble gaining audience with Christians due to their non-conservative image.&lt;ref name="Kyle_2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2006|loc="If You Can't Beat 'em Join 'em" pp. 281–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stryper]] is a well-known example. Stryper received large amounts of criticism from groups on the Christian right, who argue (among other things) that their image as rock stars contradict their espoused faith. One critic wrote that the marriage of secular and religious elements in "Christian music" "violates all that God has commanded in the Bible about [[Doctrine of separation|separation]]."&lt;ref name="Truth85"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pyle |first=Hugh |title=The Truth About Rock Music |publisher=Sword of the Lord Publishers |location=[[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]] |year=1985 |isbn=0-87398-839-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ghetto" has several effects, critics point out that the audience of such artists are often already Christians, thus limiting the impact of any supposed "evangelism."&lt;ref name="JoAC_15_3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1992.t01-1-00079.x |last=Romanowski |first=William D. |title=Roll Over Beethoven, Tell Martin Luther The News: American Evangelicals and Rock Music |pages=79–82 |journal=Journal of American Culture |volume=15 |issue=3 |date=Fall 1992 |publisher=[[Bowling Green State University]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that artists sometimes have trouble appealing to and maintaining both secular and religious audiences. For example:

*One [[Jesus music]] artist, [[Randy Matthews]], ran into trouble at an early Christian music festival after announcing an upcoming tour with [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[ZZ Top]].&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_RM"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="Randy Matthews" pp. 566–569.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd, also reacting to his electric musical style, chased him off the stage, pronouncing him to be [[Demonic possession|demon]] or [[Drug abuse|drug]] possessed.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_RM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCM_3_6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rabey |first=Steve |date=December 1980 |title=Randy Matthews... The Long Road To Now |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=3 |issue=6 |page=14 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews was later dropped from the tour.
*After [[Bob Dylan]] announced his conversion to Christianity in 1979, he released three albums widely cited as being based on his newfound faith.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_bdylan"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="Bob Dylan" pp. 277 – 286.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan spent several years touring and preaching from stage, though he never became a part of the "Christian music subculture."&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_bdylan"/&gt; The result, as one critic bluntly puts it, was that "It didn't work. Christian music fans were characteristically suspicious of Dylan's failure to leave the world behind and become a part of their little ghetto, and the world at large tired quickly of paying money to hear him sing about religion."&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_bdylan"/&gt; By 1981, Dylan had dropped the explicit religious references; both critics and audiences returned his music to acclaim.
*While commonly cited as the father of Christian rock, [[Larry Norman]] struggled to gain acceptance from the Christian music industry, and was largely estranged from it for his career.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_LNorman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="Larry Norman" pp. 633–641.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CYTY_52_4"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Christian Rock's 'Father' Dies: icon Larry Norman was often estranged from the industry |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |date=April 2008 |volume=52 |issue=4 |page=13 |issn=0009-5753 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Upon This Rock (Larry Norman album)|1969 solo debut]] has been described by secular observers as "perhaps the first truly accomplished and relevant Christian rock testimony ever recorded,"&lt;ref name="AllMusic_LN_1969"&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r90988|pure_url=yes}} | publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=2009-04-26 |first=Vincent | last=Jeffries | title=''Upon This Rock''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1972's ''[[Only Visiting This Planet]]'' became one of the most revered albums of all time in Christian music. Even so, Norman became, according to ''CCM'' "so far outside the mainstream that most of today's Christian music fans have no idea who Larry Norman is."&lt;ref name="CCM_30_9_LN"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=John J. |authorlink=John J. Thompson |date=April 2008 |title=Remembering Larry Norman |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=24 |issue=9 |page=42 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem, as summed by one critic, was that the music was too religious for secular audience, while simultaneously too aggressive for religious audiences.&lt;ref name="JMIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AoR1999"/&gt; One critic describes the situation, stating that for a band "to be taken seriously outside the Christian scene, a band must stay far, far away from that scene."&lt;ref name="CTTY_06_06"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moll |first=Rob |title=Rock Un-Solid: When Christian bands bite the hands that praised them |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/june/28.62.html |date=June 2006 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mutemath]], for instance sued their record label with the goal of removing their product from the Christian market. [[Reset (Mute Math EP)|Their first release]] sold almost 30,000 copies, with "bulk of sales coming from the Christian market," according to ''Billboard''.&lt;ref name="BB_118_10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martens |first=Todd |title=A question of faith: buzz band Mutemath, preferring secular rock, sues Warner |journal=[[Billboard Magazine]] |date=March 11, 2006 |volume=118 |issue=11 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band had been placed in the Christian market by their record label largely because their lead singer, [[Paul Meany]], was previously with the band [[Earthsuit]], whose [[Kaleidoscope Superior|only major label release]] was released on [[Sparrow Records|a Christian label]].

This caused the band to not get taken seriously by music critics, and by the release of [[Mutemath (album)|their full-length album]] the band began expressing discontent with their situation.&lt;ref name="TW_Mutemath"&gt;{{cite news |last=Holub |first=Annie |url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/church-and-state/Content?oid=1083036 |title=Church and State: Mutemath fights the machine at Warner Bros |work=[[Tucson Weekly]] |date=January 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meany told ''Tucson Weekly'' "...we began to see ourselves getting pigeonholed into this particular world that we weren't necessarily proud to be associated with... We're not trying to preach through our music; we don't have some kind of [[evangelistic]] agenda with what we're doing... You know, you don't want to be ashamed of your faith and your beliefs, but you don't want to be marketed by that, either."&lt;ref name="TW_Mutemath"/&gt;

On the other hand, some artists operate solely within the "ghetto" of Christian music, and find great success in doing so.

===Downplayed religious content===&lt;!-- Obviously, there are a great number of bands that could be listed in this section. Please try to limit these to relevant examples. --&gt;
An early Christian record label, [[Lamb &amp; Lion Records]] (founded by [[Pat Boone]]) reported in 1978 that it was their goal to produce crossover artists, but they were limited by lack of distribution to the secular marketplace.&lt;ref name="ET_29_5"&gt;{{cite journal |title=H-E-R-E-S'S Christian Show Biz! |last=Hortegas |first=Steve |journal=Eternity |volume=29 |issue=5 |date=May 1978 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both problems affected Christian labels into the 1990s.&lt;ref name="JoAC_15_3"/&gt; "Since people don't understand [the term] '[[Blood of Christ|the Blood of Jesus]], '" stated a manager for Lamb &amp; Lion, "...music that communicates must approach it another way. We've got to present a subtle but sensitive Christian message."&lt;ref name="ET_29_5"/&gt; Lyrics with subdued religious content have become commonplace in the industry; One critic points out that the secular hit "[[Spirit in the Sky]]" "has more explicit religious references than do many recent Christian radio hits."&lt;ref name="BILLBOARD_G_HIST"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alfonso|2002|loc="Contemporary Christian music: A History" pp. 11–29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have alleged that CCM often uses "minimal direct theology," and promotes a "Jesus is my boyfriend" image of God.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; Using downplayed religious content in lyrics has allowed some artists to "cross over" and make significant impact into the general market. Some Christian bands are able to do this while maintaining their identity in the Christian market. For example, [[MercyMe]], whose double platinum album ''[[Almost There (MercyMe album)|Almost There]]'' produced the Christian and secular chart hit "[[I Can Only Imagine (MercyMe song)|I Can Only Imagine]]." However, the lyrics of the single, while Christian in nature, contain what one critic calls "rather [[wiktionary:vacuous|vacuous]] theology."&lt;ref name="JMIA"/&gt;

Sometimes "crossing over" creates ambiguity over whether an artist is Christian (a "Christian band"),&lt;ref name="AoR1999"/&gt; or the artist is composed of Christians and produces music that appeals to Christian music fans but doesn't cater to the Christian market ("Christians in a band").&lt;ref name="AoR1999"/&gt; Such artists are:

*[[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle]], whose [[Point No. 1|debut album]] was released to Christian music markets, received three [[Dove award]]s.&lt;ref name="DOVE_CHV1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?cid=32 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020106001828/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?cid=32 |archivedate=January 6, 2002 |title=Dove Award Recipients for Hard Music Recorded Song |publisher=[[Gospel Music Association]] |accessdate=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOVE_CHV2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020406020434/http://doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=2000 |archivedate=April 6, 2002 |title=Dove Award Recipients for Hard Music Album |publisher=Gospel Music Association |accessdate=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the band is not generally considered to be a "Christian band" today. On that topic the band states "We originally signed with [[Squint Entertainment|a record company]] that was backed by [[Word Records|Word]] (a Christian label housing [[John Tesh]] and [[Amy Grant]]), so the record was in Christian bookstores. It was really an accidental thing."
*[[Project 86]] has sometimes been labeled a "Christian band", although the band itself eschewed the label. The band considers its art to be the best conveyance of their message.&lt;ref name="CM_Vol_52"&gt;{{cite book |last=Winters |first=Kelly |editor=Pilchak, Angela M. |title=Contemporary Musicians |series=Volume 52 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Gale Group]] |location=[[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] |issn=1044-2197 |isbn=0-7876-8065-6 |chapter=Project 86 |pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frontman Andrew Schwab has offered several statements on the topic. "We're not going to go in there and say 'Hey we're the Christian band. We're going to carry ourselves like a normal band. Hopefully people will like our music and investigate into the band [...] and they will learn our beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Wide range of music inspires Project 86 | author = Gonzales, Ron | publisher = [[Albuquerque Journal]] | page = 2D | date = May 28, 2004 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If we're playing at [[Ozzfest]] or on [[Family Values Tour|Family Values]]...," the band told ''[[7ball]]'' after the release of [[Drawing Black Lines|their second album]], "there is a greater level of tact necessary in order to reach that sort of audience."&lt;ref name="7b_30"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dodd |first=Jason |title=Hard and Fast |pages=51–52 |date=May–June 2000 |issue=30 |journal=[[7ball]] |issn=1082-3980 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 interview, Schwab further opined "We always tell people that the goal has been to just write music that we love, and write music hopefully that is challenging and inspiring to people and doesn't sound like everything else out there."&lt;ref name = "DIBASE_2007-04-23"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/interviews/Project862007.asp | title = I want ''Rival Factions'' | last = DiBase | first = John | publisher = Jesus Freak Hideout | date = April 23, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Switchfoot]] is often referred to as a "Christian band", mostly due to their involvement with the Christian rock scene in their early days. But the band has always shunned this label: "For us, it's a faith, not a genre,..." says Jon Foreman. "...these songs are for everyone. Calling us 'Christian rock' tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them. And that's not what we're trying to do. Music has always opened my mind—and that's what we want".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/01/09/switchfoot_steps_toward_stardom |title=Switchfoot steps toward stardom |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=January 9, 2004 |accessdate=2006-08-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050123135046/http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/01/09/switchfoot_steps_toward_stardom?mode=PF |archivedate = January 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duly, Foreman's lyrics steer clear of preachiness, exclusive declarations of faith, or even any mention of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], instead [[Social commentary|questioning the status quo]], probing [[Existentialism|existential]] issues through "[[Socratic dialogue]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utahstatesman.com/media/storage/paper243/news/2004/10/13/Features/Question.And.Answer.With.Switchfoots.Jon.Foreman-751862.shtml |title=Question and Answer with Switchfoot's Jon Foreman |date=October 13, 2004 |accessdate=2006-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130208220210/http://www.utahstatesman.com/media/storage/paper243/news/2004/10/13/Features/Question.And.Answer.With.Switchfoots.Jon.Foreman-751862.shtml |archivedate=February 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he answers questions with more questions, exploring frustrations, or simply being inspirational. Even so, this position has not alienated their Christian fans. As in their [[Indie (music)|indie]] days, they are still distributed to Christian retail outlets through [[Sparrow Records]], featured on Christian radio and charts, and presented [[GMA Music Awards|Dove Awards]], even after having been signed to the mainstream [[Columbia Records]]. [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] writer Andrew Beaujon takes the view that "their lyrics often have two different meanings, one meaning for a Christian audience and one meaning for the rest of us. They try to relate to two different groups of people at once".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=444350 |title=Rocking for Jesus |date=June 30, 2006 |accessdate=2006-08-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060706140202/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=444350 |archivedate = July 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In video====
The trend continues when examining religious videos. Many Christian bands produce videos with rotation on [[MTV]] in mind, however, the images can lead to an ambiguous impression of the portrayal.

In 1982 MTV featured two videos, "Constantly Changing" and "It's Mad" (which was the first one to be featured), made by the Swedish Christian rock band [[Jerusalem (Swedish band)|Jerusalem]] to promote their 1981 release ''Warrior''.&lt;ref name="MuLe_2_9"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Cable Music First? Lamb &amp; Lion act to be seen and heard on MTV. |pages=43 |journal=Billboard |date=November 20, 1982 |volume=88 |issue=? |publisher=[[Billboard Magazine]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DeGarmo and Key]] was the first Christian band in the US whose video appeared on MTV, made a video for their single "Six, Six, Six" off their 1984 release ''Communication''. While the video was shown on MTV for a short time, it was subsequently pulled for a scene which depicted the [[Antichrist]] engulfed in flames, which MTV described as "senseless violence."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |title=MTV Rejects DeGarmo and Key Video, Cites 'Violent' Scene |pages=3, 15 |journal=MusicLine |date=February 1985 |volume=2 |issue=9 |issn=0746-7656 |publisher=[[CCM Communications]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the video was re-edited for MTV—however, the unedited version continued to play in Christian bookstores and on Christian television networks, like [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|Trinity Broadcasting]].&lt;ref name="MuLe_3_1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=DeGarmo and Key Video Airs on MTV |page=3 |journal=MusicLine |date=May 1985 |volume=3 |issue=1 |issn=0746-7656 |publisher=[[CCM Communications]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video received a [[Dove award]] in a category created specially for it, "Gospel Music Visual Song" in 1985.&lt;ref name="MuLe_3_1"/&gt;

Another artist, [[Brian Welch]], whose ''[[Save Me from Myself (album)|solo debut]]'' was released to Christian markets, found their album pulled from some Christian bookstores after the music video for "Flush" was released.&lt;ref name="BrianW"/&gt; The video is an interpretation of the authors personal experience with [[methamphetamine]], before his religious conversion. At the time the album was pulled, Brian Welsh released a statement about the visual content of the video, relating its symbolism to his personal experiences of addiction and redemption. He also issued the following statement: "The video for 'Flush' is about [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] addiction and the crazy things anyone addicted to meth will do while they're [[Substance intoxication|high]] or to get their fix. Everything the models were doing in the video is what I was wrapped up in while I was addicted to meth... I believe I would be dead right now if I continued using meth, but instead, I chose to [[Salvation#Christianity|surrender my life]] to Christ and die to myself so He could share His resurrection with me... There is a huge message of hope on my CD and I believe those retailers that are pulling the CD from their shelves are robbing someone spiritually by taking it off of the shelves."&lt;ref name="BrianW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-Korn guitarist Brian "Head" Welch defends 'controversial' video|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=105600|date=September 25, 2008|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Z Music Television - Joe Gow Study.svg|150px|right|thumb|Classification of videos on Z Music by content&lt;ref name="PMS_S99"/&gt;]]
A study of visual elements of Christian music videos on [[Z Music Television]], a now defunct MTV-like channel for Christian music, found that almost one third of the channel's videos could be described as "Ambiguously Religious" at best (red area, right).&lt;ref name="PMS_S99"/&gt; The conclusion was that the channel's programming was designed to make its Christian nature "apparent only to those willing to listen for it."&lt;ref name="PMS_S99"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gow |first=Joe |date=Summer 1999 |title=Rockin', Rappin', and Religion: Programming Strategy on Z Music Television |journal=Popular Music and Society |publisher=[[Bowling Green State University]] Popular Press |issn=0300-7766 |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=17 |ref=harv |doi=10.1080/03007769908591730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other arguments===
Some critics describe the Christian music industry as being committed "to the goals and strategies of the commercial marketplace – industrial growth, increased market share, and greater profits."&lt;ref name="RPCinA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|2000|loc="Evangelicals and Popular Music: The Contemporary Christian Music Industry" pp. 105–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s as the largest Christian record labels became subsidiaries of the "mainstream" labels (who are themselves owned by huge [[media conglomerate]]s like [[Viacom]] and [[Time Warner]]).&lt;ref name="AoR1999"&gt;{{Harvnb|Howard|1999|loc=p. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendershot2002"/&gt; Others see the industry as taking on the roles traditionally reserved for the church. Concerts are the equivalent of religious services, and commodities symbols of faith.&lt;ref name="RPCinA_art"&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|2000|loc="Evangelicals and Popular Music: The Art World of Contemporary Christian Music" pp. 109–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions "[[evangelism]] becomes rhetoric—justifying the propaganda value of the industry's work – not spiritual reality."&lt;ref name="RPCinA_art"/&gt; One critic comments that "perhaps the 'ghettoization' and parallel institutionalism of CCM manifests itself nowhere more apparently than at numerous [[Christian rock festival]]s."&lt;ref name="JMIA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nichols|2008|loc=Chapter 5: "Jesus on Vinyl" pp. 122 – 146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8935">As used by copyright theorists, the term '''copynorm'''  (or more frequently '''copynorms''') is used to refer to a [[Norm (sociology)|normalized social standard]] regarding the [[Ethics|ethical]] issue of duplicating [[copyright]]ed material.  

Questions about the ethics of copying came to public attention as a result of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] systems, such as [[Napster]], [[Gnutella]], [[KaZaA]], [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] and [[Direct Connect (file sharing)|Direct Connect]].  Survey research indicates that most users of filesharing systems do not believe that it is wrong to download [[MP3]] files of copyrighted [[music]], even though such downloading may be unlawful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} 

These questions are important to legal theory, because the ability of copyright law to control the copying of digital material may depend more on voluntary compliance than on hypothetical criminal or civil actions against individuals.

== Legal background ==
Copyright law is actually a collection of legal rules.  Typically, copyright statutes confer a bundle of legal rights on the author or proprietor of a work (writing, a musical composition or an image), including the exclusive right to make copies of the work, subject to the [[fair use]]. Legal rules carry legal consequences.  Violation of copyrights can give rise to [[Civil liability|civil]] and [[criminal liability]].  

In the [[United States]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] grants [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] power to secure exclusive rights of authors to their writings, and Congress has exercised that power in a comprehensive statutory scheme, codified in [[Title 17 of the United States Code]]. 

Each nation has its own copyright laws and international treaties set minimum standards for copyright legislation.  This entry focuses on the laws of the United States as an example.

== Social rules ==
Copynorms are informal [[social rules]].  Social norms include rules of etiquette as well as moral norms (such as the moral prohibitions on theft or murder) and quasi-moral norms (such as the social rules that create zones of privacy in public places).  Copynorms are simply the informal social norms that determine the social acceptability of copying works created by others.  Social norms are enforced by informal social sanctions, ranging from simple expressions of disapproval (mild) to shunning or vandalism (severe).

Copyright law and copynorms are interrelated but distinct.  Some copying that is not prohibited by copyright law violates copynorms—[[plagiarism]] of work in the [[public domain]] would be an example.  More significant to copyright theory and policy, copying that is prohibited by law may be considered socially acceptable.

== Real life examples ==
=== P2P impact ===
In the late 1990s and early in the 2000s, [[peer-to-peer filesharing]] over the [[Internet]] became increasingly popular.  The first P2P program to receive widespread attention in the media and popular consciousness was [[Napster]].  After the Napster service was shut down by an injunction issued by the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]], a variety of other P2P ([[Gnutella]], [[Bearshare]], [[Kazaa]], etc.) programs became popular.  Perhaps the most significant use of P2P programs involves the distribution of MP3 files created by ripping copyrighted music from a commercial Compact Disc.  The use of P2P to distribute digital copies of [[Digital Versatile Disc|DVD]] files has also grown in popularity.

There is considerable controversy over the application of the copyright laws to individual, noncommercial use of P2P programs to distribute MP3 files, but judicial opinion, so far, has sided with the music industry and held that an individual who copies and distributes an MP3 file containing copyrighted music violates federal copyright law.  Nonetheless, the use of P2P to share and download copyrighted music is considered socially acceptable.  Survey research supports this conclusion{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}, as does the use of P2P programs by tens or hundreds of millions of persons.

=== Other cases ===
Although P2P has been the focal point in discussions of copynorms, the phenomenon is more general in scope.  Some other contexts in which copynorms diverge from [[United States copyright law]] include the following:
*Videotape recording of copyrighted broadcast and cable television content for archival (as opposed to time shifting) use,
*Systematic photocopying of books and journal articles for academic and business use,
*Audiotape recording of live music concerts,
*The use of copyrighted digital images ([[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[JPEG]], etc.) on personal websites.

To varying degrees, in each of these cases, copying that violates the law is socially acceptable.  [[Anecdotal evidence]] suggests that illegal archiving of television programs is widely regarded as socially acceptable, and it is doubtful that many users of home Video Cassette Recorders (VCRs) are aware that this activity is unlawful in some countries.

== Causes of divergence ==
In the absence of [[social science]] research, theorizing about the causes of the divergence between copyright laws and copynorms is necessarily speculative.  Several tentative hypotheses have been suggested.  A simple rational choice model might suggest that illegal copying is accepted simply because it is in the self-interest of individuals who can obtain copyrighted materials for free with very little risk of getting caught.

Another possible factor is connected to technological change.  Copying technology was relatively centralized and expensive until after the middle of the twentieth century.  Until the advent of inexpensive audio tape recorders, the sharing of copyrighted recordings was very difficult and expensive.  The transition from reel-to-reel to 8-track cartridge and later cassette tape recorders reduced costs substantially, but a significant investment of time was required to make each copy.  Digital technology, the [[Internet]], and specialized P2P software in turn substantially reduced the costs of file sharing.  Social norms develop over time and necessarily emerge only with respect to conduct that is sufficiently feasible to become a social issue.

A third factor springs from the fact that most laypeople do not know the precise scope of the monopoly that a copyright grants to the author (or copyright holder).

A final factor concerns the perceived legitimacy or justice of copyright laws.  Many individuals may believe that copyright laws are unjust.  For example, many users of P2P programs believe that large music companies rather than artists are the beneficiaries of the [[economic rent]]s created by copyright laws.  The most fervent advocates will engage in public [[civil disobedience]] of those parts of copyright law that they believe unjust, in hope of getting an eventual [[jury nullification]] or otherwise bringing the issues to public attention.

Although the empirical research on copynorms is limited, important survey research has been done by the [[Pew Center on Internet and Society]].

== Implications ==
Implications of weak copynorms for copyright theory and policy are a large and complex question.  
The content of copyright law may affect the emergence of copynorms.  For example, if copyright law is perceived as fair and legitimate, this may strengthen copynorms.  Weak copynorms may prevent copyright law from achieving its policy goals.  For example, the music industry has argued that P2P has reduced sales, and hence investments in the industry's production of new music recordings.

Proposals for more vigorous enforcement of copyright laws against individual users may affect copynorms, although both the direction and magnitude are uncertain.  On one hand, more enforcement might strengthen copynorms by expressing social disapproval of illegal copying.  On the other hand, strict enforcement might cause a backlash, further weakening social support for the copyright laws.

'''Cordel literature '''(from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term, ''literatura de cordel'', literally “string literature”) are popular and inexpensively printed booklets or [[pamphlets]] containing [[folklore|folk]] [[novels]], [[poems]] and [[songs]]. They are produced and sold in street markets and by street vendors in [[Brazil]], principally in the [[Northeast of Brazil|Northeast]]. They are so named because they are hung from strings to display them to potential customers.

== History ==
Cordel literature forms one of the least altered continuations of the Western traditions of popular literature, such as [[chapbook]]s, and [[popular prints]]. They come from the ''[[papel volante]]'' tradition of [[Portugal]]. This genre of literature was also found in Spain during the 18th and 19th centuries, and offered readers a wide array of topics, from basic instruction to political tracts.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

According to the poet [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]] it is one of the purest manifestations of the inventive spirit, the sense of humor and the critical capacity of Brazilians from the interior and of the humblest backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slater|first1=Candace |authorlink=Candace Slater |title=A vida no barbante: a literatura de cordel no Brasil|date=1984|publisher=Civilização Brasileira|location=Rio de Janeiro|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form ==
[[File:Xilogravura de Yolanda Carvalho.JPG|thumb|right|Woodcut by Yolanda Carvalho]]
Usually produced in black and white, in [[quarto]] format, ''cordel'' chapbooks are usually illustrated with [[woodcut]]s. Often both the author or poet’s and the woodcut artist’s names will appear in the credits of the book. Two expressive woodcutters are Adir Botelho and José Francisco Borges, whose woodcuts have been exhibited in the [[Louvre]] and the [[Smithsonian]].

The cordel literature found its zenith in the decades of 20s and 30s, with the popular legend created by the [[cangaço|cangaceiros]] of [[Lampião]], a band of outlaws and bandolier bandits who terrorized the region for almost 20 years. The [[War of Canudos]], a military conflict in the state of [[Bahia]], 1896-1897, has been also a frequent theme of cordel literature, due to its epic dimensions and importance for the history of the [[Sertão|Northeast backlands]].

Cordel literature can still be found in the Northeastern Brazilian states, most notably in [[Pernambuco]], [[Paraíba]] and [[Ceará]].

Some of the main authors from the past are Leandro Gomes de Barros (1865-1918)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recantodasletras.com.br/artigos/976198|title=A literatura de cordel e Leandro Gomes De Barros: Vida e obra|work=Recanto das Letras|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and João Martins de Athayde (1880-1959). 

Today some Cordel Literature authors as Marcelo Soares, [[Davi Teixeira]], Meca Moreco and Altair Leal are keeping this popular expression alive. They and others are helping to show to Brazil and the world the importance of popular art.

There are a lot of not-well-known cordel authors in Brazil, although there are still chapbooks that tell widely known old tales, even reivented, in a new context. See as an example a masterpiece of the past decades: ''A Chegada de Lampião no Inferno'' (The Arrival of Lampião in Hell) by José Pacheco, as well as today's ''A Chegada de Lula no Inferno'' (The Arrival of Lula in Hell); besides "classics", living folk poetry say to us much both about cordel and its strong roots in the day-to-day life of the people and its place in the Brazilian Culture as a whole.

The '''Cultural Medallion''' is a [[Singapore]] cultural award conferred to those who have achieved artistic excellence in [[dance]], [[theatre]], [[Literature of Singapore|literature]], [[Music of Singapore|music]], [[photography]], [[art]] and [[Cinema of Singapore|film]]. It is widely recognized as Singapore's pinnacle arts award.

It was instituted in March 1979 as an initiative of the late [[President of Singapore|President]], [[Ong Teng Cheong]] who was the then Minister for Culture. It is administered by the [[National Arts Council Singapore|National Arts Council]].

On 20 October 2006, [[Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts]] [[Dr Lee Boon Yang]] announced that Cultural Medallion recipients are eligible for a project grant of up to S$80,000 each, up from S$50,000. The increase would enable recipients to create major new works.&lt;ref name="Clara"&gt;Clara Chow, "SSO co-leader, versatile artist get highest award for the arts", ''[[The Straits Times]]'', 21 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

It was previously conferred by the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (the modern equivalent of the Minister for Culture). However, in 2006, the status of the award was further elevated by being conferred by the President of Singapore.

From 2013, in an effort to recognise multi-disciplinary artists, it was announced that recipients of the Cultural Medallion and Young Artist Award will no longer be categorised according to art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural Medallion &amp; Young Artist Award Winners|url=https://www.nac.gov.sg/docs/cmyaa/past-recipients_2014.pdf|website=National Arts Council|publisher=National Arts Council|accessdate=2 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903112331/https://www.nac.gov.sg/docs/cmyaa/past-recipients_2014.pdf|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Daluyong''''' ("Tidal Wave" or "Wave") is a 1976 [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-language novel written by [[Filipino people|Filipino]] novelist [[Lazaro Francisco]].  The novel was published in [[Quezon City]], [[Manila]], in the [[Philippines]] by the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] Press.&lt;ref name=OL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL5026575W/Daluyong|title=Daluyong nobela ni Lázaro Francisco|publisher=Open Library|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:CityofCabanatuanjf5028 08.JPG|thumb|right|200px| Lazaro Angeles Francisco bust, memorial, Caalibangbangan Park, [[Cabanatuan City]].]]

==Plot==
Daluyong begins where Francisco’s novel ''[[Maganda pa ang Daigdig]]'' ("The World Be Beautiful Still") ends. Lino Rivero, a former [[ranch]] worker, is given an opportunity to own a portion of land by the [[priest]] Padre Echevarria.  Lino becomes an avatar who, through his efforts and good will, is able to free himself from the oppressive "tenant farmer" system.  Apart from the "waves of changes" that might happen due to [[agrarian reform]] and because of the hope of the Filipino lower class for a good future, ''Daluyong'' tackled the "waves of forces" that prevents such changes and hopes from being realized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10096">The '''distancing effect''', more commonly known (earlier) by [[John Willett]]'s 1964 translation as the '''alienation effect''' or (more recently) as the '''estrangement effect''' ({{lang-de|Verfremdungseffekt}}), is a [[performing arts]] concept coined by German [[playwright]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] (1898–1956).

Brecht first used the term in an essay on "Alienation Effects in Chinese Acting" published in 1936, in which he described it as "playing in such a way that the audience was hindered from simply identifying itself with the characters in the play. Acceptance or rejection of their actions and utterances was meant to take place on a conscious plane, instead of, as hitherto, in the audience's subconscious".&lt;ref&gt;John Willett, ed. and trans., ''Brecht on Theatre'' (New York: Hill and Wang, 1964), 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The term ''Verfremdungseffekt'' is rooted in the [[Russian formalism|Russian Formalist]] notion of the device of ''making strange'' (приём остранения ''priyom ostraneniya''), which literary critic [[Viktor Shklovsky]] claims is the essence of all art.&lt;ref&gt;"Art as Device", translated by Benjamin Sher in Shklovsky, ''The Theory of Prose'' (Bloomington, IL: Dalkey Archive Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Lemon and Reis's 1965 English translation&lt;ref&gt;Lee T. Lemon and Marion J. Reis, eds. and trans., ''Russian Formalist Criticism'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press).&lt;/ref&gt; of Shklovsky's 1917 coinage as "[[defamiliarization]]", combined with John Willett's 1964 translation of Brecht's 1935 coinage as "alienation effect"—and the canonization of both translations in Anglophone literary theory in the decades since—has served to obscure the close connections between the two terms. Not only is the root of both terms "strange" (''stran-'' in Russian, ''fremd'' in German), but both terms are unusual in their respective languages: ''ostranenie'' is a neologism in Russian, while ''Verfremdung'' is a resuscitation of a long-obsolete term in German. In addition, according to some accounts Shklovsky's Russian friend playwright [[Sergei Tretyakov (writer)|Sergei Tretyakov]] taught Brecht Shklovsky's term during Brecht's visit to Moscow in the spring of 1935.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, see [[Douglas Robinson (academic)|Douglas Robinson]], ''Estrangement and the Somatics of Literature: Tolstoy, Shklovsky, Brecht'' (Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, many scholars have recently taken to using ''estrangement'' to translate both terms: "the estrangement device" in Shklovsky, "the estrangement effect" in Brecht.

It was in any case not long after returning in the spring of 1935 from Moscow, where he saw a command performance of Beijing Opera techniques by [[Mei Lanfang]], that Brecht first used the German term in print&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/download/attachments/75699736/Willett-Brecht-BrechtonTheatre-Excerpts.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1297321537000 "Alienation Effects in Chinese Acting"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719201339/https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/download/attachments/75699736/Willett-Brecht-BrechtonTheatre-Excerpts.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1297321537000 |date=July 19, 2013 }}, in Willett 99.&lt;/ref&gt; to label an approach to theater that discouraged involving the audience in an illusory narrative world and in the emotions of the characters. Brecht thought the audience required an emotional distance to reflect on what was being presented in critical and objective ways, rather than being ''taken out of themselves'' as conventional entertainment attempts to do.

The proper English translation of ''Verfremdungseffekt'' is a matter of controversy.  The word is sometimes rendered as ''defamiliarization effect'', ''estrangement effect'', ''distantiation'', ''alienation effect'', or ''distancing effect''. This has caused some confusion for English scholars who confuse the German word Verfremdung with Entfremdung.

Brecht wanted to "distance" or to "alienate" his audience from the characters and the action and, by dint of that, render them observers who would not become involved in or to sympathize emotionally or to empathize by identifying individually with the characters psychologically; rather, he wanted the audience to understand intellectually the characters' dilemmas and the wrongdoing producing these dilemmas exposed in his dramatic plots. By being thus "distanced" emotionally from the characters and the action on stage, the audience could be able to reach such an intellectual level of understanding (or intellectual empathy); in theory, while alienated emotionally from the action and the characters, they would be empowered on an intellectual level both to analyze and perhaps even to try to change the world, which was Brecht's social and political goal as a playwright and the driving force behind his dramaturgy.

In ''Brecht and Method'',&lt;ref&gt;London: Verso, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fredric Jameson]] abbreviates ''Verfremdungseffekt'' as "the V-effekt"; many scholars similarly leave the word untranslated.

== Techniques ==
The distancing effect is achieved by the way the "artist never acts as if there were a [[fourth wall]] besides the three surrounding him ... The audience can no longer have the illusion of being the unseen spectator at an event which is really taking place".&lt;ref&gt;Willett 91&lt;/ref&gt; The use of direct audience-address is one way of disrupting stage illusion and generating the distancing effect. In performance, as the performer "observes himself", his objective is "to appear strange and even surprising to the audience. He achieves this by looking strangely at himself and his work".&lt;ref&gt;Willett 92&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Brecht intended the distancing effect to refer to the audience or to the actor or to both audience and actor is still controversial among teachers and scholars of "Epic Acting" and Brechtian theatre.

By disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances and "fictive" qualities of the medium, the actors attempt to alienate the viewer from any passive acceptance and enjoyment of the play as mere "entertainment". Instead, the goal is to force viewers into a critical, analytical frame of mind that serves to disabuse him or her of the notion that what he is watching is necessarily an inviolable, self-contained narrative. This effect of making the familiar strange serves a didactic function insofar as it aims to teach the viewer not to take the style and content for granted, since (proponents argue) the theatrical medium itself is highly constructed and contingent upon many cultural and economic conditions.

It may be noted that Brecht's use of distancing effects in order to prevent audience members from what he characterizes as ''bathing'' themselves in empathetic emotions and to draw them into an attitude of critical judgment may lead to other reactions than intellectual coolness.  Brecht's popularization of the ''V-Effekt'' has come to dominate the understanding of its dynamics.  But the particulars of a spectator's psyche and of the tension aroused by a specific alienating device may actually ''increase'' emotional impact.&lt;ref&gt;Frau Weigel’s famous Gestus of the ''stummer Schrei'' or "silent scream," following the death of Courage's son Swiss Cheese, moved some to experience deep empathy—based on a vicarious feeling of what it is to so restrain oneself that the full expression of grief is prevented.&lt;/ref&gt;  Audience reactions are rarely uniform, and there are many diverse, sometimes unpredictable, responses that may be achieved through distancing.

Actors, directors, and playwrights may draw on alienating effects in creating a production.  The playwright may describe them in the script's stage directions, in effect requiring them in the staging of the work.  A director may take a script that has not been written to alienate and introduce certain techniques, such as playing dialogue forward to remind the audience that there is no fourth wall, or guiding the cast to act "in quotation marks".  The actor (usually with the director's permission) may play scenes with an ironic subtext.  These techniques and many more are available for artists in different aspects of the show.  For the playwright, reference to [[vaudeville]] or musical [[revue]]s will often allow rapid segues from empathy to a judgmental attitude through comic distancing.  A notable example of such estrangement in an English-language script can be found in [[Brendan Behan]]'s ''The Hostage'' (1958).

The '''Droste effect''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈdrɔstə}}), known in [[art]] as ''[[mise en abyme]]'', is the effect of a picture [[recursion|recursively]] appearing within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Nänny. Max and Fischer, Olga, ''The Motivated Sign: Iconicity in Language and Literature'' p.&amp;nbsp;37, John Benjamins Publishing Company (2001) {{ISBN|90-272-2574-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Please do not add anything here that is not a summary of cited material in the body of the article below - it will be removed.--&gt;

The effect is named for [[Droste|a Dutch brand of]] [[cocoa solids|cocoa]], with an image designed by Jan Misset in 1904. It has since been used in the packaging of a variety of products. The effect was anticipated in medieval works of art such as [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]'s [[Stefaneschi Triptych]] of 1320.

==Effect==

===Origins===
[[File:Polittico Stefaneschi, dettaglio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Detail from the 1320 [[Stefaneschi Triptych]] showing [[Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi|Cardinal Stefaneschi]] holding the triptych itself]]

The effect is named after the image on the tins and boxes of [[Droste]] [[cocoa solids|cocoa]] powder, one of the main [[Netherlands|Dutch]] brands, which displayed a [[nurse]] carrying a serving tray with a cup of hot chocolate and a box with the same image, designed by Jan Misset.&lt;ref&gt;Törnqvist, Egil. ''Ibsen: A Doll's House'', pp.105, Cambridge University Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-521-47866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This image, introduced in 1904, and maintained for decades with slight variations from 1912 by artists including [[Adolphe Mouron]], became a household notion. Reportedly, poet and columnist Nico Scheepmaker introduced wider usage of the term in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultuurarchief.nl/tentoonstellingen/0505droste.htm |title=Droste, altijd welkom |work=cultuurarchief.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===

The appearance is [[recursion|recursive]]: the smaller version contains an even smaller version of the picture, and so on.&lt;ref name=Merow2013/&gt; Only in theory could this go on forever, as [[fractal]]s do; practically, it continues only as long as the [[image resolution|resolution]] of the picture allows, which is relatively short, since each iteration [[geometric progression|geometrically]] reduces the picture's size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Juola |first1=Patrick |last2=Ramsay |first2=Stephen |title=Six Septembers: Mathematics for the Humanist |year=2017 |publisher=Zea Books |isbn=978-1-60962-111-7 |page=116 |quote=By putting a picture inside a picture, you get a progression of suggessively smaller, but self-similar images (the box of Droste cocoa has a picture of a woman holding a box of Droste cocoa... ). In theory, this nesting could go on forever into infinite detail, but in practical terms, the resolution of the image limits how it's actually drawn.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--It is a visual example of a [[strange loop]], a [[self reference|self-referential]] system of [[geometry instancing|instancing]] which is the cornerstone of [[fractal geometry]].--&gt;
&lt;!--USABLE IF CITED--&gt;

===In medieval art===

The Droste effect was anticipated by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] in 1320, in his [[Stefaneschi Triptych]]. The [[polyptych]] altarpiece portrays in its center panel [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi]] offering the triptych itself to [[St. Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html |title=Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych |publisher=The Vatican}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several examples from medieval times of books featuring images containing the book itself or window panels in churches depicting miniature copies of the window panel itself.&lt;ref&gt;See the collection of articles {{cite web |url=http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf |title=Medieval 'mise-en-abyme': the object depicted within itself |author=Whatling, Stuart |publisher=[[Courtauld Institute]] |date=16 February 2009 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102033517/http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf |archivedate=2 November 2013 }} for examples and opinions on how this effect was used symbolically.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the art of M. C. Escher===

The Dutch artist [[M. C. Escher]] made use of the Droste effect in his 1956 lithograph [[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]], which depicts a gallery containing a print which depicts the gallery, each time both reduced and rotated, but with a void at the centre of the image. The work has attracted the attention of mathematicians including Bart de Smit and [[Hendrik Lenstra]]. They devised a method of filling in the artwork's central void in an additional application of the Droste effect by successively rotating and shrinking an image of the artwork.&lt;ref name=Merow2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smit&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Smit |first=B. |last2=Lenstra |first2=H.

The '''Eighth Sister''' is the unbuilt project for the Zaryadye skyscraper in Moscow.  It would have been eighth sister to the group of [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven]] postwar [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist]] [[skyscraper]]s in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].  The architect was [[Dmitry Chechulin]].  

Original 1947 plans included an eighth tower, which would have been among the tallest buildings in the world.  Following [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, it was decided that the projected structure would overshadow the [[Moscow Kremlin]] and Chechulin's 1967 [[Rossiya Hotel]] was erected on the spot. In 1955, the unused plans were revised and used to build the still tallest skyscraper in Poland, the [[Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw]]. Acknowledging this connection, the Palace of Culture is informally referred to as the Eighth Sister.

The '''[[flag]] of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]''' is an official symbol of the province. The flag was approved 17 February 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.provinciegroningen.nl/servicelinks-provincie-groningen/over-de-provincie/provincievlag/ Provincievlag], [[Groningen (province)#Government|Province of Groningen]]. Retrieved on 3 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and is based upon the flag of the town of [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] and the coat of arms of the region [[Ommelanden]]. The colours red, white and blue are derived from the [[coat of arms]] of the Ommelanden, and the white and green are shown in the Groningen town flag. The colours of the town are in the centre of the flag to represent the central location of Groningen town, which is the capital of the province.

==Design==
The ratio of the flag is 2:3, the same as the [[Flag of the Netherlands|Dutch flag]]. The white cross has the width of 1/3 of the height of the flag and the green cross 1/9 of the flag height. The colors are defined as the Pantone-colors 032U (red), 300U (blue) and 355U (green).

==History==
In the year 1913 Van der Laars did a proposal to use a flag for the province of Groningen. His proposal was a flag that was based upon the flag of the Ommelanden. The blue stripe in the middle was altered to the green of the flag from the [[Groningen (city)|city of Groningen]]. He also did two other proposals where he used the colors of the [[coat-of-arms]] of the province of Groningen.

The design of the current flag was made by [[Jan Tuin]], member of the Gedeputeerde Staten of the [[Groningen (province)|province of Groningen]] and later mayor of the [[Groningen (city)|city of Groningen]]. They couldn't agree upon which flag would become the flag of the province. [[Jan Tuin]] proposed to design a new flag, this design was accepted. On 17 February 1950 it was decided by Gedeputeerde Staten that this would become the flag of the [[Groningen (province)|province of Groningen]]. Six days later the ruling was officially published.

'''''Gastrotypographicalassemblage''''' (compound word: {{nowrap begin}}''Gastro''&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;''typographical''&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;''assemblage''){{nowrap end}} is a {{convert|35|x|8.5|ft|m|adj=on}} work of art designed by [[Lou Dorfsman]] to decorate the [[cafeteria]] in [[Eero Saarinen]]'s [[CBS Building]] on [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

As the senior vice president and creative director for marketing communications and design for [[CBS]], Dorfsman was responsible for all aspects of the building's graphics, designating the type, design, and spacing for wall clocks, elevator buttons, and elevator inspection stickers.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Steven. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/26/nyregion/26dorfsman.html "Lou Dorfsman, Design Chief at CBS, Dies at 90"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 25, 2008. Accessed October 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He designed what he called ''Gastrotypographicalassemblage'' for the building's cafeteria, using varied [[typeface]]s to list all of the foods offered to patrons in hand-milled [[woodcut|wood type]]. The completed work was based on ideas conceived in the mid-1960s. The project was ultimately completed in 1966 with assistance from graphic designer [[Herb Lubalin]], and Tom Carnase, who crafted the [[typography]] from Dorfsman's original design. Dorfsman considered this work to be "his magnum opus, his gift to the world".&lt;ref name=AIGA&gt;Anwyl, Richard. [http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/rebuilding-a-legacy-the-gastrotypographicalassemblage "Rebuilding a Legacy: The Gastrotypographicalassemblage"], [[AIGA]], March 5, 2008. Accessed October 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gastrotypographicalassemblage'' was discarded in the early 1990s by CBS, but the work's nine panels were retrieved by designer Nick Fasciano. It was in an advanced state of disrepair, aggravated by improper storage. The piece was acquired by the [[Atlanta]]-based Center for Design Study in the mid-2000s, which developed a program to raise the funds needed to support the restoration of the work of art. Funding goals to begin the restoration fell short, and efforts to restore the work did not begin at that time. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlyBevuS3h8&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Lou Dorfsman in 2008, it was announced that [[the Culinary Institute of America]] in [[Hyde Park, New York]] would serve as the new home for Gastrotypographicalassemblage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciachef.edu/gastrotypographicalassemblage-release/ Culinary Institute of America]&lt;/ref&gt; The college worked with Nick Fasciano to fund the restoration, and the work was put on public display for the first time starting in March 2014, when it was showcased in the Institute's new Marriott Pavilion and Conference Center in its [[Hyde Park campus of the Culinary Institute of America|Hyde Park campus]], where it remains to this day.

The '''Habima Theatre''' ({{lang-he-n|תיאטרון הבימה}} ''Te'atron HaBima'', lit. "The Stage Theatre") is the [[List of national theatres|national theatre]] of [[Israel]] and one of the first [[Hebrew language]] theatres. It is located in [[Habima Square]] in the center of [[Tel Aviv]].

==History==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4058 Habima Theater.jpg|thumb|150px|Historic building, c.1950]] 
[[File:HANA ROVINA THE DYBBUK 1920.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Hanna Rovina]] as Leah in [[S. Ansky]]'s ''The Dybbuk'' (performed by Habima in the Hebrew-language translation by [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]]).]]

Habima was founded by Nahum Zemach in [[Białystok]] (then in [[Grodno Governorate]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]])  in 1912. [[Menahem Gnessin]] was one of its cofounders and early actors.&lt;ref name="Encycl-Judaica"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08098.html |title=Habimah |date=2007 |edition=2nd |via=Gale Virtual Reference Library database; and freely available via [[Jewish Virtual Library]] |work=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|place=Detroit |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because its performances were in [[Hebrew]], invoked the Jewish folk tradition, and dealt with issues of the Jewish people, it met with persecution by the [[Czarist]] government.  Beginning in 1918, it operated under the auspices of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]], which some consider its true beginning.  It encountered difficulties under the Soviet government as well as after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/habima-01.htm "Habima in New York: The Origin and Early History of the Habima"], Museum of Family History, accessed 6 Sep 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Konstantin Stanislavsky|Stanislavski]] arranged for the mainly Jewish Polish actors to be trained by [[Yevgeny Vakhtangov]]. The [[People's Commissar]] for Nationalities Affairs, [[Joseph Stalin]], also authorized the theatre's creation. However, the [[Yevsektsiya]] attempted to use its influence to cut off state funds to Habima, branding it counter-revolutionary.&lt;ref name=Shindler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shindler|first1=Colin|title=Israel and the European Left|date=2012|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|page=33|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International tour===

In 1926, the theatre left the [[Soviet Union]] to tour abroad, in countries including Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States.&lt;ref name=“Ivanov”&gt;Ivanov, Vladislav (August&amp;nbsp;10, 2010). “[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Habimah Habimah]”. ''[[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe|YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]''. yivoencyclopedia.org. Translated from Russian by I. Michael Aronson; revised by Alice Nakhimovsky and Michael C. Steinlauf. Retrieved 2018-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Their productions met with great success.&lt;ref name=“Ivanov”/&gt; In 1927, the company split up, with Zemach and some of the actors choosing to stay in the U.S.&lt;ref name=“Ivanov”/&gt;

===Lodz Impact===
The theatre staff visited the city of Lodz, and the pre-war photographer and artist [[Mendel Grossman]], photographed the actors and actresses from the wings of the stage. His life was changed as a result of the visit of the theatre.&lt;ref name="SAT"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grossman|first1=Mendel |last2=Meron|first2=Peter |title=With a Camera in the Ghetto|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yb9tAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_slider_cls_metadata_9_mylibrary|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment in Palestine===
[[File:Bima12night.jpg|thumb|250px|Habima stages ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Neues Schauspielhaus]], 15 September 1930. First professional performance of Shakespeare in Hebrew.]]

Other members of the theatre took the company to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="commentarymagazine.com"&gt;Politzer, Heinz (August 1948). "[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/habimah-in-new-yorka-great-theater-enters-a-new-period Habimah in New York: A Great Theater Enters a New Period]". ''Commentary Magazine''. Retrieved 2017-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1928-29 season there, the Habima Players presented two plays, both under the direction of [[Aleksei Dikiy]], from the Moscow Art Theatre.&lt;ref name="Encycl-Judaica"/&gt; The first production, ''Ha-otsar'' (The Treasure), a translation of [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s [[Yiddish]] play ''Der Oytser'', premiered on December 29, 1928.&lt;ref name="Encycl-Judaica"/&gt;  The second production, which premiered on May 23, 1929 in Tel Aviv, was ''Keter David'' (David's Crown), an adaptation by Hebrew writer [[Yitzhak Lamdan|Isaac Lamdan]]&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Henry W. (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mcC0hgK8FI0C&amp;pg=PA476 Calderón in the German Lands and the Low Countries: His Reception and Influence, 1654-1980]''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p.&amp;nbsp;476, footnote 17. Sullivan notes that Lamdan worked from the German translation by [[Johann Diederich Gries]].&lt;/ref&gt; of ''The Hair of Absalom'' (''Los cabellos de Absalón''), by the 17th-century Spanish dramatist [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca| Calderón]].&lt;ref&gt;Rokem, Freddie (1996).

Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN |0472106074}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;51-84; here: p.&amp;nbsp;72. "The production of ''David's Crown'', produced in Tel Aviv in 1929, during Habima's first visit there, was a very radical adaptation of Calderón de la Barca's ''Hair of Absalom''."&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1930 the company traveled to Berlin, Germany, where it produced Shakespeare's ''Twelfth Night'', directed by [[Michael Chekhov]], and [[Karl Gutzkow]]'s ''Uriel Acosta'', under the direction of [[Alexis Granowsky|Alexander Granovski]].&lt;ref name="Encycl-Judaica"/&gt; 

The company finally settled in Palestine in 1931.&lt;ref name="Encycl-Judaica"/&gt; In 1945, it built a theatre in Tel Aviv, which it occupied before completion.&lt;ref name="commentarymagazine.com"/&gt;

===National Theatre of Israel===
Habima has been officially considered the national theatre of Israel since 1958, the year in which it received the [[Israel Prize]] for theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyah |title=Israel Prize recipients in 1958 (in Hebrew) |publisher=Israel Prize Official Site |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqejxurH?url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyah |archivedate=January 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first year in which the Prize was awarded to an organization. In the 21st century, Habima employs 80 actors, and another 120 staff members work at the complex.

==Restoration== 
&lt;!-- [[Image:RubinaHabima2011.jpg|thumb|150px|Rovina Hall]] --&gt;
In January 2012, the theatre reopened after four and a half years of renovations.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;Shohat, Zipi (November&amp;nbsp;21, 2011).

'''Historicism''' is the idea of attributing meaningful significance to space and time, such as historical period, geographical place, and local culture. Historicism tends to be [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or [[relativism|relativist]], because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, Jeffrey. "Historicism." ''Renaissance Quarterly'', vol. 50, no. 4 December 22, 1997, p. 1202&lt;/ref&gt; The approach varies from individualist theories of knowledge such as [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]], which neglect the role of [[tradition]]s.

The term "historicism" (''Historismus'') was coined by German philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, Michael Rosen (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 175: "[The word 'historicism'] appears as early as the late eighteenth century in the writings of the German romantics, who used it in a neutral sense. In 1797 Friedrich Schlegel used 'historicism' to refer to a philosophy that stresses the importance of history..."; Katherine Harloe, Neville Morley (eds.), ''Thucydides and the Modern World: Reception, Reinterpretation and Influence from the Renaissance to the Present'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 81: "Already in   Friedrich Schlegel's ''Fragments about Poetry and Literature'' (a collection of notes attributed to 1797), the word ''Historismus'' occurs five times."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time it has developed different and somewhat divergent meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher [[G. B. Vico]] (1668–1744), and became more fully developed with the [[dialectic]] of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]] (1770–1831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of [[Karl Marx]], influenced by Hegel, also include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of [[Franz Boas]].

Historicism may be contrasted with [[reductionism|reductionist]] theories—which assumes that all developments can be explained by fundamental principles (such as in [[economic determinism]])—or with theories that posit that historical changes occur as a result of random chance.

The Austrian-English philosopher [[Karl Popper]] condemned historicism along with the [[determinism]] and [[holism]] which he argued formed its basis. In his ''[[Poverty of Historicism]]'', he identified historicism with the opinion that there are "inexorable laws of historical destiny", which opinion he warned against. This contrasts with the contextually relative interpretation of historicism for which its proponents argue. [[Talcott Parsons]] criticized historicism as a case of idealistic fallacy in ''The Structure of Social Action'' (1937).

[[Post-structuralism]] uses the term "[[New Historicism]]", which has some associations with both anthropology and Hegelianism.

The [[#Christian historicism|theological use]] of the word denotes the interpretation of biblical prophecy as being related to church history.

==Variants==

===Hegelian===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|right|thumb|G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831)]]

Hegel viewed the realization of human freedom as the ultimate purpose of history, which could only be achieved through the creation of the perfect state. And this progressive history would only occur through a dialectical process: namely, the tension between the purpose of humankind (freedom), the position that humankind currently finds itself, and mankind's attempt to bend the current world into accord with its nature. However, because humans are often not aware of the goal of both humanity and history, the process of achieving freedom is necessarily one of self-discovery. Hegel also saw the progress toward freedom being conducted by the "spirit" (Geist), a seemingly supernatural force that directed all human actions and interactions. Yet Hegel makes clear that the spirit is a mere abstraction, and only comes into existence "through the activity of finite agents." Thus, Hegel's philosophy of history is not necessarily metaphysical, despite the fact that many of Hegel's opponents and interpreters have understood Hegel's philosophy of history as a metaphysical and determinist view of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Cambridge University PRess|year=1993|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=289–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Karl Popper in his book ''The Poverty of Historicism'' interpreted Hegel's philosophy of history as metaphysical and deterministic. Popper referred to this "Hegelian" philosophy of history as ''Historicism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Poverty of Historicism|last=Popper|first=Karl Popper|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1957|isbn=|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's historicism also suggests that any human [[society]] and all human activities such as [[science]], [[art]], or [[philosophy]], are defined by their history. Consequently, their essence can be sought only by understanding said history. The history of any such human endeavor, moreover, not only continues but also reacts against what has gone before; this is the source of Hegel's famous dialectic teaching usually summarized by the slogan "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis, and synthesis]]".  (Hegel did not use these terms, although [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johann Fichte]] did.) Hegel's famous [[aphorism]], "Philosophy is the history of philosophy," describes it bluntly.

Hegel's position is perhaps best illuminated when contrasted against the atomistic and reductionist opinion of human societies and social activities self-defining on an ''ad hoc'' basis through the sum of dozens of interactions. Yet another contrasting model is the persistent metaphor of a [[social contract]].  Hegel considers the relationship between individuals and societies as organic, not atomic: even their social discourse is mediated by [[philosophy of language|language]], and language is based on [[etymology]] and unique character. It thus preserves the culture of the past in thousands of half-forgotten [[metaphor]]s.  To understand why a person is the way he is, you must examine that person in his society: and to understand that society, you must understand its history, and the forces that influenced it.  The ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the "Spirit of the Age," is the concrete embodiment of the most important factors that are acting in human history at any given time. This contrasts with teleological theories of activity, which suppose that the end is the determining factor of activity, as well as those who believe in a [[tabula rasa]], or blank slate, opinion, such that individuals are defined by their interactions.

These ideas can be interpreted variously.  The [[Right Hegelians]], working from Hegel's opinions about the organicism and historically determined nature of human societies, interpreted Hegel's historicism as a justification of the unique destiny of national groups and the importance of stability and institutions.  Hegel's conception of human societies as entities greater than the individuals who constitute them influenced nineteenth-century [[romantic nationalism]] and its twentieth-century excesses.  The [[Young Hegelians]], by contrast, interpreted Hegel's thoughts on societies influenced by social conflict for a doctrine of [[social progress]], and attempted to manipulate these forces to cause various  results.  Karl Marx's doctrine of "historical inevitabilities" and [[historical materialism]] is one of the more influential reactions to this part of Hegel's thought.  Significantly, Karl Marx's [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]] argues that [[capitalism]] disrupts traditional relationships between workers and their work.

Hegelian historicism is related to his ideas on the means by which human societies progress, specifically the [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]] and his conception of logic as representing the inner essential nature of reality. Hegel attributes the change to the "modern" need to interact with the world, whereas ancient philosophers were self-contained, and medieval philosophers were monks. In his History of Philosophy Hegel writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves. With the present day all difference has disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find them generally in connection with the world, participating with others in some common work or calling. They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationship. They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress. Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the external world is at rest, is brought into order — worldly relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible connection, and with that individuality likewise attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world.&lt;ref name=LecturesOnTheHistoryOfPhilosophyVolume3&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_the_History_of_Philosophy.html?id=ik05WhN4ga0C&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Volume 3"], By Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Translated by E. S. Haldane and Frances H. Simson, M. A., ''University of Nebraska Press'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This opinion that entanglement in society creates an indissoluble bond with expression, would become an influential question in philosophy, namely, the requirements for individuality.  It would be considered by [[Nietzsche]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Michel Foucault]] directly, as well as in the work of numerous artists and authors. There have been various responses to Hegel's challenge. The Romantic period emphasized the ability of individual genius to transcend time and place, and use the materials from their heritage to fashion works which were beyond determination. The modern would advance versions of John Locke's infinite malleability of the human animal. Post-structuralism would argue that since history is not present, but only the image of history, that while an individual era or power structure might emphasize a particular history, that the contradictions within the story would hinder the very purposes that the history was constructed to advance.

===Anthropological&lt;!--'Anthropological historicism'--&gt;===
In the context of [[anthropology]] and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. '''Anthropological historicism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron Kaldis (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences'', SAGE Publications, 2013, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with the work of [[Franz Boas]]. His theory used the [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusionist]] concept that there were a few "cradles of civilization" which grew outwards, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances, which is called [[historical particularism]]. The school of historicism grew in response to [[Classical social evolutionism|unilinear theories]] that social development represented adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a continuum. While these theories were espoused by [[Charles Darwin]] and many of his students, their application as applied in [[social Darwinism]] and [[general evolution]] characterized in the theories of [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Leslie White]], historicism was neither anti-selection, nor anti-evolution, as Darwin never attempted nor offered an explanation for cultural evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead emphasizing how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. [[Julian Steward]] refuted the viability of globally and universally applicable adaptive standards proposing that culture was honed adaptively in response to the idiosyncrasies of the local environment, the [[cultural ecology]], by [[specific evolution]]. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.

The primary method of historicism was empirical, namely that there were so many requisite inputs into a society or event, that only by emphasizing the data available could a theory of the source be determined. In this opinion, grand theories are unprovable, and instead intensive field work would determine the most likely explanation and history of a culture, and hence it is named "historicism."

This opinion would produce a wide range of definition of what, exactly, constituted culture and history, but in each case the only means of explaining it was in terms of the historical particulars of the culture itself.

===New===
{{main|New Historicism}}
Since the 1950s, when [[Jacques Lacan]] and Foucault argued that each epoch has its own knowledge system, within which individuals are inexorably entangled, many [[post-structuralist]]s have used ''historicism'' to describe the opinion that all questions must be settled within the cultural and social context in which they are raised. Answers cannot be found by appeal to an external truth, but only within the confines of the norms and forms that phrase the question.  This version of historicism holds that there are only the raw texts, markings and artifacts that exist in the present, and the conventions used to decode them. This school of thought is sometimes given the name of ''New Historicism''.

The same term, ''new historicism'' is also used for a school of literary scholarship which interprets a [[poem]], [[drama]], etc. as an expression of or reaction to the power-structures of its society. [[Stephen Greenblatt]] is an example of this school.

===Modern===
Within the context of 20th-century philosophy, debates continue as to whether ahistorical and immanent methods were sufficient to understand meaning—that is to say, "what you see is what you get" positivism—or whether context, background and culture are important beyond the mere need to decode words, phrases and references. While post-structural historicism is relativist in its orientation, that is, it sees each culture as its own frame of reference, a large number of thinkers have embraced the need for historical context, not because culture is self-referential, but because there is no more compressed means of conveying all of the relevant information except through history. This opinion is often seen as deriving from the work of [[Benedetto Croce]]. Recent historians using this tradition include [[Thomas Kuhn]].

===Christian===
{{main|Historicism (Christian eschatology)}}

====Eschatological====
In [[Christianity]], the term ''historicism'' refers to the confessional [[Protestantism|Protestant]] form of prophetical interpretation which holds that the fulfillment of [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophecy]] has occurred throughout history and continues to occur; as opposed to other methods which limit the time-frame of prophecy-fulfillment to the past or to the future.

====Dogmatic and ecclesiastic====
There is also a particular opinion in [[ecclesiastical history]] and in the [[History of Catholic dogmatic theology|history of dogmas]] which has been described as historicist by Pope [[Pius XII]] in the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]''. "They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed, forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |title=Humani generis, 15 |publisher=[[Vatican.va]] |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==

===Karl Marx===
The social theory of Karl Marx, with respect to modern scholarship, has an ambiguous relation to historicism. Critics of Marx have charged his theory with historicism since its very genesis. However, the issue of historicism also finds itself important to many debates within Marxism itself; the charge of historicism has been made against various types of Marxism, typically disparaged by Marxists as "vulgar" Marxism.

Marx himself expresses critical concerns with this historicist tendency in his [[Theses on Feuerbach]]:
{{quote|The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [Selbstveränderung] can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary [[praxis (process)|practice]].&lt;ref name="Theses on Feuerbach"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm | title = Theses on Feuerbach | website = | publisher = | accessdate = February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Karl Popper===

[[Karl Popper]] used the term ''historicism'' in his influential books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', to mean: "an approach to the social sciences which assumes that ''historical prediction'' is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history".&lt;ref name = "Poverty 3"&gt;POPPER, Karl, p. 3 of ''The Poverty of Historicism'', italics in original&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Popper wrote with reference to [[Hegel]]'s theory of [[history]], which he criticized extensively. However, there is wide dispute whether Popper's description of "historicism" is an accurate description of Hegel, or more his characterisation of his own philosophical antagonists, including [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought, then widely held as posing a challenge to the philosophical basis of the [[Western world|West]], as well as theories such as [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] which drew predictions about the future course of events from the past.

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper attacks "historicism" and its proponents, among whom (as well as Hegel) he identifies and singles out [[Plato]] and [[Marx]]—calling them all "enemies of the open society".  The objection he makes is that historicist positions, by claiming that there is an inevitable and deterministic pattern to history, abrogate the [[democracy|democratic]] responsibility of each one of us to make our own free contributions to the evolution of society, and hence lead to [[totalitarianism]].

Another of his targets is what he terms "moral historicism", the attempt to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel's words, that "history is the world's court of justice".  This may take the form of conservatism (former might is right), positivism (might is right) or futurism (presumed coming might is right). As against these, Popper says that he does not believe "that success proves anything or that history is our judge".&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', vol. 2 p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.

He also attacks what he calls "[[Historism]]", which he regards as distinct from historicism.  By historism, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits.  In Popperian terms, the "[[New Historicism]]" is an example of historism rather than of historicism proper.

===Leo Strauss===
[[Leo Strauss]] used the term ''historicism'' and reportedly termed it the single greatest threat to intellectual freedom insofar as it denies any attempt to address injustice-pure-and-simple (such is the significance of historicism's rejection of "natural right" or "right by nature").  Strauss argued that historicism "rejects political philosophy" (insofar as this stands or falls by questions of permanent, trans-historical significance) and is based on the belief that "all human thought, including scientific thought, rests on premises which cannot be validated by human reason and which came from historical epoch to historical epoch." Strauss further identified [[R. G. Collingwood]] as the most coherent advocate of historicism in the English language.  Countering Collingwood's arguments, Strauss warned against historicist social scientists' failure to address real-life problems—most notably that of tyranny—to the extent that they relativize (or "subjectivize") all ethical problems by placing their significance strictly in function of particular or ever-changing socio-material conditions devoid of inherent or "objective" "value." Similarly, Strauss criticized [[Eric Voegelin]]'s abandonment of ancient political thought as guide or vehicle in interpreting modern political problems.

In his books, ''[[Natural Right and History]]'' and ''[[On Tyranny]]'', Strauss offers a complete critique of historicism as it emerges in the works of Hegel, Marx, and [[Heidegger]]. Many believe that Strauss also found historicism in [[Edmund Burke]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Augustine]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Although it is largely disputed whether Strauss himself was a historicist, he often indicated that historicism grew out of and against Christianity and was a threat to civic participation, belief in human agency, religious pluralism, and, most controversially, an accurate understanding of the classical philosophers and religious prophets themselves. Throughout his work, he warns that historicism, and the understanding of [[Progress (history)|progress]] that results from it, expose us to [[tyranny]], totalitarianism, and [[Ochlocracy|democratic extremism]]. In his exchange with [[Alexandre Kojève]] in ''On Tyranny'', Strauss seems to blame historicism for [[Nazism]] and [[Communism]]. In a collection of his works by Kenneth Hart entitled ''[[Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity]]'',  he argues that [[Islam]], traditional [[Judaism]], and ancient Greece, share a concern for sacred law that makes them especially susceptible to historicism, and therefore to tyranny.  Strauss makes use of Nietzsche's own critique of progress and historicism, although Strauss refers to Nietzsche himself (no less than to Heidegger) as a "radical historicist" who articulated a philosophical (if only untenable) justification for historicism.

{{main|Claude Monet}}

'''[[Claude Monet]]''' painted a [[Serial imagery|series]] of oil paintings of the [[Palace of Westminster]], home of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], in the fall of 1899 and the early months of 1900 and 1901 during stays in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/56.135.6|title=''Claude Monet: The Houses of Parliament (Effect of Fog)'' (56.135.6) In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. (December 2010)}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the series' paintings share the same viewpoint from Monet's window or a terrace at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] overlooking the [[Thames]] and the approximate canvas size of 81&amp;nbsp;cm × 92&amp;nbsp;cm (32 in × 36 3/8 in).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/monet/parliament/|title=Monet, Claude: Houses of Parliament, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/09/science.arts|title='Hospital view. Experts decipher where Monet was standing', James Randerson, Wednesday 9 August 2006, Guardian Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are, however, painted during different times of the day and weather conditions.

By the time of the ''Houses of Parliament'' series, Monet had abandoned his earlier practice of completing a painting on the spot in front of the motif. He carried on refining the images back in France and sent to London for photographs to help in this. This caused some adverse reaction, but Monet's reply was that his means of creating a work was his own business and it was up to the viewer to judge the final result.

==Public display==

In 2018, the [[Tate Britain]] in [[Central London|London]] exhibited six paintings of the series, together in a single room, for the duration of a temporary exhibition titled ''Impressionists in London, French artists in exile (1870-1904)'', devoted to the temporary exile of French and [[impressionist]] artists in London during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. This was a rare occurrence because no museum owns or exhibits more than two in a permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Brown | first=Mark | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/18/monet-uk-parliament-paintings-feature-impressionism-tate-britain-exhibition | title=Monet's UK parliament paintings to feature in Tate Britain exhibition  | website=The Guardian | date=18 July 2017 | accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Sooke | first=Alastair | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/not-impressionistic-beautiful-impressionists-londontate-britain/ | title=Not very impressionistic, but beautiful all the same - Impressionists in London Tate Britain, review  | website=The Telegraph | date=30 October 2017 | accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob Eisenberg''' (1897–1965) (also Yaakov Eisenberg)  was an [[Israel]]i [[artist]] and a member of the [[Bezalel school]].&lt;ref&gt;Autour de l'art juif: encyclopédie des peintres, photographes et sculpteurs,
By Adrian M. Darmon, Paris, Carnot, 2003   p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenberg was born in [[Pinsk]] and immigrated to the land of Israel in 1913.  He studied art at the School for Arts and Crafts in Vienna, specializing in ceramics and at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in Jerusalem,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hirshgallery.com/toldot_e.html#1&lt;/ref&gt; where he continued as a teacher for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lionsgallery.com/html/ArtistBio.asp?artnum=136 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111022938/http://www.lionsgallery.com/html/ArtistBio.asp?artnum=136 |date=November 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly notable was his creation of a series of ceramic plaques and murals for the early buildings of [[Tel Aviv]].  These included the cities first street signs, ceramic plaques in deep blue inscribed with the street names in Hebrew, Arabic and English that were affixed to the corners of buildings.  The surviving plaques are now treasured historic landmarks.  Large Eisenberg murals enliven the facades of several Tel Aviv buildings, including the 1925 Lederberg house, at the intersection of [[Rothschild Boulevard]] and [[Allenby Street]].  The four murals show a Jewish pioneer sowing and harvesting, a shepherd, and Jerusalem with a verse from Jeremiah 31:4, "Again I will rebuild thee and thous shalt be rebuilt."&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Nachman Bialik Home, in Batia Carmiel, Tiles Adorned City; Bezalel ceramics on Tel Aviv Houses, 1923-1929), Eretz Israel Museum, Tel Aviv, copyright 1996, book in Hebrew and some English with illustrations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A place in history: modernism, Tel Aviv, and the creation of Jewish urban space,

{{slavery}}

'''Jewish views on slavery''' are varied both religiously and historically. [[Judaism]]'s ancient and medieval religious texts contain numerous laws governing the ownership and treatment of slaves. Texts that contain such regulations include the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), the [[Talmud]], the 12th century [[Mishneh Torah]] by rabbi [[Maimonides]], and the 16th century [[Shulchan Aruch]] by rabbi [[Yosef Karo]].  The original Israelite slavery laws found in the Hebrew Bible bear some resemblance to the 18th century BCE slavery laws of [[Hammurabi]].&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 619"&gt;Hastings, p 619&lt;/ref&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}} The regulations changed over time.  The Hebrew Bible contained two sets of laws, one for [[Canaan]]ite slaves, and a more lenient set of laws for Hebrew slaves.  From the time of the Pentateuch, the laws designated for Canaanites were applied to all non-Hebrew slaves. The Talmud's slavery laws, which were established in the second through the fifth centuries CE,&lt;ref name="BBC Religion"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Talmud|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/texts/talmud.shtml|website=BBC Religion|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; contain a single set of rules for all slaves, although there are a few exceptions where Hebrew slaves are treated differently from non-Hebrew slaves.  The laws include punishment for slave owners that mistreat their slaves.  In the modern era, when the [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement sought to outlaw slavery, supporters of slavery used the laws to provide religious justification for the practice of slavery.

Historically some Jewish people owned and traded slaves.&lt;ref name="Reiss p 85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Reiss|title=The Jews in Colonial America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQEyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85|date=2 January 2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1730-8|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were important players in the [[Slavery in medieval Europe|medieval slave trade in Europe]] up to about the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Trade|title=YIVO {{!}} Trade|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholarly works have been published to rebut the [[antisemitic canard]] of Jewish domination of the slave trade in Africa and the [[Americas]] in the later centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jews and the American Slave Trade|author=Saul Friedman|pages=250–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Finkelman&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1051402 Reviewed Work: Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight by Eli Faber] by Paul Finkelman.

* "In no period did Jews play a leading role as financiers, shipowners, or factors in the transatlantic or Caribbean slave trades. They possessed far fewer slaves than non-Jews in every British territory in North America and the Caribbean. Even when Jews in a handful of places owned slaves in proportions slightly above their representation among a town's families, such cases do not come close to corroborating the assertions of The Secret Relationship." - Wim Klooster (University of Southern Maine): [http://oieahc.wm.edu/wmq/Jan00/FaberJan00.pdf Review of ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight'' by Eli Faber]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (2000).

* "Medieval Christians greatly exaggerated the supposed Jewish control over trade and finance and also became obsessed with alleged Jewish plots to enslave, convert, or sell non-Jews... Most European Jews lived in poor communities on the margins of Christian society; they continued to suffer most of the legal disabilities associated with slavery. ... Whatever Jewish refugees from Brazil may have contributed to the northwestward expansion of sugar and slaves, it is clear that Jews had no major or continuing impact on the history of New World slavery." - Professor David Brion Davis of Yale University in ''Slavery and Human Progress'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 89 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts Shofar FTP Archive File: orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts])
* "The Jews of Newport seem not to have pursued the [slave trading] business consistently ... [When] we compare the number of vessels employed in the traffic by all merchants with the number sent to the African coast by Jewish traders ... we can see that the Jewish participation was minimal. It may be safely assumed that over a period of years American Jewish businessmen were accountable for considerably less than two percent of the slave imports into the West Indies" - Professor Jacob R.

* "None of the major slave-traders was Jewish, nor did Jews constitute a large proportion in any particular community. ... probably all of the Jewish slave-traders in all of the Southern cities and towns combined did not buy and sell as many slaves as did the firm of Franklin and Armfield, the largest Negro traders in the South." - Bertram W. Korn, ''Jews and Negro Slavery in the Old South, 1789-1865'', in ''The Jewish Experience in America'', ed. Abraham J.

* "[There were] Jewish owners of plantations, but altogether they constituted only a tiny proportion of the Southerners whose habits, opinions, and status were to become decisive for the entire section, and eventually for the entire country. ... [Only one Jew] tried his hand as a plantation overseer even if only for a brief time." - Bertram W.

American mainland colonial Jews imported slaves from Africa at a rate proportionate to the general population.  As slave sellers, their role was more marginal, although their involvement in the Brazilian and Caribbean trade is believed to be considerably more significant.&lt;ref name=ColumbiaHistory&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JIBM5JEYM1gC&amp;pg=PA43 ''The Columbia History of Jews and Judaism in America'', p. 43], by Rabbi Marc Lee Raphael, (Columbia University Press, February 12, 2008); {{ISBN|978-0231132220}}. "During the 1990s, allegations that Jews financed, dominated, and controlled the slave trade captured wide attention and were widely accepted in the African American community (on the latter point, see [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]]'s "Black Demagogues and Pseudo-Scholars", ''New York Times'', July 20, 1992, p A15). Subsequent extensive research demonstrated this was not the case, see David Brion Davis, "Jews in the Slave Trade", ''Culturefront'' (Fall 1992): 42-45&lt;br&gt;* Seymour Drescher, "The Role of Jews in the Transatlantic Slave Trade", ''Immigrants and Minorities'' 12 (1993): 113-25&lt;br&gt;Eli Faber, ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight'' (New York, 1998)&lt;br&gt;Saul S. Friedman, ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'' (New Brunswick, NJ, 1998).&lt;br&gt;For numerical data demonstrating the minute role played by mainland colonial Jews in the importation of slaves from Africa and the Caribbean and their marginal role as slave sellers, see Faber, ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade'', pp 131-42"; retrieved from Google Books on January 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Jason H. Silverman, a historian of slavery, describes the part of Jews in slave trading in the southern United States as "minuscule", and writes that the historical rise and fall of slavery in the United States would not have been affected at all had there been no Jews living in the [[American South]].&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt; Jews accounted for 1.25% of all Southern slave owners, and were not significantly different from other slave owners in their treatment of slaves.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt;

==The Exodus==

The story of the [[Exodus from Egypt]], as related in the [[Torah]], has shaped the Jewish people throughout history.  Briefly outlined, the story recounts the experience of the [[Israelites]] under Egyptian enslavement, God's promise to redeem them from slavery, God's punishment of the Egyptians, and the Israelite redemption and departure from Egypt.  The Exodus story has been interpreted and reinterpreted in every era and in every location to suit or challenge cultural norms.&lt;ref&gt;Kushner, 332.&lt;/ref&gt; The result over time has been a steady increase in governance of masters in favor of slaves' rights and eventually the complete prohibition of slavery.&lt;ref name="Kushner457" /&gt;

==Biblical era==

Ancient Israelite society allowed slavery; however, total domination of one human being by another was not permitted.&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 6"&gt;Hezser, p 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potok, 457-459.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, slavery in antiquity among the Israelites was closer to what would later be called [[indentured servitude]].&lt;ref name="Kushner457"&gt;Kushner, 457.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were seen as an essential part of a Hebrew household.&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 382"&gt;Hezser, p 382&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there were cases in which, from a slave's point of view, the stability of servitude under a family in which the slave was well-treated would have been preferable to economic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Tigay, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; It is impossible for scholars to quantify the number of slaves that were owned by Hebrews in ancient Israelite society, or what percentage of households owned slaves, but it is possible to analyze social, legal, and economic impacts of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser p 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains two sets of rules governing slaves:  one set for Hebrew slaves (Lev 25:39-43) and a second set for [[Canaan]]ite slaves (Lev 25:45-46).&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 619"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 29"&gt;Hezser, p 29&lt;/ref&gt; The main source of non-Hebrew slaves were prisoners of war.&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 382"/&gt;   Hebrew slaves, in contrast to non-Hebrew slaves, became slaves either because of extreme poverty (in which case they could sell themselves to an Israelite owner) or because of inability to pay a debt.&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 6"/&gt;  According to the Hebrew Bible, non-Hebrew slaves were drawn primarily from the neighboring [[Canaan]]ite nations,&lt;ref name="Schorsch, p 63"&gt;Schorsch, p 63&lt;/ref&gt; and religious justification was provided for the enslavement of these neighbors:  the rules governing Canaanites was based on a curse aimed at [[Canaan (Biblical figure)|Canaan]], a son of [[Curse of Ham|Ham]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis p 5&lt;/ref&gt; but in later eras the Canaanite slavery laws were stretched to apply to all non-Hebrew slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch p 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws governing non-Hebrew slaves were more harsh than those governing Hebrew slaves:  non-Hebrew slaves could be owned permanently, and bequeathed to the owner's children,&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 25:45-45&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Hebrew slaves were treated as servants, and were released after six years of service or the occurrence of a jubilee year.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potok, 457&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar suggests that the distinction was due to the fact that non-Hebrew slaves were subject to the [[curse of Canaan]], whereas God did not want Jews to be slaves because he freed them from [[The Exodus|Egyptian enslavement]].&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, pp 10, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws governing Hebrew slaves were more lenient than laws governing non-Hebrew slaves, but a single Hebrew word, ''ebed'' (meaning slave or servant, cognate to the Arabic ''[[Abd (Arabic)|abd]]'') is used for both situations.  In English translations of the Bible, the distinction is sometimes emphasized by translating the word as "slave" in the context of non-Hebrew slaves, and "servant" or "bondman" for Hebrew slaves.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Most slaves owned by Israelites were non-Hebrew, and scholars are not certain what percentage of slaves were Hebrew: [[Ephraim Urbach]], a distinguished scholar of Judaism,  maintains that Israelites rarely owned Hebrew slaves after the [[Maccabean]] era, although it is certain that Israelites owned Hebrew slaves during the time of the [[Babylonian exile]].&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 6"/&gt;  Another scholar suggests that Israelites continued to own Hebrew slaves through the Middle Ages, but that the Biblical rules were ignored, and Hebrew slaves were treated the same as non-Hebrews.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The Torah forbids the return of runaway slaves who escape from their foreign land and their bondage and arrive in the Land of Israel. Furthermore, the Torah demands that such former slaves be treated equally to any other resident alien.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 23:16-17&lt;/ref&gt; This law is unique in the Ancient Near East.&lt;ref&gt;Potok, 1124-1125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Talmudic era==
In the early [[Common Era]], the regulations concerning slave-ownership by Jews underwent an extensive expansion and codification within the Talmud.&lt;ref name="Blackburn, p 68"&gt;Blackburn, p 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The precise issues that necessitated a clarification to the laws is still up for debate. The majority of current scholarly opinion holds that pressures to assimilate during the late Roman to early medieval period resulted in an attempt by Jewish communities to reinforce their own identities by drawing distinctions between their practices and the practices of non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Urbach, pp 3-4, 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milikowsky, Collected Writings in Jewish Studies&lt;/ref&gt;  One author however, has forwarded that they could include factors such as ownership of non-Canaanite slaves, the continuing practice of owning Jewish slaves or conflicts with Roman slave-ownership laws.&lt;ref name="Blackburn, p 68"/&gt; Thus, the [[Talmud]] (circa 200–500 CE) contains an extensive set of laws governing slavery, which is more detailed than found in the [[Torah]].

The major change found in the Talmud's slavery laws was that a single set of rules, with a few exceptions, governs both Jewish slaves and non-Jewish slaves.&lt;ref name="Schorsch, p 63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hezser, pp 8, 31-33, 39"&gt;Hezser, pp 8, 31-33, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Another change was that the distinction between Hebrew and non-Hebrew slaves began to diminish as the Talmud expanded during this period. This included an expanded set of obligations the owner incurred to the slave as well as codifying the process for manumission (the freeing from slavery). It also included a large set of conditions that allowed or required manumission to include requirements for education of slaves, expanding disability manumission, and in cases of religious conversion or necessity.&lt;ref name="Schorsch, p 63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hezser, pp 8, 31-33, 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"&gt;Hastings, p 620&lt;/ref&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, "Slaves and Slavery"&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;Ref&gt;Jewish Virtual Library, Slavery in Judaism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kid 24a, Git 38b, Yev 93b&lt;/ref&gt; These restrictions were based on the Biblical injunction to treat slaves well with the reinforcement of the memory of Egyptian slavery which Jews were urged to remember by their scriptural texts.&lt;ref name="Goodman2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdiKEOTphrgC|title=Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations|author=Martin Goodman|date=25 January 2007|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-190637-9|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian [[Josephus]] wrote that the seven-year automatic release was still in effect if the slavery was a punishment for a crime the slave committed (as opposed to voluntary slavery due to poverty).&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 33&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the notion of Canaanite slaves from the Jewish Bible is expanded to all non-Jewish slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, pp 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant effort is given in the Talmud to address the property rights of slaves. While the Torah only refers to a slave's specific ability to collect gleanings, Talmudic sources interpret this commandment to include the right to own property more generally, and even "purchase" a portion of their own labor from the master. Hezser notes the often confusing mosiac of Talmudic laws distinguishes between finding property during work and earning property as a result of work.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, "Ideas of Slavery from Aristotle to Augustine"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kid 11b, Kid 14b (note 13), Ar. 1:2, Shek. 1:5, Pes. 8:2, 88b, Yev. 66a, Yev. 7:1, BK 11:1, BB 51b–52a, Sanh. 91a, 105a, Ket. 28a, Meg. 16a&lt;/ref&gt; While the Talmud affirmed that self-redemption of slaves (Jewish or not) was always permitted, it noted that conditionless manumission by the owner was generally a violation of legal precept.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p 620, citing Gitten 45b&lt;/ref&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}  The Talmud however, also included a varied list of circumstances and conditions that overrode this principle and mandated manumission. Conditions such as ill-treatment, oral promise, marriage to a free-woman, escape, inclusion in religious ceremony, and desire to visit the Holy Land all required the master to provide the slave with a deed of manumission, presented to him with witnesses. Failure to comply would result in excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

It is apparent that Jews still owned Jewish slaves in the Talmudic era because Talmudic authorities tried to denounce the practice&lt;ref&gt;Lev. 25:39&lt;/ref&gt; that Jews could sell themselves into slavery if they were poverty-stricken. In particular, the Talmud said that Jews should not sell themselves to non-Jews, and if they did, the Jewish community was urged to ransom or redeem the slave.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}

While Jews did take slaves for granted just as in other ancient societies, slaves in Jewish households could expect more compassionate treatment.&lt;ref name="Goodman20072"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdiKEOTphrgC|title=Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations|author=Martin Goodman|date=25 January 2007|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-190637-9|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female slaves===
The classical rabbis instructed that masters could never marry female slaves. They would have to be [[manumitted]] first;&lt;ref&gt;''Gittin'', 40a&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, male slaves could not be allowed to marry Jewish women.&lt;ref&gt;''Gittin'' 4:5&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the biblical instruction to sell thieves into slavery (if they were caught during daylight and could not repay the theft), the rabbis ordered that female Israelites could never be sold into slavery for this reason.&lt;ref name="je"&gt;''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1901), article on ''Slaves and Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Sexual relations between a slave owner and engaged slaves is prohibited in the Torah (Lev. 19:20-22).&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 95"&gt;Abrahams, p 95&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p 61&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Torah allows sex with non-engaged slaves, by clarifying that if she is engaged when the master has sex with her, "they are not to be put to death, since she was not freed" (which implies that a woman's slave status has direct bearing on whether she can be used for sex).&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 95"/&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freeing a slave===
The [[Tanakh]] contains the rule that Jewish slaves would be released following six years of service, but that non-Jewish slaves (barring a long list of conditions including conversion, or disability) could potentially be held indefinitely. The Talmud codified and expanded the list of conditions requiring manumission to include religious necessity, conversion, escape, maltreatment, and codified slaves' property rights and rights to education.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Gittin'' 1:4, 1:6, and 40b.&lt;/ref&gt; Freeing a non-Jewish slave was seen as a religious conversion, and involved a second immersion in a ritual bath ([[mikveh]]). Jewish authorities of the Middle Ages argued against the Biblical rule that provided freedom for severely injured slaves.&lt;ref&gt;The Bible said a slave should be freed if they had been harmed to the extent that their injury was covered by the [[lex talionis]] - {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:26-27|}}, should actually apply only to slaves who had converted to Judaism; additionally, Maimonides argued that manumission was really punishment of the owner and so that it could only be imposed by a court and required evidence from witnesses. —Jewish Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of slaves===
The Torah and the Talmud contain various rules about how to treat slaves. Biblical rules for treatment of Jewish slaves were more lenient than for non-Jewish slaves&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Leviticus|25:43"&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:43|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Leviticus|25:53"&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:53|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:39|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Talmud insisted that Jewish slaves should be granted similar food, drink, lodging, and bedding, to that which their master would grant to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Furthermore, the Talmud instructed that servants were not to be unreasonably penalised for being absent from work due to sickness. The biblical seventh-year manumission was still to occur after the slave had been enslaved for six years; extra enslavement could not be tacked on to make up for the absence, unless the slave had been absent for more than a total of four years, and if the illness did not prevent light work (such as needlework), the slave could be ill for all six years without having to repay the time.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws existed that specified punishment of owners that killed slaves.&lt;ref&gt;The vague ("Avenger of Blood", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', 1901.) biblical instruction to ''avenge'' slaves that had died, from punishment by their masters, {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:20-21|}} became regarded as an instruction to view such events as murder, with masters guilty of such crime being [[beheading|beheaded]], see ''[[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta]]'', ''Mishpatim'' 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the other hand, the protection given to fugitive slaves was lessened by the classical rabbis; fugitive Israelite slaves were now compelled to buy their freedom, and if they were recaptured, then the time they had been absent was added on as extra before the usual 7th-year manumission could take effect.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish slaves were often treated as property; for example, they were not allowed to be counted towards the quorum, equal to 10 men, needed for public worship.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakot]]'' 47. [[Sadducees]] went as far as to hold slave owners responsible for any damage caused by their slaves; - ''[[Yadayim]]'' 4:7. By contrast [[Pharisees]] acknowledged that slaves had independent thought - ''Yadayim'' 4:7&lt;/ref&gt;  Maimonides and other [[Halacha|halachic]] authorities forbade or strongly discouraged any unethical treatment of slaves, Jewish or not.&lt;ref&gt;According to the traditional Jewish law, a slave is more like an indentured servant, who has rights and should be treated almost like a member of the owner's family. Maimonides wrote ([[Mishneh Torah|Yad]], [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1363819/jewish/Chapter-Nine.htm ''Avadim'' 9:8]) that, regardless whether a slave is Jewish or not, "The way of the pious and the wise is to be compassionate and to pursue justice, not to overburden or oppress a slave, and to provide them from every dish and every drink. The early sages would give their slaves from every dish on their table. They would feed their servants before sitting to their own meals.... Slaves may not be maltreated of offended&amp;nbsp;— the law destined them for service, not for humiliation. Do not shout at them or be angry with them, but hear them out". In another context, Maimonides wrote that all the laws of slavery are "mercy, compassion and forbearance" - from Encyclopedia Judaica, 2007, vol. 18, p. 670&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Tzvi|title=Torah, Slavery and the Jews|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/305549/jewish/Torah-Slavery-and-the-Jews.htm|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts indicate that Jewish slave-owners were affectionate, and would not sell slaves to a harsh master&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, p 100-101&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} and that Jewish slaves were treated as members of the slave-owner's family.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars are unsure to what extent the laws encouraging humane treatment were followed. In the 19th century, Jewish scholars such as [[Moses Mielziner]] and [[Samuel Krauss]] studied slave-ownership by ancient Jews, and generally concluded that Jewish slaves were treated as merely temporary bondsman, and that Jewish owners treated slaves with special compassion.&lt;ref name="Hezser, pp 3-5"&gt;Hezser, pp 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; However, 20th century scholars such as [[Solomon Zeitlin]] and [[Ephraim Urbach]], examined Jewish slave-ownership practices more critically, and their historical accounts generally conclude that Jews did own slaves at least through the Maccabbean period, and that it was probably more ubiquitous and humane than earlier scholars had maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, pp 5-8&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Catherine Hezser explains the differing conclusions by suggesting that the 19th century scholars were "emphasizing the humanitarian aspects and moral values of ancient Judaism, Mielziner, Grunfeld, Farbstein, and Krauss [to argue] that the Jewish tradition was not inferior to early Christian teachings on slaves and slavery."&lt;ref name="Hezser, pp 3-5"/&gt;

===Converting or circumcising non-Jewish slaves===
The Talmudic laws required Jewish slave owners to try to convert non-Jewish slaves to Judaism.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other laws required slaves, if not converted, to be circumcised and undergo ritual immersion in a bath (''[[mikveh]]'').&lt;ref name="Lewis, p 8-9"&gt;Lewis, p 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 41&lt;/ref&gt; A 4th century Roman law prevented the circumcision of non-Jewish slaves, so the practice may have declined at that time,&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; but increased again after the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 99"&gt;Abrahams, p 99&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Jewish slave owners were not permitted to drink wine that had been touched by an uncircumcised person so there was always a practical need, in addition to the legal requirement, to circumcise slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}}

Although conversion to Judaism was a possibility for slaves, rabbinic authorities Maimonides and Karo discouraged it on the basis that Jews were not permitted (in their time) to proselytise;&lt;ref name="je" /&gt; slave owners could enter into special contracts by which they agree not to convert their slaves.&lt;ref name="je" /&gt; Furthermore, to convert a slave into Judaism without the owner's permission was seen as causing harm to the owner, on the basis that it would rob the owner of the slave's ability to work during the Sabbath, and it would prevent them from selling the slave to non-Jews.&lt;ref name="je" /&gt;

===Jewish slaves and masters===
[[File:Boleslav of Bohemia and Jewish slave trader.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A Jewish slave trader being presented to [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslas of Bohemia]]]]
[[Christian]] leaders, including Pope [[Gregory the Great]] (served 590-604), objected to Jewish ownership of Christian slaves, due to concerns about conversion to Judaism and the Talmudic mandate to circumcise slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, pp 97, 99&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} The first prohibition of Jews owning Christian slaves was made by [[Constantine I]] in the 4th century. The prohibition was repeated by subsequent councils - [[Fourth Council of Orléans]] (541), Paris (633), [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] (633), the [[Synod of Szabolcs]] (1092) extended the prohibition to Hungary, [[Ghent]] (1112), [[Narbonne]] (1227), [[Béziers]] (1246). It was part of Saint Benedict's rule that Christian slaves were not to serve Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Aronius, "Regesten", No. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the prohibition, Jews participated to some extent in slave trading during the Middle Ages. The extent of Jewish participation in the medieval slave trade has been subject to ongoing discourse among the historians. [[Michael Toch]] noted that the idea of a Jewish dominance of or even monopoly over the slave trade of medieval Christian Europe, while present in some older historical works, is generally unfounded.&lt;ref name="studio2000"&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael Toch |agency= Istituto internazionale di storia economica F.

Most European Jews lived in poor communities on the margins of Christian society; they continued to suffer most of the legal disabilities associated with slavery.&lt;ref&gt;David Brion Davis. ''Slavery and Human Progress'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 89 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts Shofar FTP Archive File: orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts])&lt;/ref&gt; Jews participated in routes that had been created by Christians or Muslims but rarely created new trading routes.&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], Jews acted as slave-traders in Slavonia&lt;ref&gt;Graetz, Heinrich, ''History of the Jews'', vol iii, p 305 (Engl. translation by P. Bloch)&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} North Africa,&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Baltic States,&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, p 111&lt;/ref&gt; Central and Eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt; Spain and Portugal,&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt; and Mallorca&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, p 52&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant Jewish involvement in the slave-trade was in Spain and Portugal during the 10th to 15th centuries.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt;

Jewish participation in the slave trade was recorded as beginning in the 5th century, when [[Pope Gelasius I|Pope Gelasius]] permitted Jews to introduce slaves from [[Gaul]] into Italy, on the condition that they were non-Christian.&lt;ref name=JE_STO&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=849&amp;letter=S Slave Trade]. [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 8th century, [[Charlemagne]] (ƒ 768-814) explicitly allowed Jews to act as intermediaries in the slave trade.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 98"&gt;Abrahams, p 98&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} In the 10th century, Spanish Jews traded in [[Slavonia]]n slaves, whom the Caliphs of [[Andalusia]] purchased to form their bodyguards.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 98"/&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} In [[Bohemia]], Jews purchased these Slavonian slaves for exportation to Spain and the west of Europe.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 98"/&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} [[William the Conqueror]] brought Jewish slave-traders with him from [[Rouen]] to England in 1066.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 99"/&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} At [[Marseilles]] in the 13th century, there were two Jewish slave-traders, as opposed to seven Christians.&lt;ref&gt;"R. E. J." xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle Ages historical records from the 9th century describe two routes by which Jewish slave-dealers carried slaves from west to east and from east to west.&lt;ref name=JE_STO/&gt; According to [[Abraham ben Jacob|Abraham ibn Yakub]], [[Byzantine]] Jewish merchants bought [[Slavs]] from [[Prague]] to be sold as slaves.  Similarly, the Jews of [[Verdun]], around the year 949, purchased slaves in their neighborhood and sold them in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Aronius, "Regesten", No. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews continued to own slaves during the 16th through 18th centuries, and ownership practices were still governed by Biblical and Talmudic laws.&lt;ref name="Schorsch, p 63"/&gt; Myriad Hebrew and other sources indicate that owning slaves—particularly women of Slavic origin—was uniquely prevalent during this period among the Jewish households of the urban centres of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ben-Naeh|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halachic developments===

====Treatment of slaves====
Jewish laws governing treatment of slaves were restated in the 12th century by noted rabbi [[Maimonides]] in his book [[Mishneh Torah]], and again in the 16th century by Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] in his book [[Shulchan Aruch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p 619-620&lt;/ref&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}

The legal prohibition against Jews owning Jewish slaves was emphasized in the Middle Ages&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, p 97, who cites Shulchan Aruch, Yore Deah, 267 sec 14&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} yet Jews continued to own Jewish slaves, and owners were able to bequeath Jewish slaves to the owner's children, but Jewish slaves were treated in many ways like members of the owner's family.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, p 97&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}}

====Redeeming Jewish slaves====
The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains instructions to redeem (purchase the freedom of) Jewish slaves owned by non-Jews (Lev. 25:47-51).  Following the suppression of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|66AD rebellion in Judea]] by the Roman army, many Jews were taken to Rome as prisoners of war.&lt;ref name="je" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Annals'', 2:85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Tiberius'', 36&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Talmud contained guidance to emancipate Jewish slaves, but cautioned the redeemer against paying excessive prices since that may encourage Roman captors to enslave more Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 43&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]], himself a former 1st century slave, remarks that the faithfulness of Jewish slaves was appreciated by their owners;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews''&lt;/ref&gt; this may have been one of the main reasons for freeing them.&lt;ref name="je" /&gt;

In the Middle Ages, redeeming Jewish slaves gained importance and—up until the 19th century—Jewish congregations around the Mediterranean Sea formed societies dedicated to that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, p 96&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Jewish communities customarily ransomed Jewish captives according to a Judaic [[mitzvah]] regarding the redemption of captives ([[Pidyon Shvuyim]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/GemilutHasadim/Social_Welfare/PidyonShvuyim.htm Ransoming Captive Jews. An important commandment calls for the redemption of Jewish prisoners, but how far should this mitzvah be taken?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184438/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/GemilutHasadim/Social_Welfare/PidyonShvuyim.htm |date=2007-09-27 }} by Rabbi David Golinkin&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''A History of the Jews'', [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] wrote, "Jews were particularly valued as captives since it was believed, usually correctly, that even if they themselves poor, a Jewish community somewhere could be persuaded to ransom them.  ... In Venice, the Jewish Levantine and Portuguese congregations set up a special organization for redeeming Jewish captives taken by Christians from Turkish ships, Jewish merchants paid a special tax on all goods to support it, which acted as a form of insurance since they were likely victims."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]]: ''A History of the Jews''. 1987. p.240&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==

===Latin America and the Caribbean===
Jews participated in the [[European colonization of the Americas]], and owned slaves in Latin America and the Caribbean, most notably in [[Brazil]] and [[Suriname]], but also in [[Barbados]] and [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;"Suriname", ''The Historical Encyclopaedia of world slavery, Volume 1'', by Junius P. Rodriguez, p 622&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, p 60&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in Suriname, Jews owned many large plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, p. 622&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ethnic Jews in the New World, particularly in Brazil, were "[[New Christian]]s" or ''[[converso]]s'', some of which continued to practice Judaism, so the distinction between Jewish and non-Jewish slave owners is a difficult distinction for scholars to make. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Mediterranean slave trade===
{{further|Jewish pirates|Barbary slave trade}}
The [[Algerian Jews|Jews of Algiers]] were frequent purchasers of Christian slaves from [[Barbary corsairs]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Jewish brokers in [[Livorno]], Italy, were instrumental in arranging the ransom of Christian slaves from Algiers to their home countries and freedom. Although one slave accused [[History of the Jews in Livorno|Livorno's Jewish]] brokers of holding the ransom until the captives died, this allegation is uncorroborated, and other reports indicate Jews as being very active in assisting the release of English Christian captives.&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, an exceptionally poor year for ransoming captives, the few slaves freed were ransomed largely by Jewish factors in Algiers working with Henry Draper.&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, p. 163, No 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic slave trade===
[[Image:Triangle trade2.png|right|thumb|200px|Triangular slave trade.]]
The Atlantic slave trade transferred African slaves from Africa to colonies in the New World.  Much of the slave trade followed a [[Triangular trade|triangular route]]: slaves were transported from Africa to the Caribbean, sugar from there to North America or Europe, and manufactured goods from there to Africa.  Jews and descendants of Jews participated in the slave trade on both sides of the Atlantic, in the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal on the eastern side, and in Brazil, Caribbean, and North America on the west side.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, p 107: "A small fragment of the Jewish diaspora fled ... westward into the Americas, there becoming entwined with the African slave trade"....they could only prosper by moving into high risk and new areas of economic development.  In the expanding Western European economy after the Columbus voyages, this meant getting footholds within the new markets at the fringes of Europe, primarily in overseas enclaves.  One of these new 'products' was human beings.  It was here that Jews, or descendants of Jews, appeared on the rosters of Europe's slave trade."&lt;/ref&gt;

After Spain and Portugal [[Alhambra Decree|expelled many of their Jewish residents]] in the 1490s, many Jews from Spain and Portugal migrated to the Americas and to the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Austen, p 134"&gt;Austen, p 134&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish participation in the Atlantic slave trade increased through the 17th century because Spain and Portugal maintained a dominant role in the Atlantic trade and peaked in the early 18th century, but started to decline after the [[Peace of Utrecht]] in 1713 when Britain obtained the right to sell slaves in Spanish colonies, and Britain and France started to compete with Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher: JANCAST (p 451): "Jewish mercantile influence in the politics of the Atlantic slave trade probably reached its peak in the opening years of the eighteenth century....the political and the economic prospects of Dutch Sephardic [Jewish] capitalists rapidly faded, however, when the British emerged with the asiento [permission to sell slaves in Spanish possessions] at the Peace of Utrecht in 1713".&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the worldwide slave trade and European sugar-growing reached its peak in the 18th century, Jewish participation was dwarfed by the enterprise of British and French planters who did not allow Jews among their number.  During the 19th century, some Jews owned some cotton plantations in the southern United States.&lt;ref name="Austen, p 134" /&gt;

The role of Jewish converts to Christianity (New Christians) and of Jewish traders was momentarily significant in Brazil&lt;ref name="Drescher p 455"&gt;Drescher: JANCAST: p 455: "only in the Americas&amp;nbsp;— momentarily in Brazil, more durably in the Caribbean&amp;nbsp;— can the role of Jewish traders be described as significant." p 455.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Christian inhabitants of Brazil were envious because the Jews owned some of the best plantations in the river valley of [[Pernambuco]], and some Jews were among the leading slave traders in the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert I. Bloom. "The Christian inhabitants [of Brazil] were envious because the Jews owned some of the best plantations in the river valley of Pernambuco and were among the leading slave-holders and slave traders in the colony", p 133 of ''The Economic Activities of the Jews in Amsterdam in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries''&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Some Jews from Brazil migrated to [[Rhode Island]] in the American colonies, and played a significant but non dominant role in the 18th-century slave trade of that colony; this sector accounted for only a very tiny portion of the total human exports from Africa.&lt;ref name="Austen135"&gt;Austen, p 135: "Jews of Portuguese Brazilian origin did play a significant (but by no means dominant) role in the eighteenth-century slave trade of Rhode Island, but this sector accounted for only a very tiny portion of the total human exports from Africa."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Caribbean and Suriname====
The New World location where Jews played the largest role in the slave-trade was in the Caribbean and [[Suriname]], most notably in possessions of the Netherlands, that were serviced by the [[Dutch West India Company]].&lt;ref name="Drescher p 455"/&gt; The slave trade was one of the most important occupations of Jews living in Suriname and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;"Slave trade [sic] was one of the most important Jewish activities here [in Surinam] as elsewhere in the colonies", p 159, same book 2. ''The Economic Activities of the Jews of Amsterdam in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'' (Port Washington, New York/London: Kennikat Press, 1937), p. 159{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews of Suriname were the largest slave-holders in the region.&lt;ref name="Roth, p 292"&gt;Roth, p 292&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Austen, "the only places where Jews came close to dominating the New World plantation systems were Curaçao and Suriname."&lt;ref&gt;Austen* p 135: "but the Dutch territories were small, and their importance shortlived."&lt;/ref&gt; Slave auctions in the Dutch colonies were postponed if they fell on a Jewish holiday.&lt;ref name="Raphael, p 14"&gt;Raphael, p 14&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish merchants in the Dutch colonies acted as middlemen, buying slaves from the Dutch West India Company, and reselling them to plantation owners.&lt;ref&gt;Kritzler, p 135: ''While the [Dutch West India] Company held a monopoly on the slave trade, and made a 240 percent profit per slave, Jewish merchants, as middlemen, also had a lucrative share, buying slaves at the Company auction and selling them to planters on an installment plan&amp;nbsp;— no money down, three years to pay at an interest rate of 40-50 percent.  ... With their large profits&amp;nbsp;— slaves were marked up by 300 percent ... - they built stately homes in [[Recife]], and owned ten of the 166 sugar plantations, including "some of the best plantations in the river valley of [[Pernambuco]]"''. [Herbert Bloom quoted in the last sentence]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of buyers at slave auctions in the Brazil and the Dutch colonies were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Wiznitzer, Arnold, ''Jews in Colonial Brazil'', Columbia University Press, 1960, p 70; quoted by Schorsch at p 59: The West India Company, which monopolized imports of slaves from Africa, sold slaves at public auctions against cash payment. "It happened that cash was mostly in the hands of Jews. The buyers who appeared at the auctions were almost always Jews, and because of this lack of competitors they could buy slaves at low prices. On the other hand, there also was no competition in the selling of the slaves to the plantation owners and other buyers, and most of them purchased on credit payable at the next harvest in sugar. Profits up to 300 percent of the purchase value were often realized with high interest rates"&lt;/ref&gt; Jews allegedly played a "major role" in the slave trade in Barbados&lt;ref name="Raphael, p 14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorsh, p 60&lt;/ref&gt; and Jamaica,&lt;ref name="Raphael, p 14"/&gt; and Jewish plantation owners in Suriname helped suppress several slave revolts between 1690 to 1722.&lt;ref name="Roth, p 292"/&gt;

In Curaçao, Jews were involved in trading slaves, although at a far lesser extent compared to the Protestants of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Schorsch. ''Jews and blacks in the early modern world'', p. 61&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jews imported fewer than 1,000 slaves to Curaçao between 1686 and 1710, after which the slave trade diminished.&lt;ref name="Raphael, p 14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch p 62: In Curaçao: "Jews also participated in the local and regional trading of slaves"&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1630 and 1770, Jewish merchants settled or handled "at least 15,000 slaves" who landed in [[Curaçao]], about one-sixth of the total Dutch slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, JANCAST, p 450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cnaan|first1=Liphshiz|last2=Tzur|first2=Iris|title=How culpable were Dutch Jews in the slave trade?|url=http://www.jta.org/2013/12/26/news-opinion/world/dutch-rabbi-confronts-jews-with-ancestors-complicity-in-slavery#ixzz326RoIrWQ|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====North American colonies====

The Jewish role in the American slave trade was minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Jacob R. Marcus of Hebrew Union College in The Colonial American Jew (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1970), Vol. 2, pp. 702-703&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian and rabbi [[Bertram Korn]], there were Jewish owners of plantations, but altogether they constituted only a tiny proportion of the industry.&lt;ref name="Korn"&gt;Bertram W. Korn, "Jews and Negro Slavery in the Old South, 1789-1865", in ''The Jewish Experience in America'', ed. Abraham J. Karp (Waltham, MA: American Jewish Historical Society, 1969), Vol. 3, p. 180 &lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;:&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830 there were only four Jews among the 11,000 Southerners who owned fifty or more slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Facts vs. Antisemitic Fictions: The Truth About Jews, Blacks, Slavery, Racism and Civil Rights'' (prepared under the auspices of the Simon Wiesenthal Center by Dr. Harold Brackman and Professor Mary R. Lefkowitz; 1993)&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the shipping ports in Colonial America, only in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] did Jewish merchants play a significant part in the slave-trade.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, EAJH. Vol 1 (p 415), Newport, RI: "Newport [Rhode Island] was the leading African slaving port during the eighteenth century and the only port in which Jewish merchants played a significant part. At the peak period of their participation in slaving expeditions (the generation before the Am. Revolution), Newport's Jewish merchants handled up to 10 percent of the Rhode Island slave trade. Incomplete records for other eighteenth-century ports in which Jews participated in the slave trade in any way show that for a few years they held at least partial shares in up to 8 percent of New York's small number of slaving voyages, usually from African to Caribbean ports.&lt;/ref&gt;

A table of the commissions of brokers in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], shows that one Jewish brokerage accounted for 4% of the commissions. According to Bertram Korn, Jews accounted for 4 of the 44 slave-brokers in Charleston, three of 70 in Richmond, and 1 of 12 in Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, EAJ. Vol 1 (p 415): internal traffic within US (Korn 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; However the proportion of Jewish residents of Charleston who owned slaves was similar to that of the general white population (83% versus 87% in 1830).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Susanna Ashton | title = Slaves of Charleston | newspaper = [[The Forward]] | date = September 12, 2014 | url = http://forward.com/articles/205455/slaves-of-charleston/?p=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessing the extent of Jewish involvement in the Atlantic slave trade===

Bosworth, 1853&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information on Jacob Levin found at ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'', by Saul S. Friedman, p 157&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historian [[Seymour Drescher]] emphasized the problems of determining whether or not slave-traders were Jewish.  He concludes that [[New Christian]] merchants managed to gain control of a sizeable share of all segments of the Portuguese Atlantic slave trade during the Iberian-dominated phase of the Atlantic system. Due to forcible conversions of Jews to Christianity many New Christians continued to [[Crypto-Jews|practice Judaism in secret]], meaning it is impossible for historians to determine what portion of these slave traders were Jewish, because to do so would require the historian to choose one of several definitions of "Jewish".&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, p 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drescher: JANCAST: p 447: "New Christian merchants managed to gain control of a sizeable, perhaps major, share of all segments of the Portuguese Atlantic slave trade during the Iberian-dominated phase of the Atlantic system. I have come across no description of the Portuguese slave trade that estimates the relative shares of the various participants in the slave trade by the racial-religious designation, but New Christian families certainly oversaw the movement of a vast number of slaves from Africa to Brazil during its first-century period [1600-1700]."&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews'' (book) ====
{{Main article|The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews}}

In 1991, the [[Nation of Islam]] (NOI) published ''The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews'', which alleged that Jews had dominated the Atlantic slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, pp 131-33&lt;/ref&gt; Volume 1 of the book claims Jews played a major role in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and profited from slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jews and Money|first=Abraham|last=Foxman|pages=130–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nation of Islam and antisemitism|The book was heavily criticized for being anti-Semitic]], and for failing to provide any objective analysis of the role of Jews in the slave trade. Common criticisms included the fact that the book used selective quotes, made "crude use of statistics",&lt;ref name="Austen, p 134"/&gt; and was purposefully trying to exaggerate the role of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, pp 133-34&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) criticized the NOI and the book.&lt;ref name="adl.org"/&gt; [[Henry Louis Gates Jr]] criticized the book's intention and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;"Black Demagogues and Pseuo-Scholars", ''New York Times'', July 20, 2002, p A15.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Antisemitism}}
Historian Ralph A. Austen heavily criticized the book and said that although the book may seem fairly accurate, it is an anti-Semitic book.  However, he added that before the publication of ''The Secret Relationship'', some scholars were reluctant to discuss Jewish involvement in slavery because of fear of damaging the "shared liberal agenda" of Jews and African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, pp 131-135&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, Austen found the book's aims of challenging the myth of universal Jewish benevolence throughout history to be legitimate even though the means to that end resulted in an anti-Semitic book.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, p. 131: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[[John Hope Franklin]] and I ... were condoning a benign historical myth: that the shared liberal agenda of twentieth-century Blacks and Jews has a pedigree going back through the entire remembered past. ... Jewish students of Jewish history have known it was untrue and ... have produced a significant body of scholarship detailing the involvement of our ancestors in the Atlantic slave trade and Pan-American slavery.  [The scholarship] had never been synthesized in a publication for non-scholarly audience.  A book of this sort has now appeared, however, written not by Jews but by an anonymous group of African Americans associated with the Reverend Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later assessments====
The publication of ''The Secret Relationship'' spurred detailed research into the participation of Jews in the Atlantic slave trade, resulting in the publication of the following works, most of which were published specifically to refute the thesis of ''The Secret Relationship'':
* 1992 - Harold Brackman, ''Jew on the brain: A public refutation of the Nation of Islam's The Secret relationship between Blacks and Jews''
* 1992 - [[David Brion Davis]], "Jews in the Slave Trade", in ''Culturefront'' (Fall 1 992) pp 42–45
* 1993 - [[Seymour Drescher]], "The Role of Jews in the Atlantic Slave Trade", ''Immigrants and Minorities'', 12 (1993), pp 113–25
* 1993 - Marc Caplan, ''Jew-Hatred As History: An Analysis of the Nation of Islam's "The Secret Relationship"'' (published by the [[Anti Defamation League]])
* 1998 - Eli Faber, ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight'',  New York University Press
* 1999 - Saul S. Friedman, ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'', Transaction

Most post-1991 scholars that analysed the role of Jews only identified certain regions (such as Brazil and the Caribbean) where the participation was "significant".&lt;ref&gt;Drescher: JANCAST:  p 455: "only in the Americas&amp;nbsp;— momentarily in Brazil, more durably in the Caribbean&amp;nbsp;— can the role of Jewish traders be described as significant." .. but elsewhere involvemnent was modest or minimal p 455.&lt;/ref&gt; Wim Klooster wrote: "In no period did Jews play a leading role as financiers, shipowners, or factors in the transatlantic or Caribbean slave trades. They possessed far fewer slaves than non-Jews in every British territory in North America and the Caribbean. Even when Jews in a handful of places owned slaves in proportions slightly above their representation among a town's families, such cases do not come close to corroborating the assertions of ''The Secret Relationship''".&lt;ref name="academia.edu" /&gt;

David Brion Davis wrote that "Jews had no major or continuing impact on the history of New World slavery."&lt;ref&gt;"Medieval Christians greatly exaggerated the supposed Jewish control over trade and finance and also became obsessed with alleged Jewish plots to enslave, convert, or sell  non-Jews ... Most European Jews lived in poor communities on the margins of Christian society; they continued to suffer most of the legal disabilities associated with slavery. ... Whatever Jewish refugees from Brazil may have contributed to the northwestward expansion of sugar and slaves, it is clear that Jews had no major or continuing impact on the history of New World slavery." - Professor David Brion Davis of Yale University in ''Slavery and Human Progress'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), p 89 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts Shofar FTP Archive File: orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts])&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob R. Marcus wrote that Jewish participation in the American Colonies was "minimal" and inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;"The Jews of Newport seem not to have pursued the [slave trading] business consistently ... [When] we compare the number of vessels employed in the traffic by all merchants with the number sent to the African coast by Jewish traders ... we can see that the Jewish participation was minimal. It may be safely assumed that over a period of years American Jewish businessmen were accountable for considerably less than two percent of the slave imports into the West Indies" - Professor Jacob R. Marcus of Hebrew Union College in ''The Colonial American Jew'' (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1970), Vol. 2, pp. 702-03 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts Shofar FTP Archive File: orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertram Korn]] wrote "all of the Jewish slavetraders in all of the Southern cities and towns combined did not buy and sell as many slaves as did the firm of [[Franklin and Armfield Office|Franklin and Armfield]], the largest Negro traders in the South."&lt;ref&gt;"None of the major slavetraders was Jewish, nor did Jews constitute a large proportion in any particular community. ... probably all of the Jewish slavetraders in all of the Southern cities and towns combined did not buy and sell as many slaves as did the firm of Franklin and Armfield, the largest Negro traders in the South." - Bertram W. Korn. ''Jews and Negro Slavery in the Old South, 1789–1865'', in ''The Jewish Experience in America'', ed. Abraham J. Karp (Waltham, Massachusetts: American Jewish Historical Society, 1969), Vol 3, pp 197-98 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts] Shofar FTP Archive File at [http://orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a review in ''[[The Journal of American History]]'' of both ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight''  and ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'': "Faber acknowledges the few merchants of Jewish background locally prominent in slaving during the second half of the eighteenth century but otherwise confirms the small-to-minuscule size of colonial Jewish communities of any sort and shows them engaged in slaving and slave holding only to degrees indistinguishable from those of their English competitors."&lt;ref&gt;"Eli Faber takes a quantitative approach to Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade in Britain's Atlantic empire, starting with the arrival of Sephardic Jews in the London resettlement of the 1650s, calculating their participation in the trading companies of the late seventeenth century, and then using a solid range of standard quantitative sources (Naval Office shipping lists, censuses, tax records, and so on) to assess the prominence in slaving and slave owning of merchants and planters identifiable as Jewish in Barbados, Jamaica, New York, Newport, Philadelphia, Charleston, and all other smaller English colonial ports. He follows this strategy in the Caribbean through the 1820s; his North American coverage effectively terminates in 1775.

According to [[Seymour Drescher]], Jews participated in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], particularly in [[Brazil]] and [[Suriname]],&lt;ref&gt;Drescher: JANCAST:  p 455:&lt;/ref&gt; however in no period did Jews play a leading role as financiers, shipowners, or factors in the transatlantic or Caribbean slave trades.&lt;ref name="academia.edu" /&gt; He said that Jews rarely established new slave-trading routes, but rather worked in conjunction with a Christian partner, on trade routes that had been established by Christians and endorsed by Christian leaders of nations.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, EAJH&amp;nbsp;— Vol  1. "The available evidence indicates that the Jewish network probably counted for little in Atlantic slaving. The few cases of long-term Jewish participation in the eighteenth-century slave trades offer evidence of cross-religious networks as keys to their success. In case after case, Jews who participated in multiple slaving voyages ... linked themselves to Christian agents or partners. It was not as Jews, but as merchants, that traders ventured into one of the great enterprises of the early modern world." Drescher, in Ency Am. J. Hist. p 416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, pp 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) issued a statement, together with Drescher, condemning "any statement alleging that Jews played a disproportionate role in the Atlantic slave trade".&lt;ref name="ajh"&gt;Encyclopedia of American Jewish history, Volume 1, p 199&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish slave ownership in the southern United States===
Slavery historian Jason H. Silverman describes the part of Jews in slave trading in the southern United states as "minuscule", and wrote that the historical rise and fall of slavery in the United States would not have been affected at all had there been no Jews living in the south.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt; Jews accounted for only 1.25% of all Southern slave owners.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt;

[[Image:Aaron Lopez.png|right|thumb|120px|Aaron Lopez]]
Jewish slave ownership practices in the southern United States were governed by regional practices, rather than Judaic law.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"&gt;Rodriguez, p 385&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg, p 110"&gt;Greenberg, p 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reiss, p 88"&gt;Reiss, p 88&lt;/ref&gt; Many southern Jews held the view that blacks were subhuman and were suited to slavery, which was the predominant view held by many of their non-Jewish southern neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, p 84&lt;/ref&gt; Jews conformed to the prevailing patterns of slave ownership in the South, and were not significantly different from other slave owners in their treatment of slaves.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt; Wealthy Jewish families in the American South generally preferred employing white servants rather than owning slaves.&lt;ref name="Reiss, p 88"/&gt; Jewish slave owners included [[Aaron Lopez]], [[Francis Salvador]], [[Judah Touro]], and [[Haym Salomon]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''Jews and the American Slave Trade;; pp xiii, 123-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish slave owners were found mostly in business or domestic settings, rather than on plantations, so most of the slave ownership was in an urban context&amp;nbsp;— running a business or as domestic servants.&lt;ref name="Greenberg, p 110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reiss, p 88"/&gt; Jewish slave owners freed their black slaves at about the same rate as non-Jewish slave owners.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt; Jewish slave owners sometimes bequeathed slaves to their children in their wills.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt;

A significant number of Jews gave their energies to the antislavery movement.&lt;ref name="whiteman"&gt;Maxwell Whiteman, "Jews in the Antislavery Movement", Introduction to The Kidnapped and the Ransomed: The Narrative of Peter and Vina Still (Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1970), pp 28, 42&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many 19th century Jews, such as [[Adolphe Crémieux]], participated in the moral outcry against slavery. In 1849, Crémieux announced the abolition of slavery throughout the French possessions.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;

In England there were Jewish members of the abolition groups. [[Granville Sharp]] and [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]], in his "A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade," employed Jewish teachings as arguments against slavery. Rabbi G. Gottheil of Manchester, and Dr. L. Philippson of Bonn and Magdeburg, forcibly combated the view announced by Southern sympathizers, that Judaism supports slavery. Rabbi M.

In the [[American Civil War|civil-war era]], prominent Jewish religious leaders in the United States engaged in public debates about slavery.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|title=This Land of Liberty: A History of America's Jews|first=Helene Schwartz|last=Kenvin|publisher=Behrman House, Inc|year=1986|isbn=0-87441-421-0|pages=90–92}}*Benjamin, Judah P.

[[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]] rabbis, including Einhorn and [[Michael Heilprin]], concerned that Raphall's position would be seen as the official policy of American Judaism, vigorously rebutted his arguments, and argued that slavery&amp;nbsp;– as practiced in the South&amp;nbsp;– was immoral and not endorsed by Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strangers &amp; neighbors: relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States|first=Maurianne|last=Adams|pages=190–94|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1999|isbn=1-55849-236-4}}. Adams writes that Raphall's position was "accepted by many as the Jewish position on the slavery question. ... Raphall was a prominent Orthodox rabbi and so the sermon was used in the South to prove the Biblical sanction of slavery and the American Jews' sympathy with the secession movement."&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Yellis, writing in ''[[The Forward]]'', has suggested that "the majority of American Jews were mute on the subject, perhaps because they dreaded its tremendous corrosive power.  Prior to 1861, there are virtually no instances of rabbinical sermons on slavery, probably due to fear that the controversy would trigger a sectional conflict in which Jewish families would be arrayed on opposite sides.  ... America’s largest Jewish community, New York’s Jews were overwhelmingly pro-southern, pro-slavery, and anti-Lincoln in the early years of the war." However, as the war progressed, "and the North’s military victories mounted, feelings began to shift toward[s] ... the Union and eventually, emancipation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yellis|first1=Ken|title=Jews Mostly Supported Slavery&amp;nbsp;— Or Kept Silent&amp;nbsp;— During Civil War|url=http://forward.com/articles/179441/jews-mostly-supported-slavery-or-kept-silent-d/?p=all#ixzz326OPEy5Q|publisher=The Forward Association|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary affairs, Jews and African-Americans have cooperated in the Civil Rights movement, motivated partially by the common background of slavery, particularly the story of the Jewish enslavement in Egypt, as told in the Biblical story of the [[Book of Exodus]], which many blacks identified with.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, pp 3, 268&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seymour Siegel]] suggests that the historic struggle against prejudice faced by Jews led to a natural sympathy for any people confronting discrimination. Joachim Prinz, president of the [[American Jewish Congress]], spoke from the podium at the Lincoln Memorial during the famous [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in 1963 where he emphasized how Jews identify deeply with African American disenfranchisement "born of our own painful historic experience," including slavery and [[ghettoization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joachimprinz.com/civilrights.htm Joachim Prinz March on Washington Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/mowprog.htm Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement - March on Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, according to the [[Orthodox Union]],  ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', and the ''[[Jewish Quarterly]]'', slavery (as defined as the total subjugation of one human being over another) is absolutely unacceptable in Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is little doubt that in terms of the Torah’s value system the exercise of power by one person over another, without their consent, is a fundamental assault against human dignity. ... So slavery is to be abolished. ... [God] wanted slavery abolished but he wanted it to be done by free human beings coming to see of their own accord the evil it is and the evil it does. The God of history, who taught us to study history, had faith that eventually we would learn the lesson of history: that freedom is indivisible. We must grant freedom to others if we truly seek it for ourselves."&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Jonathan Sacks|Sacks, Jonathan]].

Accessed 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"History has judged [American Civil War-era Rabbi Morris Jacob] Raphall's defense of slavery poorly.  No Orthodox rabbi today would defend his view."

Human power and dominion, on the other hand, is always relative, so there is no justification for slavery; no human has the right to enslave another for none has absolute authority."&lt;/blockquote&gt; [http://www.jewishquarterly.org/issuearchive/article0eff.html?articleid=368 "Tikkun Olam."] ''[[The Jewish Quarterly]]''.

The '''Kronos Quartet''' is an American [[string quartet]] based in San Francisco. They have been in existence with a rotating membership of musicians for over forty years. The quartet covers a very broad range of musical genres, including [[contemporary classical music]]. More than 900 works have been [[commission (art)|written for them]].

==History==
The quartet was founded by [[violin]]ist David Harrington in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Its first performance was in November 1973.&lt;ref name=Graves/&gt; Since 1978, the quartet has been based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].  The longest-running combination of performers (from 1978 to 1999) had Harrington and John Sherba on [[violin]], Hank Dutt on [[viola]], and [[Joan Jeanrenaud]] on [[cello]].  In 1999, Joan Jeanrenaud left Kronos because she was "eager for something new";&lt;ref name=Templeton/&gt; she was replaced by Jennifer Culp&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; who, in turn, left in 2005 and was replaced by Jeffrey Zeigler. In June 2013, Zeigler was replaced by Sunny Yang.&lt;ref name=press1/&gt; With over forty studio albums to their credit and having performed worldwide, they were called "probably the most famous '[[Contemporary classical music|new music]]' group in the world"&lt;ref name=McCalla/&gt; and were praised in philosophical studies of music for the inclusiveness of their repertoire.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;

By the time the quartet celebrated their twenty-fifth anniversary in 1999, they had a repertoire of over 600 works, which included 400 string quartets written for them, more than 3,000 performances, seven first-prize [[ASCAP]] awards, [[Edison Award]]s in classical and popular music, and had sold more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;million records.&lt;ref name=Derk/&gt;

===30th anniversary===
When Kronos turned 30, in 2003, they decided on a commissioning process for composers under the age of 30, in the hope of bringing some of the talented young composers to light. The program, called the Under 30 Project, is now run in cooperation with [[Carnegie Hall]], Cal Performances at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and the [[Montalvo Arts Center]]. The first recipient was [[Alexandra du Bois]] (at the time a student at [[Indiana University]], later a [[Juilliard School]] graduate),&lt;ref name=Cahill/&gt; followed by Felipe Perez Santiago (born in Mexico in 1973),&lt;ref name=Sisario/&gt; and Dan Visconti (born in Illinois in 1982);&lt;ref name=Martini/&gt; in 2007, Israeli composer Aviya Kopelman became the fourth.&lt;ref name=MusicalA/&gt;

===40th anniversary===
To celebrate the fortieth year of the organization, the Kronos Quartet decided to return to Seattle, the city in which they first played, and work in collaboration with Seattle's [[Degenerate Art Ensemble]] to create a piece incorporating music, dance and video.&lt;ref name=Graves/&gt; They celebrated their 40th anniversary with a sold-out performance at [[Zellerbach Hall]], [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], in December 2013. The same year, [[Michael Giacchino]], a soundtrack composer who often names his pieces with puns, published a piece named after them as a part of the soundtrack to ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (the name of the piece is "The Kronos Wartet"), for a scene that takes place on the fictional planet "Kronos"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/Playback/2013/05/wecreatemusic/fmf-michael-giacchino-on-star-trek-into-darkness.aspx|title=Film Music Friday: Michael Giacchino on Star Trek: Into Darkness|publisher=|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also spelled "[[Qo'noS]]").

{{quote box|quote=I've always wanted the string quartet to be vital, and energetic, and alive, and cool, and not afraid to kick ass and be absolutely beautiful and ugly if it has to be.

'''Lover's Leap''', or (in plural) '''Lovers' Leap''', is a [[toponym]] given to a number of locations of varying height, usually isolated, with the risk of a fatal fall and the possibility of a deliberate jump. [[Legend]]s of romantic tragedy are often associated with a Lovers' Leap.

==Legends==

===United States===
The Lovers' Leap at [[Hawks Nest State Park]] in the town of [[Ansted, West Virginia]], along the historic [[Midland Trail]], has a drop of {{convert|585|ft}} from a high [[cliff]] overlooking the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River Gorge]]. The promontory was named "Lovers' Leap" by settlers,&lt;ref&gt;''Shawnee Captive: The Story of Mary Draper Ingles (Women of the Frontier)'', page 83, Mary R. Furbee, Morgan Reynolds Publishing (July 2001), {{ISBN|1-883846-69-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has acquired a [[legend]] involving two young [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] from different tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wonderfulwv.com/sub.cfm?month=sept06&amp;fea=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915071732/http://www.wonderfulwv.com/sub.cfm?month=sept06&amp;fea=2 |archivedate=2008-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blowing Rock (land feature)|Blowing Rock Mountain]], outside [[Blowing Rock, North Carolina]], has a similar legend of a young lover leaping from the cliff and instead of plunging to his death, is saved. In this version the lover is saved by the blowing wind which sends him back into the arms of his sweetheart.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.townofblowingrock.com/history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wills Mountain]] has a Lovers' Leap overlooking [[Cumberland Narrows]] on the west side of [[Cumberland, Maryland]]. It is {{convert|1652|ft|m}} above sea level and made up of oddly squared projections of rock from its top all the way down to the [[National Road]] (U.S. Route 40) below. The city of Cumberland and the surrounding states of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[West Virginia]] may be seen from this point.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[Mark Twain]] in ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'' writes: "There are fifty Lover's Leaps along the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] from whose summit disappointed Indian girls have jumped."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Twain, ''Life on the Mississippi'', Penguin Books, New York, 1961 p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qufriary.org/Hoebing/lleap.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328134857/http://www.qufriary.org/Hoebing/lleap.html |archivedate=2009-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winona (legend)|Princess Winona]] is one such legend, in which the daughter of a [[Dakota people|Dakota]] chief leaps to her death rather than marry a suitor she does not love.&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;{{Cite web

[[Dovedale]] in the [[Peak District]] in the [[United Kingdom]] has a limestone promontory named Lovers' Leap reached by a set of steps built by Italian [[prisoners of war]] captured in [[World War II]]. The local legend is that a young woman believed her lover had been killed in the [[Napoleonic wars]], so she threw herself off the top of the promontory. Later, her family found out that her lover was alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The south coast of [[Jamaica]] at [[Saint Elizabeth Parish]] has a Lovers' Leap {{convert|1700|ft|m}} above the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Lovers' Leap is named after two slave lovers from the 18th century, Mizzy and Tunkey. According to legend, their master, Chardley, liked Mizzy; so, in a bid to have her for himself, he arranged for her lover, Tunkey, to be sold to another estate. Mizzy and Tunkey fled to avoid being separated but were eventually chased to the edge of a large steep cliff. Rather than face being caught and separated, the lovers embraced and jumped over the cliff.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Atrium/5460/Introduction/About_Lover_s_Leap/about_lover_s_leap.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:58:25&lt;/ref&gt; The story was used as the basis for a romantic novel.&lt;ref&gt;''Lover's Leap: Based on the Jamaican Legend'', Horane Smith, Minerva Press (June 1, 1999), {{ISBN|0-7541-0589-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Living Treasures Award''', alternatively known as the '''Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan''' (GAMABA; {{literal translation|Award for the Creators of the Country}}) is conferred to a person or group of artists recognized by the [[Government of the Philippines]] for their contributions to the country's [[intangible cultural heritage]]. A recipient of the award, known as a National Living Treasures or ''Manlilikha ng Bayan''  is defined as "a Filipino citizen or group of Filipino citizens engaged in any traditional art uniquely Filipino, whose distinctive skills have reached such a high level of technical and artistic excellence and have been passed on to and widely practiced by the present generations in their community with the same degree of technical and artistic competence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ph/2003/09/19/executive-order-no-236/ Executive Order No. 236, s. 2003] Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines. Retrieved 14 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The National Living Treasures Award (''Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan'') was institutionalized in 1992 through Republic Act No. 7355. The [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]], which is the highest policy-making and coordinating body of the [[Philippines]] for culture and the arts, was tasked with the implementation.&lt;ref name="ncca" /&gt; This is in line with UNESCO's criteria of [[Living Human Treasure|Living National Treasure]]s.

== Criteria ==
To become a National Living Treasure, the candidate must possess the following qualifications:&lt;ref name="ncca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/briefer-gawad-sa-manlilikha-ng-bayan/|title=Briefer: Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan|work=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#is an inhabitant of an indigenous/traditional cultural community anywhere in the Philippines that has preserved indigenous customs, beliefs, rituals and traditions and/or has syncretized whatever external elements that have influenced it.
#must have engaged in a folk art tradition that has been in existence and documented for at least 50 years.
#must have consistently performed or produced over a significant period, works of superior and distinctive quality.
#must possess a mastery of tools and materials needed by the art, and must have an established reputation in the art as master and maker of works of extraordinary technical quality.
#must have passed on and/or will pass on to other members of the community their skills in the folk art for which the community is traditionally known.

A traditional artist who possesses all the qualities of a ''Manlilikha ng Bayan'' candidate, but due to age or infirmity has left them incapable of teaching further their craft, may still be recognized if:&lt;ref name="ncca" /&gt;

#had created a significant body of works and/or has consistently displayed excellence in the practice of their art, thus achieving important contributions for its development.
#has been instrumental in the revitalization of their community's artistic tradition.
#has passed on to the other members of the community skills in the folk art for which the community is traditionally known.
#community has recognized them as master and teacher of their craft.

== Categories ==

The categories are, but not limited to, the following categories of traditional folk arts:&lt;ref name="ncca" /&gt;

* folk architecture
* maritime transport
* weaving
* carving
* performing arts
* literature
* graphic and plastic arts
* ornament
* textile or fiber art
* pottery

Other artistic expressions of traditional culture may be added.

== Recipients and nominees ==
As defined by [[UNESCO]], the bearers of intangible cultural heritage are to be known internationally as [[Living Human Treasure]]s. The Filipino counterparts of this title are the [[Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan]] (GAMABA) awardees. There are currently sixteen declared GAMABA awardees, all of which have exemplified the highest standard in their respective field of expertise. The award is only given to individuals or groups that have exhibited the highest possible standard in intangible cultural heritage. A master of the heritage does not automatically qualify an individual or group for the award as the craft of the master should exude a higher meaning to the highest standard set by the highly critical council of the GAMABA board. Due to this lengthy and critical process, only sixteen of the thousands of traditional masters have been conferred with the award.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3263">'''The period eye''' is a concept that was devised by [[Michael Baxandall]] and described in his innovative ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth-Century Italy: A Primer in the Social History of Pictorial Style'' where he used it to describe the cultural conditions under which art in the [[Renaissance]] was created, viewed, and understood.

==The concept==
Baxandall argued that everyone processes visual information in the brain in a different way, using a combination of innate skills and skills based on experience, which are often culturally determined. He suggested that cultural factors influence the visual characteristics that are attractive at any particular time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dartfac/features/0102/art.html "In the Eyes of the Beholder" by Tamara Steinert] Dartmouth Faculty Scholarship Today - Features, 2003. Retrieved 23 November 2011.[https://www.webcitation.org/63Q7gHwSO Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; The period eye examines how artists and their works functioned in their original social, commercial and religious context and has been called an "''...anthropological analysis of a society’s visual culture''." &lt;ref&gt;Langdale, A.

'''Public Netbase''' was a cultural media initiative, open access internet platform, and advocate for the development of electronic art. The project increasingly came into conflict with the Austrian political establishment{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} during the 1990s. It received awards and recognition by [[UNESCO]].

==Early development==
Public Netbase was founded by [[Konrad Becker]] and Francisco de Sousa Webber in Vienna's Messepalast (later renamed to [[Museumsquartier]]) in 1994 as a non-profit internet provider and a platform for the participatory use and critical analyses of information and communication technology. Its parent organization was the ''Institute for New Culture Technologies-t0'', founded in 1993.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web | title=About Public Netbase / t0 |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/about |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the Institute's activities after 1994 occurred through Public Netbase, leading to the names and establishment dates being loosely applied, even in the organization's official material. The name of its [[World Wide Web]] server, ''t0'', was often appended to either name as well. During the first years of its existence, Public Netbase shared a space in [[Museumsquartier]] with the initiative ''Depot – Kunst und Diskussion''.&lt;ref&gt;http://depot.or.at/index.php?article_id=1&amp;clang=1. Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; After it relocated to own rooms (also in [[Museumsquartier]]), the number of wokshops and instruction courses increased and the program of discursive events was now realized on an almost daily basis.

==Art and culture==
[[Image:Netbase 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2]]
Public Netbase focused on aiding the development of electronic art and the impact of the nascent World Wide Web on culture.  Its own online presence earned it an award for distinction at the [[Prix Ars Electronica]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Prix"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prix Ars Electronica 1995 World Wide Web Distinction |url=http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2528# |accessdate=2006-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129084500/http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2528 |archivedate=November 29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the web space provided through Public Netbase supported Austrian artists, although some hosted projects, such as the [[Transformation Story Archive]], had wider recognition.  The physical location in the Museumsquartier was also used for sponsored events, ranging from art symposia to a conference of the [[Association of Autonomous Astronauts]]&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Association of Autonomous Astronauts' Intergalactic Conference in Vienna, Earth, June 21-22 1997 |date=1997-06-06 |url=http://www.rhizome.org/thread.rhiz?thread=1274&amp;page=1#660 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a "lecture/performance/event" by [[Critical Art Ensemble]] about biotechnology &lt;ref name="CAE"&gt;{{cite press release |title=FLESH MACHINE: A Genexploitation Project |date=1997-11-17 |url=http://www.rhizome.org/thread.rhiz?thread=1475&amp;page=1#940 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of conferences/exhibitions such as ROBOTRONIKA&lt;ref&gt;http://robot.t0.or.at/ Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; (1998) and SYNWORLD&lt;ref name="synworld.t0.or.at"&gt;http://synworld.t0.or.at/. Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; (1999).

==Involvement in politics==
When the right-wing [[Austrian Freedom Party]] (FPÖ) and its leader [[Jörg Haider]] began to rise in power in Austria, Public Netbase took an increasingly political activist role while facing increasing government pressure.  Haider accused Public Netbase of sponsoring child pornography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.medialounge.net/lounge/workspace/crashhtml/cc/29.htm| publisher=Crash Media| title=Sex slaves to public opinion - Public Netbase kicks back...| first=Micz| last= Flor| date=1998-11-27| accessdate=2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conflated Christina Göstl's hosted erotic art with a commercial porn site run from the British Virgin Islands during a speech in parliament.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/08/06feature.html | publisher=Salon | title=Is it Sex or is it Art? | first=Janelle | last=Brown | date=1998-09-06 | accessdate=2006-10-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901125303/http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/08/06feature.html | archivedate=2006-09-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Public Netbase sponsored a "virtual alternative to Austria's far right government" that offered Austrian Web Resistance Awards to web sites dedicated to opposing Haider's government.&lt;ref name="GAA"&gt;{{cite web |title=About government-austria.at |url=http://government-austria.at/index.php3?lang=&amp;menuid=about |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute for Applied Autonomy]], recipient of an award for distinction in interactive art at the Prix Ars Electronica 2000,&lt;ref name="PAE2000"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prix Ars Electronica 2000 Interactive Art Distinction |url=http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2175 |accessdate=2006-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050325043635/http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2175 |archivedate=March 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated their award to Public Netbase for its political efforts.&lt;ref name="PAE2002-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Netbase t0 ist überraschender Preisträger des Prix Ars Electronica 2000 |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/about/press/20000905 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another t0-project begun during this period, World-information.org, described as "an ongoing effort to critically observe and investigate new technologies in a societal, economic and artistic context"&lt;ref name="WIO"&gt;{{cite web | title=World-information.org |publisher=Public Netbase |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/projects/wio |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to involvement with the UNESCO ''Digi-Arts'' program&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |title=World-information.org |publisher=UNESCO |date=2004-10-11 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23603&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of conventions across Europe.

However, the organization's successes were insufficient to stave off problems.  Its lease at the Museumsquartier was not renewed after the controversial remodelling period in 2000,&lt;ref name="CI"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wassermair |first=M. |title='In Austria, the Clock Ticks with a Different Beat': Short Story of Public Netbase t0, its International Success and Recent Political Struggles |journal=Cultivate Interactive |issue=2 |date=2000-10-16 |issn=1471-3225 |url=http://www.cultivate-int.org/issue2/netbase/ |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it faced a series of audits and other bureaucratic obstacles.  Financial difficulties and an inability to secure a permanent replacement location could not be resolved.&lt;ref name="Support"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Open letter to Michael Häupl, Mayor of Vienna, and the Vienna City Government |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/about/press/20040506 |date=2004-05-06 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite significant community support and a reorganization effort in 2005 that shortened its name to Netbase, the City of Vienna stopped all funding effective January 11, 2006, leading to the immediate shut down of the organization.

The ''Institute for New Culture Technologies-t0'' is still active: Its projects are now mainly conducted through World-Information.Org and World-Information Institute.&lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.net/en/.

Can the Internet be reclaimed as a 'digital commons' or has the current crisis already reached a meta media level, beyond propaganda and its mirror counter-campaigns?"

*nikeground (2003)
This communication guerilla project, which was developed and conducted in co-operation with 0100101110101101.ORG, criticized the accelerating commercialization of public space. Faked announcements informed that [[Karlsplatz]], one of Vienna's historical squares, was going to be renamed to "Nikeplatz" and that as part of this process a 36 meter high monument in form of the Nike-logo would be erected. A two-story glass pavilion located on the square informed about the alleged plans and served as a highly visible sign in public space. The project led to discussions in the arts and cultural scene. At the same time it was sufficiently plausible and spectacular to trigger various forms of citizens' protests and a broad media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.t0.or.at/nikeground.

'''Rebecca Sugar''' (born July 9, 1987), is an American animator, director, screenwriter, producer, and songwriter. She is known for creating the [[Cartoon Network]] series ''[[Steven Universe]]'', which has made her the first woman to independently create a series for the network.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mfl45edfge/rebecca-sugar/|title=Rebecca Sugar – 30 Under 30: Hollywood|date=December 17, 2012|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar was formerly a writer and storyboard artist on the animated television series ''[[Adventure Time]]'' until 2013. Her work on the two series has earned her five [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.emmys.com/bios/rebecca-sugar&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sugar was raised in the Sligo Park Hills area of [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]. She simultaneously attended [[Montgomery Blair High School]] and the Visual Arts Center at [[Albert Einstein High School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Steven Universe' creator Rebecca Sugar is a Cartoon Network trailblazer |work= The Washington Post |first= Michael |last= Cavna |date= November 1, 2013 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-is-an-idealistic-trailblazer/2013/11/01/fe622da2-4338-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; (where she was an arts semifinalist in the Presidential Scholar competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/press/printPress.aspx?id=1647 | title=Two Students are Named Presidential Scholars | website= montgomeryschoolsmd.org | date=May 10, 2005 | accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and won Montgomery County's prestigious Ida F.

While at Blair, she drew several comics (called "The Strip" for the school's newspaper, ''Silver Chips'') which won first place for comics in the Newspaper Individual Writing and Editing Contest. "The Strip" ran a comic challenging MCPS's new grading policy from 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://silverchips.mbhs.edu/story/5887|accessdate=October 19, 2017|publisher=Silver Chips Online|title=Silver Chips, Silver Chips Online, Silver Quill win in journalism competitions| author=Goldstein, Jordan|author2=Sekaran, Adith|date=November 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to attend the [[School of Visual Arts]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amidi|first1=Amid|title=Rebecca Sugar Is Cartoon Network’s First Solo Woman Show Creator|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/rebecca-sugar-is-cartoon-networks-first-solo-woman-show-creator-71157.html|publisher= CartoonBrew|accessdate=June 11, 2014|date=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

=== Early work ===
During her time at the [[School of Visual Arts]], Sugar directed short animated films, including ''Johnny Noodleneck'' (2008).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hornet.com/stories/rebecca-sugar-before-steven-universe/|title=The Weird, Heartbreaking Pre-'Steven Universe' Work of Rebecca Sugar|date=2016-02-20|work=Hornet Stories|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she wrote and animated ''Singles'', in which frequent collaborator [[Ian Jones-Quartey]] acted as an assistant animator, assistant inker and voice actor on the project, while Sugar's brother Steven Sugar acted as an assistant colorist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sugar completed this film as her thesis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sugar also played an important role in the creation of ''nockFORCE'', a cartoon series created by [[Ian Jones-Quartey]] and Jim Gisriel and launched in 2007 on [[YouTube|Youtube.]] In particular, she contributed to the cartoon's backgrounds and characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ianjq/status/636312476930314244|title=ianjq on Twitter: "actually Rebecca helped a number of things in nockFORCE..."|last=|first=|date=|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Sugar published her first graphic novel, ''Pug Davis'', featuring an astronaut dog and his gay sidekick Blouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/adventure_time/2010/12/09/rebecca-sugars-pug-davis/|title=Frederator Studios Blogs {{!}} The Adventure Time Blog {{!}} Rebecca Sugar’s “Pug Davis”|website=archives.frederatorblogs.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12673887-pug-davis|title=Pug Davis|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also known for her comic "Don't Cry for Me, I'm Already Dead", a story about two brothers whose shared love of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' takes a tragic turn.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Television ===
Sugar first joined the crew of ''[[Adventure Time]]'' as a [[storyboard]] revisionist during the show's [[Adventure Time (season 1)|first season]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Pendleton (2011). "Rainy Day Daydream" [Animatic commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season One [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon Network]].&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the quality of her work, within a month of being hired she was promoted to a storyboard artist, making her debut during the production of the [[Adventure Time (season 2)|second season]].&lt;ref name="jsmicah" /&gt; Her first episode was "[[It Came from the Nightosphere]]".&lt;ref name="firstboard"&gt;{{cite web|last=Seibert|first=Fred|title=Rebecca Sugar’s First Board (Nightosphere)|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/adventure_time/2010/10/11/rebecca-sugars-first-board-nightosphere/|publisher=[[Frederator Studios]]|accessdate=January 19, 2013|date=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production for ''[[Steven Universe]]'' began while Sugar was still working on ''[[Adventure Time]]''. She continued working on ''[[Adventure Time]]'' until the show's [[Adventure Time (season 5)|fifth season]], whereupon she left in order to focus on ''[[Steven Universe]]''. Her last episode for ''[[Adventure Time]]'' was "[[Simon &amp; Marcy]]"; following that episode, working on both series simultaneously "became impossible to do". She had also previously encountered difficulty in the production of the ''[[Adventure Time]]'' episode "[[Bad Little Boy]]".&lt;ref name="Kohn 2013-11-01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/adventure-time-writer-rebecca-sugar-on-steven-universe|title=''Adventure Time'' Writer Rebecca Sugar on ''Steven Universe'', Being Cartoon Network's First Female Show Creator And Why Pop Art Is 'Offensive'|publisher=[[Indiewire]]|date=2013-11-01|accessdate=2013-11-25|last=Kohn|first=Eric|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar returned temporarily to write the song "Everything Stays" for the [[Adventure Time (season 7)|seventh season]] miniseries "[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]".&lt;ref name=stakesairdate&gt;{{cite web|title=[Olivia Olson confirms when 'Stakes' will air]|url=https://instagram.com/p/4-ChaHhw-D/?taken-by=oliviaroseolson|publisher=[[Instagram]]|date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future projects ===
A teaser for a ''[[Steven Universe]]'' television movie, called ''Steven Universe: The Movie'', was released during [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in the summer of 2018. A release date for the film has yet to be announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://collider.com/steven-universe-movie-trailer/#ok-ko-crossover-special|title='Steven Universe: The Movie' Trailer Announces Cartoon Network's Feature-Length Special|date=2018-07-21|work=Collider|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Themes ===
Sugar has discussed the importance of creating [[LGBT]] representation and content, especially in children's entertainment. On [[Cameron Esposito]]'s podcast QUEERY, Sugar stated "I want to champion [[LGBT|LGBTQIA]], all of it, content...in G-Rated, family entertainment. I want to do that forever".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/rebecca-sugar/|title=Rebecca Sugar, episode #13 of Queery with Cameron Esposito on Earwolf|website=www.earwolf.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also explained that the show has helped her come to terms with her own identity as a [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] woman. She believes that early and positive exposure to the [[LGBT community]] can help [[queer]] identifying children avoid experiencing shame in their own identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-rebecca-sugar-steven-universe-20180524-story.html|title=Rebecca Sugar’s commitment to LGBTQ visibility continues to drive 'Steven Universe' - Los Angeles Times|last=Brown|first=Tracy|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/13/steven-universe-rebecca-sugar-lgbtq-cartoons/|title='Steven Universe' creator is doing more for LGBTQ visibility than you might know|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Regatta at Sainte-Adresse''''' is an oil-on-canvas painting by the [[impressionism|impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]]. It was painted in 1867 and is owned by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

This painting and ''The Beach in Sainte-Adresse'' ([[Art Institute of Chicago]]) were probably conceived as a pair. They are identical in size, and their viewing point differs by only a few yards.
==Description==
[[Sainte-Adresse]], the well-to-do suburb of [[Le Havre]], was the home of Monet's father. Destitute, Monet spent the summer of 1867 with his father and aunt Sophie Lecadre at the cost of abandoning his companion, Camille Doncieux, and their newborn son, Jean. Monet attended the birth in Paris and returned to the coast a few days later.&lt;ref name="The Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/437136?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ao=on&amp;ft=monet&amp;pos=4 The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair of paintings juxtaposes this sunny regatta watched at high tide by well dressed bourgeois, with an overcast scene at low tide, fishing boats hauled onto the beach peopled with sailors and workers. Since Monet never exhibited the paintings side by side, the contrast between them was probably not intended as a social manifesto but instead reflected differing conditions under which the same place could be painted.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

On 25 June 1867, Monet reported that he was working on about twenty pictures:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Among the seascapes, I am doing the regattas of Le Havre with many figures on the beach and the outer harbor covered with small sails." (Claude Monet)&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting is signed at the lower left.

[[File:Operating system placement (software).svg|thumb|upright|A diagram showing how the [[User (computing)|user]] interacts with [[application software]] on a typical [[desktop computer]].The application software layer interfaces with the [[operating system]], which in turn communicates with the [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]]. The arrows indicate information flow.]]

'''Computer software''', or simply '''software''', is a collection of [[data (computing)|data]] or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to [[Computer hardware|physical hardware]], from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], computer software is all [[information]] processed by [[computer system]]s, [[Computer program|program]]s and [[data]]. Computer software includes [[computer program]]s, [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and related non-executable [[Data (computing)|data]], such as [[Software documentation|online documentation]] or [[digital media]]. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.

At the lowest programming level,{{Clarify|reason=What 'level' means can be unclear to non-technical readers|date=August 2018}} [[executable code]] consists of [[Machine code|machine language]] instructions supported by an individual [[Microprocessor|processor]]—typically a [[central processing unit]] (CPU) or a [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU). A machine language consists of groups of [[Binary numbers|binary values]] signifying [[Instruction (computing)|processor instructions]] that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction [[System call|may also invoke]] one of many [[Input/output|input or output operations]], for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the [[User (computing)|user]]. The processor [[Instruction cycle|executes]] the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to [[branch instruction|"jump" to a different instruction]], or is [[Interrupt|interrupted]] by the operating system. {{As of|2015}}, most [[Personal computer|personal computers]], [[smartphone]] devices and [[Server (computing)|servers]] have [[Multi-core processor|processors with multiple execution units]] or [[Multiprocessing|multiple processors performing computation]] together, and computing has become a much more [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] activity than in the past.

The majority of software is written in [[high-level programming language]]s. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to [[natural language]]s than machine languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compiler construction|url=http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102143144/http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-level languages are translated into machine language using a [[compiler]] or an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level [[assembly language]], which has strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an [[Assembly language|assembler]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of software}}
An outline ([[algorithm]]) for what would have been the first piece of software was written by [[Ada Lovelace]] in the 19th century, for the planned [[Analytical Engine]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} She created [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] to show how the engine would calculate [[Bernoulli number|Bernoulli Numbers]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} Because of the proofs and algorithm, she is considered the first computer programmer.&lt;ref name="Annals of the History of Computing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuegi|first=J.|last2=Francis|first2=J.|date=2003|title=Lovelace &amp; Babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes'|journal=Annals of the History of Computing|volume=25|issue=4|pages=16–26|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelace Google"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/10/ada-lovelace-honoured-google-doodle|title=Ada Lovelace honoured by Google doodle|last=|first=|date=December 10, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first theory about software—prior to creation of computers as we know them today—was proposed by Alan Turing in his 1935 essay ''On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem'' (decision problem).

This eventually led to the creation of the academic fields of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]]; Both fields study software and its creation. Computer science is the theoretical study of computer and software (Turing's essay is an example of computer science), whereas software engineering is the application of engineering and development of software.

However, prior to 1946, software was not yet the programs stored in the memory of stored-program digital computers, as we now understand it. The first electronic computing devices were instead rewired in order to "reprogram" them.

==Types==
{{See also|List of software categories}}

On virtually all computer platforms, software can be grouped into a few broad categories.

===Purpose, or domain of use===
{{Ecommerce}}
Based on the goal, computer software can be divided into:

* '''[[Application software]]''' &lt;br&gt; which is software that uses the computer system to perform special functions or provide [[video game|entertainment functions]] beyond the basic operation of the computer itself. There are many different types of application software, because the range of tasks that can be performed with a modern computer is so large—see [[list of software]].
* '''[[System software]]''' &lt;br&gt; which is software that directly operates the '''[[computer hardware]]''', to provide basic functionality needed by users and other software, and to provide a platform for running application software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System Software|url=http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010530092843/http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 May 2001|publisher=The University of Mississippi|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; System software includes:
** '''[[Operating system]]s''' &lt;br&gt; which are essential collections of software that manage resources and provides common services for other software that runs "on top" of them. [[Supervisory program]]s, [[boot loader]]s, [[shell (computing)|shells]] and [[window system]]s are core parts of operating systems. In practice, an operating system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has one operating system.
** '''[[Device driver]]s''' &lt;br&gt; which operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Each device needs at least one corresponding device driver; because a computer typically has at minimum at least one input device and at least one output device, a computer typically needs more than one device driver.
** '''[[Software utility|Utilities]]''' &lt;br&gt; which are computer [[Programs and Features|programs]] designed to assist users in the maintenance and care of their computers.
* '''[[Malicious software]]''' or '''malware''' &lt;br&gt; which is software that is developed to harm and disrupt computers. As such, malware is undesirable. Malware is closely associated with computer-related crimes, though some malicious programs may have been designed as [[practical joke]]s.

===Nature or domain of execution===
* [[Desktop applications]] such as [[web browser]]s and [[Microsoft Office]], as well as [[smartphone]] and [[Tablet computer|tablet]] applications (called "[[mobile app|apps]]"). (There is a push in some parts of the software industry to merge desktop applications with mobile apps, to some extent. [[Windows 8]], and later [[Ubuntu Touch]], tried to allow the same style of application user interface to be used on desktops, laptops and mobiles.)
* [[JavaScript]] scripts are pieces of software traditionally embedded in [[web pages]] that are run directly inside the [[web browser]] when a web page is loaded without the need for a web browser plugin. Software written in other programming languages can also be run within the web browser if the software is either translated into JavaScript, or if a web browser plugin that supports that language is installed; the most common example of the latter is [[ActionScript]] scripts, which are supported by the [[Adobe Flash]] plugin.
* [[Server software]], including:
** [[Web application]]s, which usually run on the [[web server]] and output dynamically generated web pages to web browsers, using e.g. [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[ASP.NET]], or even [[Node.js|JavaScript that runs on the server]]. In modern times these commonly include some JavaScript to be run in the web browser as well, in which case they typically run partly on the server, partly in the web browser.
* [[Plug-in (computing)|Plugins]] and extensions are software that extends or modifies the functionality of another piece of software, and require that software be used in order to function;
* [[Embedded software]] resides as [[firmware]] within [[embedded system]]s, devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as [[car]]s and [[television]]s (although some embedded devices such as wireless chipsets can ''themselves'' be part of an ordinary, non-embedded computer system such as a PC or smartphone).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Embedded Software—Technologies and Trends|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|date=May–June 2009|accessdate=6 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028045823/http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|archivedate=28 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the embedded system context there is sometimes no clear distinction between the system software and the application software. However, some embedded systems run [[embedded operating system]]s, and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software (although typically there will only be one, fixed, application which is always run).
* [[Microcode]] is a special, relatively obscure type of embedded software which tells the processor ''itself'' how to execute machine code, so it is actually a lower level than machine code. It is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer, and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users (which is much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware). Thus an ordinary programmer would not expect to ever have to deal with it.

===Programming tools===
{{Main article|Programming tool}}
Programming tools are also software in the form of programs or applications that [[software developer]]s (also known as
''programmers, coders, hackers'' or ''software engineers'') use to create, [[Debugging|debug]], [[Software maintenance|maintain]] (i.e. improve or fix), or otherwise [[Technical support|support]] software. 

Software is written in one or more programming languages; there are many programming languages in existence, and each has at least one implementation, each of which consists of its own set of programming tools. These tools may be relatively self-contained programs such as [[compiler]]s, [[debugger]]s, [[interpreter (computing)|interpreters]], [[linker (computing)|linkers]], and [[text editor]]s, that can be combined together to accomplish a task; or they may form an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE), which combines much or all of the functionality of such self-contained tools. IDEs may do this by either invoking the relevant individual tools or by re-implementing their functionality in a new way. An IDE can make it easier to do specific tasks, such as searching in files in a particular project. Many programming language implementations provide the option of using both individual tools or an IDE.

==Topics==
===Architecture===
{{See also|Software architecture}}
Users often see things differently from programmers. People who use modern general purpose computers (as opposed to [[embedded system]]s, [[analog computer]]s and [[supercomputer]]s) usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks: platform, application, and user software.

* '''Platform software''' &lt;br&gt; The [[Platform (computing)|Platform]] includes the [[firmware]], [[device driver]]s, an [[operating system]], and typically a [[graphical user interface]] which, in total, allow a user to interact with the computer and its [[peripheral]]s (associated equipment). Platform software often comes bundled with the computer. On a [[Personal computer|PC]] one will usually have the ability to change the platform software.
* '''Application software''' &lt;br&gt; [[Application software]] or Applications are what most people think of when they think of software. Typical examples include office suites and video games. [[Application software]] is often purchased separately from computer hardware. Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications. Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system, though they are often tailored for specific platforms. Most users think of compilers, databases, and other "system software" as applications.
* '''User-written software''' &lt;br&gt; [[End-user development]] tailors systems to meet users' specific needs. User software include spreadsheet templates and [[word processor]] templates. Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is. Depending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into default application packages, many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages, and what has been added by co-workers.

===Execution===
{{Main article|Execution (computing)}}
Computer software has to be "loaded" into the [[computer storage|computer's storage]] (such as the [[hard drive]] or [[Computer memory|memory]]). Once the software has loaded, the computer is able to ''execute'' the software. This involves passing [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] from the [[application software]], through the system software, to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as [[machine language|machine code]]. Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation—moving [[data (computing)|data]], carrying out a [[computation]], or altering the [[control flow]] of instructions.

Data movement is typically from one place in memory to another. Sometimes it involves moving data between memory and registers which enable high-speed data access in the CPU. Moving data, especially large amounts of it, can be costly. So, this is sometimes avoided by using "pointers" to data instead. Computations include simple operations such as incrementing the value of a variable data element. More complex computations may involve many operations and data elements together.&lt;!-- This section is simply to long for this article and needs to be compressed into the intro above, or moved to the article itself.

Instructions may be performed sequentially, conditionally, or iteratively. Sequential instructions are those operations that are performed one after another. Conditional instructions are performed such that different sets of instructions execute depending on the value(s) of some data. In some languages this is known as an "if" statement. Iterative instructions are performed repetitively and may depend on some data value. This is sometimes called a "loop." Often, one instruction may "call" another set of instructions that are defined in some other program or [[module (programming)|module]]. When more than one computer processor is used, instructions may be executed simultaneously.

A simple example of the way software operates is what happens when a user selects an entry such as "Copy" from a menu. In this case, a conditional instruction is executed to copy text from data in a 'document' area residing in memory, perhaps to an intermediate storage area known as a 'clipboard' data area. If a different menu entry such as "Paste" is chosen, the software may execute the instructions to copy the text from the clipboard data area to a specific location in the same or another document in memory.

Depending on the application, even the example above could become complicated. The field of software engineering endeavors to manage the complexity of how software operates. This is especially true for software that operates in the context of a large or powerful [[computer system]].

Currently, almost the only limitations on the use of computer software in applications is the ingenuity of the designer/programmer. Consequently, large areas of activities (such as playing grand master level chess) formerly assumed to be incapable of software simulation are now routinely programmed. The only area that has so far proved reasonably secure from software simulation is the realm of human art— especially, pleasing music and literature.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Kinds of software by operation: [[computer program]] as [[executable]], [[source code]] or [[script (computer programming)|script]], [[computer configuration|configuration]].--&gt;

===Quality and reliability===
{{Main article|Software quality|Software testing|Software reliability}}
Software quality is very important, especially for [[commercial software|commercial]] and system software like [[Microsoft Office]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]]. If software is faulty (buggy), it can delete a person's work, crash the computer and do other unexpected things. Faults and errors are called "[[Software bug|bugs]]" which are often discovered during alpha and beta testing. Software is often also a victim to what is known as [[software aging]], the progressive performance degradation resulting from a combination of unseen bugs.

Many bugs are discovered and eliminated (debugged) through [[software testing]]. However, software testing rarely—if ever—eliminates every bug; some programmers say that "every program has at least one more bug" (Lubarsky's Law).&lt;ref name="github"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | title=scripting intelligence book examples | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106154317/https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | archivedate=6 November 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Waterfall model|waterfall]] method of software development, separate testing teams are typically employed, but in newer approaches, collectively termed [[agile software development]], developers often do all their own testing, and demonstrate the software to users/clients regularly to obtain feedback. Software can be tested through [[unit testing]], [[regression testing]] and other methods, which are done manually, or most commonly, automatically, since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large. For instance, [[NASA]] has extremely rigorous software testing procedures for many operating systems and communication functions. Many NASA-based operations interact and identify each other through command programs. This enables many people who work at NASA to check and evaluate functional systems overall. Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together.

===License===
{{Main article|Software license}}
The software's license gives the user the right to use the software in the licensed environment, and in the case of [[free software license]]s, also grants other rights such as the right to make copies.

[[Proprietary software]] can be divided into two types:

* [[freeware]], which includes the category of "free trial" software or "[[freemium]]" software (in the past, the term [[shareware]] was often used for free trial/freemium software). As the name suggests, freeware can be used free, although in the case of free trials or freemium software, this is sometimes only true for a limited period of time or with limited functionality.
* software available for a fee, often inaccurately termed "[[commercial software]]", which can only be legally used on purchase of a license.

[[Open source software]], on the other hand, comes with a [[free software license]], granting the recipient the rights to modify and redistribute the software.

===Patents===
{{Main article|Software patent|Software patent debate}}
Software patents, like other types of patents, are theoretically supposed to give an inventor an exclusive, time-limited license for a ''detailed idea (e.g. an algorithm) on how to implement'' a piece of software, or a component of a piece of software. Ideas for useful things that software could ''do'', and user ''requirements'', are not supposed to be patentable, and concrete implementations (i.e. the actual software packages implementing the patent) are not supposed to be patentable either—the latter are already covered by copyright, generally automatically. So software patents are supposed to cover the middle area, between requirements and concrete implementation. In some countries, a requirement for the claimed invention to have an effect on the physical world may also be part of the requirements for a software patent to be held valid—although since ''all'' useful software has effects on the physical world, this requirement may be open to debate. Meanwhile, American copyright law was applied to various aspects of the writing of the software code.&lt;ref&gt; Gerardo Con Díaz, "The Text in the Machine: American Copyright Law and the Many Natures of Software, 1974–1978,” ''Technology and Culture'' 57 (October 2016), 753–79.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Software patents are controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about them. One of the sources of controversy is that the aforementioned split between initial ideas and patent does not seem to be honored in practice by patent lawyers—for example the patent for [[Aspect-Oriented Programming]] (AOP), which purported to claim rights over ''any'' programming tool implementing the idea of AOP, howsoever implemented. Another source of controversy is the effect on innovation, with many distinguished experts and companies arguing that software is such a fast-moving field that software patents merely create vast additional litigation costs and risks, and actually retard innovation. In the case of debates about software patents outside the United States, the argument has been made that large American corporations and patent lawyers are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of allowing or continue to allow software patents.

==Design and implementation==
{{Main article|Software development|Computer programming|Software engineering}}
Design and implementation of software varies depending on the complexity of the software. For instance, the design and creation of [[Microsoft Word]] took much more time than designing and developing [[Microsoft Notepad]] because the latter has much more basic functionality.

Software is usually designed and created (aka coded/written/programmed) in [[integrated development environment]]s (IDE) like [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[IntelliJ IDEA|IntelliJ]] and [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] that can simplify the process and [[compiler|compile]] the software (if applicable). As noted in a different section, software is usually created on top of existing software and the [[application programming interface]] (API) that the underlying software provides like [[GTK+]], JavaBeans or [[Swing (Java)|Swing]]. Libraries (APIs) can be categorized by their purpose. For instance, the [[Spring framework|Spring Framework]] is used for implementing [[enterprise application]]s, the [[Windows Forms]] library is used for designing graphical user interface (GUI) applications like [[Microsoft Word]], and [[Windows Communication Foundation]] is used for designing [[web service]]s. When a program is designed, it relies upon the API. For instance, a Microsoft Windows desktop application might call API functions in the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] Windows Forms library like ''Form1.Close()'' and ''Form1.Show()''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx |title=MSDN Library |accessdate=2010-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611204810/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to close or open the application. Without these APIs, the programmer needs to write these functionalities entirely themselves. Companies like [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Microsoft]] provide their own APIs so that many applications are written using their [[Library (computing)|software libraries]] that usually have numerous APIs in them.

[[Data structure]]s such as [[hash table]]s, [[array data type|arrays]], and [[binary tree]]s, and [[algorithm]]s such as [[quicksort]], can be useful for creating software.

Computer software has special economic characteristics that make its design, creation, and distribution different from most other economic goods.{{Specify|Which characteristics?|date=May 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=v. Engelhardt, Sebastian |year=2008 |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/jrp/jrpwrp/2008-045.html |title=The Economic Properties of Software |journal=Jena Economic Research Papers |volume=2 |issue=2008–045. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105145954/https://ideas.repec.org/p/jrp/jrpwrp/2008-045.html |archivedate=5 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dankaminsky.com/1999/03/02/69/ |title=Why Open Source Is The Optimum Economic Paradigm for Software |first=Dan |last=Kaminsky |year=1999 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522001231/http://dankaminsky.com/1999/03/02/69/ |archivedate=22 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who creates software is called a [[programmer]], [[software engineer]] or [[software developer]], terms that all have a similar meaning. More informal terms for programmer also exist such as "coder" and "'''hacker'''"{{Spaced ndash}}although use of the latter word may cause confusion, because it is more often used to mean [[Hacker (computer security)|someone who illegally breaks into computer systems]].

{{Main article|Software industry}}
A great variety of software companies and programmers in the world comprise a software industry. Software can be quite a profitable industry: [[Bill Gates]], the co-founder of [[Microsoft]] was the richest person in the world in 2009, largely due to his ownership of a significant number of shares in Microsoft, the company responsible for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Microsoft Office]] software products - both market leaders in their respective product categories.

Non-profit software organizations include the [[Free Software Foundation]], [[GNU Project]] and [[Mozilla Foundation]]. Software standard organizations like the [[W3C]], [[IETF]] develop recommended software standards such as [[XML]], [[HTTP]] and [[HTML]], so that software can interoperate through these standards.

Other well-known large software companies include [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[TCS]], [[Infosys]], [[Wipro]], [[HCL Technologies]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Novell]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Symantec]], [[Adobe Systems]], [[Sidetrade]] and [[Corel]], while small companies often provide innovation.

It is part of the [[Ashcan School]] movement known in particular for depicting scenes of daily life in  early twentieth century [[New York City]], often in the city's poorer neighborhoods. Bellows used quick strokes to create a blurred image, simulating the two fighters in motion. He also chose a low point of view to put the viewer among the crowd watching the fight.

Participants in the boxing ring were usually members of the club, but occasionally outsiders would fight with temporary memberships. These fighters were known as "stags".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=PBS| title=Sister Wendy's American Collection| accessdate=2014-07-09| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/sisterwendy/works/sta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bridge at Narni''''' (in French: ''Le pont de Narni'') is an 1826 painting of the [[Ponte d'Augusto (Narni)|Ponte d'Augusto]] at [[Narni]] by [[France|French]] artist [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]]. The painting is currently on display at the [[Musée du Louvre]] in [[Paris]]. 

The painting is a product of one of Corot's youthful sojourns in Italy, and, in [[Kenneth Clark]]'s words, "as free as the most vigorous [[John Constable|Constable]]". It was painted in September 1826, and was the basis for the larger and more finished ''View at Narni'', which was exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1827, and is now in the [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa]].

The view was not a novel one: in 1821 Corot's teacher, [[Achille-Etna Michallon]] had drawn the same scene, as had Corot's friend Ernst Fries in 1826. Corot's study is a reconciliation of traditional and [[plein air]] painting objectives:

''So deeply did Corot admire [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] and [[Nicholas Poussin|Poussin]], so fully did he understand their work, that from the outset he viewed nature in their terms....In less than a year (since his arrival in Rome) he had realized his goal of closing the gap between the empirical freshness of outdoor painting and the organizing principles of classical landscape composition.''&lt;ref&gt;Galassi, Peter, ''Corot in Italy'', page 168-70. Yale University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HarleianMisc.png|thumb|right|Title page from the second edition of ''Harleian Miscellany'' (1753)]]
'''''The Harleian Miscellany''''' is a collection of material from the [[library]] of the [[Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] collated and edited by [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[William Oldys]] between 1744 and 1753 on behalf of the publisher [[Thomas Osborne (publisher)|Thomas Osborne]]. Its subtitle was  '''A Collection of Scarce, Curious, And Entertaining Pamphlets And Tracts, as well In Manuscript As In Print, Found In The Late Earl Of Oxford's Library, Interspersed With Historical, Political, And Critical Notes'''.

==Provenance==
The "late Earl of Oxford" whose library was the source of the texts could refer either to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] (died 1724), or to his son, [[Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] (died 1741). A passage at the beginning of the first volume emphasizes the role of Robert Harley, the first earl, in the creation of the library:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no Objection against the Prefixing the reasons for Creating the Right Honorable Robert Harley, Esq., a Peer of Great-Britain, and Earl of Oxford; especially, as the valuable Collection, intended to be published in this Form, was made by the Greatness of his Knowledge in all Branches of Learning, and at the vast Expence of that noble Family. ...his Library consisted of more than 100000 different Authors: He, I say, cannot be denied the first Place in this Miscellany, which esteems it an Honour to bear his Name.&lt;ref&gt;''The Harleian Miscellany'', vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WpVCAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=harleian+miscellany&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QHn0zKwrab&amp;sig=IUkRPlFiwZx9IoUKv2GUHQ81PHU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ciA5TZL8HIO78gbd9cX1Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=robert%20harley&amp;f=false p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Edward Harley, the second earl, who had died only a few years before ''The Harleian Miscellany'' was published, was also a [[bibliophile]] who had greatly expanded the library.&lt;ref&gt;David Stoker, ‘[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12337 Harley, Edward, second earl of Oxford and Mortimer (1689–1741)]’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis''''' is [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s account of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962. The book was released in 1969, a year after [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination|his assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;Haruya Anami, "'Thirteen Days' Thirty Years After: Robert Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis Revisited," ''Journal of American &amp; Canadian Studies'' (1994) Issue 12, pp 69-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thirteen Days'' describes the meetings held by the Executive Committee ([[ExComm]]), the team assembled by US President [[John F. Kennedy]] to handle the tense situation that developed between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] following the discovery of Soviet [[nuclear missiles]] in [[Cuba]], {{convert|90|mi}} from [[Florida]]. Robert Kennedy, who was the [[US Attorney General]] at the time, describes his brother John's leadership style during the crisis as involved, but not controlling. Robert Kennedy viewed the military leaders on the council sympathetically, and recognized that their lifelong concentration on war was difficult to set aside.

The book was used as the basis for the 1974 television play ''[[The Missiles of October]]''. In 2000, the theatrical film ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'' was produced using the same title, but based on an entirely different book, ''The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis'' by [[Ernest May (historian)|Ernest May]] and [[Philip Zelikow]]. That book contained some information that Kennedy was not able to reveal because it was classified at the time.

'''''Two Girls Dressing a Kitten by Candlelight''''' (also known as '''''Dressing the Kitten''''') (c. 1768–70) is a "fancy painting" by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] (1734–97). The picture is one of a number of candlelit studies made by Wright that demonstrate his skill in the use of ''[[chiaroscuro]]'' in which he specialised. Apparently an innocent scene of little girls dressing a kitten, the picture has been thought by art historians to have a number of deeper meanings.

==Genre and composition==
''Two Girls Dressing a Kitten by Candlelight'' would have been described in the late eighteenth century as a "fancy picture", a type of picture between [[Portrait painting|portraiture]] and works with a historical or literary theme.&lt;ref name=Kenw/&gt; It depicts two upper-class girls, probably sisters, who have put aside their doll in order to dress up their kitten instead.

The most notable feature of the painting is Wright's skillful use of ''chiaroscuro'', the contrast of light and dark, a technique in which he specialised, here seen in the play of the candlelight on the figures of the girls. The English portrait painter [[James Northcote]], who was a contemporary of Wright, called him "the most famous painter now living for candle-lights"&lt;ref name=Houst/&gt; and Wright's use of contrasts in this picture has been compared to the [[Utrecht Caravaggism]] of the religious paintings of [[Gerard van Honthorst]].&lt;ref name=App/&gt; Wright was also known for his close attention to detail which here may be seen in the careful depiction of the girls dresses, their doll, the necklace, and the bonnet on the kitten.&lt;ref name=Houst/&gt;

==Interpretation==
A longer look at the picture indicates that it may not be so innocent as it seems. In contrast to the little girls in Wright's ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' (1768, thought to be the earlier work), who shrink from the suffering of the bird, the girls in this painting seem to be enjoying themselves.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt; The theme of cruelty is the same however.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; The girl on the left is placed forward, almost outside the scene, her index finger pointing to her sister, inviting the spectator to observe the proceedings.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; Her maniacal expression and the shadowy uplighting add a sinister dimension, suggesting that something unnatural is going on.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt; If the scene was entirely innocent it would surely be taking place in daylight&lt;ref name=Kenw&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryant, Julius.|title=Kenwood, Paintings in the Iveagh Bequest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DAjHamKGor0C&amp;pg=PA408|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0-300-10206-2|pages=408–411}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the positioning of the spectator at about the eye level of the children enhances the feeling that the viewer is entering the secret world of the child with its attendant moral ambiguity.&lt;ref name=App/&gt;

The sexual undertone in the picture is suggested by the kitten, gripped firmly by the neck and who we may infer is male, which stares out of the picture as though protesting the forced [[transvestism]]&lt;ref name=rep/&gt; but at the same time suggesting with his tail an element of arousal, while the girls' doll lies on her back with her skirts around her waist.&lt;ref name=Kenw/&gt; The candle adds drama by producing areas of light and dark, and refers to the transience of childhood.&lt;ref name=App&gt;"The dark side of ''The Kitten'': A Wright of Derby for Kenwood." Julius Bryant, ''[[Apollo (magazine)|Apollo]]'', December 1996, Vol. 144, No. 418 (new series), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; When the picture was painted the age of consent in England was just 12&lt;ref name=Kenw/&gt; and the girls, approaching womanhood, are more finely dressed than they need be, with fancy collars, cuffs and jewellery more appropriate to adults.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt; The message is that today they dress up and cruelly toy with a helpless kitten, soon they will toy with the affections of real men.&lt;ref name=Houst/&gt; Wright did not marry until he was 38 and it has been speculated that the picture in some way reflects his frustrations with the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=Houst&gt;[http://www.mfah.org/blogs/behind-scenes-rienzi/2012/guests-abroad-joseph-wright-derby-fancy-pictures-a/ "Guests from Abroad: Joseph Wright of Derby and a Tiny Kitten with a Hat".] Caroline Cole, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]], 20 July 2012. Retrieved 12 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  There may also be an element of interest in the developing sexuality of the adolescent girls.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt; Cats were often used in eighteenth-century painting as devices to indicate female sexuality.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt;

The depiction of the girls in the painting has been contrasted with Wright's treatment of boys in his art. While the girls either shrink in horror from the cruelty in ''An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump'', or turn cruelty into a game of fun in ''Dressing the Kitten'' in order to make it more acceptable to the viewer, the boys in ''Two Boys Blowing a Bladder by Candle-light'' are engaged in enlightenment scientific research, and the ''Two Boys Fighting over a Bladder'' are in the tradition of using children as allegories for adult ambition.&lt;ref name=App/&gt;&lt;ref name=rep/&gt;

[[Art historians]] have also placed the painting in the tradition of [[Allegory|allegories]] of the cruelty of children&lt;ref name=App/&gt; as seen in the work of [[William Hogarth]] in plate I of ''[[The Four Stages of Cruelty]]'' (1751).&lt;ref name=rep&gt;"Engaging the Audience: Sexual Economies of Vision in Joseph Wright", Susan L. Siegfried, ''[[Representations (journal)|Representations]]'', No. 68 (Autumn, 1999), pp. 34–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The last in the series of the four stages, entitled "The Rewards of Cruelty", was a source for ''A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery'' (1766) and ''An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump'' (1768) and it is possible therefore that Wright owned all four of the engravings in the series.&lt;ref name=Kenw/&gt; As a collector of prints, Wright may also have been aware of the work of earlier artists that explored similar themes, particularly Netherlandish painters such as [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Judith Leyster]] and [[Jan van Bijlert]], where there was a proverb "Whoever plays with a little cat will be scratched".&lt;ref name=Kenw/&gt;&lt;ref name=App/&gt;

==Provenance==
The exact date of completion of the painting is not known but Wright showed two "candle-light" paintings at the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]] in 1767, and again in 1768. ''Dressing the Kitten'' may have been one of them.&lt;ref name=Kenw/&gt; The painting was purchased at [[Christie's]] in 1772 by [[Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston|Henry Temple]], second Viscount Palmerston (1739–1802),&lt;ref name=App/&gt; father of British Prime Minister [[Lord Palmerston]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2119">A '''visual narrative''' (also '''visual storytelling''')&lt;ref&gt;Tony C. Caputo, ''Visual Storytelling: The Art and Technique'', Watson-Guptill Publications, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; is a story told primarily through the use of visual media. The story may be told using still [[photography]], [[illustration]], or [[video]], and can be enhanced with [[graphics]], music, voice and other audio.

==Overview&lt;!--'Visual narratology' redirects here--&gt;==
The term "visual narrative" has been used to describe several genres of visual storytelling, from news and information ([[photojournalism]], the [[photo essay]], the [[documentary film]]) to entertainment (art, movies, television, [[comic book]]s, the [[graphic novel]]). In short, any kind of a story, told visually, is a visual narrative.

The visual narrative has also been of interest to the academic community as scholars, thinkers and educators have sought to understand the impact and power of image and narrative in individuals and societies. The corresponding discipline is called '''visual [[narratology]]'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.imageandnarrative.be Image &lt;nowiki&gt;[&amp;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Narrative]'' – "a peer-reviewed [[e-journal]] on visual narratology in the broadest sense of the term".&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing characteristics of the visual narrative include:
*a persuasive story with a point of view
*high quality images, still or moving
*subject matter with pressing social, environmental, or spiritual value
*an appeal (explicit or implicit) for transformation in attitudes and behaviors
