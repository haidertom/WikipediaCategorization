After studies at EAVRA in Maracay and at the [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie]] in [[Amsterdam]] he lives and works in Amsterdam and [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arcthemagazine.com/arc/2013/03/abdul-vas-shoot-to-thrill-curated-by-alexis-callado-estefania-casado-santapau-gallery-madrid/ Abdul Vas’ Shoot to Thrill-Curated by Alexis Callado Estefania-Casado Santapau Gallery] [[ARC Magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt; He has created handmade [[books]] and [[zines]], [[photographs]], [[collages]], [[drawings]], [[paintings]] and [[murals]].

Vas's work has been discussed and reviewed in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Pete Benesch.

== Work ==

Abdul Vas work broaches heavily the obsessions of his home country Venezuela with the symbols of the American dream. Heavily influenced by [[Marc Chagall]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Al Feldstein]] and [[James Ensor]], Vas's work heavily consists of depictions of aggressive and well-hung [[rooster]]s that represent the masculine element of the American cowboy-culture. Therefore, his pictures are full of references to the American baseball team [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[MLB]], [[Malcolm Young]],  [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Slayer]], [[Metallica]], [[the Black Crowes]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[SUV]]s, [[rock and roll]] and the symbols of the North American imperialist power: the [[Navistar]] trucks. Another common theme in his work is the Australian rock group [[AC/DC]], particularly lead singer [[Brian Johnson]]. Many of his other artworks are named after AC/DC songs or albums.

==About Abjjad==
Abjjad was designed in Arabic to attract Arabic readers and authors to a one [[social network]]. It also aims to provide an accurate and enormous database for [[Arabic books]] and authors.&lt;ref name="test4"&gt;[http://arablit.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/abjjad-an-arabic-social-network-for-books-with-a-big-vision/ Abjjad: An Arabic Social Network for Books with a Big Vision.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abjjad recommends a variety of 10 books each week and a weekly article written by one of the members.&lt;ref name="test4" /&gt; It also allows members to follow each other, or follow authors or books to receive notifications once a new review has been added about the books or new information was added in the writer page.&lt;ref name="test3" /&gt;

Abjjad is linked to [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] which provides Abjjad with an extensive database of English books making it easy for members to find English books. In addition, it includes more than 30 thousand Arabic books.

Members of Abjjad call themselves "Abjjadyeen" which created a brand for the website and helped in spreading it around the Middle East. The website is featured with the "Abjadyya" where members can use to filter what to appear on their timelines from members' status, book reviews or book ratings. The "Abjadyya" is a status a member can write and share with his followers where they can like and comment on it. Members of the website tend to use the word "Abjadyya" to refer to other members statuses.

'''The Adoration of the Shepherds''' is an oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Michelangelo Merisi, commonly known as [[Michelangelo Merisi Caravaggio|Caravaggio]]. ''The Adoration of the Shepherds'' measures 83.07 x 123.62 in. It was commissioned for the Capuchin Franciscans and was painted in [[Messina]] for the Church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli, Messina|Santa Maria degli Angeli]] in 1609 just one year prior to the death of Caravaggio.

== About the Artist ==
Michelangelo Merisi, commonly known as Caravaggio, was born in Milan in the northern region of Lombardy, Italy in 1571. He had to flee from his hometown after wounding a police officer in a tavern brawl. As with most other aspiring artists, he went to Rome to study classical techniques. Throughout his young adult life, Caravaggio was known amongst Italian citizens to be quite unruly and rebellious. He was often arrested on charges for violent behavior.

Cardinal Francesco del Monte took a struggling Caravaggio into his home, and introduced him to his circle—thereby securing Caravaggio with his first public commissions. These commissions were not religious, but entirely secular paintings ranging from flowers and fruit to paintings of a young classical Greek god. It was during this time that he would become world-renowned for the physical particularity and brutal realism of his paintings. 
In 1599, Caravaggio reached a turning point in his artistic career.

Presumably under Cardinal Francesco de Monte, Caravaggio was commissioned to decorate a wall dedicated to Saint Matthew in the Contarelli Chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi. This was Caravaggio’s first religious work for the Catholic Church. He began to be seen as an artistic visionary for the Church with his use of anachronistic technique to draw people back to the Catholic Church during the Counter Reformation. With this good publicity, he began to pick up many more prestigious commissions. Caravaggio painted from life rather than drawings, which initially received criticism but later revolutionized the term “artistic realism”.

Caravaggio mysteriously died in 1610, a year after finishing The Adoration of the Shepherds.&lt;ref name="The National Gallery- UK" /&gt;

== The Creation and Artistic Analysis of ''The Adoration of the Shepherds'' ==
By the time that Caravaggio painted ''The Adoration of the Shepherds'' in 1609, the subjects in his paintings had acquired a more spiritual expressiveness. His figures were isolated against vast, empty backgrounds. This was a contrast to the Renaissance technique of employing decorative backgrounds.

The Capuchins were among the few religious patrons and critics who were fond of Caravaggio’s brutal realism. Many were critical of Caravaggio’s approach to his religious paintings and called it “vulgar” to represent biblical figures as ordinary peasants. 
The focal point of the scene is Mary in the center. She is swathed in bright red. One of the three shepherds closest to her also has a little bit of what appears to be the same red robe draped along his arm. This might be symbolic of the gesture he is making to touch the Virgin as she is holding Christ. All three shepherds, as well as Joseph identified by a faint halo, look on with amazement and complete adoration at this infant child born in a barn.

Caravaggio’s Baroque work is starkly different and revolutionary from Renaissance predecessors. To start, these divine figures are represented as ordinary people of the times. They are barefoot with ordinary robes. There is no divinity in the barn, either. There is no holy light source to shine the entire scene and make it overly-apparent that a divine event is occurring. Instead, the background is extremely dark with only a small single light source. It seems as though the space was lit by a single candle, as it might have realistically been during the actual event. We know that in the biblical account, Mary and Joseph were extremely poor. Their halos are almost barely seen, in contrast to the ornate halos of the Renaissance. Other than the halos, the clasped hands of the shepherds is the only thing hinting of any religious importance in the painting. There was nothing overtly marvelous about the birth of Christ. Caravaggio renders this aspect perfectly.

Caravaggio's compositions are also non-classical: he arranges his figures along imaginary diagonal lines rather than a perfectly center linear composition like the Renaissance. There is a box of tools in the foreground, presumably Joseph’s since he was a carpenter. There is a single roughly baked loaf of bread as well, to reiterate Mary and Joseph’s poverty. There is nothing pre-arranged in the painting. It looks like a photograph that would have been taken in the exact moments after Christ’s birth.

Stylistically, Caravaggio used a technique he was famous for developing called chiaroscuro. Chiaroscuro is a contrast between dark and light. Using this technique heightened the drama of the work to make it seem raw and magnify the emotional aspects of the work. Chiaroscuro forces the viewer to focus on the figures and the event rather than other things going on in the background.

The central theme of the painting is humility. By seating the Virgin on the ground, Caravaggio implies that she is not a heavenly queen, but rather a simple young mother. This painting is a representation of the majority. The response of the shepherds is to admire rather than to venerate. There is a calmness and tranquility that is unmistakably conveying their worth as common-folk for the people as the parents of the Savior.&lt;ref name='The Caravaggio Foundation- "The Adoration of the Shepherds"' /&gt;

'''Balochi cinema''' refers to the [[Balochi language|Balochi-language]] film industry in [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], and among the [[Baloch diaspora]].&lt;ref name="Taheri"/&gt;

==History==
The first Balochi feature film, ''Hammal-o-Mahganj'', was produced by [[Anwar Iqbal]] and released in Pakistan in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pakistan Cinema, 1947-1997|first=Mushtaq|last=Gazdar|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1997|page=146|isbn=9780195778175}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film never made it to the screen amidst protests by cultural activists who alleged it misrepresented Baloch culture.&lt;ref name="Rehman"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/117478-A-new-lease-of-life-for-Balochi-cinema|title=A new lease of life for Balochi cinema?|work=The News|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=27 August 2016|first=Zia-ur|last=Rehman}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slogan used by the protest movement was "Balochi film chalay ga tou cinema jalay ga" (If Balochi films are screened, cinemas will be burnt).&lt;ref name="Rehman"/&gt; Analysts believe the film's release became politicised, as [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] activists favoured the film while [[Baloch nationalism|Baloch nationalist]] groups opposed it. Iqbal later arranged a private screening of the film to address the reservations, where Sindh's labour minister cum PPP leader Abdullah Baloch was a key attendee. According to ''[[The News International|The News]]'', those who viewed it "agreed that the film did not have anything that went against the Baloch culture".&lt;ref name="Rehman"/&gt; The falling quality of erstwhile [[Punjabi cinema|Punjabi]] and [[Pashto cinema|Pashto]] cinema reportedly contributed to the Baloch activist's sentiments.&lt;ref name="Rehman"/&gt; This event is believed to have dented the Balochi film industry's initial growth.&lt;ref name="Rehman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DP"/&gt;

In 1989, the Iranian film ''[[Dadshah]]'' was released in Balochi dubbing. The film was based on Mir [[Dad Shah]] of [[Iranian Balochistan]].&lt;ref name="BV"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://balochistanvoices.com/2016/04/balochi-film-industry/|title=Balochi Film Industry|first=Yasmeen|last=Baloch|work=Balochistan Voices|date=3 April 2016|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent years, cinema growth in Balochistan remained slow in line with the [[Cinema of Pakistan#Decline of cinema theatres|stagnant growth]] of Pakistan's film industry.&lt;ref name="CITEREFCinemaThreatreDecline"/&gt; An uncertain security situation further led to nearly half of Quetta's cinema houses facing closure by 2010.&lt;ref name="Mastoi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/53273/cinemas-in-quetta-face-extinction/|title=Cinemas in Quetta face extinction|work=The Express Tribune|date=22 September 2010|accessdate=27 August 2016|first=Irshad|last=Mastoi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of films via Blu-rays, DVDs, VCRs and cable networks has also hampered the cinema-going trend.&lt;ref name="Mastoi"/&gt;

==Re-emergence==

In recent years, a younger generation of Baloch filmmakers has emerged in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and [[Karachi]], as part of the new wave of Pakistani cinema. This phase has witnessed the production of quality short films as well as documentaries focusing on social and political issues, such as ''Ich Gushgi Nahe'' (Keep Silent) in 2007.&lt;ref name="Rehman"/&gt; In 2013, ''The Line of Freedom'', a short film based on Balochistan's [[Human rights violations in Balochistan|human rights situation]], was produced by Noordin Mengal, Bhawal Mengal and David Whitney, starring British and Baloch actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/634257-film-on-balochistan-to-shed-light-on-%E2%80%98dirty-war%E2%80%99|title=Film on Balochistan to shed light on ‘dirty war’|work=The News|date=14 November 2013|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Lyari Film Festival was held in Karachi's [[Lyari]] neighbourhood, which is famous for its Baloch community. Several Balochi short films were screened at the event.&lt;ref name="Rehman"/&gt; The Nosach Films Academy, which organised the event, provides support to Balochi filmmakers in Lyari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/764876/calling-the-curtain-on-lyari-film-festival/|title=Calling the curtain on Lyari Film Festival|work=Express Tribune|first=Hasan|last=Ansari|date=21 September 2014|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Ahsan Shah's ''Jaawar'' (Ongoing Situation), which focuses on the Lyari gang war, won the first prize at [[Bahrain]]'s International Youth Creativity Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1101456/lyari-filmmaker-wins-first-prize-at-bahrains-international-youth-creativity-awards/|title=Lyari filmmaker wins first prize at Bahrain's International Youth Creativity Awards|work=The Express Tribune|date=11 May 2016|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, ''Sawaad'' (Ocean) was screened at the [[Lok Virsa Museum]] in Islamabad.&lt;ref name="DP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailythepatriot.com/films-best-way-to-promote-native-languages-says-dr-fauzia/|title=Films best way to promote native languages says Dr Fauzia|work=The Patriot|date=20 February 2016|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An upcoming filmmaker is Haneef Shareef, who has directed popular hits such as ''Balaach'', ''Manzil'', ''Mani Pethaa Braath Nesth'' and ''Kareem'' from 2009 to 2014.&lt;ref name="BV"/&gt; Other recent Balochi films include ''Jageen'', ''Ganjen Gwadar'', ''Rahdarbar'', ''Aadenk'', ''Zoorak'', ''Betach'', ''Drandeh'', ''Karwaan'', ''Hankain'', ''Maath'', ''Bemuraad'', ''Begowaah'', ''Pendok 2'' and ''Showanag''.&lt;ref name="BV"/&gt;

Balochistan has served as a filming location or subject of portrayal in multiple [[Lollywood|Urdu films]], television serials and documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1186346|title=5 things you need to know about Jami's upcoming film Moor|work=Dawn|date=6 June 2015|accessdate=27 August 2016|first=Mehreen|last=Hasan}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been foreign documentaries made on the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2012/01/2012121372863878.html|title=Balochistan: Pakistan's other war|work=Al Jazeera|date=9 January 2012|accessdate=28 August 2016|first=Ahmad|last=Zaidan}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2002, there were 8 main theatres in [[Quetta]] and a few in [[Makran]], [[Sibi]], [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]] and [[Zhob]].&lt;ref name="CITEREFCinemaThreatreDecline"/&gt; Quetta's 3D Weplex Pak Force Cinema, opened in 2016, currently features the largest [[curved screen]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="ET2"/&gt; Other popular single-screen cinemas in the city are Paradise, Imdad and Delight.&lt;ref name="ET2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1053458/quettas-first-multiplex-to-have-the-biggest-curved-screen-in-pakistan/|title=Quetta’s first multiplex to have the biggest curved screen in Pakistan|work=The Express Tribune|date=24 February 2016|accessdate=27 August 2016|first=Hasan|last=Ansari}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newslens.pk/in-quetta-terrorism-and-extremism-take-a-heavy-toll-on-cinema-industry/|title=In Quetta, terrorism and extremism take a heavy toll on cinema industry|first=Abdul Malik|last=Achakzai|work=News Lens|date=16 December 2015|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iran, Balochi theatre is in its infancy stage and is concentrated mainly in [[Zahedan]], [[Iranshahr (city)|Iranshahr]], and [[Khash, Iran|Khash]]. As of 2008, Zahedan-based Honorkadeh Saba was the sole cultural institution promoting Balochi cinema and theatre.&lt;ref name="Taheri"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Baloch in Post Islamic Revolution Iran: A Political Study|first=Ahmad Reza|last=Taheri|publisher=Lulu|isbn=9780557328376|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sangat'' by Sami Sarang was Pakistan's first Balochi film released after decades in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://images.dawn.com/news/1178141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/pakistani-film-experiencing-revival-170201082653391.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Byzantine architecture''' ({{lang-el|Βυζαντινή αρχιτεκτονική}}) is the [[architecture]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]], also known as the Later Roman or Eastern Roman Empire. The [[Byzantine Era|Byzantine era]] is the period after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. [[Constantinople]] became known as the Roman capital in 330 AD. Constantinople is what is now present day [[Istanbul]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Byzantine architecture was mostly influenced by [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greek]] architecture.  It began with [[Constantine the Great]] when he rebuilt the city of [[Byzantium]] and named it Constantinople&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orderofconstantinethegreat.com/constantine_the_great.htm|title=Constantine the Great &amp; The Byzantine Empire|website=www.orderofconstantinethegreat.com|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued with his building of churches &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/medieval-world/early-christian1/a/early-christian-art-and-architecture-after-constantine|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Forum of Constantine|the forum of Constantine]], as also the [[Church of St. George, Sofia]] in the rebuild city of [[Serdica]], present day [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. This terminology is used by modern historians to designate the medieval [[Roman Empire]] as it evolved as a distinct artistic and cultural entity centered on the new capital of [[Constantinople]] rather than the city of [[Rome]] and environs. The empire endured for more than a [[millennium]]. Its architecture dramatically influenced the later [[medieval architecture]] throughout Europe and the Near East, and became the primary progenitor of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] architectural traditions that followed its collapse.

==Overview of extant monuments==
Early Byzantine architecture drew upon earlier elements of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]]. [[Timeline of architectural styles|Stylistic drift]], [[pendentive|technological advancement]], and [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|political]] and territorial changes meant that a distinct style gradually resulted in the [[Cross-in-square|Greek cross]] plan in [[church architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1365642/Byzantine-architecture|title=Byzantine architecture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buildings increased in geometric [[Cruciform|complexity]], [[brick]] and plaster were used in addition to [[Rock (geology)|stone]] in the decoration of important public structures, [[classical orders]] were used more freely, [[mosaic]]s replaced carved decoration, complex [[dome]]s rested upon massive [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], and windows filtered light through thin sheets of [[alabaster]] to softly illuminate interiors.  Most of the surviving structures are sacred in nature, with secular buildings mostly known only through contemporaneous descriptions.

===Early architecture===
[[File:SantApollininner.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[basilica]] of [[Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] in [[Ravenna]] (6th century)]]
Prime examples of early Byzantine architecture date from the Emperor [[Justinian I]]'s reign and survive in [[Ravenna]] and Istanbul, as well as in [[Sofia]] (the [[Church of St Sophia, Sofia|Church of St Sophia]]). [[File:Basilica of Hagia Sofia, Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Saint Sofia Church, Sofia]] One of the great breakthroughs in the history of Western architecture occurred when Justinian's architects invented a complex system providing for a smooth transition from a square plan of the church to a circular dome (or domes) by means of [[pendentive]]s.

In Ravenna, the longitudinal [[basilica]] of [[Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]], and the octagonal, centralized structure of the church of [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]], commissioned by Emperor Justinian but never seen by him, was built. Justinian's monuments in Istanbul include the domed churches of [[Hagia Sophia]] and [[Hagia Irene]], but there is also an earlier, smaller church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (locally referred to as "[[Little Hagia Sophia]]"), which might have served as a model for both in that it combined the elements of a longitudinal basilica with those of a centralized building.

[[File:Millingen H Eirene section.svg|thumb|The 6th-century church of [[Hagia Irene]] in [[Istanbul]] was substantially rebuilt after an earthquake in the 8th century.]]

Secular structures include the ruins of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]], the innovative [[walls of Constantinople]] (with 192 towers) and [[Basilica Cistern]] (with hundreds of recycled classical columns). A [[frieze]] in the [[Ostrogoth]]ic palace in Ravenna depicts an early Byzantine palace.

[[Hagios Demetrios]] in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]], [[Jvari (monastery)|Jvari Monastery]] in present-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and three [[Armenia]]n churches of [[Echmiadzin]] all date primarily from the 7th century and provide a glimpse on architectural developments in the Byzantine provinces following the age of Justinian.

Remarkable engineering feats include the 430 m long [[Sangarius Bridge]] and the pointed arch of [[Karamagara Bridge]].

The period of the [[Macedonian dynasty]], traditionally considered the epitome of Byzantine art, has not left a lasting legacy in architecture. It is presumed that [[Basil I]]'s votive church of the [[Theotokos of the Pharos]] and the ''[[Nea Ekklesia]]'' (both no longer existent) served as a model for most [[cross-in-square]] sanctuaries of the period, including the [[Cattolica di Stilo]] in southern Italy (9th century), the monastery church of [[Hosios Lukas]] in Greece (c. 1000), [[Nea Moni of Chios]] (a pet project of [[Constantine IX]]), and the [[Daphni Monastery]] near [[Athens]] (c. 1050).

[[File:20090803 hosiosloukas36.jpg|thumb|220px|External view of the 11th-century monastery of [[Hosios Loukas]] in Greece. It is representative of the Byzantine art during the rule of the [[Macedonian dynasty]] ([[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]])]]

[[File:St Sophia (Ohrid).jpg|thumb|left|300px||Rear courtyard of [[Church of St. Sophia, Ohrid]]]]
The cross-in-square type also became predominant in the Slavic countries which were Christianized by Salonikas missionaries during the Macedonian period. The [[Church of St. Sophia, Ohrid|Hagia Sophia church]] in [[Ochrid]] (present-day [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], build during the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]), and the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|eponymous cathedral]] in [[Kiev]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]) testify to a vogue for multiple subsidiary domes set on drums, which would gain in height and narrowness with the progress of time.

===Comnenian and Paleologan periods===
In Istanbul and [[Asia Minor]] the architecture of the [[Komnenian period]] is almost non-existent, with the notable exceptions of the Elmali Kilise and other rock sanctuaries of [[Cappadocia]], and of the Churches of the [[Church of the Pantokrator (Constantinople)|Pantokrator]] and of the [[Kalenderhane Mosque|Theotokos Kyriotissa]] in Istanbul. Most examples of this architectural style and many of the other older Byzantine styles only survive on the outskirts of the Byzantine world, as most of the most significant and ancient churches/ buildings were in Asia Minor, but unfortunately in [[World War I]]  almost all churches that ended up within Turkish borders were destroyed,converted into mosques, or abandoned in the [[Greek genocide|Greek and Christian genocides]] spanning from 1915–1923. Only national forms of architecture can be found in abundance due to this. Those styles can be found in many [[Transcaucasia]]n countries; such as [[Russia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]]  and other Slavic lands; and also in [[Sicily]] ([[Cappella Palatina]]) and [[Veneto]] ([[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Torcello Cathedral]]).

The [[Paleologus|Paleologan]] period is well represented in a dozen former churches in Istanbul, notably [[Chora Church|St Saviour at Chora]] and [[Pammakaristos Church|St Mary Pammakaristos]]. Unlike their Slavic counterparts, the Paleologan architects never accented the vertical thrust of structures. As a result, there is little grandeur in the late medieval architecture of Byzantium (barring the [[Hagia Sophia, Trabzon|Hagia Sophia]] of [[Trabzon|Trebizond]]).

The [[Church of the Holy Apostles (Thessaloniki)]] is often cited as an archetypal structure of the late period, when the exterior walls were intricately decorated with complex brickwork patterns or with glazed ceramics. Other churches from the years immediately predating the fall of Constantinople survive on [[Mount Athos]] and in [[Mistra]] (e.g. [[Brontochion Monastery]]).

==Structural evolution==
As early as the building of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine's]] churches in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] there were two chief types of plan in use: the [[basilica]]n, or axial, type, represented by the basilica at the [[Holy Sepulchre]], and the circular, or central, type, represented by the great octagonal church once at [[Antioch]]. 
[[Image:StGeorgeRotundaSofia.JPG|thumb|left|300px|The St. George Rotunda; some remains of Serdica can be seen in the foreground]]
Those of the latter type we must suppose were nearly always [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]], for a central [[dome]] would seem to furnish their very raison d'etre. The central space was sometimes surrounded by a very thick wall, in which deep recesses, to the interior, were formed, as at [[Church of St. George, Sofia]], build by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the 4th century as a cylindrical domed structure built on a square base, and the noble [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda#Rotunda of Galerius|Church of Saint George]], [[Thessaloniki]] (5th century), or by a vaulted aisle, as at [[Santa Costanza]], [[Rome]] (4th century); or annexes were thrown out from the central space in such a way as to form a cross, in which these additions helped to counterpoise the central vault, as at the [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]], [[Ravenna]] (5th century). The most famous church of this type was that of the [[Church of the Holy Apostles|Holy Apostles, Constantinople]]. Vaults appear to have been early applied to the basilican type of plan; for instance, at [[Hagia Irene]], [[Constantinople]] (6th century), the long body of the church is covered by two domes.

[[File:Hagia Sophia Interior Dome.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Interior of the [[Hagia Sophia]] under renovation, showing many features of the grandest Byzantine architecture.]]

At [[Little Hagia Sophia|Saint Sergius]], Constantinople, and San Vitale, Ravenna, churches of the central type, the space under the dome was enlarged by having apsidal additions made to the octagon. Finally, at [[Hagia Sophia]] (6th century) a combination was made which is perhaps the most remarkable piece of planning ever contrived. A central space of 100&amp;nbsp;ft (30 m) square is increased to 200&amp;nbsp;ft (60 m) in length by adding two [[hemicycle]]s to it to the east and the west; these are again extended by pushing out three minor apses eastward, and two others, one on either side of a straight extension, to the west. This unbroken area, about 260&amp;nbsp;ft (80 m) long, the larger part of which is over 100&amp;nbsp;ft (30 m) wide, is entirely covered by a system of domical surfaces. Above the [[conch]]s of the small [[apse]]s rise the two great [[semi-dome]]s which cover the hemicycles, and between these bursts out the vast dome over the central square. On the two sides, to the north and south of the dome, it is supported by vaulted aisles in two storeys which bring the exterior form to a general square.

[[File:Hagia Eirene Constantinople 2007.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The apse of the church with cross at [[Hagia Irene]]. Nearly all the decorative surfaces in the church have been lost.]]

At the Holy Apostles (6th century) five domes were applied to a cruciform plan; the central dome was the highest. After the 6th century there were no churches built which in any way competed in scale with these great works of Justinian, and the plans more or less tended to approximate to one type. The central area covered by the dome was included in a considerably larger square, of which the four divisions, to the east, west, north and south, were carried up higher in the vaulting and roof system than the four corners, forming in this way a sort of [[nave]] and [[transept]]s. Sometimes the central space was square, sometimes octagonal, or at least there were eight piers supporting the dome instead of four, and the nave and transepts were narrower in proportion.

If we draw a square and divide each side into three so that the middle parts are greater than the others, and then divide the area into nine from these points, we approximate to the typical setting out of a plan of this time. Now add three apses on the east side opening from the three divisions, and opposite to the west put a narrow entrance porch running right across the front. Still in front put a square court. The court is the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] and usually has a [[fountain]] in the middle under a [[canopy (building)|canopy]] resting on pillars. The entrance porch is the ''[[narthex]]''. Directly under the center of the dome is the ''[[Ambon (liturgy)|ambo]]'', from which the Scriptures were proclaimed, and beneath the ambo at floor level was the place for the choir of singers. Across the eastern side of the central square was a screen which divided off the ''bema'', where the altar was situated, from the body of the church; this screen, bearing images, is the ''[[iconostasis]]''. The [[altar]] was protected by a canopy or ''[[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]]'' resting on pillars. Rows of rising seats around the curve of the apse with the [[patriarch]]'s throne at the middle eastern point formed the synthronon. The two smaller compartments and apses at the sides of the bema were sacristies, the ''[[diaconicon]]'' and ''[[prothesis (liturgy)|prothesis]]''. The ambo and bema were connected by the ''solea'', a raised walkway enclosed by a railing or low wall.
&lt;!--
[[File:pammakaristos.gif|thumb|250px|The 14th-century church of St Mary Pammakaristos is a characteristic sample of the [[Palaiologoi]] architecture]]--&gt;

The continuous influence from the East is strangely shown in the fashion of decorating external [[brick]] walls of churches built about the 12th century, in which bricks roughly carved into form are set up so as to make bands of ornamentation which it is quite clear are imitated from Cufic writing. This fashion was associated with the disposition of the exterior brick and stone work generally into many varieties of pattern, zig-zags, key-patterns etc.; and, as similar decoration is found in many Persian buildings, it is probable that this custom also was derived from the East. The domes and vaults to the exterior were covered with [[lead]] or with tiling of the Roman variety. The window and door frames were of [[marble]]. The interior surfaces were adorned all over by [[mosaic]]s or [[fresco]]es in the higher parts of the edifice, and below with incrustations of marble slabs, which were frequently of very beautiful varieties, and disposed so that, although in one surface, the coloring formed a series of large panels. The better marbles were [[bookmatched|opened out]] so that the two surfaces produced by the division formed a symmetrical pattern resembling somewhat the marking of skins of beasts.

{{Byzantine culture}}

===In the West===
Ultimately, Byzantine architecture in the West gave a way to [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]], [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], and [[Gothic architecture]].  But a great part of current Italy used to belong to the Byzantine Empire before that. Great examples of Byzantine architecture are still visible in Ravenna (for example Basilica di [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]] which architecture influenced the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] of Charlemagne).

===In the East===
[[File:Dongola Throne Hall.jpg|thumb|The 9th century [[Throne Hall of Dongola]] in [[Sudan]] was heavily influenced by Byzantine architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Godlewski |first=Włodzimierz |year=2013 |title=Dongola-ancient Tungul. Archaeological guide |publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw |url=https://pcma.uw.edu.pl/wp-content/uploads/template/main/file/Dongola_guide/Dongola_guide_book.pdf |isbn=978-83-903796-6-1 |page=12 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the East, Byzantine architectural tradition exerted a profound influence on early [[Islamic architecture]]. During the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] era (661-750), as far as the Byzantine impact on early Islamic architecture is concerned, the Byzantine artistic heritage formed a fundamental source to the new Islamic art, especially in Syria and Palestine. There are considerable Byzantine influences which can be detected in the distinctive early Islamic monuments in Syria and Palestine, as on the [[Dome of the Rock]] (691) at Jerusalem, the [[Umayyad Mosque]] (709–715) at Damascus. While the Dome of the Rock gives clear reference in plan - and partially in decoration - to Byzantine art, the plan of the Umayyad Mosque has also a remarkable similarity with 6th- and 7th-century Christian basilicas, but it has been modified and expanded on the transversal axis and not on the normal longitudinal axis as in the Christian basilicas. This modification serves better the liturgy for the Islamic prayer. The original mihrab of the mosque is located almost in the middle of the eastern part of the qibla wall and not in its middle, a feature which can be explained by the fact that the architect might have tried to avoid the impression of a Christian apse which would result from the placement of the mihrab in the middle of the transept. The tile work, geometric patterns, multiple arches, domes, and polychrome brick and stone work that characterize Islamic and [[Moorish architecture]] were influenced to some extent by Byzantine architecture.

===Post-Byzantine architecture in Eastern Orthodox countries===
In [[Bulgaria]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], and other Orthodox countries the Byzantine architecture persisted even longer, from the 16th up to the 18th centuries, giving birth to local post-Byzantine schools of architecture.

===Neo-Byzantine architecture===
{{main article|Neo-Byzantine architecture}}
[[Neo-Byzantine architecture]] had a small following in the wake of the 19th-century [[Gothic revival]], resulting in such jewels as [[Westminster Cathedral]] in [[London]], and in [[Bristol]] from about 1850 to 1880 a related style known as [[Bristol Byzantine]] was popular for industrial buildings which combined elements of the Byzantine style with Moorish architecture. It was developed on a wide-scale basis in [[Russia]] during the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&amp;nbsp;II]] by [[Grigory Gagarin]] and his followers who designed [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] in Kiev, [[:Image:Kronstadt Naval Cathedral 1.jpg|St Nicholas Naval Cathedral]] in [[Kronstadt]], [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia]], [[St. Mark's Church, Belgrade|Saint Mark's church]] in [[Belgrade]] and the [[New Athos Monastery]] in [[New Athos]] near [[Sukhumi]]. The largest Neo-Byzantine project of the 20th century was the [[Temple of Saint Sava]] in [[Belgrade]].

== Important Byzantine Monuments ==

=== Hagia Irene ===
[[File:Hagia Irene exterior.JPG|thumb|Exterior view of [[Hagia Irene]].]]
One of the less famous Byzantine churches is [[Hagia Irene]]. This church served as a model church for the more famous church, Hagia Sophia. Construction on the church began in the 4th century. This was the first church that was built in Constantinople, but due to its location, it was severely damaged by earthquakes and the Nika riots, and required repair several times. The Hagia Irene is defined by its large atrium, and is in fact the only surviving building of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to have such a feature&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-01-01|title=The Unique Construction of the Church of Hagia Irene in Istanbul for The Teaching of Byzantine Architecture|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187770581632999X|journal=Procedia Engineering|language=en|volume=161|pages=1745–1750|doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2016.08.770|issn=1877-7058}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Construction ====
Hagia Irene is composed mainly of three materials: stone, brick, and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Bricks 70 cm x 35 cm x 5 cm were used, and these bricks were glued together using mortar approximately 5 cm thick. The building materials chosen for construction of the church had to be lightweight, durable, and strong. Volcanic materials were chosen for this purpose, as volcanic concrete is very light and durable. Perhaps the most definite feature of the Hagia Irene is the strict contrast between the interior and exterior design. While the plain outside composed of stone and brick favors functionality, the interior is decorated in elaborate mosaics, decorative marble, and, in some places, covered in plaster. Another important characteristic of the church include two domes that follow one behind another, the first being a lower oval, and the second being a higher semi-circle&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==== History of Hagia Irene ====
Throughout history Hagia Irene has undergone several changes. There were multiple repairs due to the Nika riots and earthquakes. When the Ottomans took over Hagia Irene they repurposed it and made a few changes, but none as drastic as what was done to Hagia Sophia&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Today, Hagia Irene is still standing and open to visitors as a museum. It is open everyday, except for Tuesdays&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://topkapisarayi.gov.tr/en/hagia-irene-museum-opened|title=Hagia Irene Museum Opened {{!}} Topkapı Palace Museum Official Web Site|website=topkapisarayi.gov.tr|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Hagia Sophia ===
The most famous example of Byzantine architecture is [[Hagia Sophia]]. The Hagia Sophia held the title of largest church in the world until the Ottoman Empire sieged the Byzantine capital. After the fall of Constantinople, the church was converted into a mosque and was used for religious services until 1931, until it was reopened as a museum in 1935.Translated from [[Greek language|Greek]], the name Hagia Sophia means "Sacred Wisdom"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/a-monumental-struggle-to-preserve-hagia-sophia-92038218/|title=A Monumental Struggle to Preserve Hagia Sophia|last=Bordewich|first=Fergus M.|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Construction of Hagia Sophia ====
[[File:Hagia Sophia February 2013 02.jpg|thumb|Exterior view of Hagia Sophia]]
The construction is a combination of longitudinal and central structures. This church was apart of a larger complex of buildings created by Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]]. This style influenced the construction of several other buildings, such as [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] cathedral. Hagia Sophia should have been built to withstand earthquakes, but since the construction of Hagia Sophia was rushed this technology was not implemented in the design, which is why the building has had to be repaired so many times due to damages from the earthquakes. The dome is the key feature of Hagia Sophia as the domed basilica is representative of Byzantine architecture. Both of the domes collapsed at different times throughout history due to earthquakes and had to be rebuilt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-01-01|title=Disorders of the Building and its Remediation - Hagia Sophia, Turkey the Most the Byzantine Building|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705816330600|journal=Procedia Engineering|language=en|volume=161|pages=2259–2264|doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2016.08.825|issn=1877-7058}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== History of Hagia Sophia ====
The original construction of Hagia Sophia was ordered by Emperor Constatine I in 360. His building of churches, specifically Hagia Sophia, was considered an incredibly significant component in his shift of the centralization of power from Rome in the East to Constantinople in the West, and was considered the high-point of religious and political celebration. The construction of the final version of Hagia Sophia, which still stands today, was overseen by Emperor Justinian. Between the rule of these two Emperors, Hagia Sophia was destroyed and rebuilt twice. Following its reconstruction, Hagia Sophia was considered the center of Orthodox Christianity for 900 years, until the conquest of Constantinople by the [[Ottomans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Andrew|date=2011|title=Architecture in Religion: The History of the Hagia Sophia and Proposals For Returning It To Worship|url=https://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=3586&amp;context=etd|journal=FIU Electronic Theses and Dissertations|volume=DOI: 10.25148/etd.FI14060867|pages=2-3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''coat of arms of Romania''' was adopted in the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]] on 10 September 1992 as a representative coat of arms for [[Romania]]. It is based on the Lesser Coat of Arms of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] (used between 1922 and 1947), redesigned by Victor Dima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://adevarul.ro/news/eveniment/creatorul-stemei-romaniei-drepturi-autor-1_50ace7ce7c42d5a6638b97be/index.html|title=Creatorul stemei României, fără drepturi de autor|publisher=[[Adevărul]]|date=27 February 2010|accessdate=23 June 2016|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a central element, it shows a golden [[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]] holding a cross in its beak, and a [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] and a [[sword]] in its claws. It also consists of the three colors (red, yellow, and blue) which represent the colors of the [[Flag of Romania|national flag]]. The coat of arms was augmented on 11 July 2016 to add a representation of the [[Steel Crown of Romania]].

==History==
{{main|Romanian heraldry}}

The idea behind the design of the coat of arms of [[Romania]] dates from 1859, when the two Romanian countries, [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], united under [[Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza]]. Then the two heraldic symbols, the [[eagle (heraldry)|golden aquila]] and the [[aurochs]], were officially juxtaposed.

Until 1866, there were many variants of the coat of arms, regarding the background color and the number of times the two main elements where represented. In 1866, after [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] was elected Prince of Romania, the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] was divided into quarters: in the first and fourth an [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] was depicted, and in the second and third the [[aurochs]]; above the shield the arms of the reigning [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] family was placed. After 1872, the coat of arms included the symbol of southern [[Bessarabia]] (after 1877, of [[Dobruja]]), two [[dolphin]]s, in the fourth quarter; and the one of [[Oltenia]], a [[Lion (heraldry)|golden lion]], in the third quarter; on the shield the [[Steel Crown of Romania|Steel Crown]] was placed, as a symbol of sovereignty and independence, after the [[Romanian War of Independence]].

[[File:Kingdom of Romania - Big CoA.svg|280px|thumb|right|'''The greater coat of arms''' of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] (1922{{ndash}}1947) was displayed at the center of the war and battle flags]]
The coat of arms remained unchanged until 1922, after [[World War I]], when [[Transylvania]] was united with the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. Then the coat of arms of [[Transylvania]] was placed in the fourth quarter, with the [[Turul]] replaced by a black aquila,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} the third quarter depicted the joined coats of arms of [[Banat]] and [[Oltenia]] (the [[bridge]] of [[Apollodorus of Damascus]] and a [[Lion (heraldry)|golden lion]] respectively), and the coat of arms of [[Dobruja]] was placed in an insertion. The shield was placed on the chest of a [[Eagle (heraldry)|golden crossed and crowned aquila]], as a symbol of the Latinity of the [[Romanians]]. The [[Eagle (heraldry)|aquila]] was placed on a [[Azure (heraldry)|blue]] shield, capped with the [[Steel Crown of Romania|Steel Crown]]. The coat of arms had three versions: lesser, middle (with [[supporters]] and motto), and greater (the middle arms on a [[Gules|red]] mantle lined with [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]]).

After 1948, the [[Communist Romania|Communist authorities]] changed both the [[Flag of Romania|flag]] and the coat of arms. The coat of arms was rather an emblem, [[Socialist heraldry|faithful to the Communist pattern]]: a landscape (depicting a rising sun, a tractor and an oil drill) surrounded by stocks of wheat tied together with a cloth in the colors of the [[Flag of Romania|national flag]]. Until 1989, there were four variants, the first being changed shortly after 1948 (the proclamation of the republic), again changed in 1956 (a red star was added), and finally in 1966, when Romania ceased to be a ''People's Republic'' and became a ''Socialist Republic''.

Immediately after the [[Romanian Revolution|1989 Revolution]], the idea came up of giving Romania a new, representative coat of arms. In fact, the very symbol of the Revolution was the flag with a hole in its middle where the communist coat of arms had been cut out.

The heraldic commission set up to design a new coat of arms for Romania worked intensely, subjecting to the [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] two final designs which were then combined. What emerged is the current design adopted by the [[Bicameralism|two chambers]] of the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]] in their [[joint session]] on September 10, 1992.

In April 2016, deputies of the Judiciary Committee endorsed a bill voted previously by the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/actualitate/senatul-a-aprobat-modificarea-stemei-romaniei-cum-va-arata-noul-simbol.html|title=Senatul a aprobat modificarea stemei Romaniei.

==Description==
{{Symbols of Romania}}

The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] surmounting the eagle is divided into five fields, one for each historical province of Romania with its traditional symbol:

* golden [[eagle (heraldry)|aquila]] - [[Wallachia]] (''Muntenia'')
* [[aurochs]] - [[Moldavia]] (''Moldova'') and [[Bukovina]] (''Bucovina'')
* [[dolphin]]s - Seaside: [[Bessarabia]]/[[Budjak]] (1867{{ndash}}1878) and [[Dobruja]] (after 1878)
* a black aquila, seven castles, a sun and a moon - [[Transylvania]] (''Transilvania''), [[Maramureș]] and  [[Crișana]]
* [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] and [[Trajan]]'s [[bridge]] - [[Oltenia]] and the [[Banat]]

[[Romania]]’s coat of arms has as a central element the golden aquila holding an Orthodox cross. Traditionally, this eagle appears in the arms of the [[Argeș county]], the town of [[Pitești]] and the town of [[Curtea de Argeș]]. It stands for the “nest of the Basarabs”, the nucleus around which Wallachia was organised.

Since July 11, 2016 the coat of arms has been altered to include the heraldic representation of the [[Steel Crown of Romania|Steel Crown]] of [[Carol I of Romania|King Carol]]. A symbol of its royal past and a token for the period during 1881 and 1947 when Romania was de facto and de jure a monarchy, ruled by the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen house through its Romanian branch, founded by Carol. 

The aquila, being the symbol of Latinity and a heraldic bird of the first order, symbolises courage, determination, the soaring toward great heights, power, grandeur. It is to be found also in Transylvania’s coat of arms.

The shield on which it is placed is [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], symbolising the sky. The eagle holds in its talons the insignia of sovereignty: a mace and a sword, the latter reminding of [[Moldavia]]’s ruler, [[Stephen the Great]] whereas the mace reminds of [[Michael the Brave]], the first unifier of the Romanian Countries. On the bird’s chest there is a quartered escutcheon with the symbols of the historical Romanian provinces (Wallachia, Oltenia, Moldavia, Bessarabia, Transylvania, the Banat, Crisana, Maramureș) as well as two dolphins reminding of the country’s Black Sea Coast (Dobruja).

In the first quarter, Wallachia’s coat of arms, an aquila or holding in its beak a golden [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] cross, accompanied by a golden sun on the right and a golden new moon on the left, is displayed against an azure background.

In the second quarter, Moldavia’s traditional coat of arms is shown, gules: an aurochs head sable with a mullet of or between its horns, a cinquefoil rose on the dexter and a waning crescent on the sinister, both argent.

The third quarter features the traditional coat of arms of the Banat and Oltenia, gules: over waves, a golden bridge with two arched openings (symbolising [[Roman Emperors|Roman emperor]] [[Trajan]]’s bridge over the [[Danube]]), wherefrom comes a golden lion holding a broadsword in its right forepaw.

The fourth quarter shows the coat of arms of Transylvania, Maramureș and Crișana: a shield parted by a narrow fesse, gules; in the chief, on azure, there is a black aquila with golden beak coming out of the fesse, accompanied by a golden sun on the dexter and a crescent argent on the sinister (symbolizing the [[Székely]]s); on the base, on or, there are seven crenellated towers, placed four and three (symbolizing the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]]s).

Also represented are the lands adjacent to the Black Sea(Dobruja), on azure: two dolphins affronts, head down.

'''Hans Conrad Schumann''' (March 28, 1942 – June 20, 1998) was an [[East Germany|East German]] soldier who defected to [[West Germany]] during the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961.

==Early life==
Born in Zschochau, Saxony during the middle of [[World War II]], Schumann enlisted in the East German [[Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft|Bereitschaftspolizei]] (state police) following his 18th birthday. After three months' training in [[Dresden]], he was posted to a non-commissioned officers' college in [[Potsdam]], after which he volunteered for service in [[Berlin]].

==Defection to West Germany==
On 15 August 1961, the 19-year-old Schumann was sent to the corner of Ruppiner Straße and [[Bernauer Straße]] to guard the Berlin Wall on its third day of construction. At that time and place, the wall was only a single coil of [[concertina wire]]. From the other side, West Germans shouted to him, "''Komm' rüber!''" ("Come over!"), and a police car pulled up to wait for him. Schumann jumped over the barbed wire while dropping his [[PPSh-41]] submachine gun and was promptly driven away from the scene by the West Berlin police. West German photographer [[Peter Leibing]] photographed Schumann's escape. His picture has since become an iconic image of the [[Cold War]] era and featured at the beginning of the 1982 Disney film ''[[Night Crossing]]''. The scene, including Schumann's preparations, has also been filmed on 16-mm film from the same perspective.

Schumann was later permitted to travel from West Berlin to the main territory of [[West Germany]], where he settled in [[Bavaria]]. In 1962, he met and married his wife Kunigunde (Gunda) in the town of [[Günzburg]], whom he later had a son with in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;CONRAD SCHUMANN, 56, SYMBOL OF E. BERLIN ESCAPES; [NORTH SPORTS FINAL Edition]

==Later life and death==

[[File:SarahEwart-094.JPG|thumb|Schumann inspired graffiti on the [[East Side Gallery]]]]
After the fall of the Berlin Wall he said, "Only since 9 November 1989 [the date of the fall] have I felt truly free." Even so, he continued to feel more at home in Bavaria than in his birthplace, citing old frictions with his former colleagues, and was even hesitant to visit his parents and siblings in [[Saxony]]. On 20 June 1998, suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], he committed [[suicide]], [[hanging]] himself in his orchard near the town of [[Kipfenberg]] in [[Upper Bavaria]]. His body was found by his wife a few hours later.&lt;ref&gt;"Escaped soldier found hanged"
DENIS STAUNTON. The Guardian. Manchester (UK): Jun 22, 1998. p. K2&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the photograph of Schumann's "leap into freedom" was inducted into the [[UNESCO]] Memory of the World programme as part of a collection of documents on the fall of the Berlin Wall.&lt;ref&gt;Diekmann, Kai. ''Die Mauer. Fakten, Bilder, Schicksale''.

==Monument==
A sculpture called ''Mauerspringer'' ("Walljumper") by Florian and Michael Brauer and Edward Anders could be seen close to the site of the defection,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/picturesoftheday/5939092/Pictures-of-the-day-30-July-2009.html?image=27 "Pictures of the day: 30 July 2009" ''The Telegraph'' (UK): Jul 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; but has since been moved to the side of a building on Brunnenstraße, several meters south of Bernauer Straße.

'''Contemporary dance''' is a genre of [[Concert dance|dance performance]] that developed during the mid twentieth century and has since grown to become one of the dominant genres for formally trained dancers throughout the world, with particularly strong popularity in the U.S. and Europe. Although originally informed by and borrowing from [[classical dance|classical]], [[modern dance|modern]], and [[Jazz dance|jazz]] styles, it has since come to incorporate elements from many styles of dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concordia University Contemporary Dance Program|url=https://www.concordia.ca/programs-and-courses/undergraduate-programs/a-z-subject-list/bfa_contemporarydance.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its technical similarities, it is often perceived to be closely related to modern dance, ballet, and other classical concert dance styles.

In terms of the focus of its technique, contemporary dance tends to combine the strong but controlled legwork of ballet with modern that stresses on torso. It also employs contract-release, [[floor work]], fall and recovery, and improvisation characteristics of modern dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheff|first=Helene |author2=Marty Sprague |author3=Susan McGreevy-Nichols |title=Exploring dance forms and styles: a guide to concert, world, social, and historical dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phJqR8gMWRUC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22Contemporary+dance%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Contemporary%20dance%22&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=0-7360-8023-6|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unpredictable changes in rhythm, speed, and direction are often used, as well. Additionally, contemporary dance sometimes incorporates elements of non-western dance cultures, such as elements from African dance including bent knees, or movements from the Japanese contemporary dance, [[Butoh]].&lt;ref name=Origins&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins of Contemporary Dance|url=http://dance.lovetoknow.com/Origins_of_Contemporary_Dance|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Contemporary&gt;{{cite web|title=Contemporary Dance History|url=http://www.contemporary-dance.org/contemporary-dance-history.html|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|Modern dance}}
[[File:ATERBalletto.jpg|thumb|222px|Contemporary dance performed by Le Sacre]]
Contemporary dance draws on both classical ballet and modern dance, whereas [[postmodern dance]] was a direct and opposite response to modern dance. [[Merce Cunningham]] is considered to be the first choreographer to "develop an independent attitude towards modern dance" and defy the ideas that were established by it.&lt;ref name="Contemporary"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Modern&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Dance Pioneers|url=http://www.groovygames.com/hinge/writing/articles/Beginner%27s%20Guide%204.htm|accessdate=28 February 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 Cunningham accompanied his dance with music by [[John Cage]], who observed that Cunningham's dance "no longer relies on linear elements (...) nor does it rely on a movement towards and away from climax. As in [[abstract painting]], it is assumed that an element (a movement, a [[sound]], a change of light) is in and of itself expressive; what it communicates is in large part determined by the observer themselves." Cunningham formed the [[Merce Cunningham Dance Company]] in 1953 and went on to create more than one hundred and fifty works for the company, many of which have been performed internationally by ballet and modern [[dance companies]].

==Cunningham's key ideas==
Cunningham's key ideas include:
* Contemporary dance does refuse the classical ballet's leg technique in favor of modern dance's stress on the torso
* Contemporary dance is not necessarily [[narrative]] form of art
* Choreography that appears disordered, but nevertheless relies on technique
* Unpredictable changes in rhythm, speed, and direction 
* Multiple and simultaneous actions
* Suspension of perspective and symmetry in ballet scenic frame perspective such as front, center, and hierarchies
* Creative freedom
* "Independence between dance and music"
* Dance to be danced, not analyzed
* Innovative lighting, sets, and costumes in collaboration with [[Andy Warhol]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and [[Jasper Johns]] &lt;ref name="Contemporary"/&gt;

Other pioneers of contemporary dance (the offspring of modern and postmodern) include [[Ruth St. Denis]], [[Doris Humphrey]], [[Mary Wigman]], [[Francois Delsarte]], [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]], [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], [[Rudolph von Laban]], [[Loie Fuller]], [[Jose Limon]] and [[Marie Rambert]].

==Choreographer's role==
There is usually a choreographer who makes the creative decisions and decides whether the piece is an abstract or a [[narrative]] one. Dancers are selected based on their skill and training. The choreography is determined based on its relation to the music or sounds that is danced to. The role of music in contemporary dance is different from in other genres because it can serve as a backdrop to the piece. The choreographer has control over the costumes and their aesthetic value for the overall composition of the performance and also in regards to how they influence dancers’ movements.&lt;ref name=Choreo&gt;{{cite web|title=Choreo|url=http://www.contemporary-dance.org/choreography.html|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance technique==
[[File:Le_Sacre_du_Tempo.jpg|thumb|Le Sacre du Tempo]]
Dance techniques and movement philosophies employed in contemporary dance may include [[Contemporary ballet]], [[Dance improvisation]], [[Modern dance]] styles from [[United States]] such as [[Graham technique]], [[Humphrey-Weidman]] technique and [[Lester Horton|Horton]] technique, [[Modern dance]] of [[Europe]] [[Bartenieff Fundamentals]] and the dance technique of [[Isadora Duncan]] (also see [[Free dance]]).

Contemporary dancers train using contemporary dance techniques as well as non-dance related practices such as [[Pilates]], [[Yoga]], the acting practice of [[Corporeal mime]] - [[Étienne Decroux]] technique and somatic practices such as [[Alexander technique]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juilliard.edu/college/dance/curriculum_outline.html The Juilliard School - Dance Division - Curriculum Outline]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feldenkrais Method]], Sullivan Technique and [[Eric Franklin|Franklin-Methode]], American contemporary techniques such as [[José Limón]] technique and [[Erick Hawkins|Hawkins]] technique and [[Postmodern dance]] techniques such as [[Contact improvisation]] and [[Merce Cunningham|Cunningham]] technique,  and [[Release technique]].

Some well-known choreographers and creators of contemporary dance created schools and techniques of their own. [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]] developed a dance technique called Taylor technique, which is now taught at modern dance schools like The Ailey School in New York City.

It considers itself as part of the international [[Situationist International|Situationist]] movement in collaboration with other like-minded organizations.

The CFU committee comprises artists Henrietta Heise and Jakob Jakobsen, its founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=We are All Normal (and We Want Our Freedom)|pages=357|author=Katya Sander and Simon Sheikh|year=2001|publisher=Black Dog Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AK&gt;{{cite book|title=Realizing the Impossible: Art Against Authority|pages=150|author=Josh MacPhee and Erik Reuland|year=2007|publisher=AK Press|isbn=1-904859-32-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFU has a guide called ''The ABZ of the Copenhagen Free University'' with entries ranging from "self-institution" through "uneconomical behaviour" to "mass intellectuality".  It publishes small books and brochures, as well as hosting discussions, conferences, and screenings.  One of its publications is a research paper called ''The Rise and Fall of the Situationists'', documenting the influence of the [[Situationist International]] in Denmark.&lt;ref name=AK /&gt;

The CFU also helps to run an artist-run television service named '''TV-TV''', broadcast from a squat in Copenhagen (named ''Folkets Hus'' &amp;mdash; People's House) three nights per week in airtime slots that used to be occupied by TV STop, using TV Stop's equipment.  TV-TV's content is usually experimental, and its stated aim is to not be like mainstream television.&lt;ref name=AK /&gt;

[[File:Court Theatre - the shed.JPG|thumb|The current premises in [[Addington, New Zealand|Addington]]]]
The '''Court Theatre''' is a professional theatre company based in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand. It was founded in 1971 and located in the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]] from 1976 until the February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]. It opened new premises in [[Addington, New Zealand|Addington]] in December 2011.  It is currently New Zealand's largest theatre company and is led by CEO, [[Philip Aldridge]] and artistic director Ross Gumbley.

== History ==

===Founding and early years===
[[File:Canterbury Provincial Council Stone Chamber.jpg|thumb|Stone Chamber of the [[Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings|Canterbury Provincial Council]]]]
The company was founded by Yvette Bromley {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSM}} and [[Mervyn Thompson]] in 1971 who served as Co-artistic Directors for the first three years of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.courttheatre.org.nz/index.cfm/1,9,html/About-Us | title=Christchurch's Theatre | publisher=Court Theatre | location=Christchurch | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724101856/http://www.courttheatre.org.nz/index.cfm/1%2C9%2Chtml/About-Us | archive-date=24 July 2011 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bromley chose the theatre's name out of affection for the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in [[London]], which she knew well from her upbringing and drama education.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark" /&gt;

During the first eighteen months of its existence, The Court had three venues. The first was ''The Stone Chamber of the [[Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings|Canterbury Provincial Council Chambers]]'' (April – May 1971), where The Court's début production, ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' was staged.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crean |first1=Mike |title=Reliving Court's ties to landmark |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5833594/Reliving-Courts-ties-to-landmark |accessdate=15 August 2015 |work=[[The Press]] |date=22 October 2011 |page=C7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally the [[Māori Land Court]] would require the use of the chamber, necessitating the set being struck and taken to the Durham Street Art Gallery; the furniture being moved back into the chamber and the processed reversed for the next evening's performance. The Stone Chamber was one of the city's most magnificent structures, but it was impractical for a theatre company, as there was little room for an audience and a lack of toilets.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark" /&gt;

Next was the ''Durham Street Art Gallery'' (June 1971 – May 1972), which was used as an interim venue between the Canterbury Society of Arts vacating the premises and the Law Court expanding into the area.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark" /&gt; From June to August 1972, The Court was housed in the ''Beggs Theatrette'' and staged two productions in the space.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The next four years (September 1972 – February 1976) were a period of relative stability. The Court Theatre was housed at The Orange Hall on Worcester Street. In 1974, Mervyn Thompson stood down leaving Yvette Bromley as sole Artistic Director until 1975 when Randall Wackrow (who had joined the company as Business Manager in 1973) joined her as Co-artistic Director.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===The Arts Centre===
[[File:Court Theatre, Christchurch (Arts Centre).jpg|thumb|The Court Theatre at the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]]]]
In 1976, the company moved to the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]] complex, in the buildings which were formerly the Engineering School of [[Canterbury College, Christchurch|Canterbury College]]. The performance space was previously lecture room D.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark" /&gt;

From 1977 to 1978, Randall Wackrow served as sole Artistic Director, standing down in 1979 with the appointment of Elric Hooper.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Hooper served as Artistic Director for more than two decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Hooper declared his intent to balance the theatre's repertoire with "three main thrusts — the classic, the contemporary and the indigenous".  Although economic pressure saw a fledgling second auditorium, ''Court Two'', closed as a regular venue following the economic slump of the mid-eighties (although it was to be later revived as ''The Forge''), overall this philosophy was rewarded.

As the new millennium approached, The Court saw growth across the board — in audiences, income and acclaim, and expanded its company with the introduction of [[Theatresports]] to [[Australasia]] in the late 1980s and the formation of professional improvisation troupe, [[Court Jesters|The Court Jesters]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} In 1990, Hooper was awarded the [[MBE]] and the 1990 Commemoration medal by the [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Hooper retired as Artistic Director in 1999 and Catherine Downes served as Artistic Director of The Court Theatre from 2000–2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Ross Gumbley has been The Court's Artistic Director from 2006.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Arts Centre premises ==
The Court operated two auditoria at the Arts Centre. Court One seated 291 in a broad 'semi-thrust' stage, staging at least eight productions each season totalling approximately 270 performances annually. Each season contained a mix of New Zealand works, modern international theatre and classics.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The Forge (formerly known as Court Two) seated 123 in a 'box' setting with the audience seated on two sides. Until recently it was used as a hosting venue by touring or independent productions, but since 2007 The Forge was used by the Court for staging challenging international, local and devised works, with an aim of attracting a different audience demographic from its Court One patronage.

== Current role and activities ==
The Court Theatre employs professionals from around the country and internationally. It sustains a full-time professional staff and an ensemble acting company and is administered by The Court Theatre Trust. At any one time there can be up to 100 people working full-time at The Court Theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In addition to being a full-time professional theatre company, The Court Theatre operates numerous other activities in the community. The company annually tours a show regionally around the [[South Island]]. Its education programme provides training for school-age students and adults, regularly liaising with high school and tertiary institutions as well as other community groups. The company also produces school holiday kids' shows and an annual touring primary school show.

Furthermore, the company employs a troupe of professional improvisors and corporate entertainers, The [[Court Jesters]]. The most public face of their work is the [[improv comedy]] show "Scared Scriptless" which is staged every Friday and Saturday night at The Court Theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''Crichton Street Public School''' was an elementary school in the [[New Edinburgh]] neighbourhood of [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]] until 1999. In 2000, [[The School of Dance]] purchased 200 Crichton.

==History==
The first school in the village of New Edinburgh opened in 1838.  The school moved to Crichton Street around 1875. In 1887, when New Edinburgh was annexed to Ottawa, this two-room school house became part of the Ottawa school board.  The original structure was demolished in 1919, and a new structure designed by W.B. Garwick was erected.

Over time enrollment fell, and the school was frequently threatened with closure. In the 1980s it became one of a number of Ottawa area [[alternative education|alternative school]]s focused on independent and unstructured learning.  It was eventually shuttered in 1999.

In 2000, [[The School of Dance]] purchased 200 Crichton Street.

==Community==
In 1998, the Grade 6 students at Crichton School participated in the 25th Anniversary celebrations for the [[Lester B. Pearson Building]], used by [[Foreign Affairs Canada]].

The school had many students whose parents either worked for Foreign Affairs or were foreign diplomats serving in [[Ottawa]].

The '''decorative arts''' are arts or crafts whose object is the [[design]] and manufacture of objects that are both beautiful and functional. It includes [[interior design]], but not usually [[architecture]]. The decorative arts are often categorized in distinction to the "[[fine arts]]", namely [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[photography]], and large-scale [[sculpture]], which generally produce objects solely for their [[aesthetics|aesthetic quality]] and capacity to stimulate the [[intellect]]. "[[Applied arts]]" is synonymous with the "decorative arts".

==Distinction from the fine arts==
[[File:Surahi national Museum India.JPG|thumb|right|Surahi, [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], 17th Century CE. [[National Museum, New Delhi]]]]
The distinction between the decorative and fine arts essentially arose from the post-[[Renaissance]] art of the West, where the distinction is for the most part meaningful. This distinction is much less meaningful when considering the art of other cultures and periods, where the most valued works, or even all works, include those in decorative media. For example, [[Islamic art]] in many periods and places consists entirely of the decorative arts, often using [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]] and [[plants in culture|plant forms]], as does the art of many traditional cultures. The distinction between decorative and fine arts is not very useful for appreciating [[Chinese art]], and neither is it for understanding Early [[Medieval art]] in [[Europe]]. In that period in [[Europe]], fine arts such as [[manuscript illumination]] and [[monumental sculpture]] existed, but the most prestigious works tended to be in [[goldsmith]] work, in cast metals such as bronze, or in other techniques such as [[ivory carving]]. Large-scale wall-paintings were much less regarded, crudely executed, and rarely mentioned in contemporary sources. They were probably seen as an inferior substitute for [[mosaic]], which for the period must be considered a fine art, though in recent centuries mosaics have tended to be considered decorative. The term "ars sacra" ("sacred arts") is sometimes used for medieval Christian art executed in metal, ivory, textiles, and other more valuable materials but not for rarer secular works from that period.

==Influence of different materials==
Modern understanding of the art of many cultures tends to be distorted by the modern privileging of fine art media over others, as well as the very different survival rates of works in different media.  Works in metal, above all in precious metals, are liable to be "recycled" as soon as they fall from fashion, and were often used by owners as repositories of wealth, to be melted down when extra money was needed.  Illuminated manuscripts have a much higher survival rate, especially in the hands of the church, as there was little value in the materials and they were easy to store.

==Renaissance attitudes==
The promotion of the fine arts over the decorative in European thought can largely be traced to the Renaissance, when Italian theorists such as [[Vasari]] promoted artistic values, exemplified by the artists of the [[High Renaissance]], that placed little value on the cost of materials or the amount of skilled work required to produce a work, but instead valued artistic imagination and the individual touch of the hand of a supremely gifted master such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]] or [[Leonardo da Vinci]], reviving to some extent the approach of antiquity.  Most European art during the [[Middle Ages]] had been produced under a very different set of values, where both expensive materials and virtuoso displays in difficult techniques had been highly valued.  In China both approaches had co-existed for many centuries: [[ink and wash painting]], mostly of [[landscape art|landscapes]], was to a large extent produced by and for the [[scholar-bureaucrats]] or "literati", and was intended as an expression of the artist's imagination above all, while other major fields of art, including the very important [[Chinese ceramics]] produced in effectively industrial conditions, were produced according to a completely different set of artistic values.

==Arts and Crafts movement==
[[File:Artichoke wallpaper Morris and Co J H Dearle no borders.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arts and Crafts movement]] "Artichoke" wallpaper by Morris and Co.]]

The lower status given to works of decorative art in contrast to fine art narrowed with the rise of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. This aesthetic movement of the second half of the 19th century was born in England and inspired by [[William Morris]] and [[John Ruskin]]. The movement represented the beginning of a greater appreciation of the decorative arts throughout Europe. The appeal of the Arts and Crafts movement to a new generation led the English architect and designer [[Arthur H. Mackmurdo]] to organize the Century Guild for craftsmen in 1882, championing the idea that there was no meaningful difference between the fine and decorative arts. Many converts, both from professional artists' ranks and from among the intellectual class as a whole, helped spread the ideas of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Arts and Crafts Movement |title=Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |year=2012 |accessdate=5 June 2014|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/37281/Arts-and-Crafts-movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the Arts and Crafts movement led to the decorative arts being given a greater appreciation and status in society and this was soon reflected by changes in the law. Until the enactment of the Copyright Act 1911 only works of fine art had been protected from unauthorised copying. The 1911 Act extended the definition of an "artistic work" to include works of "artistic craftsmanship".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=Section 35(1) |title=UK Legislation, Copyright Act 1911 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/46/section/35/enacted}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Edmund Eldergill |url=http://www.vivalagoon.com/en/content/8-decorative-arts-copyright-uk |title=The Decorative Arts and Copyright |year=2012 |publisher=Lagoon Contemporary Furniture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Director of Bands''' is the head figure of a marching or concert form of bands, a person who leads a musical ensemble. The Director, by history and tradition, must know all the concepts of music and must be able to teach all different kinds of instrumental musicians in order to make a performance at a certain dateline before the scheduled performance.

==Education==
Most students attend a four-year university to earn a [[Bachelor's degree]] in music. Degrees earned after a Bachelor's are a [[Master's degree]] in music and a Doctoral degree in music. The ones that earn a [[Doctor of Music]] usually seek a professorship at an institution of higher learning.

==Conducting techniques==
Conducting is a means of communicating real-time information to performers. There are no absolute rules on how to conduct correctly, and a wide variety of different conducting styles exist. The primary responsibilities of the conductor are to set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats, and to listen and shape the sound of the ensemble.

An understanding of the basic elements of musical expression ([[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Articulation (music)|articulation]]) and the ability to communicate them effectively to an ensemble is necessary in order to conduct. The ability to communicate nuances of phrasing and expression through gesture is also beneficial. Conducting gestures may be choreographed beforehand by the conductor while studying the [[sheet music|score]], or may be spontaneous.

A distinction is sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral conducting. [[Stereotype|Stereotypically]], orchestral conductors use a [[baton (conducting)|baton]] more often than choral conductors (though not always: this is up to the conductor's personal preference), and favor the use of [[beat pattern]]s over gestural conducting, which concentrates more on musical expression and shape. 

The grip of the [[baton (conducting)|baton]] is a contentious issue that varies from conductor to conductor. Despite a wide variety of styles, a number of standard conventions have developed.

[[Image:dominant wavelength.png|frame|right|'''Dominant/complementary wavelength example on the CIE color space'''&lt;br&gt;The "x" marks the color in question. For the white point indicated, the dominant wavelength for "x" is on the nearer perimeter, around 600 nm, while the complementary wavelength is opposite, around 485 nm.  Intuitively, the dominant wavelength of "x" corresponds to the primary hue of "x".]]
In [[color|color science]], the '''dominant wavelength''' (and the corresponding '''complementary wavelength''') are ways of characterizing any [[light]] mixture in terms of the monochromatic [[Color#Spectral colors|spectral]] light that evokes an identical (and the corresponding [[complementary color|opposite]]) perception of [[hue]].  For a given physical light mixture, the dominant and complementary wavelengths are not entirely fixed, but vary according to the [[illuminant|illuminating light]]'s precise color, called the [[white point]], due to the [[color constancy]] of vision.

==Definitions==
On the [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] [[CIE 1931 color space|color coordinate space]] &lt;ref name=CIE15&gt;{{cite book|last1=CIE|first1=15|chapter=Chapter 5.1|title=Colorimetry|date=2004|publisher=Central Bureau of the CIE|location=Vienna, P.O.

The point of intersection nearer to the color in question reveals the ''dominant wavelength'' of the color as the wavelength of the pure spectral color at that intersection point.&lt;ref name=Bahadur&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bahadur|first1=Birendra|chapter=DIsplay parameters and requirements|editor-last1=Bahadur|editor-first1=Birendra|title=Liquid crystals : applications and uses|date=1990|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=9789810229511|pages=51&amp;ndash;53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harold|first1=Richard S.|chapter=Adapting CIE specifications to object colors|title=The measurement of appearance|date=1987|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780471830061|pages=111&amp;ndash;114|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David L.|last=Post|chapter=Color and human-computer interaction|editor-last1=Helander|editor-first1=Martin G.|editor-last2=Landauer|editor-first2=Thomas K.|editor-last3=Prabhu|editor-first3=Prasad V.|title=Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction.|date=1997|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080532882|pages=583&amp;ndash;584|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point of intersection on the opposite side of the color space gives the ''complementary wavelength'', which when added to the color in question in the right proportion will yield the color of the illuminant (since the illuminant point necessarily sits between these points on a straight line in CIE space, according to the definition just given).

In situations where no particular illuminant is specified, it is common to discuss dominant wavelength relative to one of several "white" [[standard illuminant]]s, such as [[Standard illuminant#Illuminant_E|equal-energy (flat spectrum)]] or a [[color temperature]] such as [[Illuminant D65|6500]][[Kelvin|K]].  For the purposes of this geometrical discussion, an analogy may be observed between the horseshoe shaped CIE 1931 color space and a circular slice of [[HSV color space]], where the CIE flat spectrum white point at (1/3,1/3) is analogous to the HSV white point at (0,0).  This comparison clarifies the derivation of the ideas of hue and complementary color common in uses of the HSV space.

==Explanation==

The psychological perception of [[color]] is commonly thought of as a function of the [[power spectrum]] of light frequencies impinging on the [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s of the [[retina]].  In the simplest case of [[Color#Spectral versus non-spectral colors|pure spectral light]] (also known as monochromatic), the spectrum of the light has power only in one narrow frequency band peak.  For these simple stimuli, there exists a continuum of perceived colors which changes as the frequency of the narrow band peak is changed.  This is the well known [[rainbow]] spectrum, which ranges from red at one end to blue and violet at the other (corresponding respectively to the long-wavelength and short-wavelength extremes of the visible range of [[electromagnetic radiation]]).

However, light in the natural world is almost never purely [[monochromatic]]; most natural light sources and reflected light from natural objects comprise spectra that have complex profiles, with varying power over many different frequencies.  A naive perspective might be that therefore all these different complex spectra would generate color perceptions completely different from those evoked in the rainbow of pure spectral light.  One can perhaps see intuitively that this is not correct: almost all hues in the natural world (purples being the exception, see below) are represented in the pure rainbow spectrum, although they may be darker or less saturated than they appear in the rainbow.  How is it that all the complex spectra in the natural world can be condensed to hues in the rainbow, which only represents simple monochromatic band peak spectra?  This is the result of the design of the [[human eye|eye]]: the three color photoreceptors in the retina (the [[Cone cell|cone]]s) reduce the information in the light spectrum down to three activity coordinates.  Thus, many different physical light spectra converge psychologically to the same perceived color.  In effect, for any single color perception, there is a whole parametric space in the power/frequency domain that maps to that one color.

For many power distributions of natural light, the set of spectra mapping to the same color perception also includes a stimulus that is a narrow band at a single frequency; i.e. a pure spectral light (usually with some flat spectrum white light added to desaturate).  The wavelength of this pure spectral light that will evoke the same color perception as the given complicated light mixture is the ''dominant wavelength'' of that mixture.

Note that since [[purple]]s (mixtures of red and blue/violet) cannot be pure spectral colors, no color mixture perceived as purple in hue can be assigned a proper ''dominant'' wavelength.  However, purple mixtures can be assigned a proper ''complementary'' wavelength in the greenish range, on the opposite side of the white point, and a "dominant hue" as a  non-spectral coordinate along the [[line of purples]].  See [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] for the standard representation of color space, where the border is composed of a horseshoe curve representing the pure spectral colors, with a straight line completing the perimeter along the bottom and representing the mixtures of extreme red and blue/violet that give the pure purples.  The same argument applies to complementary colors;  for many coordinates in the green area of CIE color space, there is a proper dominant wavelength but no proper complementary wavelength, but there is a complementary purple hue.

[[File:Parepa-Rosa, Euphrosyne, 1836-1874.jpg|upright|thumb|Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa]]
'''Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa''' (7 May 1836 – 21 January 1874) was a British [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] who established the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] together with her husband [[Carl Rosa]]. Parepa's [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|aristocratic father]] died soon after her birth, and her mother turned to the stage to support them. Parepa made her operatic debut in 1855, at age 16, and soon earned enthusiastic reviews in the major London opera houses. In 1867, the widowed Parosa married the violinist and conductor Carl Rosa in New York and founded an opera company with Parepa as the leading lady; they toured successfully in America for several years. After their return to Britain with ambitious plans for their opera company, Parepa fell ill and died in 1874 at only 37 years of age.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Parepasculpture.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Bust of Parepa-Rosa at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]]]
Euphrosyne Parepa was born in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, to the [[soprano]] Elisabeth Seguin (b. 1812, sister of [[Bass (voice type)|basso]] Arthur Edward Seguin) and the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|Wallachian boyar]] Demetrius Parepa, Baron Georgiades de Boyescu of [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name=Illustrated&gt;"Madame Parepa-Rosa", ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 7 February 1874, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died when Parepa was an infant, leaving her young mother impoverished. Parepa's mother turned to the stage to support her child and herself and trained the girl in singing.&lt;ref name=NYtimesobit&gt;{{citation|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07EFDB173BEF34BC4B51DFB766838F669FDE|title=Obituary: Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=23 January 1874|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her operatic début was in 1855 at the age of 16 in [[Malta]] as Amina in ''[[La Sonnambula]]'', followed by engagements in Italy, Spain and Portugal. She gave her first London performance at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], in the role of Elvira in ''[[I Puritani]]'', with the [[Royal Italian Opera]] company, with whom she spent the 1857 season.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Rosenthal, Harold and Elizabeth Forbes. [https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.20896 "Parepa(-Rosa), Euphrosyne (De Boyescu, Parepa)"], Grove Music Online, 20 January 2001, accessed 22 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Italian Opera company held their 1856–57 season at the Lyceum because the [[Royal Opera House]] was being remodeled after a fire. See Obituary: "Madame Parepa Rosa", ''[[The Times]]'', 23 January 1874, p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; The critic of ''[[The Observer]]'' wrote of this introduction: "Parepa possesses a soprano voice of excellent quality and remarkable compass. She acts and sings well. Her version of "''Son vergine vezzosa''" elicited applause terminating in a recall, and … [after the ''finale''] she was again called for. … '''"Qui la voce"''' … was correctly and brilliantly executed; and the ''artiste'' was again summoned back to the stage to receive the homage of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;"Royal Italian Opera: First Appearance of Mdlle. Parepa", ''[[The Observer]]'', 25 May 1857, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1859 to 1865, she appeared in opera at both [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]] and at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], becoming known for such roles as Leonora in ''[[Il trovatore]]'', Zerlina in ''[[Fra Diavolo]]'' and Elvira in ''[[La muette de Portici]]''.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; During this time, she participated in two operatic premieres, creating the title role in [[Alfred Mellon]]'s ''Victorine'' in 1859 and the role of Mabel in [[George Alexander Macfarren]]'s opera ''Helvellyn'' in 1864. She also was a successful [[oratorio]] and concert soloist, in constant demand in Britain and beyond.&lt;ref name=NYtimesobit/&gt; She sang with [[Charles Santley]] at the opening of the [[Oxford Music Hall]] in 1861, appeared before the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] in [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'' and participated in the 19th-century English revival of the music of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], performing at the Handel festivals of 1862 and 1865, and in Germany.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Elkin. ''Royal Philharmonic'', Ryder: London (1946), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and later years==
Her first husband, Army Captain H. de Wolfe Carvelle, died in Peru in 1865, sixteen months after their wedding.&lt;ref name=NYtimesobit/&gt; She travelled to the United States in 1865 with cornetist Levy and violinist [[Carl Rosa]], the latter of whom she married in New York City in 1867.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Together they quickly established the Parepa-Rosa English Opera Company there, featuring her as the leading soprano, which became popular, and which introduced opera to places in America that had never staged it before. They opened at the [[Fourteenth Street Theatre|French Theatre on Fourteenth Street]], New York City, in September 1869 with a performance of [[Michael William Balfe|Balfe]]'s opera ''The Puritan's Daughter'', with Parepa singing the title role. The subsequent tour of the eastern and midwestern states included a repertoire that ranged from ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'' and ''[[Maritana]]'' to Weber's ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' and ''Oberon''.&lt;ref name=Carl&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.carlrosaopera.co.uk/history/uk-ushistory.asp|title=The Carl Rosa Opera Company: American and British History|publisher=Carl Rosa Company Ltd|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the Parepa-Rosa Opera Company returned to Britain and then appeared in Italian opera at [[Cairo]], Egypt, followed by a return to America for another successful tour in 1871–72.&lt;ref name=Carl/&gt; In 1872, Parepa sang at the [[Lower Rhine Festival]] in [[Düsseldorf]], and they then returned to London, where she sang Donna Anna in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and the title role in ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' at the Royal Opera House.&lt;ref name=Illustrated/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; In September 1873, the company changed its name to [[Carl Rosa Opera Company|Carl Rosa's English Opera]], since Parepa was pregnant.&lt;ref name=Carl/&gt;

Parepa died in London, after an illness, at the age of 37 while preparing to sing Elsa in an English version of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' as part of her husband's planned season a [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]; after her death, Rosa cancelled the season.&lt;ref name=Illustrated/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: "Madame Parepa Rosa", ''The Times'', 23 January 1874, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried at [[Highgate cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Legge, R. H., revised by J. Gilliland. [https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/21264 "Rosa, Euphrosyne Parepa (''née'' Euphrosyne Parepa de Boyesku or Boyescu)"], ''Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', 23 September 2004, accessed 22 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, Rosa endowed the Parepa-Rosa Scholarship at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in her memory.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

==Reputation==
William Winter wrote that "Great vocal powers have seldom found such ample or such touching expression as those of Parepa-Rosa did in the first act of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''.  … [O]ne of her best successes was made as Rosina in ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' ... to indicate the versatility of her talents and the scope and thoroughness of her culture."&lt;ref&gt;Winter, William. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lJSYCwf6VaQC&amp;pg=PA253  ''Brief Chronicles''], Ayer Publishing (1970) {{ISBN|0-8337-3826-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her obituary in ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' stated: "Her voice was a genuine soprano, of extensive compass and fine quality, while her highly-cultivated execution and her general musical knowledge gave her exceptional advantages, both mechanical and intellectual".&lt;ref name=Illustrated/&gt;

Her achievements were recognised by the [[Royal Philharmonic Society|Philharmonic Society of London]] (now the Royal Philharmonic Society) with the rare award of their Gold Medal in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/awards/gold_medal/goldmedalrecipients/|title=RPS Gold Medal Recipients Since 1870|publisher=Royal Philharmonic Society|accessdate=30 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509113938/http://www.royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/awards/gold_medal/goldmedalrecipients/|archivedate=9 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Goodoldgaietyhis00holluoft 47.jpg|right|thumb|Byron in the 1870s]]
'''Henry James Byron''' (8 January 1835 – 11 April 1884) was a prolific English dramatist, as well as an editor, journalist, director, theatre manager, novelist and actor.

After an abortive start at a medical career, Byron struggled as a provincial actor and aspiring playwright in the 1850s.  Returning to London and beginning to study for the [[Bar examination|Bar]], he finally found playwriting success in [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and other punny plays.  In the 1860s, he became an editor of humorous magazines and a noted man-about-town, while continuing to build his playwriting reputation, notably as co-manager, with [[Marie Wilton]], of the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]].  In 1869, he returned to the stage as an actor and, during the same period, wrote numerous successful plays, including the historic international success, ''[[Our Boys]]''.  In his last years, he grew frail from [[tuberculosis]] and died at the age of 49.

==Biography==
Byron was born in [[Manchester]], England, the son of Henry Byron (1804–1884, second cousin to the poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and descendant of many Lord Byrons), at one time British consul in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]], and Elizabeth Josephine ''née'' Bradley.  He was educated in [[Essex]] and then at St. Peter's Collegiate School in [[Eaton Square]], London.  Although his mother wanted him to pursue a career in the Navy, Byron did not do so.  Instead, he first became a physician's clerk in London for four years and then studied medicine with his grandfather, Dr. James Byron Bradley, in [[Buxton]].  Byron married Martha Foulkes (1831–1876) in London in 1856.  He entered the [[Middle Temple]] as a student briefly in 1858, but he had already begun writing for the stage and soon returned to that vocation.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Thomson, Peter. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4280 "Byron, Henry James (1835–1884)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 19 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Byron-jack-the-giant-killer.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for Byron's 1859–60 pantomime, ''Jack the Giant Killer'']]
Byron joined several provincial companies as an actor from 1853–57, sometimes in his own plays and sometimes in those of [[T. W. Robertson]] (with whom he acted and starved) or others, but had little success.  He described his early attempts at acting, and the hardships of the journeyman touring actor, in an 1873 essay for ''The Era Almanack and Annual'' called "Eighteen Parts a Week".  He began writing [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] of melodramas and [[extravaganza]]s in the mid-1850s.  In 1857, his burlesque of ''Richard of the Lion Heart'' premièred at the [[Royal Strand Theatre]].  His successful works in 1858 included ''The Lady of Lyons, or, Twopenny Pride and Pennytence'' and ''Fra Diavolo Travestie; or, The Prince, the Pirate and the Pearl'', also at the Strand, which later played in New York.  This was so well received that Byron abandoned the law to concentrate full-time on theatre.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Another successful Strand burlesque in 1858 was ''The Maid and the Magpie; or, The Fatal Spoon'' an early play to include a dance at the end of a song.  This starred [[Marie Wilton]] as Pippo and was also revived in New York.  In 1859, he wrote another successful burlesque, ''The Babes in the Wood and the Good Little Fairy Birds''.  He soon wrote other burlesques for the Strand, the [[Olympic Theatre]], and the [[Adelphi Theatre]], as well as a sequence of Christmas [[pantomime]]s for the [[Princess's Theatre]], beginning in 1859 with ''Jack the Giant Killer, or, Harlequin, King Arthur, and ye Knights of ye Round Table''&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, Amy Wai Sum. [http://whaleyween.com/Holly/DLB344_19thC_BritishDramatists/Byron.pdf "Henry J. Byron"]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Hong Kong Baptist University&lt;/ref&gt; and followed the next year by ''Robinson Crusoe, or Harlequin Friday and the King of the Caribee Islands!''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worc.ac.uk/victorian/victorianplays/Vol49viiRobinson.pdf Script for ''Robinson Crusoe, or Harlequin Friday'']{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (1860)&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron also wrote for periodicals, and in 1861, he became the first editor of ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine, where he showcased the comic talents of the then-unknown [[W. S. Gilbert]].  He became editor of ''Comic News'' in 1863.  He also founded the short-lived ''Comic Trials'' and wrote a [[three-volume novel]], ''Paid in Full'', in 1865.  In 1867, he became the editor of ''Wag'', another humour magazine.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; He wrote numerous dramatic critiques and humorous essays for magazines, including the rival of ''Fun'', ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 14 April 1884, p. 7, col. C&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he was a well-known man-about-town, joining, and popular as a guest at, various London dining clubs and, in 1863, becoming a founding member of the Arundel Club.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; [[Henry Morley]] acknowledged with dismay Byron's position in the literary world as chief punster but found in him "a true power of fun that makes itself felt by high and low".&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of a London Playgoer'', 1866, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; He became a Member of the Dramatic Authors' Society by 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worc.ac.uk/victorian/victorianplays/Vol49viiRobinson.pdf Script of Byron's ''Robinson Crusoe; or, Harlequin Friday'' (1860)]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, he continued writing for the Strand, the Adelphi, the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], the [[Haymarket Theatre]] and the Princess's, among other London theatres.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Among Byron's dozens of plays in the early 1860s, his early successes were mostly burlesques, such as ''Bluebeard from a New Point of Hue'' (1860); ''Cinderella'' (1860); ''Aladdin, or, The Wonderful Scamp'' (1861);&lt;ref&gt;Byron's 1861 ''Aladdin'' featured the début of the [[pantomime]] character, [[Widow Twankey]], first played by James Rogers.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Esmeralda, or, The Sensation Goat'' (1861), all in rhymed couplets.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, Jane.

Gilbert: A Classic Victorian and His Theatre''], Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Another success was ''George de Barnwell; or Harlequin Folly in the Realms of Fancy'' (1862).  Several of these early plays were revived in Britain and received New York productions.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

[[File:Dearer Than Life.jpg|thumb|left|350px|1868 production of ''Dearer Than Life'' showing seated l. to r. [[J.L. Toole|Toole]], [[Lionel Brough]] and [[Henry Irving|Irving]]]]
Between 1865 and 1867, he joined [[Marie Wilton]], whom he had met through his early work at the Strand, in the management of the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]].  She provided the capital, and he was to write the plays.  His first was a burlesque of ''[[La sonnambula]]''.  However, Wilton wanted to present more sophisticated pieces. She agreed to produce three more burlesques by Byron, but he agreed to write his first prose comedies, ''War to the Knife'' (a success in 1865) and ''A Hundred Thousand Pounds'' (1866).  They also staged one of T. W. Robertson's biggest successes, ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', in 1865.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Upon his severing the partnership and starting theatre management on his own account in the provinces, he lost money, ending up in bankruptcy court in 1868.  However, he produced many of his plays at these theatres while continuing to write for London theatres.  One successful provincial work was ''Dearer than Life'' (1867), which received many revivals, beginning with a London revival in 1868 starring [[J. L. Toole]] and the young [[Henry Irving]].  Another, the same year, was ''The Lancashire Lass; or, Tempted, Tried and True'' (1867), a melodrama, also revived in London in 1868.  He even collaborated with W. S. Gilbert on ''Robinson Crusoe; or, The Injun Bride and the Injured Wife'', which played in 1867 at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in London.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

===Return to acting and later years===
He returned to acting, making his London acting début, in 1869, achieving much greater success than in his early attempts, as Sir Simon Simple in his comedy ''Not Such a Fool as He Looks''.&lt;ref name=utility&gt;Stedman, Jane W.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3205899 "General Utility: Victorian Author-Actors from Knowles to Pinero",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 24, No. 3, October 1972, pp. 289–301, The Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this with successful outings as Fitzaltamont in ''The Prompter's Box: A Story of the Footlights and the Fireside'' (1870), ''The Prompter's Box'' (1870, revived in 1875 and often thereafter, and later renamed ''The Crushed Tragedian''), Captain Craven in ''Daisy Farm'' (1871) and Lionel Leveret in ''Old Soldiers'' (1873).  Byron's acting was again admired in ''An American Lady'' in 1874, with which he began as the manager of the [[Criterion Theatre]], and then ''Married in Haste'' (1875) which was much revived.  In 1886, he played in his ''The Bull by the Horns'' and ''Old Chums''.  Other roles included Dick Simpson in ''Conscience Money'' (1878), Charles Chuckles in his ''An English Gentleman'' (1879) and John Blunt in his ''Michael Strogoff'' (1881).&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; In 1881, he played the role of Cheviot Hill in a revival of his friend Gilbert's eccentric comedy, ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]''.&lt;ref name=utility/&gt; He continued acting until 1882, when ill health forced him to retire.  Not surprisingly, Byron achieved his greatest acting successes in timing of the delivery of his own witty lines.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  ''The Times'' explained that "in such parts as Gibson Greene in ''Married in Haste'', a self-possessed, observant, satirical, well-bred man of the world, [Byron] was beyond the reach of rivalry.  To ease and grace of manner he united a peculiar aptitude for the delivery of the good things he put into his own mouth."&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

[[File:Ourboys2a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Our Boys'', 1875]]
Byron continued to write prose comedies with the ambitious semi-autobiographical ''Cyril's Success'' (1868), ''The Upper Crust'' (starring Toole), ''Uncle Dick's Darling'' (1870, starring Henry Irving), ''An English Gentleman'' (1871, starring [[Edward Sothern]]),&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 May 1871, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; ''Weak Woman'' (1875, starring [[Marion Terry]]), and his greatest success, ''[[Our Boys]]'' (1875–79, [[Vaudeville Theatre]]).&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; With 1,362 performances in its original production, ''Our Boys'' set the record for the longest-running play in history and held it for almost two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Michael R. Review of plays by H. J. Byron including ''Our Boys'' in ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 82, No. 3, pp. 716-17, July 1987, Modern Humanities Research Association&lt;/ref&gt; It was also much revived, especially in America.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; From 1876 to 1879, he wrote several successful burlesques for the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], such as a burlesque of [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''Don Caesar de Bazan'' called ''Little Don Caesar de Bazan'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Information about ''Little Don Caesar de Bazan'' and the Gaiety Theatre] at VictorianWeb.org&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Gaiety Gulliver'' (1879).  Also during that period, he edited the humour magazine ''Mirth''.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; In 1878, he co-wrote a highly successful charity pantomime, ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'', together with [[Robert Reece]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[F. C. Burnand]]. In 1880, four volumes of his plays were published, with fourteen plays in each book.&lt;ref&gt;Byron, Henry James. "Plays Volumes One to Four", Samuel French &amp; Thomas Lacy (1880)&lt;/ref&gt; After 1880, as his health greatly declined, so did Byron's playwriting output.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

Byron is described by Jim Davis in the introduction to his 1984 collection, ''Plays by H. J. Byron'', as the most prolific playwright of the mid-Victorian period, as he produced over 150 dramatic pieces.  ''The Times'' called Byron a master of "genial wit and humour".&lt;ref&gt;"Funeral of the Late Mr. H. J. Byron", ''The Times'', '18 April 1884, p. 10, col. C&lt;/ref&gt; It also commented that "The secret of his success... lay chiefly in his dialogue, which is seldom otherwise than neat, pointed and amusing.  He fires verbal shots in such rapid succession that one laugh has scarcely died away when another is raised.  In the delineation of character, too, he is often extremely happy".&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

By 1874, he was showing symptoms of [[tuberculosis]], which caused his retirement in 1882. His first wife died in 1876 at the age of 45, and the same year he remarried Eleanor Mary ''née'' Joy, the daughter of Edward Joy, a lawyer.  His son Henry and daughter Crede (a pun on ''Crede Byron'', the Byron family motto) also became actors, and he had another son.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

During the last few years of his life Byron was in frail health, and he died at his home in [[Clapham]], London, England, in 1884 at the age of 49. He is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]], London.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6359">This is a '''list of significant [[Japan|Japanese]] [[Japanese poetry|poetry]] [[Anthology|anthologies]]'''.

== [[Waka (poetry)|Waka]] ==

Starting with the ''[[Kokin Wakashū]]'', there were 21 official anthologies, known collectively as the {{Nihongo|'''Nijūichidaishū'''|二十一代集|[[Nijūichidaishū|Collections of the Twenty-One Eras]]}}.

===[[Nara period]] chronicles (710 to 794)===
*''[[Man'yōshū]]'' the oldest anthology in Japanese, c.[[785 in poetry|785]], 20 manuscript scrolls, 4,516 poems (when the tanka envoys to the various [[chōka]] are numbered as separate poems), [[Ōtomo no Yakamochi]] was probably the last to edit the Man'yōshū. It is not organized in any particular way (most [[metadata]] is supplied by headnotes), and the poems are written in a Japanese version of the Chinese monosyllabic pronunciation for the Chinese characters.

===[[Heian period]] (794 to 1185)===
*'''Imperial waka anthologies''': anthologies as a national project. Each anthology reflected the taste of time and with loyal dignity became canons for contemporaries and those who followed. The earliest three anthologies are often called ''Sandaishū'', Three Major Anthologies, and earliest eight ''Hachidaishū'', Eight Major Anthologies. Twenty one Imperial anthologies were created: they are collectively known as the ''[[Nijūichidaishū]]''.
*#''[[Kokin Wakashū]]'' the first imperial waka anthology, 20 scrolls, 1,111 poems, ordered by [[Emperor Daigo]] and completed c. [[905 in poetry|905]], compiled by [[Ki no Tsurayuki]], [[Ki no Tomonori]], [[Ōshikōchi no Mitsune]] and [[Mibu no Tadamine]].
*#''[[Gosen Wakashū]]'' 20 scrolls, 1,426 poems, ordered in [[951 in poetry|951]] by [[Emperor Murakami]]
*#''[[Shūi Wakashū]]'' 20 scrolls, 1,351 poems, ordered by ex-[[Emperor Kazan]]
*#''[[Goshūi Wakashū]]'' 20 scrolls, approx 1,200 poems, Ordered in [[1075 in poetry|1075]] by [[Emperor Shirakawa]], completed in 1086.
*#''[[Kin'yō Wakashū]]'' 10 scrolls, 716 poems, ordered by former Emperor Shirakawa, drafts completed 1124–1127, compiled by [[Minamoto no Shunrai]] ([[Toshiyori]])
*#''[[Shika Wakashū]]'' 10 scrolls, 411 poems, ordered in 1144 by former [[Emperor Sutoku]], completed c. 1151–1154, compiled by [[Fujiwara Akisuke]] ([[:ja:藤原顕輔]])
*#''[[Senzai Wakashū]]'' 20 scrolls, 1,285 poems, ordered by former [[Emperor Go-Shirakawa]], probably completed in 1188, compiled by [[Fujiwara no Shunzei]] (also known as ''Toshinari'')
*#''[[Shin Kokin Wakashū]]'' the eighth imperial waka anthology. Its name apparently aimed to show the relation and counterpart to Kokin Wakashū, ordered in 1201 by former Emperor Go-Toba, compiled by [[Fujiwara no Teika]] (whose first name is sometimes romanized as ''Sadaie''), [[Fujiwara Ariie]] ([[:ja:藤原有家]]), [[Fujiwara no Ietaka]] (Karyū), the priest [[Jakuren]], [[Minamoto Michitomo]] ([[:ja:堀川通具]]), and [[Asukai Masatsune]]
*Private editions - Most of waka poets have their own anthology edited by self or by another. They were one of sources of the imperial anthologies.
**''Hitomarokashū'' An anthology of [[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]] works. The editor is unknown. Perhaps edited in the early Heian period. Many misattributed waka are included.
**''Tsurayukishū'' An anthology of [[Ki no Tsurayuki]] works, one of editors of ''Kokin Wakashū''.
**''Kintōshū'' An anthology of [[Fujiwara no Kintō]], the editor of ''[[Wakan rōeishū|Wakan Rōeishū]]''. It gave influence to the waka poetry in the middle Heian period.
**''[[Hyakunin Isshu]]'', or more precisely ''Ogura Hyakunin Isshu''. Edited by [[Fujiwara no Teika]]. Till Meiji it had been read as elementary book for waka poets.
**''Fujiwara no Teika Kashū'' An anthology of [[Fujiwara no Teika]] works.
**''Izumi Shikibu Shū''

'''Monochromatic painting''' has been an important component of [[avant-garde]] visual art throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century. Painters have created the exploration of one color, the examination of values changing across a surface, the expressivity of texture and nuance, expressing a wide variety of emotions, intentions and meanings in a wide variety of ways and means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10124|title=The Collection - MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From geometric precision to expressionism, the monochrome has proved to be a durable idiom in [[Contemporary art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/m/monochrome|title=Monochrome – Art Term - Tate|first=|last=Tate|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Monochrome painting was initiated at the first [[Incoherents|Incoherent arts]]' exhibition in 1882 in Paris, with a black painting by poet [[Paul Bilhaud]] entitled "Combat de Nègres dans un tunnel" (Negroes fight in a tunnel). (Although Bilhaud was not the first to create an all-black artwork: for example, [[Robert Fludd]] published an image of "Darkness" in his 1617 book on the origin and structure of the cosmos; and [[Bertall]] published his black ''Vue de La Hogue (effet de nuit)'' in 1843.)  In the subsequent exhibitions of the Incoherent arts (also in the 1880s) the writer [[Alphonse Allais]] proposed other monochrome paintings, such as "Première communion de jeunes filles chlorotiques par un temps de neige" ("First communion of anaemic young girls in the snow", white), or "Récolte de la tomate par des cardinaux  apoplectiques au bord de la Mer Rouge" ("Tomato harvesting by apoplectic cardinals on the shore of the Red Sea", red).  Allais published his ''[[Album primo-avrilesque]]'' in 1897, a monograph with seven monochrome artworks.  However, this kind of activity bears more similarity to 20th century [[Dada]], or [[Neo-Dada]], and particularly the works of the [[Fluxus]] group of the 1960s, than to 20th century monochrome painting since Malevich.

[[Jean Metzinger]], following the ''[[Succès de scandale]]'' created from the [[Cubist]] showing at the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]], in an interview with Cyril Berger published in ''Paris-Journal'' 29 May 1911, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We cubists have only done our duty by creating a new rhythm for the benefit of humanity. Others will come after us who will do the same. What will they find? That is the tremendous secret of the future. Who knows if someday, a great painter, looking with scorn on the often brutal game of supposed colorists and taking the seven colors back to the primordial white unity that encompasses them all, will not exhibit completely white canvases, with nothing, absolutely nothing on them. (Jean Metzinger, 29 May 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, "Chez Metzi'', interview by Cyril Berger, published in the ''Paris-Journal'', 29 May 1911, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten: ''A Cubism Reader, Documents and Criticism, 1906-1914'', University of Chicago Press, 2008, Document 17, Cyril Berger, ''Chez Metzi'', Paris-Journal, 29 May 1911, pp. 108-112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Metzinger's (then) audacious prediction that artists would take [[abstract art|abstraction]] to its logical conclusion by vacating representational subject matter entirely and returning to what Metzinger calls the "primordial white unity", a "completely white canvas" would be realized two years later. The writer of a satirical manifesto entitled ''Manifeste de l'école amorphiste'', published in ''Les Hommes du Jour'' (3 May 1913), may have had Metzinger's vision in mind when the author justified amorphism's blank canvases by claiming 'light is enough for us'.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6552512b/f8.image|title=Les Hommes du jour / dessins de A.

Rothman, ''Between Music and the Machine: Francis Picabia and the End of Abstraction'', tout-fait, the Marcel Duchamp Studies Online Journal, Jan. 2002, vol. 2, issue 4, p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; With perspective, writes art historian Jeffery S. Weiss, "''Vers Amorphisme'' may be gibberish, but it was also enough of a foundational language to anticipate the extreme reductivist implications of non-objectivity".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=jj82ZE_ctIoC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=lumière,+1913,+amorphisme,+Les+Hommes+du+Jour&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u48KOXMiwp&amp;sig=0JBvcEnSOPXclwaEeeoP_Z5dJog&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aH3zUvWOGqy27QbTmYHgBQ&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=amorphisme&amp;f=false Jeffrey S.

In a broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s of painters associated with the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the [[De Stijl]] movement, and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivist]] movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artcritical.com/2004/10/01/albert-york-and-giorgio-morandi/ Maureen Mullarkey, Art Critical, ''Giorgio Morandi'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hr-5GcN0F6kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Constantin+Br%C3%A2ncu%C5%9Fi.+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fdrAkynIx&amp;sig=_wMpgr2P-ywVUMWpAziTWIuQnjI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRHeTr_IF6jg0QHZ55XHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Daniel Marzona, Uta Grosenick; ''Minimal art'', p.12]&lt;/ref&gt; Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Josef Albers]], and the works of artists as diverse as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], and others. [[Minimalism]] was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]] that had been dominant in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=abstract+expressionism+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NddevTB5zD&amp;sig=nyIwlEqV3XyQaTkeVPgZNqfOGUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rBfeTtKeI8Pd0QG20am2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abstract%20expressionism%20and%20minimal%20art&amp;f=false Gregory Battcock, ''Minimal Art: a critical anthology'', pp 161-172]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide range of possibilities (including impossibility) of interpretation of monochrome paintings is arguably why the monochrome is so engaging to so many artists, critics, and writers. Although the monochrome has never become dominant and few artists have committed themselves exclusively to it, it has never gone away. It reappears as though a spectre haunting [[high modernism]], or as a symbol of it, appearing during times of [[aesthetic]] and sociopolitical upheavals.&lt;ref&gt;''The Primary Colors for the Second Time: A Paradigm Repetition of the Neo-Avant-Garde,'' [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]], October, Vol. 37, (Summer, 1986), pp. 41-52   (article consists of 12 pages), Published by: [[The MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suprematism and Constructivism===
[[File:Чёрный супрематический квадрат. 1915. ГТГ.png|thumb|[[Kazimir Malevich]], ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]'', 1915, oil on canvas, [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/collection/_show/image/_id/378 Malevich, Kazimir Severinovich, ''Black Suprematic Square'', 1915, oil on canvas, 79.5 х 79.5 cm, Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140206000538/http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/collection/_show/image/_id/378 |date=2014-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Monochrome painting as it is usually understood today began in [[Moscow]], with ''[[White on White|Suprematist Composition: White on White]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=80385|title=Kazimir Malevich. Suprematist Composition: White on White. 1918 - MoMA|website=www.moma.org|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of 1918 by [[Suprematist]] artist [[Kazimir Malevich]]. This was a variation on or sequel to his 1915 work ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square on a White Field]]'', a very important work in its own right to 20th century [[geometric abstraction]].

In 1921, [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] artist [[Alexander Rodchenko]] exhibited three paintings together, each a monochrome of one of the three [[primary colors|primary colours]]. He intended this work to represent The Death of Painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/1998/rodchenko/texts/death_of_painting_jpg.html|title=MoMA - exhibitions - Rodchenko - Red Yellow Blue|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Rodchenko intended his monochrome to be a dismantling of the typical assumptions of painting, Malevich saw his work as a concentration on them, a kind of meditation on art’s essence (“pure feeling”).

These two approaches articulated very early on in its history this kind of work’s almost paradoxical dynamic: that one can read a monochrome either as a flat surface (material entity or “painting as object”) which represents nothing but itself, and therefore representing an ending in the evolution of illusionism in painting (i.e. Rodchenko); or as a depiction of multidimensional (infinite) space, a fulfillment of [[illusionistic painting]], representing a new evolution&amp;mdash;a new beginning&amp;mdash;in Western painting’s history (Malevich). Additionally, many have pointed out that it may be difficult to deduce the artist’s intentions from the painting itself, without referring to the artist’s comment.

===Abstract Expressionists===
{{Main article|Abstract Expressionism}}
* '''[[Milton Resnick]]'''

(January 7, 1917 Bratslav, Rodolia, Ukraine - March 12, 2004 New York, New York, USA) had a long career as an [[Abstract Expressionist]] painter. Initially, during the 1940s, he explored the then-current style of  [[Action Painting]]. His later work, from the 1950s through the 1970s is often characterized as [[Abstract Impressionist]] - largely because he constructed his allover compositions with multiple, repetitive, and close-valued brushstrokes, in the manner of [[Claude Monet]] in the famous ''[[Waterlilies]]'' series. During the final two and a half decades of his painting career [http://www.artcritical.com/dorfman/images/resnick.jpg Resnick's paintings became monochromatic], albeit with thickly brushed and layered surfaces.

* '''[[Ad Reinhardt]]'''
(1913 Buffalo, New York, USA - 1967 New York, New York, USA) was an Abstract Expressionist artist notable for painting nearly “pure” monochromes over a considerable span of time (roughly from 1952 to his death in 1967), in red or blue, and lastly and most (in)famously, in black. Like the Johns works mentioned below, Reinhardt’s [http://www.abstract-art.com/abstr_expressionism/re0a_Reinhardt_Painting54-58.htm black paintings] contained faint indications of geometrical shape, but the actual dilineations are not readily visible until the viewer spends time with the work. This tends to encourage a state of contemplative [[meditation]] in the viewer, and to create uncertainty about perception; in terms of Frank Stella's famous quote, you may question whether "what you see" is actually what you are seeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10124,|title=The Collection - MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Richard Pousette-Dart]]'''
Although Pousette-Dart (1916 Saint-Paul, Minnesota, USA - 1992 Suffern, New York, USA) created several distinct series of paintings during his long career as an Abstract Expressionist painter, his monochromatic series called [http://www.valeriecarberry.com/images/pousettedart/RPD101_lg.jpg Presences] spanning the late 1950s through the early 1990s, was among his most powerful.

===Color field===

{{Main article|Color Field}}
Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, several Abstract Expressionist / [[color field]] artists (notably: [[Barnett Newman]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Theodoros Stamos]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ludwig Sander]],  [[Clyfford Still]], [[Jules Olitski]], and others) explored motifs that seemed to imply monochrome, employing broad, flat fields of colour in large scale pictures which proved highly influential to newer styles, such as Post-Painterly Abstraction, Lyrical Abstraction, and Minimalism.

One of Barnett Newman’s near monochrome paintings generated outrage and widespread ridicule (and discussion) in [[Canada]] when the [[National Gallery of Canada|National Gallery]] purchased "[[Voice of Fire]]" for a large sum of money, in the 1980s. Another of [[Barnett Newman]]’s very sparse (though technically not monochrome) [[geometric abstraction]]s was slashed with a knife by an enraged viewer in the 1980s at the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]].

===Lyrical Abstraction===
{{Main article|Lyrical Abstraction}}
[[Lyrical Abstraction]]ist painters such as [[Ronald Davis]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], Ralph Humphrey, David Budd, [[David R. Prentice]], [[David Diao]], David Novros, Jake Berthot, and others also explored and worked on series of shaped and rectangular canvases that approached the monochrome - with variations especially during the 1960s and 1970s.

====Shaped canvas====
{{main article|Shaped canvas}}
Since the 1960s artists as diverse as [[Frank Stella]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Ronald Davis]], David Novros, Paul Mogensen, [[Patricia Johanson]] and others made monochrome paintings on various shaped canvases. While some of their monochromatic works related to minimalism none of the above were minimalists.

===Neo-Dada===
{{Main article|Neo-Dada|Pop art}}
* '''[[Robert Rauschenberg]]''': ''"A canvas is never empty"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quote.robertgenn.com/auth_search.php?authid=75|title=Robert Rauschenberg quotes - Art Quotes|website=quote.robertgenn.com|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early 1950s, Rauschenberg (b. 1925, Port Arthur, Texas, USA; d. 2008) became known for white, then black, and eventually red monochrome canvases. In the [http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/singular_forms/highlights_1a.html White Paintings] (1951) series, Rauschenberg applied everyday house paint with paint rollers to achieve smooth "blank" surfaces. White panels were exhibited alone or in modular groupings. The Black Paintings (1951–53) incorporated texture under the painted surface by way of collaged newspaper that sometimes indicates a grid-like structure. The Red Paintings (1953–54) incorporate still more materials such as wood and fabric under the heavily worked painted surface, and seem to foreshadow Rauschenberg's development of assemblage in his "Combine Paintings" as well as his stated intention to act in "the gap" between "Art" and "Life."

:The white canvases became associated with the work [[Four Minutes Thirty Three Seconds|4'33"]] by the composer [[John Cage]], which consisted of three movements of silence, and was inspired at least in part by Cage's study of Zen Buddhism. In both works attention is drawn to elements of listening / viewing which lie outside the artist's control: e.g. the sounds of the concert environment, or the play of shadows and dust particles accumulating on the 'blank' canvas surfaces ("landing strips" -- Cage).

:In a related work, his ''[[Erased de Kooning Drawing]]'' of 1953, Rauschenberg erased a drawing by abstract expressionist artist [[Willem de Kooning]]. Perhaps surprisingly, De Kooning was sympathetic to Rauschenberg's aims and implicitly endorsed this experiment by providing the younger artist with one of his own drawings which was very densely worked, taking 2 months and many erasers for Rauschenberg to (incompletely) erase.

* '''[[Jasper Johns]]'''
(born 1930, Augusta, Georgia, USA) was a friend of Rauschenberg, and both were often categorized as Neo-Dadaist, pointing to their rejection of the Abstract Expressionist aesthetic which was dominant in the 1950s. Johns painted a number of works such as ''[[White Flag (Johns painting)|White Flag]]'',  [http://www.desordre.net/photographie/photographes/robert_frank/jj_target_green.jpg "Green Target,"] and “Tango,” in which there is only a slight indication of an image, resembling the "White Square on a White Field" of Malevich in technique.
:These works often show more evidence of brushwork than is typically associated with monochrome painting. Many other works also approach monochrome, like the melancholic “grey” works of the early ’60s, but with real objects (“assemblage”) or text added.

===Minimalists===
{{Main article|Minimalism}}

* '''[[Ellsworth Kelly]]'''
(1923, Newburgh, New York, USA - 2015, NY) spent a lot of time in both [[Paris]] and New York. Not strictly a minimalist, he has made a number of monochrome paintings on shaped canvases and single color rectangular panels. His [https://web.archive.org/web/20070709001416/http://www.tate.org.uk/stives/exhibitions/ellsworthkelly/intro.shtm abstractions] were “abstracted” from nature. His interest in nature extends so far that he has made a series of [https://web.archive.org/web/20070709000958/http://www.tate.org.uk/stives/exhibitions/ellsworthkelly/nature.shtm plant lithographs] in an impressive and sincerely realistic style.

* '''[[Mino Argento]]'''
(1927, Rome, Italy-) monotones, white on white paintings were variations on the gridded, rectangle on rectangle themes, but were enlivened with differences in rhythm and conception. One composition included grayed grids and vertical rectagles in several, more opaque whites, clustered centrally.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Lubell, "Group show" (Mino Argento, white on White) Art Magazine, p.11 October 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Agnes Martin]]'''
(1912, Macklin, Saskatchewan, Canada - 2004, Taos, New Mexico, USA) whose works of the 1950s and 1960s are serene meditations on “perfection,” and hence “beauty,” are typically white, off-white or pale grey canvases with faint evidence of pencil dragged in lines or grids across the painted surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://members.aol.com/mindwebart4/agnes2.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Robert Ryman]]'''
(born 1930, Nashville, Tennessee, USA) in works such as [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=13058 Ledger (1982)] bring the word “constructed” to mind, with attention drawn to supports, framing, and the artist's signature as important elements of works which are usually white, or off-white, and in square format. Abstract Expressionist brushwork is used as formal material in these minimalist constructions. Ryman exhibits a tour de force of variation on a deliberately limited theme.
[[File:The Dylan Painting.jpg|thumb|Brice Marden, ''The Dylan Painting'', 1966/1986, [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]]] 
* '''[[Brice Marden]]'''
(born 1938, Bronxville, New York, USA) in his earliest mature works explored a reductive strategy which seemed similar to that of Jasper Johns’s and Ellsworth Kelly's contemporaneous works, yet more formalist: paintings such as [http://www.artsjournal.com/artopia/2006/11/marden_one_and_marden_two.html Return 1] consist of subtly grey fields painted in [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax-medium) with a narrow strip along the bottom of the canvas where Marden left bare evidence of process (i.e., drips and spatters of paint). During the late 1980s Brice Marden, who held a spiritual/emotional view of abstraction, began a more multi-colored and [[calligraphic]] form of abstract painting.

* '''[[Frank Stella]]'''
(born 1936, Malden, Massachusetts, USA) echoed composer [[Igor Stravinsky]]’s famous assertion that “music is powerless to express anything but itself” when he said “What you see is what you see,” a remark he later qualified by saying his early paintings were influenced to a degree by the writing of [[Samuel Beckett]] (see above). In his work he was attempting to minimize any inference of “spiritual” or even “emotional” response on the part of the viewer, and this is perhaps most striking in his [[pinstripe]] [http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/CCTP738/Stella-BlackPainting-Marriage-of-Reason-and-Squalor-II-1959-sm-detail.jpg Black Paintings (Marriage of Reason and Squalor - detail - 1959)] beginning in the late ’50s, where the pinstripes are articulated by unpainted canvas. Later, Stella abandoned not only monochrome, but also eventually geometric painting.

* '''[[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]]'''
(born 1934, Berkeley, California, USA) is characteristically Minimalist in that his "objects" aren't adequately categorized as "painting" or "sculpture." Famous since 1965 for "slabs, columns, planks ... Neutral forms," his meticulously finished, polished [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927031540/http://www.inglebygallery.com/popup2.php?id=796 monochrome objects] are often simply leaned up against gallery walls, in what some critics describe as a casual "West Coast-lean." Although he draws from techniques characteristic of surfboard manufacture, his works are personally and meticulously handcrafted, unlike those of John M. Miller and other more recent artists, which are typically factory-made according to the artist's specifications.
[[File:Mccollum 100ps.jpeg|thumb|Allan McCollum, ''Collection of One Hundred Plaster Surrogates'', 1982/1990, Enamel on cast Hydrostone. Collection: Museum van Hedendaagse Kunst [[Antwerp, Belgium]]]]
* '''[[Allan McCollum]]'''
(born 1944, Los Angeles, California, USA) determined in the mid-1970s that the social forces that give paintings meaning may be better understood if the "painting" itself could be reduced to a generic form—a painting that could read as a "sign" for a painting," which could function of a "[[wikt:placeholder|placeholder]]," or a kind of "[[Theatrical property|prop]]." In the 1970s and early 80s he painted what he called ''[[:Image:Mccollum 100ps.jpeg|Surrogate Paintings]],'' and ultimately began casting them in plaster, frame and all. These hundreds of objects that looked like framed, matted, fields of painted blackness, worked as neutral, "generic signs" that might inspire the viewer to think about the social expectations that constructed the "idea" of a painting," more than the actual painting itself. By reducing paintings to mere signs of themselves, McCollum turned the gallery and the museum setting into a kind of theater, highlighting the drama of presenting, displaying, buying and selling, exchanging, photographing, assessing, criticising, choosing, and writing about the works; the object-paintings at the center of the action were purposely rendered moot, in order to turn one's attention to the supplementary devices and social practices that, in the end, bestow the value on the work. Paradoxically, as time went by, these neutral objects became valuable in themselves, as symbols of an anthropological way of looking at art.
* '''[[Anne Truitt]]'''
(1921–2004) was an American artist of the mid-20th century; she is associated with both [[minimalism]] and [[Color Field]] artists like [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]]. Primarily thought of as a [[minimalist]] sculptor, and as a colorist who painted her sculpture, throughout her career Truitt produced several series of Monochromatic paintings.

:She made what is considered her most important work in the early 1960s anticipating in many respects the work of minimalists like [[Donald Judd]] and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]. She was unlike the minimalists is some significant ways. She named, for instance, many of her works after places and events that were important to her - a practice suggesting a narrative beyond and yet somehow contained by the sculpture.

:The sculpture that made her significant to the development of Minimalism were aggressively plain and painted structures, often large. The recessional platform under her sculpture raised them just enough off the ground that they appeared to float on a thin line of shadow. The boundary between sculpture and ground, between gravity and verticality, was made illusory. This formal ambivalence is mirrored by her insistence that color itself, contained a psychological vibration which when purified, as it is on a work of art, isolates the event it refers to as a thing rather than a feeling. The event becomes a work of art, a visual sensation delivered by color.

===Europe===
* '''[[Lucio Fontana]]'''
From 1949 on [[Lucio Fontana|Fontana]] started the so-called Spatial Concept or slash series, consisting in holes or slashes on the surface of [[monochrome]] paintings, drawing a sign of what he named "an art for the Space Age" (Concetto spaziale (50-B.1), 1950, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne|MNAM]], Paris).

=== Monochrome works: The Blue Epoch ===
* '''[[Yves Klein]]'''
[[File:IKB 191.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yves Klein]], ''IKB 191'', 1962.]]
Although Klein had painted monochromes as early as 1949, and held the first private exhibition of this work in 1950, his first public showing was the publication of the [[Artist's book]] [[Yves: Peintures]] in November 1954. Parodying a traditional catalogue, the book featured a series of intense monochromes linked to various cities he had lived in during the previous years. ''Yves: Peintures'' anticipated his first two shows of oil paintings, at the Club des Solitaires, Paris, October 1955 and ''Yves: Proposition monochromes'' at Gallery Colette Allendy, February 1956. These shows, displaying orange, yellow, red, pink and blue monochromes, deeply disappointed Klein, as people went from painting to painting, linking them together as a sort of mosaic.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"From the reactions of the audience, [Klein] realized that...viewers thought his various, uniformly colored canvases amounted to a new kind of bright, abstract interior decoration. Shocked at this misunderstanding, Klein knew a further and decisive step in the direction of monochrome art would have to be taken...From that time onwards he would concentrate on one single, primary color alone: blue." Hannah Weitemeier&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Weitemeier, Taschen 1994, p15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The next exhibition, 'Proposte Monochrome, Epoca Blu' (Proposition Monochrome; Blue Epoch) at the Gallery Apollinaire, Milan, (January 1957), featured 11 identical blue canvases, using ultramarine pigment suspended in a synthetic resin 'Rhodopas'. Discovered with the help of Edouard Adam, a Parisian paint dealer, the effect was to retain the brilliance of the pigment which tended to become dull when suspended in linseed oil. Klein later patented this recipe to maintain the "authenticity of the pure idea."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Yves Klein, Weitemeier, Taschen 1994, p19&lt;/ref&gt; This colour, reminiscent of the [[lapis lazuli]] used to paint the Madonna's robes in medieval paintings, was to become famous as '[[International Klein Blue]]' (IKB). The paintings were attached to poles placed 20&amp;nbsp;cm away from the walls to increase their spatial ambiguities.

The show was a critical and commercial success, traveling to Paris, Düsseldorf and London. The Parisian exhibition, at the [[Iris Clert]] Gallery, May 1957, became a seminal happening;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_us.html Yves Klein Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530082903/http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_us.html |date=2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as 1001 blue balloons being released to mark the opening, blue postcards were sent out using IKB stamps that Klein had bribed the postal service to accept as legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/YvesKlein.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102073420/http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/YvesKlein.html |archivedate=2012-11-02 |df= }} The Formidable Blue Stamp of Yves Klein, John Held Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; An exhibition of tubs of blue pigment and fire paintings was held concurrently at Gallery Collette Allendy.

* '''[[Gerhard Richter]]'''
(born 1932, Dresden, Germany) is an artist who is probably best known for his technically stunning photo-realist paintings, which overshadow his abstract and monochrome works. Both his abstract and representational works seem to cover similar emotional terrain, a kind of ironic pessimism which made his work very fashionable in the late 1980s. His grey paintings, are made by drawing “expressive” gestures in wet paint.

* '''[[Olivier Mosset]]'''
(born 1944, Bern, Switzerland) also has spent considerable time in New York and Paris. In Paris in the 1960s he was a member of the BMPT group, along with [[Daniel Buren]], Michel Parmentier, and Niele Toroni. The group brought forth questions about the notions of authorship and originality, implying that they often did each other's works, and that the art object was more important than its authorship. Later, in New York in the late 1970s, Mosset undertook a long series of monochrome paintings, during the heyday of [[Neo-expressionism]]. He became a founding member of the New York Radical Painting group, radical referring both to an implied radical social stance, as well as a returning to the radical “root” of painting. This re-assertion of social relevance for abstraction, and even the monochrome, hadn’t been emphasized to such a degree since Malevich and Rodchenko. 1980s neo-geo artists such as [[Peter Halley]] who assert a socially relevant, critical role for [[geometric abstraction]], cite Mosset as an influence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2909">{{about||the 1947 novel called "The Mooncalf"|Dennis Parry}}
{{Refimprove|date=February 2008}}
A '''mooncalf''' (or '''moon-calf''', '''calvaluna''') is a [[monstrous birth]], the [[miscarriage|abortive]] [[fetus]] of a [[Cattle|cow]] or other [[livestock|farm animal]]. The term was occasionally applied to an abortive [[human]] fetus.

The term derives from the once widespread [[superstition]], present in many [[Europe]]an [[folk medicine|folk]] traditions, that such malformed creatures were the product of the sinister influence of the [[Moon]] on fetal development.

==Modern usage==
The term came to also refer to any monstrous or grotesque thing. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], for instance, used the term to describe [[Caliban]], the deformed servant of [[Prospero]], in ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]''.

In [[H. G. Wells]]' 1901 novel ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'', large creatures domesticated by the Selenites are referred to as "mooncalves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The First Men in the Moon]] |last=Wells |first=H. G. |authorlink=H. G. Wells |year=1901 |chapter=Chapter 11: The Mooncalf Pastures }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mooncalf is used as a derogatory term indicating someone is a dullard, fool or otherwise not particularly bright or sharp. For example, [[W. C. Fields]] in ''[[The Bank Dick]]'' (1940) advises his prospective son-in-law to avoid being a "mooncalf" by buying shares he has been conned into believing are worth much more than the proffered price.

Mooncalf is also the name of a species of magical creatures in the world of the [[Harry Potter]] series. It is described in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' as a shy, nocturnal creature with a smooth, pale grey body, bulging eyes and four spindly legs with large flat feet. Mooncalves perform dances in the moonlight, and are apparently responsible for [[crop circle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]] |last=Rowling |first=J. K. |authorlink=J. K. Rowling |year=2001 |chapter=An A–Z of Fantastic Beasts }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|film of the same name]], Newt Scamander's collection of creatures in his suitcase includes a herd of Mooncalves.

Wilfred Maxwell, narrator and protagonist of [[occult]]ist [[Dion Fortune]]’s 1938 novel, ''[[The Sea Priestess]]'', refers several times to a mentally handicapped character who falls into the sea and disappears as a "mooncalf".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Sea Priestess]] |last=Fortune|first=Dion|authorlink=Dion Fortune|origyear=1938|year=1978 |at=Chapter X, p. 86, ''et infra''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oleg Leonidovich Lomakin''' ({{lang-ru|Оле́г Леони́дович Лома́кин}}; August 29, 1924, Krasny Kholm, Tver Province, USSR &amp;ndash; March 25, 2010, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation) was a Russian Soviet realist painter, [[Honored Artist of the RSFSR]], who lived and worked in Saint Petersburg (former Leningrad). He was regarded as one of the major representatives of the [[Leningrad School of Painting|Leningrad school of painting]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.''- Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – pp.9, 15, 18, 20, 24, 27, 29, 31, 42, 90, 364, 389-401, 403-406, 414-424, 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

'''Oleg Leonidovich Lomakin''' was born on August 29, 1924, in the town of Krasny Kholm, Tver Province, USSR. In the 1930s after the death of his father the family moved first to [[Bezhetsk]], then to [[Leningrad]].

In 1937-1939 Oleg Lomakin studied in Art studio at the Leningrad Palace of Young Pioneers. In 1940 he entered the [[Leningrad Secondary Art School]] at the All-Russian Academy of Fine Arts. In February 1942, together with the Secondary Art School, he was evacuated from besieged Leningrad to [[Samarkand]], Central Asia.

In June 1942, Oleg Lomakin was drafted into the [[Red Army]] and took part in the [[German-Soviet War]]. As anti-aircraft gunner he participated in the [[Battle of Kursk]], was wounded and marked by military awards. After demobilization Lomakin returned to studies and graduated from the Secondary Art School in 1946.

In the same year Oleg Lomakin was adopted at the first course of the Department of Painting of the [[Repin Institute of Arts]], there he studied of [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Alexander Zaytsev (artist)|Alexander Zaytsev]], Mikhail Bernshtein, Piotr Ivanovsky, Vladislav Anisovich, Sergei Mikhailov.

In 1952, Oleg Lomakin graduated from the [[Repin Institute of Arts]] in [[Boris Ioganson]] workshop, together with Sergei Babkov, Leonid Baykov, [[Irina Baldina]], Dmitry Beliaev, [[Abram Grushko]], [[Marina Kozlovskaya]], [[Boris Korneev]], [[Elena Kostenko]], [[Boris Lavrenko]], Piotr Fomin, [[Vladimir Chekalov]], and other young artists. His graduated work was historical painting named "[[Mikhail Kalinin]] among their fellow villagers".&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915 - 2005''. - Saint Petersburg: Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007. p.68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1952, Lomakin has participated in Art Exhibitions. He painted portraits, genre and historical paintings, landscapes, still lifes, sketches from the life. A Portrait of a contemporary had become a leading genre in his creativity.

Oleg Lomakin's style distinguish a broad painting, energetic brushstroke, artistic transfer of tonal relations and states of lighting and air. He was acknowledged master of drawing and plein air painting.

In 1952 Oleg Lomakin was admitted as a member of the [[Leningrad Union of Artists]] (since 1992, named as Saint Petersburg Union of Artists). In 1981 Lomakin was awarded the honorary title of [[Honored Artist of the RSFSR|Honored Artist of the Russian Federation]].

Oleg Leonidovich Lomakin died on March 25, 2010 in [[Saint Petersburg]] at the eighty-six year of life. His paintings reside in [[Russian Museum|State Russian Museum]], [[Tretyakov Gallery|State Tretyakov Gallery]], in art museums and private collections in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov.

The steam locomotive '''Onward''' had polygonal driving wheels. This rather ineffective locomotive with only one driving axle was built in 1887 by the [[Hinkley Locomotive Works]] in [[Boston]] for the [[Swinerton Locomotive Driving Wheel Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tracks.lionel.com/thinking-outside-the-circle-a-locomotive-with-non-circular-wheels/ Thinking Outside the Circle: A Locomotive with Non-Circular Wheels.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630164505/http://tracks.lionel.com/thinking-outside-the-circle-a-locomotive-with-non-circular-wheels/ |date=2015-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scientific American|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ChQ4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=swinerton+locomotive+driving+wheel+company&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2K2EmRx74D&amp;sig=HfcBn_eFV9OH_OMSgogDKuwpOMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jvlhUrSFNomuyQH0nIG4CQ#v=onepage&amp;q=swinerton%20locomotive%20driving%20wheel%20company&amp;f=false|year=1890|publisher=Munn &amp; Company|pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1887 the Swinerton Locomotive Driving Wheel Company in the U.S.A. received a unique locomotive boldly called ''Onward'', which had been built by the Hinkley Locomotive Works of Boston. Its unique feature was that its wheels were not round. The company's founder, [[C. E. Swinerton]], had specified that both driving wheels should actually polygons with 118 sides, each flat segment being about 2 inches (50mm) long. He wanted to prove that the line contact at the intersection of each segment would have better rail adhesion than a circular wheel, which was supposed to have only a point contact. However this was actually not the case as even steel deforms under enough pressure, so there is on fact a contact area even with a circular wheel.&lt;ref name="Onward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/polygon/polygon.htm |title=Locomotives with Non-Circular Wheels |website=The Museum of Retro Technology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722215705/http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/polygon/polygon.htm |archive-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[4-2-2]] locomotive had one single driving axle. This wheel arrangement had been abandoned elsewhere because of its poor adhesion. Probably it was chosen to emphasise the effectiveness of the invention. The ''Onward'' was tried on several north-eastern lines, but did not prove to be beneficial, and thus failed to convince practical railway men. It is likely that the non-constant radius would have caused tremendous amount of vibration.&lt;ref name="Onward"/&gt;

It was sold to the [[Portland and Rochester Railroad]], after the polygonal driving wheels had been replaced with conventional round ones. After a few years the P &amp; R sent it to the Manchester Locomotive Works for reconstruction as an ordinary eight-wheeler. "Onward" was cut up for scrap in 1905.&lt;ref name="Onward"/&gt;

[[File:PhD Comics Open Access Week 2012.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=7:58|A PhD Comics special on the occasion of [[Open Access Week]] 2012.]]
'''''Piled Higher and Deeper''''' (also known as '''''PhD Comics'''''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/education/edlife/edl-24phd-t.html?_r=1|title=The Joke Is on the Ph.D.|last=CHOE|first=JAYWON|date=22 July 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a newspaper and [[webcomic]] strip written and drawn by [[Jorge Cham]] that follows the lives of several [[grad student]]s.  First published in the fall of 1997 when Cham was a grad student himself at [[Stanford University]], the strip deals with issues of life in [[graduate school]], including the difficulties of scientific research, the perils of [[procrastination]], the complex student–supervisor relationship and the perpetual search for free food. Cham continued the strip as an Instructor in [[mechanical engineering]] at [[Caltech]], and now draws and gives talks about the strip full-time. Originally, the strip was drawn in crude black-and-white, eventually became grayscale, and finally became color in June 2004.

==Characters==
''Piled Higher and Deeper'' introduced its main characters early in its run, and their personalities have remained fairly constant during the strip's several years of publication. In the strip's first few seasons, the characters were clearly [[Stanford University]] students, though the number of school-specific references and jokes has decreased since.

&lt;!--Please arrange alphabetically by last name, or by first name if the last name is unknown.--&gt;

* '''The Nameless Grad Student (a.k.a., The Nameless Hero)''' – a graduate student in engineering, this bespectacled protagonist has procrastinated through the entire strip without receiving a name. He bears a striking resemblance to the comic strip author, [[Jorge Cham]] (at one point, his younger sister Dee remarks that her brother has dreams of quitting grad school and becoming a [[cartoonist]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Lil' sister|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=253|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=September 21, 2001|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about the hero's background, although early on Mike Slackenerny states that he knew the hero's older brother (who quit his PhD and went on to work for a "[[Silicon Valley]] Company").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Mike Slackenerny: A PhD student needs not such things|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=40|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=February 11, 1998|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he is seen playing with two children at home during his winter vacation,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Taking the laptop with me|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=802|date=December 20, 2006|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; {{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Scooped!: The Third ''Piled Higher &amp; Deeper'' Comic Strip Collection|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|publisher=Piled Higher &amp; Deeper, LLC|year=2008|isbn=978-0-9721695-3-0|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; he probably has younger siblings, nieces and/or nephews, or cousins. He has been increasingly seen with a set group of friends (one is named '''Mikkel''')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Dead Week|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=21|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 22, 1997|accessdate=April 23, 2009}})&lt;/ref&gt; and seems, at least marginally, to be the most favored graduate student of his advisor, Prof. Smith. At the conclusion of the film, the character states for the first time that his name is '''Winston''', named after Jorge's father; in the films, Winston is a Biochemistry grad student.
* '''Cecilia''' – An engineering student born around May 1, 1980&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia turned 25 in 2005: {{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Birthday 2005|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=583|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=May |accessdate=October 28, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier strips have her born in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia went to her 10 year high school reunion in 2001: {{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=High School Reunion|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=268|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 14, 2001|accessdate=October 28, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Cecilia spent years refusing to admit that she was truly a [[geek]] at heart. However, in one strip&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=25 |title=Geeks Anonymous |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; she finally with hesitation admitted she is indeed a geek. She is also a programmer as well. Addicted to chocolate and cookies, she has long since taken enough classes and conducted enough research to graduate, but a mysterious psychological force keeps her in school. She stated in an interview for a project by her friend Tajel that her father was a professor, a "great teacher",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=The grad student of academia|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=209|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 23, 2000|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; something that may or may not be a motivation for her to go above and beyond (also, her choice of words indicates that her father may have died). During class, she deliberately wears frumpy clothes to discourage male interest, since the vast majority of her classmates are men.

* '''Michael Slackenerny''' – endlessly devious, remarkably clever and phenomenally lazy, Mike did his undergraduate at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Go Cardinal!|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=151|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 11, 1999|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet had been in graduate school for longer than anyone can remember (during one of his interviews it was strongly implied that he started grad school in the 1980s), surviving on ''[[ramen]]'' and free food from various events on campus. He views grad school not as a place but as "a state of mind [...] preferably sleeping".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Coming back to grad school|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=394|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=December 8, 2003|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1998, he drove to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with a seemingly foolproof plan to beat the [[blackjack]] tables, thereby winning enough money to solve Stanford's housing crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Slackenerny – going to Vegas|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=72|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=May 22, 1998|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he returned with a wife, '''Jen''', who remained an [[unseen character]] for some time. Jen became pregnant with their daughter '''Sophy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Paternity leave|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=676|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=January 23, 2006|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; and stayed that way for several years, constantly urging Michael to finish his thesis and graduate. Michael finally completed his doctoral defense in 2005 – Jen went into labor just before his presentation began – but did not finish writing his thesis until 2007. After submitting his dissertation, Mike was seen walking home and asking himself, "Now what?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Now what?|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=844|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=April 2, 2007|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of job-hunting, he was finally hired by Prof. Smith as a [[postdoc]].
* '''Tajel''' – an [[anthropologist]] and the lone social scientist in the main cast. She was Cecilia's roommate before she got married. She is a dedicated [[activism|activist]] who frequently attends or organizes rallies. Her frustration with U.S. politics is exacerbated by her not being a United States citizen. She is conversant in Spanish. Her mother is Indian and her father is Caucasian. She married Dr. Khumalo in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1118 |title=Drama! |publisher=PHD Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1135 |title=Tajel got married |publisher=PHD Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gerard''' – the strip's newest "official" character, he is a major in Medieval [[Scandinavia]]n Cultural Philosophy, who was personally introduced to readers by Tajel, supposedly in response to numerous letters from Humanities majors requesting their own character, and was meant to provide jokes on "obscure manuscripts, dead languages, and being the lowest paid grads on campus. Also, political correctness!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=907 |title=Humanities |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Gerard has only been shown twice after his initial introduction, apart from a cameo as a guest at Tajel's wedding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1134 |title=Tajel getting married, pt. 5 |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in a joke on the obscurity and uselessness of his field.  His first actual storyline within the comic occurs when he is informed that funding has been cut for humanities majors and to leave the strip or find a more useful major, subsequently forcing him to justify why the comic should retain a humanities character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1170 |title=Budget cuts |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dee''' – the hero's younger sister.  She is an [[undergraduate student]] who has been seen taking the [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]]. She also talks on her [[cellular telephone]], eats quite a bit, and naps during class when she isn't doing something even more inappropriate, such as chatting or eating a full meal during a test. Dee once phones her "sister dearest", so the main character may have more than one sibling. Dee has a good male friend who she often spends time with and at one point hints that he may have romantic feelings for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=371 |title=Choosing grad schools |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the main character, he has not yet been named.
* '''Mariko''' – a [[Japan]]ese student in the same research field as the hero, she visits Prof. Smith's lab in 1998. Smith assigns her to work with "whoever is lowest in the lab hierarchy", which turns out to be the hero. During her brief stay, she inspires in him a powerful [[unrequited love|unrequited affection]], which he maintains for at least three years. She eventually quits her [[Ph.D.]] and starts her own company, at which the hero works briefly. She is still occasionally seen talking with the main character as he works, so her current status is somewhat murky.  On a strip dated 28 April 2010, entitled "Lost no more..?", she was seen in an alternate timeline as possibly being the mother of the Nameless Hero's (supposed) baby, with the Nameless Hero asking "WHAT IF I HAD STAYED IN ACADEMIA?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=PHD Comics: Lost no more...?|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1310|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Steve''' (''aka. Golden Boy'') – Remarkably clever, sincere and "good boy". Steve has been in graduate school for two years and has already completed his thesis. In the lab hierarchy he is given more consideration than any of the post docs or research associates by Prof. Smith. He is extremely good in getting positive results and is always consulted by Prof. Smith for his opinion. His "good boy" image in comparison to the nameless hero is a running joke in the series.
* '''Allison''' – The sole female PhD student in Professor Smith's lab, which Smith and the other PhDs often forget to Allison's frustration.  Unlike her labmates, she is not distracted by sporting events like the World Cup and proves to have some measure of athletic ability during the students vs. professors baseball match.

* '''Professor Jones''' – Cecilia's research advisor; a typical graduate school professor, although seemingly older and kinder than Prof. Smith. He is clueless in giving Cecilia advice on non-research related topics such as her lovelife and future career and will ask for her help with small tasks, such as changing the font size of footnotes, while claiming it is urgent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1104 |title=Tech support |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently the only reason he has time to see his wife is because he married his administrative assistant;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Bridge|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=880|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=June 29, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  before he received tenure, he had already been divorced three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=875 |title=Simpler |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a daughter in 1st grade named Shelley,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Cingradella|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=601|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=July 4, 2005|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; who is intelligent enough to fix Mike's work for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Kids!

* '''Dr. Patrick Khumalo''' –  An adjunct professor&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1811  The Dictionary Definition of Adjunct]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Anthropology Department's faculty, who Tajel eventually marries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1124 |title=Permission |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1135 |title=Tajel got married |publisher=PHD Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajel mistakes him for a first-year grad student when they first meet, possibly because she is older than he is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=460 |title=Social |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Professor Rivera''' – Tajel's advisor. He apparently takes a laid-back approach to being an advisor, being entirely clueless as to Tajel's research interests, progress, and sometimes even her name. Once he praised a draft of a paper that Tajel had written, three months after Tajel had already submitted the final paper on due date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=855 | work=Pile Higher and Deeper | last=Cham | first=Jorge | title=Terrific Job | date=27 April 2007 | accessdate=19 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he is extremely elusive when needed, such as when Cecilia needed to find him for documents to allow Tajel to renew her visa, appearing only when Cecilia tried imagining he was the last person she wanted to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1045 |title=Only when you don't need them |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to Professor Stein, the chair of the anthropology department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1127 |title=A very serious matter |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being aware that he lacks any apparent interest in Tajel's work, she is still stunned when he leaves for a position at another university&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1706  It's Official]&lt;/ref&gt; with only an offer of advising her remotely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1708  Remote Advisor]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Professor Galvez''' &amp;ndash; The head of the anthropology department,&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1847  Adoption]&lt;/ref&gt; who becomes Tajel's new advisor after discussion with the rest of the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1848 Close match]&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to Rivera, Galvez apparently has a surly personality&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1897  Gotta Catch Them All]&lt;/ref&gt; and finds Tajel's emails to be too lengthy to bother reading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1876  TL;DR]&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{anchor|Professor Brian S. Smith}}'''Professor Brian S.

But even then, it is clear that Prof. Smith never got over her. When she encounters him at a scientific conference, taunting his work, he has no wits to reply and can only stare longingly at her, until she finally snaps him out of his trance. It is unclear whether she still harbors a buried affection for him in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=The PhD Movie 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2y_a7hL5M|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 24, 2010|accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Smith's current wife presumably hopes not.

==Parodies==
[[Image:Jorge Chum at UIUC by Ragib.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jorge Cham]] after his "Power of Procrastination" talk at [[UIUC]], March 8, 2007]]

The title of the comic comes from an old joke about becoming a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], which explains that if one knows what "[[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]]" stands for (in this context, "bullshit"), then "[[Master of Science|M.S.]]" stands for "More of the Same" (or "More Shit"), and "Ph.D." stands for "Piled Higher and Deeper".

One of Cham's recurring themes is to re-cast an item of [[popular culture]] in the grad-school milieu. Upon several occasions, the strip has included spoofs of popular movies, like ''The Thesis'' (''[[The Matrix]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=138 |title=What is... The Thesis? |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Raiders of the Lost Dissertation'' (''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=158 |title=Raiders of the lost dissertation |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''I, Grad Student'' (a mixture of the [[I, Robot|book]] and [[I, Robot (movie)|movie]] ''I, Robot''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=440 |title=I, Grad Student |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Summer days'' ([[Summer Nights (Grease song)|"Summer Nights"]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=887 |title=Summer Days |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition, Cham has parodied [[television]] programs like ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]],'' among others.

Jorge Cham has also parodied [[Newton's laws of motion]] as ''Newton's 3 Laws of Graduation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=221 |title=Newton`s Three Laws of Graduation |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the strip these laws of graduation were superseded by Einstein's ''Special Theory of Research Inactivity'', much as Newton's actual laws were superseded by Einstein's [[Special Theory of Relativity]].

Another series of strips takes up the modern debate about the proper use of the term "[[irony]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=200 |title=Irony? |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strip has also included several adaptations of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] as well as several [[propaganda]] posters. Captions for the latter include "This man does research for ''you!''", "When you procrastinate... Someone is watching!" and "Women in grad school... Support your local female geek."

Cham has also released two song parodies, purportedly sung by Tajel, in [[MP3]] format: "Closer to fine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=191 |title=Closer to Fine (Academic Version) |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[Indigo Girls#Singles|Indigo Girls]]) and "Who will grade your work"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=194 |title=Who will grade your work? |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Who Will Save Your Soul]]'').

==Books==

Five PhD comic books have been published so far. The first book, ''Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Comic Strip Collection'' (2002), contains production sketches and an [[afterword]] by Prof. Smith in addition to the comic strips.

The second volume, ''Life is Tough and then You Graduate'', was published in April 2005. It contains six strips not published online that explain what happened in Mike's [[thesis defense]]. It also has a foreword by [[Karl Marx]], behind-the-scenes author notes and a [[graduate school]] [[board game]].

The third book, ''Scooped!'', which was released in May 2007, also contains "Tales from the Road", a series of comics that detail Cham's experiences whilst giving his Power of Procrastination tour.

The fourth book, ''Academic Stimulus Package'', was released March 2009. This volume is printed in full color.

The fifth book, ''Adventures in Thesisland'', was released April 2012. This volume is also printed in full color. The introduction is an excerpt from the screenplay of the PHD Movie.

==''Piled Higher and Deeper: the Movie''==
In March 2011, Jorge Cham started filming a movie based on the comic series.  The film production is a collaboration between Cham and a theater group at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. In fall 2011, the film was released on selected academic campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/A-Comic-Strip-That-Skewers/126921/ |title=A Comic Strip That Skewers Academe Will Become a Live-Action Movie |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trailer of the movie is available on the Piled Higher and Deeper website as of June 8, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1433&lt;/ref&gt; After about a year of various campus screenings around the world, the movie became available for purchase on DVD or streaming on April 15, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phdmovie.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The sequel to the movie was shot in the Caltech campus and was released later in 2015.

[[Image:Classic sites 1.png|thumb|right|325px|Remojadas and other important Classic Era settlements]]

'''Remojadas''' ({{IPA-es|remoˈxaðas}}) is a name applied to a [[culture]], an [[archaeological site]], as well as an [[artistic style]] that flourished on [[Mexico|Mexico's]] [[Veracruz]] [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]] from perhaps 100 [[Common Era|BCE]] to 800 CE.   The Remojadas culture is considered part of the larger [[Classic Veracruz culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Among others, Medillin Zenil, p. 168) who says recovered artifacts "reveal a strong technological and ideological relationship" with Central Veracruz.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further research into the Remojadas culture is "much needed".&lt;ref&gt; Coe (2002), p.113.&lt;/ref&gt;  The archaeological site has remained largely unexplored since the initial investigations by [[Alfonso Medellin Zenil]] in 1949 and 1950. 

== Figurines ==
Remojadas is particularly known for its pottery and its hollow [[Ceramics (art)|ceramic]] [[figurine]]s.  Literally thousands of these expressive and diverse figurines have been unearthed, found across a wide variety of settings, including burials and [[midden]]s.  

[[Image:Remojadas Chieftain 1 Art Institute.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A large terracotta figurine of a young chieftain in the Remojadas style.  In his 1957 book on Mesoamerican art, [[Miguel Covarrubias]] speaks of Remojadas' "magnificent hollow figures with expressive faces, in majestic postures and wearing elaborate paraphernalia indicated by added clay elements."&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;300 - 600 CE; Height: 31 in (79 cm).]]
Figurines portray deities, rulers, and commoners, as well as many types of animals including dogs and deer.  Of particular note are the curious childlike ''Sonrientes'' (smiling face) figurines and faces.  Many of the figurines of this period function as [[flute]]s, [[whistle]]s, and [[ocarina]]s.  Some animal figurines, interpreted as toys or more likely ritual items, are equipped with wheels, one of the few recorded instances of the application of wheel technology in the pre-Columbian Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl and Mandeville, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many figurines have filed teeth, representing a common practice in the Remojadas culture.  The earliest figurines were handmade while the later ones were created using [[molding (process)|mold]]s.  In style and in other ways, the figurines have a close kinship with [[Maya civilization|Maya]] figurines.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (2002), p. 119.&lt;br&gt;*Medillin Zenil, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sonrientes''===
The ''Sonrientes'' (smiling faces) are the most well-known of Remojadas figurines, featuring wide smiles on curiously shaped—almost triangular—faces.  Often the heads are disembodied.  Other times they are attached to childlike bodies with outstretched arms and displayed palms.  The smile is rather formalised, usually showing teeth and, on occasion, a tongue sticking out between the teeth.

Male ''sonrientes'' are nude or wear [[loincloth]]es.  Females wear skirts.  Both are usually adorned with pectoral bands and/or necklaces, as well as some type of headdress.  The headdress, and often the skirts, display a [[glyph]]-like emblem or a stylized animal.&lt;ref&gt;Medillin Zenil, p. 163-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smiling figurines are rare in [[Mesoamerica]]n art, and the sheer number of ''Sonrientes'' figurines likely attests to their special role in the Remojadas society, although what that role might be has produced much speculation.  Some researchers see the characteristic smile as being [[hallucinogenic]]ally produced&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps the result of consumption of the alcoholic [[pulque]].&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;  One researcher boldly states that they are "undoubtedly related to the cult of the dead".&lt;ref&gt;Ochoa, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Mary Ellen Miller]] and [[Karl Taube]] find that "it is more likely that many of the smiling figures represent performers".&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==

Its nose is painted with [[bitumen]], a type of crude petroleum.&lt;br&gt;  Height: 7 in. (18 cm); length: 8 in (21 cm).]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2359">Many organizations have used [[sticker]]s to publicize their philosophy or cause. The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), which during its colorful history has [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics|pioneered a variety of creative tactics]], calls its stickers '''silent agitators''', or '''silent organizers'''. Professor [[Eric Margolis (sociologist)|Eric Margolis]] has written about the history of such media,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Wobbly organizers were revolutionary fish swimming in the sea of [[bindle]] stiffs and [[Hobo|tramp]] workers. The Wobbly card was a ticket to ride the rails. "Side door coaches," as box cars were called, were plastered with paper stickers, "silent organizers," that Wobs put up everywhere they passed: "Join the One Big Union," "I Will Win," "Win a World." &lt;ref&gt;Slaughter in Serene: the Columbine Coal Strike Reader, 2005, Prof. [[Eric Margolis (sociologist)|Eric Margolis]], pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Silent agitators were produced by the millions.&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, by William D. Haywood, pp. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Margolis described the way such stickers were used when the Wobblies [[Columbine Mine massacre|called a strike]] in 1927:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bill Lloyd, Superintendent at the Puritan Mine (in [[Colorado]]'s northern coal field), went to work one chilly Autumn morning to discover Wobbly stickers pasted on every timber and cross beam in the place: "Join the Wobblies, Join the Wobblies," he said indignantly, "From the bottom of the shaft clear to the working faces, see, they had these posters."&lt;ref&gt;Slaughter in Serene: the Columbine Coal Strike Reader, 2005, Prof. Eric Margolis, pp. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Bill Haywood|Big Bill Haywood]] described in his autobiography how the IWW issued stickers to propagandize against [[World War I|the war]]. The stickers declared, "Don't be a soldier, be a man. Join the I.W.W. and fight on the job for yourself and [[Working class|your class]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, by William D. Haywood, pp. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5197">The '''solunar theory''' is a [[hypothesis]] that [[animal]]s and [[fish]] move according to the location of the [[moon]] in comparison to their bodies.&lt;ref name="KnightJohn"&gt;Knight, John. "Solunar Tables for Fishermen Produced by Register-Guard." [[The Register-Guard]], 11 May 1949: 10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theory]] was laid out in 1926 by John Alden Knight, but was said to be used by [[hunters]] and [[fishermen]] long before the time it was published.&lt;ref name="KnightJohn" /&gt;

== History ==
In May 1926, John Aldenn Knight put together some fishing [[folklore]] and other fishing factors such as the [[sun]] and the moon, hence the name Solunar (Sol for sun and Lunar for moon) to form a theory on the patterns of animal movement. Knight compiled a list of factors which control or influence the day-to-day behavior of many [[freshwater fish|freshwater]] and [[saltwater fish]]. Each one of the 33 different factors were considered. All but 3 were rejected. The three factors retained were the sun, the moon and the [[tide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solunar.com/the_solunar_theory.aspx The Solunar Theory.]" Solunar. 2007, n.d. Web. 14 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For salt water fishing, tides have long been known as a factor that controls fishes' behavior. As Knight's research progressed, he found that rather than just tides themselves, the relationship of the moon and sun's positions relative to each other may be the determining factor. In addition to the time of moon up ([[:wikt:moonrise|moonrise]]) - moon down, his research determined that there were intermediate times of the day that occurred in between the two major periods. From that he establishes that there were major periods (moon up - moon down) and minor periods. Knight published the first Solunar table in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfwc.com/fishing/freshwater/fishing-tips/solunar-theory |title=Solunar Theory |publisher=Myfwc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tables ==
Solunar tables are tables that fishermen and hunters use to determine the best days of the month and times of the day for catching fish and [[hunting]] game. Knowing the time of the tides, sunrise, and sunset help fishermen predict when fish are going to bite. For hunters, the tides are not a factor. Hunters use the alignment of the sun and the moon to determine when game are likely to be moving the most. Other conditions not being unfavorable, fish will feed, land animals will move about, birds will sing and fly from place to place, in theory, all living things will become more active, more alive, during solunar periods than at other times of apparent equal value. "...anglers have found that it is a guide to the best fishing of each day, and the quality of their sport has improved..."&lt;ref name="flyguys"&gt;[http://flyguys.net/SolunarTable.html Free Solunar Tables – Catch More Fish!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227063247/http://flyguys.net/SolunarTable.html |date=2011-02-27 }}" flyguys.net. flyguys.net, 2011. Web. 16 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Using these tables, a fisherman and a hunter can tell when the moon is directly underfoot or overhead. The strongest activity occurs when there is a full moon or a new moon, and is weakest when there is a quarter moon or a three quarter moon. This is because the combined gravitational force of the moon and the sun is strongest when both are directly above or directly below our heads. People now have access to better lunar data because of improved technology the US Naval Observatory exploits and also because of the availability of, and improvements to, GPS technology. These new technologies have allowed solunar theory to generate hunting and fishing times with much greater precision.&lt;ref name="flyguys" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntfishsport.com/web.aspx?cmd=calendar Solunar Tables - Fish and Game Activity Peak Times for the Current Month] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116041536/http://www.huntfishsport.com/web.aspx?cmd=calendar |date=2012-01-16 }}" huntfishsport.com. Web. 6 Jan 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fishingreminder.com Solunar bite time reminders&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that data in tables found on various websites should be reverified periodically with available US Naval Observatory data, as well as compared against other reputable solunar data providers. Inconsistencies abound due to the complex nature of the astrophysics computations and overlooked associated anomalies-checking that are required to produce useful results. Moon transits which do not occur for more than a day, or associated times being off more than a few minutes are indications of a fundamental issue for a given position and should be suspect. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.usprimetimes.com/faq.html#work0 USPrimetimes Solunar Forecasts FAQ usprimetimes.com.&lt;/ref&gt; All data providers should be verified before assuming data presented is authoritative or accurate. &lt;ref&gt;http://timetofish.info/solunar.html Solunar Table Calendar FAQ timetofish.info.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Stimmen... Verstummen...''''' ([[Russian language|Russian]] ''Слышу... Умолкло...'', [[English language|English]]  ''Voices... Silence...'') is a [[symphony]] in twelve movements by Russian-Tatar composer [[Sofia Gubaidulina]]. It was written in 1986 and dedicated to the conductor [[Gennady Rozhdestvensky]], who gave the first performance in West Berlin with the Moscow State Symphony Orchestra on September 4, 1986. It takes the two words of its title from a poem by [[Francisco Tanzer]].

''Stimmen... Verstummen...'' is primarily organized around two themes. The first is that of a major triad, occurring as D-major in the first, third, and fifth movements and as a G-major triad in the tenth and twelfth movements. The second theme, that of "effort and ruin", occurs in the second, fourth, and sixth movement. Movements I, III, V, and VII become progressively shorter according to the proportions of the [[Fibonacci sequence]]. 

The symphony is notable for its careful and innovative use of silence. Though the eighth movement has the largest proportions of the work, the climax actually takes place in the ninth movement when the conductor motions before a silent orchestra. The motions the conductor makes are meant to make his hands move increasingly farther apart from each other according to the Fibonacci sequence. This "conductor solo" is repeated at the end of the work, when after the last note is sounded the conductor continues to motion for several minutes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4450">[[Roy Harris]]'s '''Symphony No. 3''' is a work written in 1939 and premiered by the conductor [[Serge Koussevitzky]].{{clarify|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--All by himself? Remarkable!--&gt;

==History==
Harris wrote this symphony on a commission from [[Hans Kindler]] but he gave it to [[Serge Koussevitzky]] instead {{harv|Stehman|1984|loc=63–69}}. It has been described as "the quintessential American symphony" ({{harvnb|Canarina|1993}}, {{Page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--This short phrase must appear on just one or at most two pages from the cited three-page article.--&gt;) and "the most widely performed and recorded of all American symphonies" {{harv|Butterworth|1998|loc=84}}.&lt;!-- Other orchestral works may have a broader reception, but the quote is about symphonies, not orchestral works in general. --&gt;

The material that eventually became the opening of the Third Symphony was initially meant to be a violin concerto for [[Jascha Heifetz]], but the commission fell through and Harris decided to turn it into a symphony. The point where the strings enter on middle C was to have been the solo violin's entrance {{harv|Clark and Schuman|1986|loc=334}}.

The score was published by [[G. Schirmer]] in 1940.

==Analysis==
The music is scored for 3 [[flute]]s (the third doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[Cor anglais|English horn (cor anglais)]], 2 [[soprano clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horn]]s, 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, 1 [[euphonium]], 1 [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s, [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[xylophone]], [[vibraphone]] and [[string section|strings]].

According to Harris, the symphony is in five connected sections: Tragic, Lyrical, Pastoral, Fugue Dramatic, Dramatic Tragic. "After the first performance, Harris made two cuts" to the Pastoral section, specifically, measures 274–301 and 308–16 {{harv|Butterworth|1998|loc=86}}. Originally the symphony did not end as in the published version, but stopped rather abruptly. At Koussevitzky's suggestion, Harris added a coda {{harv|Clark and Schuman|1986|loc=334}}.

==Critical reception==

In 1939, Koussevitzky conducted the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] in the premiere. While public reaction was initially chilly, the symphony has subsequently become more popular. This work uses a number of techniques that have become common in subsequent American classical music, including "massive but spacious textures; a new emphasis on vital, syncopated rhythms... and a rich harmonic palette" {{harv|Haskins|n.d.|loc=173–78}}.

Koussevitzky made the world-premiere recording in a performance which Harris "regarded ... as the finest interpretation" {{harv|Butterworth|1998|loc=84}}.

Together with "the [[Symphony No. 2 (Hanson)|Second Symphony]] by [[Howard Hanson]], [and] the Third by [[Robert Ward (composer)|Robert Ward]] ... the Third of Roy Harris" is one of those American symphonies which "are within the capabilities of our [American] community orchestras" {{harv|Van Horn|1979|loc=74}}.

'''''The Book of Alley''''' ({{lang-fa|کتاب کوچه}} ''Ketâb-e Kucheh'') is a series of books about [[Persian language|Persian]] idioms and proverbs by [[Ahmad Shamlou]] coauthored with his wife [[Aida Sarkisian]].

==History==

[[Ahmad Shamlou|Shamlou]] devoted four decades of his life to collecting and organizing [[Iranian folklore]]. Folklore from his perspective is a body of traditional beliefs, customs, and expressions. The language in general, and oral languages in particular, address it through different uses such as proverbs, laments, cries and so on. Therefore the language could be used as an index to folklore as a body of tradition. The research work entitled ''Ketab Kuche ''(Translation: ''The Book of Alley'') indexes the Iranian folklore through the Persian language. The book is a multi-volume, multi-disciplinary work designed as a major source of information, providing a detailed and accurate picture of an important world civilization over a span of several thousand years. ''Ketab Kuche'' is one of the third Iranian national projects on Persian heritage and language beside the [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], a multi-disciplinary reference work and research tool designed to record the facts of Iranian history and civilization and the [[Dehkhoda dictionary]], the largest comprehensive Persian dictionary ever published, comprising 15 volumes. 14 volumes of this book were printed during his lifetime.

After Shamlou's death, his wife [[Aida Sarkisian]] took responsibility for the book.

'''''The Holy Family''''' is an [[oil painting]] on canvas of the [[Holy Family]] by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[James Collinson]]. The painting dates from 1878 when the artist was living in [[Brittany]]. The town in the background may be [[Saint-Malo]].&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;Forbes, C (2001), [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_6_160/ai_80864305 "Images of Christ In Nineteenth-Century British Paintings In The Forbes Magazine Collection"], ''Magazine Antiques, December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The scene is of [[Jesus]] as an infant, with his earthly father [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]. The specific scene does not appear in the Biblical [[Gospel]]s, but it has many precedents in Renaissance art.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; The dove typically represents the [[Holy Spirit]], who took this form at the baptism of Jesus.  

The extremely detailed depiction of the growing flora is closely comparable to Collinson's early Pre-Raphaelite work, and differs from his other paintings from this period.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;

"'''The Hurricane!'''" is the second episode of the [[The Cleveland Show (season 3)|third season]] of the animated comedy series ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', an episode produced for season 2. It is the first part of the [[Night of the Hurricane|Night of the hurricane block]] with ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'', the first such event in the animated television line-up of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. The episode first aired on Fox in the United States on October 2, 2011.

[[Seth MacFarlane]] was initially approached by [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]], the president of the entertainment division of Fox, with the idea of a crossover. The episode was first announced at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]. It was originally scheduled to air on May 1, 2011 as the twenty-first episode for the second season of the series, but was delayed until October 2, 2011 because of the [[2011 Super Outbreak]].&lt;ref name="Futic"&gt;{{cite web|title=FOX Pulls Sunday's "Family Guy" Hurricane Crossover With "The Cleveland Show", "American Dad"|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/04/29/fox-pulls-sundays-family-guy-hurricane-crossover-with-the-cleveland-show-american-dad-198402/9245/#ixzz1Kvwxrocs|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
When a hurricane hits Stoolbend, the Brown/Tubbs family tries to salvage what is left of their vacation despite the lack of any food in the house, and [[Cleveland Brown Jr.|Cleveland, Jr.]]. shocks everyone by revealing that he [[Nontheism|does not believe in God]], although he claims he is not an [[atheism|atheist]] either, which he calls "another religion", pointing out that some atheists, such as [[Brian Griffin]] have been just as condescending and judgmental as those they criticize. The family members attempt to persuade Cleveland, Jr. through reason, emotional appeal, and even a production number, but instead find their own senses of religion and faith tested.

As the storm worsens, a hungry [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] confronts his son over the possibility of having food stored in his room. Cleveland, Jr. explains he used a very scientific method to ration the food. When the family is still resistant to his non-religious lifestyle, accusing him of wanting the food all to himself, Cleveland, Jr. locks the food away in spite. Cleveland calls on God to smite Cleveland, Jr. for his actions, at which point a tree crashes through the house and pins him instead of his son. The family members are unable to lift the tree by hand and decide to pray to God for help. Cleveland, Jr. is able to rig together a pulley system and lifts the tree using his own weight. The family disagrees over whether God was involved in Cleveland, Jr.'s actions and the belief of Cleveland, Jr. is left unresolved as the hurricane [[Seahorse Seashell Party|heads for Quahog]].

He was also willing to do another crossover event if this one receives successful ratings.&lt;ref name="KR"/&gt;

In April 2011, the executives of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] officially announced that the episode would air on May 1 as part of the ''[[Night of the Hurricane]]'' crossover, alongside the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[Seahorse Seashell Party]]" and the ''American Dad!'' episode "[[Hurricane!

[[File:El triunfo de la Iglesia, de Rubens.jpg|thumb]]
'''''The Triumph of the Church''''' or '''''The Triumph of the Church over Fury, Discord and Hatred''''' is a c.1625 painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], now in the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]].

==History==
It forms part of a series of allegorical paintings praising the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]], the Catholic faith and the [[Counter Reformation]] and attacking [[heresy]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]]. They were first conceived as [[modello]]s for monumental tapestries to be displayed during major festivals such as [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] at the [[Convent of Las Descalzas Reales]] in [[Madrid]]. The paintings took from 1622 to 1625 and were commissioned by [[Isabel Clara Eugenia]], daughter of [[Philip II of Spain]] and governor of the [[Spanish Netherlands]], which was not only Rubens' homeland but also included the [[Brussels]] tapestry factories. The tapestries after the paintings were produced between 1627 and 1632 in these factories and in the studio of Jan II Raes, before being sent to the Spanish court. Some of the tapisteries show Rubens introduced changes in his final drawings&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.flandesenhispania.org/tapices/index.php/El_Triunfo_de_la_Iglesia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The other subjects in the cycle were ''The Triumph of Divine Love'', ''The Meeting between Abraham and Melchizedek'', ''The Victory of Virtue over Heresy'', ''The Victory of the Eucharist over Idolatry'' and ''The Defenders of the Eucharist''. They were mainly on allegorical themes with strong propagandistic and doctrinal subtext, along with some on Old Testament episodes. ''The Triumph of the Church'' was probably one of the central works in the cycle and the resulting tapestry was probably the biggest in the set with the most complex themes and composition.
&lt;!---De todos modos, la serie no ha llegado íntegra hasta hoy, y se componía de más tapices.&lt;ref&gt;En la iglesia de san Millán de Oncala (Soria) se conservan réplicas de los tapices originales, incluyendo algunos temas más, como ''La recogida del maná''. Ver noticia en: [http://www.noticiascastillayleon.com/noticia/La-Junta-declara-BIC-a-la-iglesia-de-San-Millan-de-Oncala/58778/3/] También la [[Catedral de Colonia]] posee réplicas de los tapices originales. En diversos museos se conservan otros bocetos o modelos de Rubens, como "Elías y el ángel" o "Ángeles adoradores y músicos", que también pertenecieron a la serie. &lt;/ref&gt;

Seis de los modelos, de mano de Rubens, se conservan en el Museo del Prado. Los tapices resultantes se encuentran en el monasterio para el que fueron encargados.&lt;ref&gt; Web de Patrimonio Nacional: [http://www.patrimonionacional.es/Home/Monasterios-y-Conventos/Monasterio-de-las-Descalzas-Reales.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; En el año [[2014]] se desarrolló en el Prado una exposición que muestra las tablas originales, sometidas a un delicado proceso de restauración, y algunos de los tapices.&lt;ref&gt;Exposición en la web del Prado: [https://www.museodelprado.es/exposiciones/info/en-el-museo/rubens-el-triunfo-de-la-eucaristia]&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt;

==Description and analysis==
&lt;!---

Las pinturas de la serie, más que [[boceto]]s previos, son modelos perfectamente acabados, con gran riqueza de detalles, destinados a servir de guía para la confección de los tapices. La propia naturaleza del tapiz hace que la gama cromática, al igual que los contrastes entre luces y sombras típicos de Rubens, sean más planos que en otros trabajos suyos, lo que no es óbice para que sean obras muy bellas y elaboradas. Todas las pinturas del ciclo se estructuran de idéntica forma, simulando una arquitectura con una [[columnata]] y un [[friso]], ante la cual se despliega un tapiz fingido en el que se desarrolla el tema. Es un artificio característico del Barroco (''cuadro dentro del cuadro'') destinado a reforzar el carácter teatral y equívoco de la imagen.
[[Imagen:Köln - Dom - Teppich 13 ies.jpg|thumb|250px|Réplica del tapiz original, en la [[Catedral de Colonia]]. Se aprecia que la composición está invertida respecto al modelo de Rubens.]]
En la obra que nos ocupa, la escena se desarrolla ante una columnata [[columna salomónica|salomónica]], ante la que dos querubines despliegan el tapiz. Dos elementos sobresalen tanto por su posición central en el cuadro como por encontrarse superpuestos en [[trampantojo]]: la cartela que debía mostrar el título (que aparece vacía; en el tapiz final, lleva la inscripción ''ECCLESIAE TRIVMPHVS'') y un [[jeroglífico]] o símbolo en la parte inferior: un globo terráqueo rodeado por una serpiente que se muerde la cola (el ''[[ouroboros]]'', símbolo de la eternidad), un timón, una palma y una rama de roble, símbolos respectivamente del gobierno recto, el puto de mierda y la fortaleza. Todos estos símbolos, junto con las guirnaldas de frutas y los angelotes, que representan la abundancia, aluden a las virtudes características de la Iglesia.

El tapiz fingido es una escena compleja, llena de simbolismo, con numerosas figuras muy vivaces y movidas; Rubens muestra en ella su dominio del lenguaje alegórico, su facilidad compositiva y sobre todo, su innata capacidad de generar dinamismo y movimiento en sus composiciones.

La escena es un cortejo triunfal al modo de los desfiles de los emperadores romanos. Una [[cuadriga]] de caballos blancos introduce la composición por la izquierda, precedida de tres figuras femeninas que sostienen las riendas o acarician a los caballos; una cuarta mujer, de la cual solo apreciamos la parte posterior, precede a todo el cortejo. En el pedo, espíritus angélicos tocan trompetas; uno de ellos, con forma femenina, porta una corona de laurel y una palma. Montado sobre uno de los caballos, un ángel mancebo, coronado de laurel, porta el [[conopeo]], sobre el que se muestran las llaves de oro y plata de los [[papa]]s. Tras él, un [[querubín]] lleva las riendas del carro, mientras vuela sobre él la paloma del [[Espíritu Santo]]  entre glorias de ángeles y resplandores. Sobre el carro, de oro y adornado con gemas, una matrona, vestida de seda plateada y manto púrpura, sostiene una gran custodia con la Eucaristía. Un ángel sostiene la [[tiara papal]] sobre ella, mostrando que representa a la Iglesia Católica.

El carro de la Iglesia, en su marcha triunfal, abate y arrolla unas figuras oscuras que apenas se pueden asomar entre las ruedas: una de ellas, huesuda y con una tea, representaría la Furia o la Ira; otra, con la cabeza ensortijada de serpientes, figura la Discordia; mientras que un hombre barbado gesticula bajo las ruedas del carro, personificando el Odio. Cierran la composición por la derecha dos rudas figuras masculinas, atadas con cuerdas, una con los ojos vendados (la Ceguera) y la otra con orejas de asno (la Ignorancia); ambas muestran haber sido dominadas y reconducidas por una mujer que sostiene un candil encendido en lo alto, como personificación de la Verdad.

Las pinturas muestran la faceta más decorativa y efectista del arte de Rubens. Constituyen un perfecto ejemplo de arte propagandístico, destinado a reafirmar la fe de los fieles en los [[dogma]]s negados por el protestantismo, como la presencia real de Cristo en la Eucaristía. No hay que olvidar que los [[Países Bajos españoles]] se encontraban en ese momento en medio de diversos conflictos de índole religiosa, que habían llevado a la separación de las [[Provincias Unidas de los Países Bajos]] del dominio de España en [[1579]].

'''''Tramp Royale''''' is a nonfiction travelogue by science fiction writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]], describing how he and his wife, [[Virginia Heinlein|Ginny]], went around the world by ship and plane between 1953 and 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-441-82184-6|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Tramp Royale by Robert A. Heinlein|work=Publishers Weekly|date=March 30, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published posthumously in 1992, and subsequently went out of print.

Much of the book is devoted to social and political commentary and observation, including two lengthy but half-hearted defenses of the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy hearings]], about which the Heinleins were interrogated repeatedly in the countries they visited. Although Heinlein has been adopted as somewhat of a posterboy by the [[libertarianism|libertarian]] movement, the political commentary reveals that Heinlein was far from being a doctrinaire adherent of any particular political philosophy. For example, he compares the social welfare state of New Zealand unfavorably to that of Uruguay and says that he cannot explain why the one was so much more successful than the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heinleinsociety.org/rah/works/articles/tramproyale.html|title=Heinlein Society: Review of Tramp Royale|publisher=|author=John J. Reilly|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinlein devoted an entire chapter to his (almost) visit to [[Tristan da Cunha]], arguably the most remote human settlement on Earth. He described the islands as being so far from the rest of human civilization that the next closest human settlement, [[St. Helena]], "[is] itself so remote that it was picked as a safe prison for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] after he crushed his way out of [[Elba]]". Tristan da Cunha is {{convert|2430|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from St. Helena.

This trip, along with Heinlein's experiences as a naval officer, appears to have provided a great deal of the background material for some of Heinlein's science fiction novels, such as passenger liners used in ''[[Podkayne of Mars]]'' (in space) and in ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'' (on the oceans). Much of the humor in the book consists of riffs on the idea that Ginny is the hothead, while Robert is the easygoing one. For example, in a shipboard incident at the captain's table, Robert continues eating his dessert after being doused in salad during a food fight started by Ginny.

[[File:Tribute in Light in 2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|In 2010, as seen from [[Brooklyn]].]]
The '''''Tribute in Light''''' is an art installation of 88 [[searchlight]]s placed six blocks south of the [[World Trade Center site|World Trade Center]] on top of the Battery Parking Garage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Tribute in Light|url=https://www.911memorial.org/tribute-light|website= 9/11 Memorial||publisher= National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|accessdate= June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City]] to create two vertical columns of light to represent the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] in remembrance of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref name=godark&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/will-the-tribute-in-light-go-dark-after-08/|publisher=New York Times|title=Will ''Tribute in Light'' Go Dark After ’08?|date=September 11, 2007|first=Sewell|last=Chan|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tribute in Light'' began initially as a temporary commemoration of the attacks in early 2002 but became an annual commemoration, currently produced on September 11th by the [[Municipal Art Society]] of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute in Light|url=http://creativetime.org/programs/archive/2002/tribute/main.html|website=creativetime.org|publisher=Creative Time, Inc.|accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/tribute_in_light_shines_bright_every_year_since_20.html | location= | work=NJ.com | first=John | last=Munson | title=Tribute in Light shines bright every year since 2002 | date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute in Light|url=https://www.mas.org/programs/tribute-in-light/|website=mas.org|publisher=The Municipal Art Society of New York|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On clear nights, the lights can be seen from over {{Convert|60|mi}} away, visible in all of [[New York City]] and most of suburban [[North Jersey|Northern New Jersey]] and [[Long Island]]. The lights can also be seen in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], as well as [[Westchester County|Westchester]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]], and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] counties in [[New York State|New York]]. The beams have been clearly visible as far north as the terrace at Century Country Club in [[Purchase, New York]], from at least as far west as western [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]], in [[Flanders, New Jersey]], at least as far east as the barrier beach of [[Fire Island]] in [[Suffolk County, New York]] on Long Island, and as far south near [[Trenton, New Jersey]] in nearby [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2035010/9-11-anniversary-Tribute-Light-rises-New-York.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Lee | last=Moran | title=Twinkling tribute to the Twin Towers: World Trade Center rises in poignant pillars of light as New York makes final preparations for 9/11 anniversary | date=September 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two beams cost approximately $1,626 (assuming $0.11 per [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]]) to run for 24 hours. There are 88 xenon spotlights (44 for each tower) which each consume 7,000 [[watt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chaban|first1=Matt|title=The End of Tribute in Light: Memorial Goes Dark Forever on 9/12|url=http://observer.com/2011/08/the-end-of-tribute-in-light-memorial-goes-dark-forever-on-912/|website=observer.com|publisher=Observer|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Tribute in Light (10092).jpg|thumb|Tribute in Light set up atop Battery Parking Garage in 2018]]
The idea of two vertical beams of light was first suggested by Ezra Orion, an Israeli sculptor, in 1997. Orion proposed an art installation in which 120 Xenon searchlights were to be placed on the tops of the Twin Towers for the 1998 [[4th of July]] celebration.  On September 25th, 1997, Orion met with Richard Hart, the president of Xenotech Lighting, and the municipal art adviser, at the top of the south tower.  Although the response to Orion’s suggestion was enthusiastic, it was deemed too expensive. 

The ''Tribute in Light'' initially ran as a temporary installation from March 11 to April 14, 2002, and ran again on September 11, 2003 to mark the second anniversary of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/tribute_in_light_shines_bright_every_year_since_20.html | location= | work=NJ.com | first=John | last=Munson | title=Tribute in Light shines bright every year since 2002 | date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has been repeated every year on September 11. It was announced that 2008 would be its final year,&lt;ref name=godark&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but the tribute was continued in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=NY1.com|title=September 11th Tribute Lights Up Again|url=http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/105290/september-11th-tribute-lights-up-again/Default.aspx"|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914135857/http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/105290/september-11th-tribute-lights-up-again/Default.aspx|archivedate=September 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2009, it was confirmed that the tribute would continue through to the tenth anniversary of the attacks in 2011, but continued again in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/tribute-in-light-will-keep-shining-this-year-and-the-next//|publisher=New York Times|title=‘Tribute in Light’ Will Keep Shining, This Year and the Next|date=September 10, 2010|first=David W.|last=Dunlap|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 23, 2012, plans are underway for the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] to assume the lease for the MTA property used during this tribute, and to begin transitioning operation of the tribute from the Municipal Art Society to the memorial foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Ted|title='Tribute' Handover|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443437504577545520666491842|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 23, 2012|accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those working on the project came up with the concept in the week following the attack.  On September 13, 2001, the concept was introduced by John Englehart in a meeting with the crisis communications task force at the electric utility [[Consolidated Edison]], as a signal of support for the community.  Architects John Bennett and Gustavo Bonevardi of PROUN Space Studio distributed their "Project for the Immediate Reconstruction of Manhattan's Skyline". Artists Julian LaVerdiere and Paul Myoda, who before September 11 were working on the 91st floor of the World Trade Center north tower on a proposed light sculpture on the giant radio antenna with [[Creative Time]], conceived of a project called "Phantom Towers". They were commissioned by ''[[The New York Times Magazine]],'' ([[Janet Froelich]], art director) to create an image of the project for its September 23 cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TRIBUTE IN LIGHT|url=http://creativetime.org/programs/archive/2002/tribute/main.html|website=creativetime.org|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Nash Gould, a New York architect, presented the concept to the [[Municipal Art Society]]. On September 19, Municipal Art Society chairman [[Philip K. Howard]] wrote to Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], asking him "to consider placing two large searchlights near the disaster site, projecting their light straight up into the sky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mas.org/programs/tributeinlight/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825172813/http://mas.org/programs/tributeinlight/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 25, 2010|title=Tribute In Light –  The Municipal Art Society of New York|publisher=|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some consideration, it was decided to contact lighting experts in the field of high intensity light displays. A [[Las Vegas]]-based company, Light America, was chosen because of their vast knowledge of high intensity light displays. Gary Evans, the VP of Light America, and Michael Burns, the designer of the ''Tribute in Light'', said that the company did testing of the lighting fixtures in the [[Las Vegas Valley]] before bringing the fixtures to the World Trade Center site.

The project was originally going to be named ''Towers of Light'', but the victims' families felt that the name emphasized the buildings destroyed instead of the people killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1857699.stm|title=Tribute in light to New York victims|accessdate=April 27, 2008 | work=BBC News | date=March 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent fixture of the ''Tribute in Light'' was at one point intended to be installed on the roof of [[One World Trade Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom Tower rendering Time-lapse|url=http://www.wtc.com/media/videos|publisher=Silverstein Properties Inc.|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOM Freedom Tower Fact Sheet|url=http://www.renewnyc.com/content/pdfs/freedom_tower_fact_sheet.pdf|publisher=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not included in the finished design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design changes to base, spire of 1 World Trade Center|url=http://www.myfoxny.com/story/19229185/new-renderings-of-1-wtc-show-design-changes|publisher=''Fox New York''|accessdate=March 22, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317171748/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/19229185/new-renderings-of-1-wtc-show-design-changes|archivedate=March 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the generators that power ''Tribute in Light'' have been fueled with biodiesel made from used cooking oil collected from local restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bevill|first1=Kris|title=Tri-State Biodiesel fuels Sept. 11 memorial|url=http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/2726/tri-state-biodiesel-fuels-sept.-11-memorial/|publisher=Biodiesel Magazine|accessdate=September 12, 2017|date=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on birds==
The [[light pollution]] from ''Tribute in Light'' has caused confusion for thousands of migrating birds, trapping them in the beams.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doren|first=Benjamin M.

==Media appearances==
''Tribute in Light'' was featured in [[Boyz II Men]]'s music video for "Color of Love". It made a notable appearance during the opening credits of [[Spike Lee]]'s 2002 film ''[[25th Hour]]''. It also appeared as a virtual memorial in the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' video game for Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The tribute was also shown and referenced in the [[CBS]] series ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]''.

 |ShortSummary= In the premiere of the show, Tim Gunn introduces the three mentors to a group of 15 designers. He separates the designers into 2 groups- group one with 8 and the group two with 7. He announces that 3 designers will be eliminates, and that the second group will not be participating in the first challenge. The first group is led into the workroom and given a bag of 6 3-yard pieces of fabric that they have 6 hours to make an outfit that shows their design aesthetics. After the runway, the mentors take turns to pick out their team. Designers who are chosen by more than one mentor are given the opportunity to choose their mentor. Nick becomes disheartened when it appears that he is unpopular with the designers.

'''Sixth Selection:''' Oscar

This leaves Melissa and Natalia in the bottom two; the mentors bemoan the simplicity of Melissa's look, and raise doubts about Natalia's taste and time management. However, after a tearful appeal to the judges, both Nick and Mondo invite Natalia to be on their teams. Citing construction concerns, she ultimately chooses Nick, to his delight.

 |Title= The Mentor Face Off

 |ShortSummary= The second group is given 30 seconds to pick out as much fabric as they want from drums scattered around the FIDM courtyard and given 6 hours to create a look that represents their aesthetic. Cognizant of the fact that there are fewer open positions for their group, several of the designers "up their game," creating a more competitive playing field for the mentors.

This leaves one spot on Nick's team open. Stephanie, Amy, and Rey plead their cases to Nick, but ultimately Nick states that his mind was already made up, and chooses Stephanie for his final mentee, leaving a disappointed Amy and a somewhat aggravated Rey to be eliminated.

 |ShortSummary= Tim takes the designers and mentors for a bus tour around hollywood to inspire the designers to come up with a red carpet look, with Zanna Roberts Rassi citing that the winning look would be worn by a celebrity in a future publication of ''Marie Claire''. As Tim analyzes the mentors, he finds himself stepping in to stop Nick from getting too hands-on with his designers. During the runway critique, Sam's outfit stands out for approaching red carpet clothing from a different direction and he is awarded the win; conversely, Camila is sent home for keeping her look too plain.

She sets the designers with the task of making an outfit using vampire-related materials, which the designers have to run and collect from a in a graveyard-setting in the FIDM courtyard. Despite landing in the bottom two the previous week, Michelle is awarded the win over Asha for this challenge,  while Anya is given the task of choosing between Brady and Nicholas as the losing designer. Ultimately, she decides that Nicholas has more potential, and sends Brady home.

 |Title= Hit the Stage
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|2|13}}
 |ShortSummary= The designers must create a performance look for Zendaya to wear onstage while on tour. The designers seem to struggle with this challenge, and during the runway critique, seven designs are critiqued, with only Shan and Asha landing on top, while Nick's entire group (Stephanie, Oscar, Natalia, and Isabelle) and Blake end up on the bottom. Despite an overwhelming consensus from the judges that seems to point to Isabelle's elimination, Nick figuratively throws her under the bus after being unable to successfully help her manage her time, which causes concern amongst his remaining designers. Zendaya--tasked with choosing the winning designer--clearly heavily favors Asha's design, and awards her the win.

 |Title= Pompeii Team Challenge
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|2|20}}
 |ShortSummary=  The first team challenge requires the designers to create mini collections of 3 cohesive pieces, inspired by the Getty Villa and the movie, Pompeii. Nick's team has a shaky start, and seems unable to reach common ground. Oscar takes over the group in order to turn things around, and Nick's group ultimately ends up winning the challenge, with Oscar being cited as the clear winner in his group. Mondo's team is safe, while Anya's team is declared the losing team. Blake's outfit is praised by the judges, which leaves Shan and Nicholas up for elimination. Ultimately neither designer is eliminated due to their "potential."

 |ShortSummary=  The designers are challenged to make avant-garde outfits inspired by steampunk, utilizing unconventional materials found at Travel Town Museum in Griffith Park, Los Angeles. Tensions run high between Anya and Nicholas because of his consecutive bad performances, whereas Shan has upped his game after his near elimination. Shan wins the challenge, and Anya is yet again given the task between sending Blake or Nicholas home. Apparently learning from her mistake the first time, she chooses Blake to stay.

 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|3|6}}
 |ShortSummary=  The designers enjoy a beach party in the California sun and then are challenged to use the materials from the seaside bash to create their looks. Frustrated with being safe since his initial win, Sam seems to struggle with his look, whereas Oscar has difficultly settling on a design for the challenge. Tim criticizes him for relying too much on the mentor critique to drive his design choices. After the runway, Mondo is given the responsibility of awarding the win to either Sam or Asha, ultimately choosing Sam for overcoming his frustrations with the challenge, and sticking to his design aesthetic. Sam is also awarded a bonus prize for creating the look that best matched the mood of the California beach party challenge. Even though Michelle is harshly criticized for making a cocktail waitress outfit and not utilizing enough unconventional materials, it's Stephanie who is sent home for yet again failing to deliver a compelling runway look.

 |Title= Crossing Teams
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|3|20}}
 |ShortSummary=   The designers are placed in pairs across mentor groups to create a 3 look mini collection to be manufactured and sold at Francesca's. Shan and Oscar, Blake and Sam, and Natalia and Asha are paired up for this challenge. Asha is noticeably unhappy about the proposition of working with the unpredictable Natalia, and the two butt heads when Natalia seems to be wasting time. The mentors collaborate on their critiques, with Nick and Mondo seemingly disagreeing over the direction of the Asha/Natalia pairing. Several of the designers provide interviews saying that Natalia is faking her incessant emotional outbursts.

Oscar, Shan, Sam, and Blake are in contention for the win, with both Shan and Oscar being chosen as the winner. Asha and Natalia both give tearful speeches after being asked which of them should be sent home, and though neither of them actually give a clear answer, Natalia insinuates that she wouldn't want Asha to feel as though she was being sent home for something Natalia did. Ultimately, Natalia is eliminated for her poor construction.

 |Title= The Benefit of Fashion
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|3|27}}
 |ShortSummary=   The designers are paired with clients who have specific fashion needs, and are tasked with giving them makeovers.

'''Oscar:''' Dani has to shop in the children's sections of stores due to her petite stature, and is in need of a more age appropriate wardrobe.
'''Shan:''' Brittany is a single mom looking for exciting date look to break up the monotony of her day wear.
'''Blake:''' Ruzena is looking to have her tomboyish image more feminized.
'''Sam:''' Norah is looking for something that she can wear from the office to the bar.
'''Asha:''' Erin is looking for a birthday outfit that celebrate her recent 50lb weight loss.

All of the designers seemingly struggle in this challenge--Asha frets that the judges will send her home for the most minor issue after the previous week, while Sam is criticized for his poor fabric choices. Shan's client has an allergic reaction to sequins, and he has to make a dress for her in the two hours before the runway show. On the runway, Oscar is criticized for making Dani look old, whereas Sam and Blake both struggle to give their clients interesting designs. Asha is praised for making Erin glow with happiness, while Shan is credited with his think quick design, and is awarded the win and a bonus prize for his resourcefulness.

 |ShortSummary=   The designers are tasked with creating looks inspired by the attributes of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] Superheroes. Sam becomes emotional after he connects Hawkeye's story to his struggles as a young gay teen, and shares that his mother accidentally prevented him from committing suicide, which he had never told her. Despite this emotional breakthrough, he and Asha are put up for elimination, both of whom seem sad to be losing their best friend right before the finale. However, in a twist, both designers from Mondo's team are put through to the finale, to the distaste of the other designers and mentors.

 |Title= Finale
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2014|4|10}}
 |ShortSummary=   The designers must create their collections in three days. The winning designer and mentor are chosen.

'''Sam's Collection:''' Inspired by the armor people build up to protect themselves, and how his armor crumbled during the competition.
'''Asha's Collection:''' Inspired by "Coming to America" and the idea of Queen Nefertiti in Harlem.
'''Oscar's Collection:" Inspiration unclear; seems to be inspired by Cuba and women giving life. Recycles past designs.
'''Shan's Collection:''' Inspired by the dichotomy of hard and soft, using leather and lace.

In the workroom, Nick is surprised at how directional Sam's collection is turning out, while Sam declares Asha his biggest competition. During critique, Mondo challenges both Asha and Sam to make their designs less costumey. Shan struggles to come up with a cohesive statement, and Oscar is reprimanded for repeating past looks.

On the runway, Sam is lauded for his ability to create a cohesive, salable collection out of highly disparate fabric choices but criticized for not creating more of a show. Asha is told her collection is "next level" by the sitting judges, who appreciate her growth in the competition; however Neil and Heidi find it to be too costumey. Oscar is praised by the guest judges for a gorgeously made collection, but the main judges are disappointed at how many of his looks are disappointing remakes. The judges' disappointment in Shan's collection is palpable, with Jen Rade looking nearly in tears.

The judges debate the criteria of who should win the challenge, and Tim has to reiterate the nature of the challenge itself. Shan is left out of the conversation while Asha, Oscar, and Sam are thrown around as potential winners. Ultimately, the decision comes down to Oscar and Sam, and the former is declared the winner of Under the Gunn.

'''Shantaram Rajaram Vankudre''' (18 November 1901 – 30 October 1990), referred to as '''V. Shantaram or Shantaram Bapu''', was a Marathi Indian [[Filmmaking|filmmaker]], [[film producer]] and actor.&lt;ref name="Tilak2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tilak, Shrinivas |title=Understanding Karma: In Light of Paul Ricoeur's Philosophical Anthropology and Hemeneutics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1xXDHLlNYIC&amp;pg=PA306|accessdate=19 June 2012|year=2006|publisher=International Centre for Cultural Studies|isbn=978-81-87420-20-0|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is most known for films such as ''[[Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani]]'' (1946), ''[[Amar Bhoopali]]'' (1951), ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje]]'' (1955), ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]]'' (1957), ''[[Navrang]]'' (1959), ''[[Duniya Na Mane]]'' (1937), ''[[Pinjra (film)|Pinjra]]'' (1972), ''Chani'', ''Iye Marathiche Nagari'' and ''Zunj''.

==Career==
V. Shantaram started his film career doing odd jobs in Maharashtra Film Co. owned by [[Baburao Painter]] at [[Kolhapur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaplaza.com/Promo/vshantaram/page2.shtml Biography – The V. Shantaram Centennial Collection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902234856/http://www.indiaplaza.com/Promo/vshantaram/page2.shtml |date=2 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to debut as an actor in the silent film ''Surekha Haran'' in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenindia.com/old/20001208/falis.htm Remembering the Pioneer] screenindia. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923154918/http://www.screenindia.com/old/20001208/falis.htm |date=23 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shantaram, fondly known as Annasaheb, had an illustrious career as a filmmaker for almost six decades. He was one of the early filmmakers to realize the efficacy of the film medium as an instrument of social change and used it successfully to advocate humanism on one hand and expose bigotry and injustice on the other. V. Shantaram had a very keen interest in music. It is said that he "ghost wrote" music for many of his music directors, and took a very active part in the creation of music. Some of his songs had to rehearsed several times before they were approved by V. Shantaram.

He directed his first film ''[[Netaji Palkar (film)|Netaji Palkar]]'', in 1927.&lt;ref name="Lal2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lal, S. |title=50 Magnificent Indians Of The 20Th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkI1_n4QAxMC&amp;pg=PT274|accessdate=20 February 2015|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7992-698-7|pages=274–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, he founded the [[Prabhat Film Company]] along with [[Vishnupant Damle]], K.R.

He was praised by [[Charlie Chaplin]] for his Marathi film ''[[Manoos]]''. Chaplin reportedly liked the film to a great extent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://in.movies.yahoo.com/news/charlie-chaplin-saluted-v-shantaram-140157157.html Charlie Chaplin saluted V. Shantaram]. In.movies.yahoo.com (18 November 2013). Retrieved on 2018-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shantaram introduced his daughter [[Rajshree]] (his daughter by Jayashree) and [[Jeetendra]] in the 1964 film ''[[Geet Gaya Patharon Ne]]''. That was the debut film for both of them. He also introduced his second wife Sandhya's niece [[Ranjana Deshmukh]] into the Marathi film industry through ''Chandanachi Choli Ang Ang Jaali'', directed by his son Kiran Shantaram in 1975. Ranjana dominated the Marathi silver screen in the 70s and 80s.

The [[Dadasaheb Phalke Award]] was conferred on him in 1985.&lt;ref name=phalke&gt;[http://www.ultraindia.com/movies/awards/vshantaram.htm 17th Awardee] Dada Saheb Phalke Awards, List of Awardees. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725024304/http://www.ultraindia.com/movies/awards/vshantaram.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Padma Vibhushan]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india.gov.in/myindia/padmavibhushan_awards_list1.php Official List of Awardees] Padma Vibhushan. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115044717/http://india.gov.in/myindia/padmavibhushan_awards_list1.php |date=15 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The V. Shantaram Award was constituted by Central Government and Maharashtra State Government. The V. Shantaram Motion Picture Scientific Research and Cultural Foundation, established in 1993, offers various awards to film-makers. The award is presented annually on 18 November.&lt;ref name=phalke/&gt; A postage stamp dedicated to Shantaram was released by [[India Post]] on 17 November 2001.

==Personal life==
Shantaram was born in 1901 at [[Kolhapur]] to a Marathi family with a Jain father and Hindu mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lyden, John |title=The Routledge Companion to Religion and Film |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9OJLAZakI4C&amp;pg=PA148 |year=2009 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-44853-6 |pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, aged 20, he married 12-year-old Vimalabai, a girl of his own community and similar background, in a match arranged by their families in the usual Indian manner. Their marriage lasted their entire lives and its relationships of harmony and mutual support survived even his subsequent two marriages, which were concurrent with his first. Vimalabai bore four children, being son Prabhat Kumar (after whom Shantaram named [[Prabhat Film Company|his movie company]]) and daughters Saroj, Madhura and Charusheela. Shantaram's second daughter Madhura is the wife of [[Pandit Jasraj]] and mother of music director Shaarang Dev Pandit and of TV personality [[Durga Jasraj]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/jai-ho-jasraj/article2254030.ece Jai ho! Jasraj]. ''The Hindu''. 8 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Shantaram's third daughter, Charusheela, is the mother of Hindi and Marathi actor Sushant Ray a.k.a. [[Siddharth Ray]].

On 22 October 1941, Shantaram (aged 40) married the actress Jayashree (née Kamulkar), with whom he had fallen in love while they worked together in several films, including ''Shakuntala'' (1942) which ran for 104 weeks in Mumbai. Jayashree became Shantaram's second wife, and was received with traditional ceremonies by his first wife Vimalabai. Until January 1957, it was perfectly legal (and in keeping with ancient custom) for Hindu men to have more than one wife at a time, and it was typical for the wives to live harmoniously together in the same household. Jayashree bore Shantaram three children – one son, the Marathi film director and producer [[Kiran Shantaram]],&lt;ref name="Gavankar2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavankar, Nilu N. |title=The Desai Trio and the Movie Industry of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGAyEpXtK3UC&amp;pg=PA139|accessdate=5 May 2013|date=26 July 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-9981-7|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 50 years of a Shantaram classic | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/50-years-of-a-Shantaram-classic/articleshow/2033356.cms |author=Mishra, Ambarish |date=28 September 2006| accessdate = 22 September 2014 | publisher = The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two daughters, [[Rajshree]] (the actress) and Tejashree. Shantaram's six children grew up playing and bonding with each other. The two wives also had a cordial relationship and often interacted with each other, although they maintained separate houses. Vimalabai was strongly bonded with Shantaram's extended family; she would be at her husband's side at all religious and family finctions that they attended, and she would be hostess whenever they themselves hosted such functions. On the other hand, Jayashree would accompany Shantaram to all events and functions connected with the film industry and the film profession and at any parties he hosted for the film fraternity.

In the early 1950s, Shantaram grew close to another of his leading ladies, the actress [[Sandhya Shantaram|Sandhya]] (née Vijaya Deshmukh), who was his co-star in many films like ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje]]'', ''Navrang'', ''[[Jal Bin Machhli Nritya Bin Bijli]]'' and ''Sehra''. Vimalabai did not have much contact with Shantaram's professional associates and took Sandhya in her stride, but the case was different with Jayashree, who came to regard Sandhya as an ambitious gold-digger who was using the middle-aged Shantaram for her own purposes, to become a successful actress at his expense and riding on his shoulders. Things came to a head during the making of ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' a film which Shantaram was producing and which featured him and Sandhya in the main roles. Shantaram ran short of money while making the film, and asked his wives to give him their jewellery so that he could mortgage the same and raise funds to get over the cash crunch. The jewellery would be redeemed and returned to the ladies after the movie was completed, he said. Vimalabai agreed without fuss and handed over her jewellery, but Jayashree did not, apparently because she suspected that the jewellery would end up in Sandhya's possession. This led to a misunderstanding between the couple. Later, Jayashree realized that money was indeed the problem and that in fact, even Sandhya had parted with her jewels in order to help Shantaram. When she came to know this, Jayashree felt bad that she was the only person to have retained her jewellery. On some minor occasion (a birthday), she tried to make amends by gifting some of her jewellery to Sandhya, so that the latter could have some jewels at least. However, Sandhya declined the gift by saying that she had lately stopped wearing jewellery. Jayashree took offence at the snub and the rift between the ladies grew. It became clear that they would not be able to live harmoniously together the way Vimalabai and Jayashree were living. It also became clear that there existed a widening rift between Jayashree and Shantaram also.

Finally, Shantaram and Jayashree were divorced on 13 November 1956. This was one of the earliest divorces to be granted in India, because it happened only weeks after parliament passed a law making it possible for Hindus to get a divorce; previous to this, divorce had been literally impossible for Hindus. According to Shantaram's daughter by Vimalabai, neither Shantaram not Jayashree could ever forget each other in later life and both of them deeply regretted that the parting of ways.

Hardly a month after the divorce, on 22 December 1956, Shantaram married Sandhya. This marriage was also legally valid because the law which forbade bigamy for Hindu men would come into effect only on 1 January 1957; it was therefore one of the last bigamous marriages to be conducted among Hindus in India. Sandhya had met Vimalabai many times before her wedding, and when the wedding was being finalized, she told Vimalabai that she would only marry Shantaram if Vimalabai not only gave her willing consent but also permitted her to stay in the same house with her. Touched by Sandhya's humility, goodness and traditional values, Vimalabai wholeheartedly gave her consent. She performed the traditional ceremonies and received her new co-wife into her household. The two ladies lived together harmoniously in the same house not just during Shantaram's lifetime but even after his death. Vimalabai and Sandhya enjoyed a close and cordial relationship with each other, which was enhanced because of the large age difference between them, because of their common values of ''pativratha sanskar,'' and also because it was known from the beginning that Sandhya would never bear children. This was because Shantaram had undergone an operation after the birth of Jayashree's third child, which left him incapable of begetting further progeny. Sandhya had been informed of this fact and had accepted it knowingly, which earned her great respect in her new home and put to rest all the speculation about her being a gold-digger. She would often say in Marathi “Hey sagle majhe mula aahet (all these are my kids)" indicating Shantaram's seven children. Sandhya treated Vimalabai with great respect at all times, and Vimalabai looked upon Sandhya with deep affection. In the professional field, Sandhya worked exclusively with her husband and refused all film offers made by other film-makers. She starred in some of Shantaram's biggest hits like ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' ''[[Navrang]],'' ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje]]'' and ''[[Pinjra (film)|Pinjra]].''

Shantaram died on 30 October 1990 in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/14188 Biography] American Film Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by all three of his wives. Even his second wife Jayashree, who was divorced from him, attended his funeral rites, participated in the rituals, and took to wearing the garb of a widow thereafter, thus indicating that the piece of legal paper which constituted their divorce was only a paper. Vimalabai and Sandhya continued to reside together in one house along with Vimalabai's son Prabhat and his wife and children. Vimalabai, passed away in 1996 after being bedridden for four years. Sandhya lives today in the care and company of Vimalabai's children, especially of Prabhat and his family.

Shantaram used to live at [[Panhala]] near [[Kolhapur]] in [[Maharashtra]] state. His daughter Saroj has maintained his house and has converted it into a hotel named Valley View.
