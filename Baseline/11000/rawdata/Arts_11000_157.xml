'''Aliza Olmert''' ({{lang-he|עליזה אולמרט}}; born 1946) is an Israeli artist, photographer, author and social worker. She is married to former Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Aliza olmert 1.jpg|thumb|right|Laura Bush welcomes Aliza Olmert]]

Aliza Olmert was born in a [[displaced persons camp]] in [[Eschwege]], [[Germany]]. Her parents were [[Holocaust]] survivors from [[Łódź]], [[Poland]]. She immigrated to Israel with her family in 1949, grew up in [[Ramat Gan]], and served as an instructor in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/981971.html |title=That Midas touch |work=Haaretz}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She met her husband, [[Ehud Olmert]], at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], where she was studying social work.&lt;ref name=Shabi&gt;{{cite news |work=The Guardian |title=The unlikely first lady |author=Rachel Shabi |date=5 May 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/05/israel1 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olmerts live in Jerusalem's [[Katamon]] neighborhood. They have five children (including [[Shaul Olmert]]), one of them adopted.&lt;ref name=Shabi /&gt;

=== Art career ===
In 1985–1988, at the age of 40, Olmert studied environmental design at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]]. In Israel, Olmert has exhibited at the Museum on the Seam in Jerusalem, the Museum of Israeli Art in Ramat Gan, the Eretz Israel Museum in Tel Aviv and the Tel Aviv Artists' House.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt; Her work has also been exhibited in Japan, Uruguay, Italy, Britain, Poland, Argentina and New York.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt; In March 2008, she was awarded the Steiger Prize in Germany.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt;

===Politics===

Olmert espouses left-wing politics, and has been accused of influencing her husband's political views. Olmert dislikes the political limelight, and says that their most difficult period as a couple was 1993–2003, when Ehud was mayor of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=Shabi /&gt;

She is said to support [[Meretz]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Berger, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/13/international/middleeast/13israel.html How a Zionist Hawk Grew His New Dovish Feathers], ''New York Times'' (13 August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social welfare ===
Olmert is active in social programs promoting child welfare. She is the chairman of Or Shalom and Tlalim, which aid children at risk and families with homebound sick children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nir Magal |date=14 May 2006 |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-3250714,00.html |publisher=Ynet |script-title=he:עליזה אולמרט: לא אוותר על הבריחות לתל אביב |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Aliza Olmert: I will not give up on escapes to Tel Aviv |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olmert is also a member of the Action Committee for Children of Foreign Workers.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt;

'''''Amor Vincit Omnia''''' ("Love Conquers All", known in English by a variety of names including '''''Amor Victorious''''', '''''Victorious Cupid''''', '''''Love Triumphant''''', '''''Love Victorious''''', or '''''Earthly Love''''') is a painting by the Italian Baroque artist [[Caravaggio]].  

''Amor Vincit Omnia'' shows [[Cupid|Amor]], the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Cupid]], wearing dark eagle wings, half-sitting on or perhaps climbing down from what appears to be a table. Scattered around are the emblems of all human endeavours – violin and lute, armour, coronet, square and compasses, pen and manuscript, bay leaves, and flower, tangled and trampled under Cupid’s foot. The painting illustrates the line from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]'' X.69, ''Omnia vincit amor et nos cedamus amori'' ("Love conquers all; let us all yield to love!"). A musical manuscript on the floor shows a large "V". It has therefore been suggested also that the picture is a coded reference to the attainments of Marchese [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]]: his [[Genoa|Genoese]] family ruled [[Chios]] (until the island's capture by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]) in 1622, hence the coronet; the cultivated Marchese also wrote about [[music]] and [[painting]] (pen, manuscript and musical instruments), was constructing an imposing new palazzo (geometrical instruments), studied [[astronomy]] (astral sphere), and was praised for his  military prowess (armour). The symbology thus holds the possible reading: Vincenzo Conquers All. Giustiniani is said to have prized it above all other works in his collection.&lt;ref&gt;Puglisi, ''Caravaggio'', pp. 201–202&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject was common for the age. Caravaggio’s treatment is remarkable for the realism of his Cupid – where other depictions, such as a contemporary ''Sleeping Cupid'' by [[Battistello Caracciolo]], show an idealised, almost generic, beautiful boy, Caravaggio’s Cupid is highly individual, charming but not at all beautiful, all crooked teeth and crooked grin: one feels that one would recognise him in the street. The shock of the Caravaggio, quite apart from the dramatic [[chiaroscuro]] lighting and the photographic clarity, is the mingling of the [[allegorical]] and the real, this sense it gives of a child who is having a thoroughly good time dressing up in stage-prop wings with a bunch of arrows and having his picture painted. Nevertheless, despite the clear indications of Caravaggio’s practice of painting direct from a live model, there is an undeniable resemblance to the pose of [http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/michelangelo-sculptures17.htm Michelangelo's ''Victory''] now in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence]], and it is likely the artist had this in mind.

The painter [[Orazio Gentileschi]] lent Caravaggio the wings as props to be used in the painting, and this allows fairly precise dating of 1602–3. It was an immediate success in the circles of Rome’s intellectual and cultural elite. A poet immediately wrote three [[madrigal (poetry)|madrigal]]s about it, and another wrote a Latin [[epigram]] in which it was first coupled with the Virgilian phrase ''Omnia Vincit Amor'', although this did not become its title until the critic [[Giovanni Pietro Bellori]] wrote his life of Caravaggio in 1672. 

Inevitably, much scholarly and non-scholarly ink has been spilled over the alleged [[eroticism]] of the painting.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Yet the [[homoerotic]] content was perhaps not so apparent to Giustiniani’s generation as it has become today. Naked boys could be seen on any riverbank or seashore, and the eroticisation of children is very much a cultural artefact of the present-day rather than Caravaggio's. The story that the Marchese kept ''Amor'' hidden behind a curtain relates to his reported wish that it should be kept as a final ''[[pièce de résistance]]'' for visitors, to be seen only when the rest of the collection had been viewed – in other words, the curtain was to reveal the painting, not to hide it. (According to the historian [[Joachim von Sandrart]], who catalogued the Giustiniani collection in the 1630s, the curtain was only installed at his urging at that time). The challenge is to see the ''Amor Vincit'' through 17th century eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1602, shortly after ''Amor Vincit'' was completed, Cardinal [[Benedetto Giustiniani]], Vincenzo’s brother and collaborator in the creation of the Giustiniani collection of contemporary art, commissioned a painting from the noted artist [[Giovanni Baglione]]. Baglione’s ''Divine and Profane Love'' showed Divine Love separating a juvenile Cupid on the ground in the lower right corner (profane love) from a [[Lucifer]] in the left corner. Its style was thoroughly derivative of Caravaggio (who had recently emerged as a rival for Church commissions) and a clear challenge to the recent ''Amor'', and the younger painter bitterly protested at what he saw as the plagiarism. Taunted by one of Caravaggio’s friends, Baglione responded with a second version, in which the devil was given Caravaggio’s face. Thus began a long and vicious quarrel which was to have unforeseeable ramifications for Caravaggio decades after his death when the unforgiving Baglione became his first biographer.

Sandrart described ''Amor'' as "A life size Cupid after a boy of about twelve...[who] has large brown eagle's wings, drawn so correctly and with such strong colouring, clarity and relief that it all comes to life.".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Robb, ''M'', p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Symonds (diarist)|Richard Symonds]], an English visitor to Rome about 1649/51, recorded the Cupid as being "ye body and face of his (Caravaggio's) owne boy or servant thait (sic) laid with him"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Robb, ''M'', p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;. The Italian art historian Giani Pappi has put forward the theory that this Cecco may be identical with [[Cecco del Caravaggio]] ('Caravaggio’s Cecco'), a notable Italian follower of Caravaggio who emerged in the decade after the master’s death. While this remains controversial, there is more widespread support for Pappi's further proposal that Cecco del Caravaggio should be identified as an artist known as Francesco Boneri. Cecco Boneri, if this is his name, appears in many of Caravaggio's paintings, as the juvenile angel supporting Christ in ''[[The Conversion of Saint Paul (Caravaggio)|The Conversion of Saint Paul]]'', (1600–1601) possibly as the angel offering a martyr's palm to the saint in ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew]]'' (1599–1600) (although seen only as the top of a curly head of hair), as the young Isaac about to have his throat cut in ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac (Caravaggio)|The Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' (1603), as an adolescent David in ''[[David with the Head of Goliath (Caravaggio, Rome)]]'' (ca. 1610 – the head is Caravaggio's), and as the [[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|John the Baptist]] now in the Capitoline gallery in Rome.

The picture remained in the Giustiniani collection until 1812, when it was purchased by the art dealer [[Féréol Bonnemaison]], and sold to [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] in 1815 for the Berlin Museums.&lt;ref name=Met&gt;{{cite book|last=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|title=The Age of Caravaggio|year=1985|page=281|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=0870993801|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL15834365W/The_Age_of_Caravaggio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ratpenat.svg|thumb|''Ratpenat'' (''the Crest of the Bat''), an heraldic symbol of the former [[Crown of Aragon]].]]
[[File:Coat of Arms of Teruel City.svg|thumb|Teruel city coat of arms.]]
The '''[[bat]]''' (also called the [[wikt:reremouse|reremouse]], [[wikt:reermouse|reermouse]], or [[wikt:rearmouse|rearmouse]]) as a [[heraldry|heraldic symbol]] is primarily represented in the coats of arms of certain important towns of the former [[Crown of Aragon]]. It appears mostly at the top, above the [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] over the shield.

==Origins==
The heraldic use of the bat in [[Valencia]], [[Catalonia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] has its origins in a winged [[dragon]] or [[European dragon|Wyrm]] ([[European dragon#Dragons in Catalan mythology|''vibra'']] or ''víbria'') that was crowning the helmet or [[:ca:Cimera del Casal de Barcelona|''cimera reial'']] of the Kings of Aragon. Although traditionally the dragon helmet is ascribed to king [[James I of Aragon]] (1208 – 1276),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariodemallorca.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=2009011100_4_425452__Diario-de-Palma-Vicisitudes-historicas-torno-cimera-Jaime Diario de Palma - ''Vicisitudes históricas en torno a la cimera de Jaime I'']&lt;/ref&gt;
reliable documents state that the winged dragon ''cimera reial'' didn't appear over the helmet until [[Peter IV of Aragon]]'s reign (1319 – 1387). 

There is also a legend that says that thanks to the humble intervention of a bat, king James I of Aragon was able to win a crucial battle against the [[Saracen]]s that allowed him to win Valencia for his kingdom. However, original documents state that the animal was a [[swallow]] and not a bat.&lt;ref name="cervantesvirtual.com"&gt;[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/FichaObra.html?Ref=23879&amp;portal=33 Luis Tramoyeres Blasco, ''Lo Rat Penat en el escudo de armas de Valencia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The bat in official heraldry==
The coats of arms of certain cities in eastern [[Spain]], like [[Valencia]],&lt;ref name="cervantesvirtual.com" /&gt; [[Palma, Mallorca]]&lt;ref&gt;Antoni I. Alomar i Canyelles, ''L'Estendard, la festa nacional més antiga d'Europa (s. XIII-XXI)'' Palma 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fraga]]&lt;ref name="ifc.dpz.es"&gt;[http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/25/75/_ebook.pdf Emblemata-Revista aragonesa de emblematica no. 11, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; have the bat over the shield. Also smaller towns, like [[Catarroja]] and [[Novallas]], use this symbol.

Formerly the [[Barcelona]] city coat of arms had a bat crowning it as well, but the bat was removed at the beginning of the 20th century for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;L'escut de Barcelona, Societat Catalana de Genealogia, Heràldica, Sigil·lografia, Vexil·lologia i Nobiliària&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Teruel]]&lt;ref name="ifc.dpz.es" /&gt; used to have the bat surmounting the coat of arms' crown. There the bat represents a commemoration of the role of this city in the conquest of Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aragonesasi.com/escudos/teescudo.php Old Teruel city coat of arms]&lt;/ref&gt; The bat now rests just below the crown in Teruel's seal.

While the use of the bat as a heraldic symbol is prevalent in the territories of the former Crown of Aragon it is rarely used elsewhere. However, it can be found in a few places, including in the coats of arms of the city of [[Albacete]] in Spain, the town of [[Montchauvet, Yvelines]] in [[France]], [[Fiefbergen]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]] and the former [[Borough of Brecknock]] and [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Brecknockshire]] in [[Wales]], [[UK]]. Outside of Europe, the coat of arms of [[Santa Fe de Antioquia]], [[Colombia]] includes multiple bats; it was granted to the town in 1545 by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Castile and Aragon]] and his mother, [[Joanna of Castile]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110707052728/http://www.reuna.unalmed.edu.co/temasdeinteres/Municipios/informacion.php?id=106&amp;opcion=simbolos REUNA - Municipio de Santa Fé de Antioquia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
Based on the heraldic symbol of their city, certain Spanish [[association football]] club badges, like [[Albacete Balompié]], [[CD Alcoyano]], [[Levante UD]] and [[Valencia CF]], have a bat on them. The ancient badge of the [[FC Barcelona]], used during the 1899-1910 period, had a small bat crowning it as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tokyostage.haru.tv/viewvideo.php?c=&amp;vid=b6wsk_6L4oA&amp;f=gdata_videos&amp;artist=&amp;title=&amp;t2=&amp;a2=&amp;search=escut L'origen dels colors i l'escut del Barça]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Burgee]] of the Royal Valencia Yacht Club (Reial Club Nàutic de València) displays a bat on a golden field in its center.

[[Lo Rat Penat]], a political organization based in Valencia in 1878, was named after the heraldic bat. Established by [[Constantí Llombart]], Teodor Llorente and Fèlix Pizcueta, its aim was originally to foster a movement similar to the Catalan [[Renaixença]] in the region of Valencia.

The [[No. 9 Squadron RAF]] adopted the bat badge in 1917 along with the [[Latin]] motto ''Per Noctem Volamus'' "We fly through the night". The badge was approved by King [[Edward VIII]] in November 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/h9.html |title=RAF Bomber command |access-date=2009-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206172950/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/h9.html |archive-date=2008-12-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5622">[[File:Terracotta Baubo figurine.jpg|thumb|244px|A [[Greek terracotta figurines|Greek terracotta figurine]] of  Baubo, of the face-in-torso type. She is holding a [[lyre]] from [[Priene]], [[Anatolia]].]]

'''Baubo''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Βαυβώ) is an old woman in [[Greek mythology]] which appears particularly in the myths of the early [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] religion. Known as the Goddess of Mirth, she was bawdy and sexually liberated, and is said to have jested with [[Demeter]], when Demeter was mourning the loss of her daughter, [[Persephone]].

==Scholarly discussion==
In his ''Greek Myths'' (1996), [[Robert Graves]] writes that Demeter (in disguise) was the guest of [[Celeus|King Celeus]] in [[Eleusis]]. [[Iambe]], the lame maid of the king:
  
{{quotation|... tried to console Demeter with comically lascivious verses, and a dry nurse, old Baubo, persuaded her to drink [[Barley water|barley-water]] by a jest: she groaned as if in great travail and, unexpectedly, produced from beneath her skirt Demeter's own son [[Iacchus]], who leapt into his mother's arms and kissed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Greek Myths |last=Graves |first=Robert|year=1996 |publisher=Folio Society |location=London |volume=volume 1|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Graves writes: 
[[File:Baubo figurine.jpg|thumb|188px|right|A face-in-body Baubo figurine.]]

{{quotation|Iambe and Baubo personify the obscene songs, in [[Iamb (poetry)|iambic metre]], which were sung to relieve emotional tension at the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]; but Iambe, Demeter, and Baubo form the familiar [[Triple deity|triad]] of [[Virginity|maiden]], [[nymph]], and [[crone]]. Old nurses in Greek myth nearly always stand for the goddess as crone.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following excerpt is taken from [[Clement of Alexandria]]'s ''Exhortation to the Greeks,'' from a 1919 English translation:

{{quotation|Baubo, having received Demeter as a guest, offers her a draught of wine and meal. She declines to take it, being unwilling to drink on account of her mourning. Baubo is deeply hurt, thinking she has been slighted, and thereupon uncovers her secret parts and exhibits them to the goddess. Demeter is pleased at the sight, and now at least receives the draught, — delighted by the spectacle! These are the secret mysteries of the Athenians! These are also the subjects of Orpheus’ poems. I will quote you the very lines of [[Orpheus]], in order that you may have the originator of the mysteries as witness of their shamelessness:

“This said, she drew aside her robes, and showed a sight of shame; child Iacchus was there, and laughing, plunged his hand below her breasts. Then smiled the goddess, in her heart she smiled, and drank the draught from out the glancing cup.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]]. Translated by Butterworth, G. W. (1919), [[Loeb Classical Library]], volume 92. Cambridge, Massachusetts. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Baubo figurines==
Figurines known as Baubos are found in a number of settings, usually with Greek connections. They were mass-produced in a number of styles, but the basic figure always exposes the [[vulva]] in some way:

* A plump woman with her legs held apart, gesturing to her exposed vulva.
* A naked splay-legged figure holding a harp on the back of a boar.
* A naked headless torso with the face in the body and the vulva in the chin of the face.
* A seated figure with an exaggerated vulva filling the space between the legs.
* A naked squatting figure with her hands on her genitalia

The figurines usually had elaborate [[headdress]]es, and some hold cups or harps. Some figurines have a loop moulded into the head, which seems to indicate that they were suspended in some way (possibly as an amulet).

{{Culture of Myanmar}}

== Introduction ==
[[Myanmar]] (Burma) is a country in [[Southeast Asia]] which has endured isolation from 1962 - 2011. It is also a country with deep rooted [[Buddhist]] beliefs. The [[contemporary art]] scene in the country reflects these facts, and the art is often related to Buddhism and the difficult socio-political situation. In this age of [[globalization]], '''Burmese contemporary art''' has developed rather on its own terms.

== History ==
One of the first to study western art was [[Ba Nyan]]. Together with [[Ngwe Gaing]] and a handful of other artists, they were pioneers of western painting style in Burma. Later, most of the students learnt from masters through apprenticeship.  Some well known contemporary artists are mentioned below.

[[Lun Gywe]] (born 1930)&lt;ref&gt;''U Lun Gywe — A Master Painter from Myanmar''. Thavibu Gallery, 2005. {{ISBN|974-92905-6-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the undisputed old master of Burmese painting.  He has been the mentor of many younger generations of artists. Lun Gywe is a master with colours, often in an [[impressionistic]] manner, and is particularly fond of painting the beauty of women.  His works are represented in the [[National Museum of Myanmar]] and the [[National Art Gallery of Malaysia]].

== Art spaces ==

== Artists ==
[[Aung Kyaw Htet]] (born 1965) is a devout [[Buddhist]] who grew up in a small village—two factors which have a strong influence on his art. His paintings of religious life in Burma show [[monks]] and [[nuns]] in a realistic manner, though non-essential objects are omitted from the paintings to focus on the religious aspects.  Aung Kyaw Htet paints the faces of monks and nuns in great detail to show their humanity.  His works are represented in the [[National Museum of Myanmar]] and the [[National Art Gallery of Malaysia]].

Four additional artists who were found worthy to have their works included in the permanent collection of the [[National Art Gallery of Malaysia]] (the country's contemporary art museum) are [[MPP Yei Myint]], [[Myint Swe (painter)|Myint Swe]], [[Min Wai Aung]] and [[Aung Myint]].

The younger generation of upcoming international contemporary artists include [[Nyein Chan Su]] and [[The Maw Naing]] and the  Gangaw Village Artist Group.

Now there are many contemporary artists such as [[Po Po]]. Po Po (born 1957) lives and works in [[Yangon]]. He studied art himself (he describes himself as self-taught) and works with various media especially with installation works. He has staged solo exhibitions since 1987; they include “Untitled” and “Solid Concept” among others. He participated in the Kwangju Biennale 2000, the Flying Circus Project 2004 and Yokohama Triennale 2005.

[[Wah Nu]] was born in Yangon in 1977, and launched herself on an artistic career after graduating from the [[University of Culture, Yangon]] in 1998 where she majored in music. Since then she has developed a personal expression by mainly adopting painting and video as media. In 2004, she held the exhibition “Cloud Department” in Yangon. That is her first solo exhibition and then 2005, “Self-Identity” second in gallery Art-U room,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-u-room.com/wahnu/wahnu.html Wah Nu], [http://www.art-u-room.com/ Art-U room].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. She showed in group exhibitions including ''Bangladesh Biennale 2004'', ''Fukuoka Triennale 2005''&lt;ref&gt;[http://faam.city.fukuoka.lg.jp/FT/eng/2005/ 3rd Fukuoka Triennale 2005], [[Fukuoka]], [[Japan]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Another Seven Artists'' in Yangon 2008. Recently, she participate in ''The 6th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art'' in Brisbane with her husband, artist, Tun Win Aung, who works in multimedia installations and performance arts.

Most of the young artists who were born in the 1980s have greater chances of art practises inside and outside the country. [[Performance art]] is a popular genre among Burmese young artists. Aung Ko, Moe Satt, Mrat Lunn Htwann and Nyan Lin Htet are some of the promising artists. Among them, Nyan Lin Htet started making performance art works in early 2000s and later he joined the contemporary theatre group Annees Folles for intensive theatre training with Japanese theatre director Arata Kitamura in Japan. Since 2005, Lin Htet has been actively involved in international performance art and theatre scenes. After founding the Yangon-based experimental theatre group [http://www.theatreofthedisturbed.org Theatre of the Disturbed] in 2005, Lin Htet directed theatrical adaptations of dramatic and literary works by [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]] and [[Franz Kafka]] as well as dramatic works by local playwrights including himself. In 2007, he was awarded the 2-year Artist-in-residency programme at Cité Internationale des Arts-Paris with the support of Alliance Française de Rangoun and Ministry of Foreign Affairs-France. Lin Htet has been recognized not only as the most promising Burmese contemporary theatre artist but as one of the few promoters of contemporary Burmese art and theatre. He is currently based in [[Europe]].

The '''Cathedral of Cefalù''' ({{lang-it|Duomo di Cefalù}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Basilica#Ecclesiastical_basilicas|basilica]] in [[Cefalù]], [[Sicily]]. It is one of nine structures included in the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] known as [[Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefalù and Monreale]].

The [[cathedral]] was erected in 1131 in the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] architectural style, the island of Sicily having been [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|conquered by the Normans]] in 1091. According to tradition, the building was erected after a vow made to the Holy Saviour by the King of Sicily, [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]], after he escaped from a storm to land on the city's beach. The building has a fortress-like character and, seen from a distance, it dominates the skyline of the surrounding medieval town. It made a powerful statement of the Norman presence.

==History==
[[File:Cefalù dal monte.JPG|thumb|280px|Cefalù Cathedral within the town]]
The cathedral was built in a long-populated area, as attested by the presence of a Roman road and a Paleo-Christian mosaic. Construction began in 1131, the apse [[mosaic]]s were begun in 1145, and the sarcophagi that Roger II provided for his tomb and that of his wife were put in place the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Demus|first1=Otto|title=The Mosiacs of Norman Sicily|publisher=Hackert Art Books|isbn=978-0878173105|pages=3-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1172 the church suffered a period of decline. In 1215 [[Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]] moved the two sarcophagi to the [[Cathedral of Palermo]].  Construction of the cathedral was resumed soon after, the façade being completed in 1240. The Cathedral was consecrated in 1267 by [[Rodolphe de Chevriêres]], [[Bishop of Albano]].

In 1472 a [[portico]], by Ambrogio da [[Como]], was added between the two towers of the facade.

==Description==

===Architecture===
[[File:Cefalù Duomo.jpg|thumb|Lateral view]]
The cathedral is preceded by a large terraced [[parvis]], which was originally a cemetery. According to tradition, it was created with earth brought from [[Jerusalem]], which was believed to have qualities that caused the rapid [[mummy|mummification]] of corpses.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The façade is characterized by two large Norman towers with [[mullion]]ed windows, each surmounted by a small spire added in the 15th century. Each spire is different: one has a square plan surrounded by flame-shaped [[merlon]]s, the latter symbolizing the Papal authority and the [[mitre]]; the other has an octagonal plan and Ghibelline merlons, symbolizing the Royal and temporal power.

The 15th-century portico has three arches, the two outer being pointed, supported by four columns and vaulting ribs. Under the portico is the ''Porta Regum'' (Kings' Door), with a finely decorated marble portal flanked by wall paintings.

The interior of the cathedral is on the Latin cross plan, divided into a nave and two aisles by arcades of antique columns: fourteen in pink granite and two in [[cipolin]]. The bases and capitals are from the 2nd century AD. Two large capitals supporting the [[triumphal arch]] of the nave were probably made by an [[Apulia|Apulian]] workshop in the mid-12th century.
[[File:Cefalu Cathedral interior BW 2012-10-11 12-07-53.jpg|thumb|Interior view towards the chancel]]
The roof of the nave was lowered, as can be seen from the exterior of the building. The [[transept]] is higher than both the nave and aisles. While parts of the building are barrel-vaulted and parts have an open timber roof, the [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] has a ribbed vault of stone.

Beyond the crossing, the church is unusual in combining a style that is essentially Romanesque in its massive simple forms with the pointed (or ogival) arch. This feature is also seen in [[Monreale Cathedral]]. It is a forerunner of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style which was to develop in the region of [[Paris]] within a few years.

The church has three [[apse]]s, an arrangement also seen in Sicily at Monreale Cathedral. The two lower side apses have the upper tiers of the exterior decorated by blind arcading of small crossed arches and sculpted [[corbel]]s, also seen used extensively at Monreale. The corbels date from 1215-1223 and portray masks, heads of animals, and human figures in contorted positions. The corbels of the central apse are more recent. The central apse originally had three large ocular windows,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Rose window]]&lt;/ref&gt; which were later closed to give space for the mosaic, and a larger central window of ogival shape. Two other pairs of circular windows are located at the transept's ends.

====Cloister====
The cathedral has a cloister that can be entered from within the church. The arcade has pointed arches, each of which rests on slender, paired columns. The form is not different from that of Spanish and some French cloisters; the composite capitals of the coupled columns are Norman and other more generically Romanesque in their motifs. This cloister is the model for the successive Norman cloisters of Sicily, in particular that of the [[Monreale]].

====Presbyterium mosaic====
[[File:Duomo cefalu msu2017-0740.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantokrator]].]]
[[File:Mosaico della Cattedrale di Cefalù.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Virgin Mary]] with four [[archangels]].]]
It was probably planned that the entire church be decorated in [[mosaic]], but this was completed only in the [[presbyterium]] area. Mosaic still covers the apse and about half of the side walls. Roger II brought masters in the technique of mosaic from [[Constantinople]]. They adapted their traditional Byzantine decorative art to an architectural structure that was of northern European origin.

The dominant figure of the decorative scheme is the bust of [[Christ Pantokrator]], portrayed on the [[semi-dome]] of the [[apse]] with a hand raised in [[Benediction]]. In his left hand he carries the [[Gospel of John]], in which can be read, in Greek and Latin: "I am the light of the world, who follows me will not wander in the darkness but will have the light of life" ([[Gospel of John|John]], {{bibleverse-nb||John|8:12|KJV}}).

In the upper tier of the apsidal wall is depicted the Blessed Virgin Mary, her hands raised in prophecy, flanked by four [[archangel]]s. In the second and third tiers, on either side of the central window, are figures of [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] and [[Four Evangelists|evangelists]], placed according to a planned theological programme.

The mosaic decoration extends into the presbyterium, with the side walls showing figures of prophets and saints. On the right wall, adjacent to the royal throne, are royal figures, while on the left side, adjacent the bishop's throne, are priestly figures. Each figure is accompanied by an inscription, in Greek or Latin, describing the character portrayed. The decoration of the cross-vaulted ceiling depicts four [[cherubim]] and four [[seraphim]].

The chief figures, that of Christ Pantokrator and the Virgin Mary, are clothed in blue, given luminosity by a background of gold tiles. The work is of the highest order, displaying elegance in the draping of the figures' robes and in the sensitivity of their faces and gestures. It is considered the finest Byzantine mosaic in Italy and comparable to other fine Late Byzantine work from Constantinople.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The Byzantine mosaic decoration was completed before 1170. The lower part and the side walls of the presbyterium were not completed until the 17th century. They covered preceding paintings of which scarce traces remain today.

====Other artwork====
[[File:Cefalucathedralnight.jpg|thumb|The cathedral at night]]
Of the original painted decoration, a figure of [[Urban V]] from the late 14th century, on a column on the left aisle; and a "Madonna enthroned" from the 15th century, in the left arm of the transept, remain.

The basilica houses several funerary monuments, including a late Antique sarcophagus, a medieval one, and the notable sepulchre of the Bishop Castelli of the 18th century.

The 12th-century baptismal font, carved from a single block of stone, is decorated with four small sculpted lions. The church also houses a canvas of the Madonna from [[Antonello Gagini]]'s workshop (16th century) and a painted wooden cross by Guglielmo da Pesaro (1468). The organ is a large two-manual instrument with detached console and plain pipework, sitting above a panelled wooden case.

The nave's ceiling has a painted decoration with busts, fanciful animals and other motifs, probably the work of Arabic craftsmen.

Starting in 1985, the Palermo artist Michele Canzoneri was commissioned and has installed 72 modern, abstract, stained-glass windows based on episodes from the Old and New Testaments. These have aroused some controversy for their style.&lt;ref&gt;Grady, Ellen, ''Blue Guide Sicily,'' 7th Edition, Somerset Books, London, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Palæo-Christian mosaic====
Excavations in the cathedral area have brought to light parts of a 6th-century polychrome mosaic. They depict a dove drinking, parts of two other birds, two small trees, and a lily-shaped flower, enclosed in a frame with ogival and lozenge motifs.

This mosaic belonged probably to a pre-existing Byzantine basilica. This area of Cefalù was frequented at least up to the 8th century, when it was an [[episcopal see]].

Rauschenberg’s Combines explored the blurry boundaries between art and the everyday world. In addition, his cross-medium creations challenged the doctrine of [[medium specificity]] mentioned by modernist art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]. [[Frank Stella]] created a large body of paintings that recall the combine paintings of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] by juxtaposing a wide variety of surface and material in each work ultimately leading to Stella's sculpture and architecture of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haberarts.com/schwitt.htm Unhappy Medium, Frank Stella and Kurt Schwitters by John Haber].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Schimmel of the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] described Rauschenberg's ''Combine paintings'' as "some of the most influential, poetic and revolutionary works in the history of American art."&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; But they've also been called "ramshackle hybrids between painting and sculpture, stage prop and three-dimensional scrap-book assemblage" according to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s critic Adrian Searle.&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; Searle believed the "different elements of the Combines have been described as having no more relation than the different stories that vie for attention on a newspaper page."&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; Jasper Johns, as well, used similar techniques; in at least one painting, Johns attached a paintbrush right inside his painting.

Examples of Rauschenberg's ''Combine paintings'' include ''Bed'' (1955), ''Canyon'' (1959), and the free-standing ''[[Monogram (artwork)|Monogram]]'' (1955–1959).&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Rauschenberg's works mostly incorporated [[two-dimensional]] materials held together with "splashes and drips of paint" with occasional 3-D objects.&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Critic John Perreault wrote "The Combines are both painting and sculpture–or, some purists would say, neither."&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Perreault liked them since they were memorable, photogenic, and could "stick in the mind" as well as "surprise and keep on surprising."&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Rauschenberg added stuffed birds on his 1955 work ''Satellite'', which featured a stuffed pheasant "patrolling its top edge."&lt;ref name=tws08jan011/&gt; In another work, he added a ladder.

The prevailing theme of Rauschenberg's "combine" paintings is ''"nonmeaning, the absurd, or antiart."'' In this regard the combine paintings relate to [[Pop art]] and their much earlier predecessor [[Dada]].&lt;ref&gt;Varieties of Visual Experience, Edmund Burke Feldman, Harry N.

]]
''Canyon,'' one of Rauschenberg's most recognizable Combines, has been the subject of art historical debate revolving around the validity of reading Rauschenberg's work iconographically. Historian [[Kenneth Bendiner]] famously proposed ''Canyon'' as a playful recreation of a 1635 [[Rembrandt]] painting depicting the abduction of [[The Abduction of Ganymede|Ganymede]], interpreting the suspended pillow as Ganymede's buttocks and the stuffed bald eagle as the form assumed by the Greek god Zeus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Rauschenberg and the Neo-Avant-Garde|last=Branden|first=Joseph|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians and critics, such as [[Joseph Branden]] have argued that searching for iconography in Rauschenberg's Combines is useless because it can be made to exist anywhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bendiner's interpretation is discredited for failing to account for compositional movement and for disregarding a number of elements within the work, for example the blue and red text in the center, in order to mould the interpretation to it.

Interpretations of Rauschenberg's Combines vary from: a deeply personal and subjective collage of expression (often homoerotic), to a surface of indecipherable, or rather infinitely cipher-able, materials which challenge notions of painting, sculpture, reception, and chance, to a multivalent iconographic landscape that seems to resist fixed decoding in favor of a more open-ended play of meaning. Rauschenberg himself states "I don't want a painting to be just an expression of my personality. I feel it ought to be much better than that … I’ve always felt as though, whatever I’ve used and whatever I’ve done, the method was always closer to a ''collaboration'' with materials than to any kind of conscious manipulation and control."&lt;ref&gt;Rauschenberg quoted in Calvin Tomkins, ‘Profiles: Moving Out,’ ''The New Yorker'', vol.40, 29 Feb. 1964, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moira Roth]] links the Combines to [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp's]] indifferent attitude in art, arguing that the perceived density of the content, and the integration of mass media elements is a facade born out of the alienation and indifference experienced by the artist during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Period]]. Jonathan Katz argues that underneath the impersonal and inexpressive appearance of his work is a secret homosexual code that can unlock some of the significance of Rauschenberg's work,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Katz: ‘Lovers and Divers’ (1998) p.24&lt;/ref&gt; but Ed Krčma points out the weakness of steering the analysis towards preconceived conclusions, especially since Rauschenberg's work is described as a poetry of infinite possibilities.

More recent interpretations of ''Canyon,'' reconsider the work in [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] terms, claiming that the Combine works more like a human mind than a human eye; Fragmented scraps of images, news cutouts, found objects and paint interact in esoteric ways and more closely resemble a cerebral process than a 'traditional' image. Yve-Alain Bois calls the search for iconographic meaning in Rauschenberg's work misguided because it is too limiting. His art's "lack of center" is a statement in itself, and the infinite permutations of meaning that can result highlight the subjectivity of art reception that postmodernism explores.&lt;ref&gt;Bois, Yve-Alain. "Eye to the Ground." Artforum International. Artforum Inc. March, 2006. p.246-247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional note===

Under U.S. law, ''Canyon'' can never be sold since it contains a stuffed bald eagle, violating the 1940 [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]] as well as the 1918 [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/05/01/rauschenberg-eagle-ruffles-feathers/|title=Rauschenberg Eagle Ruffles Feathers|last=Kinsella|first=Eileen|date=January 5, 2012|website=Art News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* "Hook IP" */ [[Patent]]s are by definition not "secret". In fact, the very original of the word "patent" is as an [[antonym]] of "secret" (as in: "we don't make it secret, we make it patent, but you require a license from us").</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3877">'''Compliance and Robustness''', sometimes abbreviated as '''C&amp;R''', refers to the legal structure or regime underlying a [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) system. In many cases, the C&amp;R regime for a given DRM is provided by the same company that sells the DRM solution. For example, [[RealNetworks]] Helix or [[Microsoft]] [[Windows Media DRM]].

However, for standardised DRM systems, it is fairly common for a separate body to be established to run the C&amp;R regime.

== Elements ==
=== C&amp;R Body ===
The legal entity that establishes and maintains the regime. Usually this will be a [[joint venture]] or forum with representation from multiple companies, structured in such as way as to avoid accusations of [[antitrust]] violations. The nature of the business is that such bodies will generally be composed of manufacturers and content owners, with little or no direct representation from consumer advocates.

=== Trust Model ===
The C&amp;R body is responsible for ensuring a chain of trust, such that the original content provider is sufficiently satisfied that their content will remain adequately secure throughout all future links in the chain. This may include export of content from one DRM system to another.

To meet this requirement, it is normal that any device planning to receive DRMed content is required to validate that it meets the C&amp;R requirements, and this is usually done using a [[device certificate]] of some kind. The issuance of such certificates is the stamp of approval for both the manufacturer and the device.

If two devices can verify that they both have trusted certificates, they can then reasonably expect that content passed between them will remain secure.

=== Compliance Rules ===
In many cases there will be gaps, ambiguities or options left open in a DRM technical specification. The C&amp;R regime must clarify exactly how a compliant device is to behave in these cases. For example, a compliance rule may define which other types of interfaces are acceptable on a device, something that the technical specification itself will never do.

=== Robustness Rules ===
The most controversial aspect of C&amp;R is the agreement on how to ensure that a device is sufficiently robust at resisting attacks. These rules may require that certain elements are implemented only in hardware, or run on secure CPUs, or that the code must not be available as open source. Manufacturers then have to satisfy the C&amp;R body that they meet this requirement before they are granted access to the certificates needed to establish their products as trusted.

=== "Hook IP" ===
One particular trick that is often used is to include some [[patent]]ed technology, often as part of the trust establishment mechanism. This means that anyone wanting to implement the DRM in a way that will work with others is forced to license these patents. A condition of obtaining such a license is to follow the rules of the C&amp;R regime itself. Thus a C&amp;R body has a 20-year window to pursue legal measures against a "rogue" implementation on the grounds of patent violation, rather than having to rely on a [[DMCA]]-style regulation provided by the relevant government. The need to license hook IP patents also impacts anyone thinking of building a product covered by the [[GPL]].

One well-known example of a system employing such Hook IP is the DVB Common Scrambling Algorithm [[DVB-CSA]], which though standardised by [[ETSI]], includes patented elements that are only licensed to approved [[Conditional access]] systems vendors who agree to maintain the secrecy and integrity of the algorithm in their chip designs.

== Examples ==
* [[OMA DRM]] is governed by the [http://www.cm-la.com/ CMLA] C&amp;R regime
* [[DTCP-IP]] is governed by the [http://www.dtcp.com/ DTLA] C&amp;R regime

It also states that there must be balance between the using and conservation, which will conserve the architectural and historical value of the property. This will be aimed by the principles of integrated conservation explained in article 13, which implies and effective cooperation between the administrative departments concerned.

===Participation and associations===
It contains '''Article 14''', and describes the establishment of structures to facilitate cooperation between the parties or regions concerned.

===Information and training===

[[File:Dead man's hand.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The card hand purportedly held by [[Wild Bill Hickok]] at the time of his death: black aces and eights]]
The '''dead man's hand''' is a nickname for a particular [[poker]] hand, popularly a [[two-pair]] of black aces and black eights, although definitions of the hand have varied through the years. 

Such a hand is said to have been held by [[Old West]] [[folk hero]], lawman, and [[gunfighter]] [[Wild Bill Hickok]] when he was murdered. No contemporaneous source records this hand's exact cards, but [[Frank Wilstach]]'s 1926 book ''Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers'' led to the popular modern conception of the "dead man's hand" as containing pairs of black aces and black eights. In Hickok's case these would have been combined with an unknown [[kicker (poker)|hole]] card.

==Earliest details==
The expression "dead man's hand" appears to have had some currency in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, although no one connected it to Hickok until the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Dope"&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/275/was-wild-bill-hickok-holding-the-dead-mans-hand-when-he-was-slain "Was Wild Bill Hickok Holding the Dead Mans Hand When He Was Slain'']; [[The Straight Dope]] article; retrieved March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest detailed reference to it was 1886, where it was described as a "[[full house (poker)|full house]] consisting of three jacks and a pair of tens".&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0607E&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R910&amp;I=-3  ''Discussion'']; July 3, 1886, article in the ''[[Grand Forks Daily Herald]]''; at [[Linguist List]] online; retrieved February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacks and sevens are called the dead man's hand in the 1903 ''Encyclopaedia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;Cora Linn Morrison Daniels, et al; editor; ''Volume 2''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmond Hoyle]] refers to it as Jacks and eights in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond Hoyle]]; ''Hoyle's Games''; 1907; p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hickok's hand==
What is considered the dead man's hand card combination of today gets its notoriety from a legend that it was the [[five-card stud]] hand held by James Butler Hickok (better known as "Wild Bill" Hickok) when he was shot in the back of the head by [[Jack McCall]] on August 2, 1876, in [[Nuttal &amp; Mann's Saloon]] at [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Dakota Territory]]. Reportedly, Hickok's final hand included the aces and eights of both black [[suit (cards)|suits]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers''; Frank J. Wilstach; 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a book by Western historian [[Carl W. Breihan]], the cards were retrieved from the floor by a man named Neil Christy, who then passed them on to his son. The son, in turn, told Mr. Breihan of the composition of the hand. "Here is an exact identity of these cards as told to me by Christy's son: the ace of diamonds with a heel mark on it; the ace of clubs; the two black eights, clubs and spades, and the queen of hearts with a small drop of Hickok's blood on it."&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Women of the West''; Signet; 1982; p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hickok biographer Joseph Rosa wrote about the make-up of the hand: "The accepted version is that the cards were the ace of spades, the ace of clubs, two black eights, and the queen of clubs as the 'kicker'."&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Bill Hickok: Gunfighter''; Joseph G. Rosa; p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rosa said that no contemporaneous source can be found for this exact hand.&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Bill Hickok: The Man and his Myth''; Joseph Rosa; 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The solidification in [[card game|gamer]]s' parlance of the dead man's hand as two pairs, aces and eights, did not come about until after the 1926 publication of Frank Wilstach's book ''Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers''—50 years after Hickok's death.&lt;ref name="Dope"/&gt;

A '''document''' is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of [[thought]]. The word originates from the Latin ''documentum'', which denotes a "teaching" or "lesson": the verb ''doceō'' denotes "to teach". In the past, the word was usually used to denote a written proof useful as evidence of a truth or fact. In the [[computer age]], "document" usually denotes a primarily textual [[computer file]], including its structure and format, e.g. fonts, colors, and [[Computer-generated imagery|images]]. Contemporarily, "document" is not defined by its [[transmission medium]], e.g., paper, given the existence of [[electronic document]]s. "Documentation" is distinct because it has more denotations than "document". Documents are also distinguished from "[[Realia (library science)|realia]]", which are three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of "document" because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are considered more as 2 dimensional representations. While documents are able to have large varieties of customization, all documents are able to be shared freely, and have the right to do so, creativity can be represented by documents, also. History, events, examples, opinion, etc. all can be expressed in documents. 

==Abstract definitions==
The concept of "document" has been defined by [[Suzanne Briet]] as "any concrete or symbolic indication, preserved or recorded, for reconstructing or for proving a phenomenon, whether physical or mental."&lt;ref&gt;Briet. 1951. 7. Quoted in Buckland, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

An often cited article concludes that "the evolving notion of ''document''" among Jonathan Priest, [[Paul Otlet|Otlet]], Briet, [[Walter Schürmeyer|Schürmeyer]], and the other [[documentalist]]s increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important. [[David M. Levy|Levy's]] thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents (e.g., Levy, 1994&lt;ref&gt;Levy, D. M. "Fixed or Fluid? Document Stability and New Media." 1994. In ''European Conference on Hypertext Technology 1994 Proceedings'', pp. 24–31. New York: Association for Computing Machinery. Retrieved 18 October 2011 from 
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.119.8813&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;). A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists physically in digital technology as a string of bits, as does everything else in a digital environment. As an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence by those who study it.

"Document" is defined in [[library and information science]] and [[documentation science]] as a fundamental, abstract idea: the word denotes everything that may be represented or memorialized in order to serve as evidence. The classic example provided by [[Suzanne Briet]] is an [[antelope]]: "An antelope running wild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document[;] she rules. But if it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those who study it. Indeed, scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document."&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, M. "What Is a Digital Document?" 1998. In ''Document Numérique'' Paris. 2(2). [http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/digdoc.html].&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion has been interpreted as an early expression of [[actor–network theory]].

==Kinds==
Documents are sometimes classified as [[Classified information|secret]], [[Privacy|private]], or public. They may also be described as [[Draft document|drafts]] or [[Proofreading|proofs]]. When a document is [[Copying|copied]], the source is denominated the "[[Originality|original]]".

Standards are accepted for specific applications in various fields, e.g.:
* Academia: [[manuscript]], [[thesis]], [[Academic publishing|paper]], and [[Academic journal|journal]]
* Business: [[invoice]], [[Financial quote|quote]], [[RFP]], [[Proposal (business)|proposal]], [[contract]], [[packing slip]], [[Ship's manifest|manifest]], [[report]] (detailed and summary), [[spread sheet]], [[MSDS]], [[waybill]], [[bill of lading]] (BOL), [[financial statement]], [[nondisclosure agreement]] (NDA), mutual nondisclosure agreement (MNDA), and user guide
* [[Government]], [[law]], and [[politics]]: [[Patent application|application]], [[brief (law)|brief]], [[certificate (disambiguation)#Official document|certificate]], [[Commission (document)|commission]], [[Constitutional documents|constitutional document]], [[Form (document)|form]], [[gazette]], [[identity document]], [[license]], [[summons]], and [[white paper]]
* Media: [[mock-up]] and [[screenplay|script]]

Such standard documents can be drafted based on a [[Template (word processing)|template]].

==Drafting==
The [[page layout]] of a document is the manner in which information is graphically arranged in the space of the document, e.g., on a page. If the appearance of the document is of concern, page layout is generally the responsibility of a [[graphic design]]er. [[Typography]] concerns the design of letter and symbol forms and their physical arrangement in the document (see [[typesetting]]). [[Information design]] concerns the effective communication of [[information]], especially in industrial documents and public [[sign]]s. Simple textual documents may not require visual design and may be drafted only by an [[author]], [[Data entry clerk|clerk]], or [[transcriber]]. [[Form (document)|Forms]] may require a visual design for their initial fields, but not to complete the forms.

==History==
[[File:LL Zamenhof birth certificate.jpg|thumb|A birth certificate from 1859]]
Traditionally, the medium of a document was [[paper]] and the information was applied to it in [[ink]], either by hand writing (to make a [[manuscript]]) or by mechanical process (e.g., a [[printing press]] or [[laser printer]]). Today, some short documents also may consist of sheets of paper [[Staple (fastener)|stapled]] together.

Historically, documents were inscribed with [[ink]] on [[papyrus]] (starting in ancient [[Egypt]]) or [[parchment]]; scratched as [[runes]] or carved on stone using a sharp tool, e.g., the [[Tablets of Stone]] described in the [[Bible]]; stamped or incised in [[clay]] and then baked to make [[clay tablet]]s, e.g., in the [[Sumer]]ian and other [[Mesopotamia]]n civilizations. The [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] was often rolled into a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]] or cut into sheets and [[Bookbinding|bound]] into a [[codex]] (book).

Contemporary electronic means of memorializing and displaying documents include:
* [[Computer display|Monitor]] of a [[desktop computer]], [[laptop]], [[tablet computer|tablet PC]], et cetera; optionally with a [[computer printer|printer]] to produce a [[hard copy]];
* [[Personal digital assistant]] (PDA);
* Dedicated [[e-book device]];
* [[Electronic paper]], typically, using the [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF);
* [[Information appliance]];
* [[Digital audio player]]; and
* [[Radio]] and [[television]] [[Telecommunications Service Provider|service provider]].

Digital documents usually require a specific [[file format]] in order to be presentable in a specific medium.

== In law ==
Documents in all forms frequently serve as material [[evidence]] in criminal and civil proceedings. The [[forensic]] analysis of such a document is within the scope of [[questioned document examination]]. For the purpose of cataloging and managing the large number of documents that may be produced during [[litigation]], [[Bates numbering]] is often applied to all documents in the lawsuit so that each document has a unique, arbitrary, identification number.

{{for|the novel|Electric Brae (novel)}}

The '''Electric Brae''' is a [[gravity hill]] in [[Ayrshire]], Scotland, where a freewheeling vehicle will appear to be drawn uphill by some mysterious attraction. The phenomenon is an optical illusion.

==Etymology==

The term "Electric" dates from a time when it was incorrectly thought to be a phenomenon caused by electric or magnetic attraction within the Brae. The [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] word ''brae'' means a hill-slope or brow (with which it is cognate). The name has also been applied to other slopes in Scotland.

==Location==

There is more than one stretch of road known as the Electric Brae. The most famous is on the [[A719 road|A719]], south of [[Dunure]], not far from [[Ayr]], between [[Drumshrang]] and [[Knoweside]].{{sfnp|Alexander|2002|p=84|ps=}} Metal road signs that used to mark the location have tended to be taken by visitors, and have been replaced by a stone inscribed with an explanation of the phenomenon.{{efn|The inscription on the stone reads:&lt;br/&gt;{{quote|The ELECTRIC BRAE, known locally as 'CROY BRAE'}}}}

==Explanation==
Although the road appears to be running uphill, a suitably free-running vehicle will slowly move off from a standstill. It was widely believed that vehicles were being propelled uphill by a mysterious magnetic force, but the road's apparently uphill slope is an optical illusion.{{sfnp|Alexander|2002|p=84|ps=}} This runs the quarter mile from the bend overlooking Croy railway viaduct in the west (286 feet Above Ordnance Datum) to the wooded Craigencroy Glen (303 feet A.O.D.) to the east. Whilst there is this slope of 1 in 86 upwards from the bend to the Glen, the configuration of the land on either side of the road provides an optical illusion making it look as if the slope is going the other way. Therefore, a stationary car on the road with the brakes off will appear to move slowly uphill.

There are hundreds of gravity hills around the world. The explanation often given for the phenomenon is that of a visual illusion, similar to the well-known [[Ames room]], in which balls can appear to roll against gravity.

==World War II visitors==
During the Second World War General [[Dwight D Eisenhower]] had a flat at nearby [[Culzean Castle]]. Eisenhower took visitors to see the phenomenon. Many other American personnel from the [[Military Air Transport Service|air-base]] at [[Prestwick]] also visited.

The '''''Father Serra statues''''' in [[Ventura, California]], consist of four statues of [[Junípero Serra]]: (i) an original made of clay in 1936 by Uno John Palo Kangas (1904–1957); (ii) a concrete version made by Kangas and displayed in front of [[Ventura County Courthouse|Ventura City Hall]] from 1936 to 1989; (iii) a wood replica created by local carvers from 1987 to 1988 and displayed in the atrium of City Hall since 1988; and (iv) a bronze cast made in 1989 and displayed in front of City Hall since October 1989.

All four versions of the ''Father Serra'' statue were nine feet, four inches in height. They depict Father Serra standing with his head facing to the left and wearing a Franciscan [[cassock]] with [[cowl]], sandals, and a rope belt (or [[cincture]]), a [[rosary]] hanging from the belt, a book in his left hand, and a walking stick (or staff) in his right hand.

In 1974, the original concrete ''Father Serra statue'' was designated as Ventura Historic Landmark No. 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of San Buenaventura Historic Landmarks &amp; Districts|publisher=City of Ventura|date=May 3, 2016|accessdate=April 15, 2018|url=https://www.cityofventura.ca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/7730}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public display of Serra statuary has been a source of controversy, particularly among those alleging that Father Serra was responsible for the suppression of the culture of [[Chumash people]].

==Junípero Serra==
{{main|Junípero Serra}}
Junípero Serra was a [[Roman Catholic]] Spanish [[Catholic priest|priest]] and [[friar]] of the [[Franciscan Order]] who founded nine [[Spanish missions in California]]. In 1782, Serra founded [[Mission San Buenaventura]], his ninth and final mission, on a site that became [[Ventura, California]]. In September 2015, Serra was [[canonised]] as a saint by [[Pope Francis]], drawing national attention to Ventura's Father Serra statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Latino Catholics See Reflection in a Friar Set for Sainthood|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 15, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/us/latino-catholics-see-reflection-in-a-friar-set-for-sainthood.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kangas' original works==
In 1935, Uno John Palo Kangas (1904–1957), a sculptor born in Finland and raised in Michigan, was commissioned by Ventura County and the [[Works Progress Administration]] to create a statue of Father Serra as part of the [[Federal Art Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Replication of the Father Serra Statue: A Community Volunteer Project|author=Catherine Antolino Mervyn|publisher=Catherine Antolino Mervyn|isbn=1403309884|year=2002|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kangas was paid $5,000 for his work.&lt;ref name=LAT89/&gt; Kangas had gained some acclaim in 1935 for a heroic statue of a [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] worker titled "Conservation of Man and Nature" that was installed at [[Griffith Park]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sculptor Will Depict C.C.C.

===The clay sculpture===
[[File:John Palo-Kangas with Father Serra statue.png|thumb|right|Kangas posing in 1936 with his original clay sculpture]]
Kangas began by visiting the Santa Barbara and Ventura Missions to study images of Serra and to learn about his life and style of dress.  He also made multiple sketches in preparation for the work.&lt;ref&gt;"Comparison of Three Statues", a paper by Shirley Week (Kangas' daughter), October 9, 1990, p. 3, contained in Serra Statue ephemera file at the Research Library of the Ventura County Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculpting process began with the creation of a full-size clay model; the clay model took four months to complete and was built at Kangas' studio at 3929 Fountain Avenue in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=LAT36/&gt; The clay sculpture was built around a frame of wood and chicken wire which Kangas then covered with layers of clay.&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a contemporary of the artist, Kangas used Meiners Oak resident Gordon Douglas as a model for the face of Serra.&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1936, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published on its front page a large photograph (shown to the right) of Kangas posing with the clay sculpture.&lt;ref name=LAT36&gt;{{cite news|title=Fra Serra Clay Statue Finished by Sculptor|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 26, 1936|page=1|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19279430/fra_serra_clay_statue_finished_by/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disposition of the original clay sculpture is unknown.  However, a newspaper story from April 1938 suggests that the original clay model may have been loaned to a museum in [[Butte, Montana]], for an exhibition on scale models of sculpture. The story announced: "'Fray Junipero Serra', by John Palo-Kangas, one of the scale models of sculpture to be shown at the Butte Art Center, beginning on April 21st, is in the original at the Ventura county courthouse at San Buenaventura, Calif."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Center To Show Sculpture|newspaper=Montana Standard|date=April 17, 1938|page=5|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19339283/art_center_to_show_sculpture/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The concrete sculpture===
Kangas next built a breakaway mold of the clay sculpture using plaster of paris. The mold was placed in front of the courthouse, and a scaffolding was built around the mold.&lt;ref name=Mervyn6/&gt;  Kangas gathered sand and gravel from the [[Ventura River]],&lt;ref name=LAT89/&gt; which he used to make a concrete aggregate material that he poured on location into the mold.&lt;ref name=Mervyn6/&gt; After the concrete hardened, the mold was removed and Kangas smoothed the outer surface.&lt;ref name=Mervyn6&gt;Mervyn p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 27, 1936, Kangas' concrete sculpture was unveiled in front of the [[Ventura County Courthouse]] (later converted to Ventura City Hall). The unveiling ceremony was attended by Kangas, Governor [[Frank Merriam]], Mayor George A. Newell, Jr., and other notable persons. In his speech, Gov. Merriam said: "A beautiful statue is about to be made visible, exemplifying the spirit of this pioneering priest – noble, brave and holy – a patriot of patriots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Merriam Pays High Honor to Father Serra|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 28, 1936|page=7|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19279533/merriam_pays_high_honor_to_father_serra/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kangas' concrete statue remained in front of the courthouse/city hall for more than 50 years from 1936 to 1989. By the 1980s, it had deteriorated from years of exposure to Ventura's salt air and from the pooling of rainwater in the collar of the statue's robe, which formed a natural basin. In addition, the statue was painted by a vandal or vandals, and the City responded by sandblasting the statue, damaging the statue's smooth outer layer and accelerating the decay.&lt;ref name=LAT89/&gt;

The statue was removed from its pedestal in September 1989 to make room for installation of the bronze cast.&lt;ref name=LAT89/&gt; At the time of the removal, the City planned to store the concrete statue at the Hilford Moving and Storage building until the completion of a planned farm implements museum, where the concrete statue was to be installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Father Serra ending tour of duty: 53-year-old Downtown statue being replaced|newspaper=Ventura Star-Free Press|author=Jim McLain|date=July 2, 1989|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the statue never made it to the Hilford facility, and the farm implements museum was delayed when its chief proponent, Bob Pfeiler, became ill.&lt;ref name=Tale&gt;{{cite news|title=A tale of the three Father Serra statues|newspaper=Oxnard Star|author=Kim Lamb Gregory|date=June 1, 2001|pages=E1, E6|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the concrete statue was discovered by a reporter for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in a scrap yard operated by Oilfield Service &amp; Trucking Company (OST) along Ventura Avenue.&lt;ref name=LAT96&gt;{{cite news|title=Buried Treasure: Original Statue of Father Junipero Serra Found in Scrap Yard|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|author=Hilary E.

===Deterioration and plans for replacement===
[[File:Head from Father Serra statue (wood).jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of head from wooden replica]]

Ownership of the concrete statue passed from Ventura County to the City of Ventura in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Ventura City Councilman Russell Burns, a mechanical engineer, presented a report to the City Council describing the deterioration of the statue and concluding that the statue "in the not too distant future will fall apart."&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The City in 1984 commissioned studies of the statue by an art conservator, an engineering firm, and a concrete expert.&lt;ref name=Mervyn13&gt;Mervyn p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The studies reached the conclusion that the statue should be moved inside and that the statue was too fragile to be copied by molding.&lt;ref name=Mervyn13/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT87/&gt;

Based on the findings, Councilman Burns proposed the creation of a wood replica of the statue which could then be used as a mold for a permanent bronze cast to be displayed in place of the decaying concrete statue.&lt;ref name=Mervyn13/&gt; In 1986, Burns' proposal was unanimously adopted by the Ventura City Council.  The City fronted an initial sum of $15,000 to begin the process, and local boosters also raised more than $100,000 through the sale of limited edition 18-inch bronze replicas (hand-tooled by Charles Kubilos),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former engineer creates Serra replicas|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|author=Brett Pauly|date=November 3, 1989|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serra statue stands tall|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=May 23, 1988|page=A1|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; posters/lithographs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Father Serra posters added to drive: $20 commemorative will help pay for statue repair|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|author=Michael Marlow|date=August 17, 1987|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lithographs available of Junipero Serra statue|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=October 14, 1989|via=The Museum of Ventura County ("Junipero Serra Statue" biographical file)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and T-shirts, hats, and pins bearing the phrase "I Support the Serra Statue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church Members on Mission to Get City's Serra Statue|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|author=Tracy Wilson|date=November 1, 1995|pages=B1, B4|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19259992/church_members_on_mission_to_get_citys/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kids, corporations back Serra statue fund drive|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=May 27, 1988|page=A3|author=Michael E.

===The bronze cast===
[[File:View of Father Serra Statue and California Street from steps of Ventura City Hall.jpg|thumb|Serra statue from City Hall]]
In 1988, the City of Ventura accepted a $17,000 bid from a group of student artists at the California Sculpture Center at [[College of the Desert]] in Palm Desert to create a bronze cast of the sculpture using the wood replica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Father Serra Pact OK'd|newspaper=Oxnard Press Courier|author=Jim Schultz|date=March 22, 1988|pages=1–2|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of the student artists visited the wood statue at the old livery building and made latex molds in multiple sections.&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze figure was then cast in 20 pieces using the "lost wax" method.&lt;ref name=DP89&gt;{{cite news|title=Father Serra sculpture being recast at COD|newspaper=Desert Post|date=May 26, 1989|page=6|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19279292/father_serra_sculpture_being_recast_at/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATPD&gt;{{cite news|title=Palm Desert Sculpture School to Cast Bronze Copy of Junipero Serra Statue|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 24, 1988|page=IX-5|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19279371/palm_desert_sculpture_school_to_cast/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bronze cast was unveiled in front of Ventura City Hall at a ceremony on October 20, 1989, attended by more than 500 persons.&lt;ref name=LAT89&gt;{{cite news|title=Father Serra's Statute Gets New Life – in Bronze|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|author=Bob Pool|date=October 19, 1989|pages=J1, J5|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19261090/father_serras_statute_gets_new_life/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bronze statue of Fray Serra in place|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=October 21, 1989|page=A3|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze cast stands on a concrete base with an outer layer of polished black granite from the Andes Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1989, the bronze cast has been on display in the middle of a pedestrian island at the top of California Street overlooking downtown Ventura and the Pacific Ocean. A plaque at the base of the statue states: "The citizens of the City of San Buenaventura gratefully recognize the extraordinary efforts of Councilman Russell Burns (1918–1994) and master carver Wilbur Rubottom (1914–1993) to replace the decaying concrete 1936 statue of Father Serra by John Palo-Kangas with this cherished bronze copy dedicated on October 20, 1989."&lt;ref&gt;Plaque displayed at the base of the Father Serra statue.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and vandalism==
[[File:Chumash petroglyph murals and wooden Father Serra statue.jpg|thumb|right|Chumash petroglyph murals and wooden ''Father Serra'' statue at Ventura City Hall]]
The City's plan to display the wooden replica in the atrium of Ventura City Hall was met with objections from the city art committee and the Candelaria American Indian Council. Members of the art committee felt the statue was too large to be placed in the atrium, and the Indian Council objected due to Father Serra's alleged abuse and enslavement of the [[Chumash people]]. The objectors did not prevail, though the City also commissioned a series of murals reproducing local Chumash petroglyphs which were installed next to the wooden Serra statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serra Statue to Be Shown Over Protests of 2 Groups|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|author=Jesse Katz|date=September 29, 1988|pages=IX-1, IX-14|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19261987/serra_statue_to_be_shown_over_protests/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VCFP88/&gt;

Ventura's ''Serra'' statues have also been subjected to vandalism over the years. In May 1980, primer paint was poured over the concrete statue; city workers sandblasted the paint from the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fouled figure|newspaper=unknown|date=May 22, 1980|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1991, four glass jars full of orange and blue paint were thrown at the bronze cast; the words "Spirit of Crazy Horse" and an image of a clenched fist were also spray-painted on the sidewalk at the base of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vandalized statue of Serra unscathed|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=January 16, 1991|author=Jim McLain|page=A4|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (biographical file for the ''Junipero Serra'' statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1992, the bronze cast's hand was painted with red paint, and a message was stenciled on the concrete below accusing Serra of having failed to honor God and claiming that Serra was a symbol of slavery to Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scarlet letters|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=May 24, 1992|page=A3|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some continue to object to the public display of Serra statuary, citing the mistreatment of the Chumash people. Following Serra's canonization in 2015, ''Serra'' statues were vandalized at [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo|Carmel Mission]] (smeared with green paint, "Saint of Genocide" written on a headstone),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mission statue of Serra sustains damage|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 28, 2015|page=4|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19318173/mission_statue_of_serra_sustains_damage/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]'s Lower Presidio Historic Park (decapitated),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/02/28/head-reattached-to-st-junipero-serra-statue-in-monterey/|title=Head reattached to St. Junipero Serra statue in Monterey|newspaper=The Mercury News|date=February 28, 2017|author=James Herrera}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mission San Fernando Rey de España|San Fernando Mission]] (hands painted red and word "murderer" scrawled),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=St. Junipero Serra statue vandalized in Mission Hills|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 20, 2017|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-junipero-serra-vandalized-mission-hills-20170820-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mission Santa Barbara]] (decapitated and covered in red paint),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Decapitated and doused with red paint: Vandals target St. Junipero Serra statue at Santa Barbara mission|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 24, 2017|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-junipero-serra-statue-vandalized-santa-barbara-20170914-htmlstory.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mission San Gabriel Arcángel|San Gabriel Mission]] (cut with electric saw and splashed with red paint).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vandal damages Padre Serra statue in San Gabriel|newspaper=Ventura County Star|date=November 3, 2017|url=https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2017/11/03/vandal-damages-padre-serra-statue-san-gabriel/831785001/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, amid the controversy over public display and vandalism of ''Serra'' statues, the ''[[Ventura County Star]]'' published an editorial calling for the removal of ''Serra'' statues. The author of the editorial, Rellis Smith, wrote: "To have statues such as the one in front of Ventura City Hall is a direct slap in the face of all Chumash and other Native American cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remove Serra statues|newspaper=Ventura County Star|author=Rellis Smith|date=August 15, 2017|url=https://www.vcstar.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/08/15/remove-serra-statues/571088001/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formularies''' (singular '''formulary'''; Latin ''littera(e) formularis, -ares'') are medieval collections of models for the execution of documents (acta), public or private; a space being left for the insertion of names, dates, and circumstances peculiar to each case. Their modern equivalent are [[form (document)|forms]].

==Rationale==
It is practically inevitable that documents of the same nature, issued from the same office, or even from distinct offices, will bear a close resemblance to one another. Those charged with the execution and expedition of such documents come naturally to employ the same formulæ in similar cases; moreover, the use of such formulæ permits the drafting of important documents to be entrusted to minor officials, since all they have to do is to insert in the allotted space the particular information previously supplied them. Finally, in this way every document is clothed with all possible efficiency, since each of its clauses, and almost every word, has a meaning clearly and definitely intended. Uncertainties and difficulties of interpretation are thus avoided, and not infrequently lawsuits. This legal formalism is usually known as the "style" or habitual diction of chanceries and the documents that issue therefrom. It represents long efforts to bring into the document all necessary and useful elements in their most appropriate order, and to use technical expressions suited to the case, some of them more or less essential, others merely as a matter of tradition. In this way arose a true art of drafting public documents or private acta, which became the monopoly of chanceries and notaries, which the mere layman could only imperfectly imitate, and which in time developed to such a point that the mere "style" of a supposititious deed has often been sufficient to enable a skilful critic to detect the forgery.

==Early history==
The earlier Roman notaries (''tabelliones'') had their own traditional formulæ, and the drafting of their acta was subject to an infinity of detail;&lt;ref&gt;See "Novels" of [[Justinian]], xliv, lxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; the imperial chanceries of Rome and Byzantium were more remarkable still for their formulæ. The chanceries of the barbarian kingdoms and that of the papacy followed in their footsteps. Nevertheless it is usually not directly from the chanceries that the formularies drawn up in the Middle Ages have come down to us, but rather from the monastic and ecclesiastical schools. Therein was taught, as pertaining to the study of law, the art of drafting public and private documents.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Du Cange]], "Glossarium med. et infimæ Latinitatis", s. v. "Dictare"&lt;/ref&gt; It was called ''dictare'' as opposed to ''scribere'', i. e. the mere material execution of such documents.

To train the ''dictatores'', as they were known, specimens of public and private acta were placed before them, and they had to listen to commentaries thereon. Thus arose the yet extant formularies, between the 5th and the 9th centuries. These models were sometimes of a purely academic nature, but their number is small; in almost every case they are taken from real documents, in the transcription of which the individualizing references were suppressed so as to make them take on the appearance of general formulæ; in many instances nothing was suppressed.
 
The formulæ deal with public documents: royal decrees on civil matters, ordinances etc.; with documents relative to legal processes and the administration of justice; or with private deeds drawn up by a notary: sales, exchanges, gifts to churches and monasteries, transference of ecclesiastical property, the manumission of slaves, the settlement of matrimonial dowries, the execution of wills etc. Finally, there are deeds which refer solely to ecclesiastical concerns: consecrations of churches, blessings of various kinds, excommunications, etc.
 
The study of the medieval formularies is of importance for the history of legislation, the rise of institutions, the development of manners and customs, of civil history, above all for the criticism of charters and diplomas, and for researches in medieval philology. In those times the ecclesiastical and civil orders were closely related. Many civil functions and some of the highest state offices were held by ecclesiastics and monks. The ''[[ars dictandi]]'' was taught in the schools connected with the monasteries and those under ecclesiastical control. For quite a long time all acta were drawn up only in [[Latin]], and as the [[vernacular]] languages, in Romance lands, gradually fell away from classical Latin, recourse to ecclesiastics and monks became a matter of necessity. The formularies are of course anything but models of good Latinity; with the exception of the Letters (Variæ) of [[Cassiodorus]], and the St. Gall collection "Sub Salomone", they are written in careless or even barbarous Latin, though it is possible that their wretched "style" is intentional, so as to render them intelligible to the multitude.

The formularies of the Middle Ages date from the 6th to the 9th or 10th century, and we still possess many once used in one or other of the barbarian kingdoms. Many were edited in the 17th century by [[Jérôme Bignon]], [[Baluze]], [[Mabillon]] and others; and many more in the 19th century, especially by two savants who compiled collections of them: 
*[[Eugène de Rozière]], "Recueil général des formules usitées dans l'empire des Francs du cinquième au dixième siècle" (3 vols., Paris, 1859–71). He groups these early medieval formulæ under five principal heads: "Formulæ ad jus publicum, ad jus privatum, ad judiciorum ordinem, ad jus canonicum, et ad ritus ecclesiasticos spectantes". And he follows up this arrangement by a very complete set of tables of concordance.
*[[Karl Zeumer]], "Formulæ Merovingici et Karolini ævi" (Hanover, 1886) in ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'': Leg.", V; he reproduces the formulæ in the work and gives a more complete study than de Rozière. In his pages will be found a complete bibliography of all written on the subject before that time; or [[knight|Chevalier]], "Topo-Bibl.", may be consulted under the word "Formules".

==Various post-Roman traditions==
Some brief observations will here suffice on the formulæ used between the 6th and the 9th centuries in the various barbarian kingdoms.

# The [[Ostrogoths]] - Cassiodorus, secretary and afterwards prime minister of King [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], included in his "Variarum (epistolarum) libri XII", particularly in books six and seven, and, as he says, for the guidance of his successors, a great number of acta and letters drawn up by him for his royal master. It is a genuine formulary, though standing apart by itself. This collection dates from before 538 (P. L., LXIX). The Servite Canciani took ninety-two of these formulæ of Cassiodorus and included them in his "Barbarorum leges antiquæ" (Venice, 1781, I, 19-56).
# The [[Visigoths]] - " Formulæ Visigothicæ", a collection of the forty-Six formulæ made under King [[Sisebut]] (612-621). The king's name occurs twice in the curious formula xx, a dowry settlement in hexameter verse. Roman and Gothic law are followed either separately or together, according to the nationality of the covenanters. This collection was published in 1854 by de Rozière from a Madrid Manuscript, which was copied in turn from an Oviedo Manuscript of the 12th century, now lost.
# The Franks' formularies are numerous:
## "Formulæ Andecavenses", a collection made at Angers, consisting of sixty formulæ for private acta, some of them dating from the 6th century, but the greater number from the early part of the seventh; the last three of the collection belong to the end of the 7th century. They were first edited in 1685 by Mabillon from an 8th-century manuscript preserved at Fulda.
## "Formulæ Arvernenses" (also known as "Baluzianæ",from Baluze, their first editor, who issued the works in 1713), a collection of eight formulæ of private acta made at Clermont in Auvergne during the 8th century. The first of them is dated from the consulate of Honorius and Theodosius (407- 422).
## "Marculfi monachi formularum libri duo", the most important of these collections, and dedicated by the author, [[Marculf]], to a Bishop Landri, doubtless identical with [[Landry of Paris|Landericus]], the [[Bishop of Paris]] (650-656). The first book contains thirty-seven formulæ of royal documents; the second, cartœ pagenses, or private acta, to the number of fifty-two. The work, which was well done, was very favourably received, and became popular as an official textbook, if not in the time of the mayors of the palace, at least under the early Carolingians. During the reign of Charlemagne it received a few additions, and was re-arranged under the title" Formulæ Marculfinæ ævi Karolini". Zeumer edited six formulæ closely related to this collection.
## "Formulæ Turonenses", also known as "Sirmondicæ"&lt;ref&gt;Baluze edited them under this title because they had been discovered by Père Sirmond in a Langres manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; This collection, made at Tours, contains forty-five formulæ, two of which are royal documents, many being judicial decisions, and the remainder private acta. It seems to belong to the middle of the 8th century. Zeumer added to the list twelve other formulæ taken from various manuscripts.
## "Formulæ Bituricenses", a name given to nineteen formulæ taken from different collections, but all drafted at Bourges; they date from 720 to the close of the 8th century. [[Zeumer]] added to them twelve formulæ taken from the Abbey of Saint-Pierre de Vierzon.
## "Formulæ Senonenses", two distinct collections, both of which were made at Sens, and preserved in the same 9th-century manuscript. The first, "Cartæ Senonicæ", dates from before 775, and contains fifty-one formulæ, of which seven are for royal documents, two are letters to the king, and forty-two are private charters. Zeumer added six Merovingian formulæ. The second collection, "Formulæ Senonenses recentiores", dates from the reign of Louis the Pious, and contains eighteen formulæ, of which seven deal with judicial acts. Zeumer added five metrical formulæ, and two Merovingian formulæ written in [[Tironian notes]].
## "Formulæ Pithoei" In a manuscript loaned by Pithou to Du Cange for his "Glossarium" of medieval Latin there was a rich collection of at least one hundred and eight formulæ, drawn up originally in territory governed by Salic law. This manuscript has disappeared. Under the above heading Zeumer has collected the various quotations made by Du Cange from this formulary.
## "Formulæ Salicæ Bignonianæ", so called from the name of their first editor, Bignon. It contains twenty-seven formulæ, one of which is for a royal decree; they were collected in a country subject to Salic law, about the year 770.
## "Formulæ Salicæ Merkelianæ", so called from the name of their editor, Merkel (about 1850), a collection of sixty-six formulæ taken from a Vatican manuscript; they were not brought to completion until after 817. The first part (1-30) consists of formulæ for private acta, modelled on "Marculf" and the "Formulæ Turonenses"; the second part (31-42) follows the "Formulæ Bignonianæ", the third (43-45) contains three formulæ drawn up in some abbey; the fourth (46-66) has formulæ dating from the close of the 8th century and probably compiled in some episcopal town. Two formulæ of decrees of the bishops of Paris were discovered by Zeumer in the same manuscript.
## "Formulæ Salicæ Lindenbrogianæ", so called from the name of their first editor, Friedrich Lindenbrog, a Frankfort lawyer (1613) who edited them together with other documents. The collection contains twenty-one formulæ of private acta, drawn up in Salic law territory. Four others were added by Zeumer.
## "Formulæ Imperiales e curia Ludovici Pii", also known as "Carpenterianæ" from [[Pierre Carpentier]] who first edited them in his "Alphabetum Tironianum" (Paris, 1747). This is an important collection of fifty-five formulæ, drawn up after the fashion of the charters of Louis the Pious at the Abbey of St. Martin of Tours, between 828 and 832, The manuscript is written mainly in Tironian notes. This collection was used by the Carolingian [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] of the 9th century. Zeumer has added to the list two formulæ.
## "Collectio Flaviniensis", one hundred and seventeen formulæ compiled at the Abbey of Flavigny in the 9th century; of these, ten only are not to be met with elsewhere.
## "Formulæ collectionis Sancti Dionysii", a collection of twenty-five formulæ made at the [[Abbey of St-Denys]] under [[Charlemagne]]; for the most part it is taken from the archives of the abbey.
## "Formulæ codicis Laudunensis", a [[Laon]] (Picardy) manuscript containing seventeen formulæ, of which the first five were drawn up at the Abbey of St-Bavon in Ghent, and the remainder at Laon.
# The most important of the [[Alamanni]] formulæ are:
## "Formulæ Alsaticæ", under which name we have two collections, one made at the [[Abbey of Murbach]] (Formulæ Morbacenses) at the end of the 8th century and preserved in a manuscript of St.Gall, containing twenty-seven formulæ, one of which is for a royal decree; the other embodies three formulæ made at Strasburg (Formulæ Argentinenses) and preserved in a Berne manuscript.
## "Formulæ Augienses", from the [[Abbey of Reichenau]], consisting of three distinct collections: one from the end of the 8th century containing twenty-three formulæ of private acta; another belonging to the 8th and 9th centuries contains forty-three formulæ of private documents; the third, "Formulæ epistolares Augienses", is a "correct letter-writer" with twenty-six formulæ.
## "Formulæ Sangallenses" (from the [[Abbey of St. Gall]]), in two collections of this name. The "Formulæ Sangallenses miscellaneæ" consists of twenty-five formulæ, many of which are accompanied by directions for their use. They date from the middle of the eighth to the end of the 9th century. The important "Collectio Sangallensis Salomonis III tempore conscripta" is so called because it seems to have been compiled by the monk [[Notker of St. Gall]], under Abbot Salomon III (890-920), who was also [[Bishop of Constance]]. Notker died in 912. It contains in forty-seven formulæ models of royal decrees, private documents, litterae formatae and other episcopal documents. Zeumer added six formulæ taken from the same manuscript.
# Among the Bavarian formulæ are:
## "Formulæ Salisburgenses", a very fine collection of one hundred and twenty-six models of documents and letters, published in 1858 by Rockinger, and drawn up at [[Salzburg]] in the early part of the 9th century.
## "Collectio Pataviensis" (of [[Passau]]), containing seven formulæ, five of which are of royal decrees, executed at Passau under [[Louis the German]].
## "Formulæ codicis S. Emmerami", fragments of a large collection made at [[St. Emmeram]]'s at [[Regensburg]] (Ratisbon).
# In Rome the most important of all ancient formularies is certainly the ''[[Liber diurnus romanorum pontificum]]'', a collection of one hundred and seven formularies long used by the [[Apostolic chancery]]. If it was not drawn up for the papal chancery but copies its documents and is largely compiled from the "Registrum" or letter-book of [[St. Gregory the Great]] (590-604). It was certainly in official use by the Roman chancery from the ninth to the end of the 11th century. This collection was known to the medieval canonists, and is often quoted by Cardinal Deusdedit and [[St. Yves of Chartres]]; four of its documents were incorporated into the "Decretum" of Gratian. The best manuscript of the "Liber diurnus", written at the beginning of the 9th century, comes from the Roman monastery of [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] and was discovered in the Vatican Library. About the middle of the 17th century, the learned [[Lucas Holstenius]] used it when preparing an edition of the work which was officially stopped and suppressed on the eve of its appearance, because it contained an ancient profession of faith in which the popes anathematized their predecessor Honorius. In 1680 the Jesuit [[Jean Garnier]], using another manuscript of the College of Clermont (Paris), brought out an edition of the "Liber diurnus" not approved by Rome (P. L., CV).

In the 19th century the Vatican manuscript was utilized for two editions, one by [[de Rozière]] (Paris, 1869), the other by [[von Sickel]] (Vienna, 1889). In 1891 the [[Abbate Ceriani]] discovered at the Ambrosiana (Milan) a third manuscript as yet unused. For a full bibliography of recent researches concerning the "Liber diurnus" see the "Topo-Bibl." of Chevalier, s. v. While, in its complete form, the "Liberdiurnus" cannot date back further than 786, the earliest forms of it go back to the end of the 7th century. Von Sickel holds that its opening formulæ (1-63) are even fifty years earlier than that date. It is badly arranged as a collection, but wonderfully complete. After a series of addresses and conclusions for papal letters, varied according to the addressees, there are formulæ concerning the installation of bishops, the consecration of churches, the administration of church property, the grant of the pallium and various other privileges. Then follow models for the official correspondence on the occasion of a vacancy of the Holy See and the election of a pope, also directions for the consecration and the profession of faith of the pope-elect; finally a group of formulæ affecting various matters of ecclesiastical administration.

==Later history==
In the 10th century these formularies cease to be in universal use; in the eleventh, recourse is had to them still more rarely; other methods of training notaries are introduced. Copies of letters are no longer placed before them. In their stead, special treatises of instruction are prepared for these officials, and manuals of epistolary rhetoric appear, with examples scattered here and there throughout the text, or collected in separate books. Such treatises on composition, ''[[ars dictaminis|artes dictaminis]]'', have hitherto been only partially studied and classified, notably by [[Ludwig Rockinger]] in "Briefsteller und Formelbücher des XI. bis XIV. Jahrhunderts" (Munich, 1863). The most ancient of these manuals known to us is the "Breviarium de dictamine" of [[Alberic of Monte Cassino]], about 1075; in the 12th century treatises of this kind become more frequent, first in Italy, then in France, especially along the Loire at [[Orléans]] and at [[Tours]].
 
Side by side with these works of epistolary rhetoric we meet special treatises for the use of clerks in different chanceries, and formularies to guide notaries public. Such are the "Formularium tabellionum" of [[Irnerius of Bologna]] in the 12th century, and the "Summa artis notariæ" of [[Ranieri of Perugia]] in the thirteenth; that of [[Salathiel of Bologna]] printed at Strasburg, in 1516, and the very popular one of Rolandino that went through many editions, beginning with the Turin edition of 1479.

At the [[papal chancery]], in general very faithful to its customs and its "style", after the reform of [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] many formularies and practical treatises appeared, none of them possessing an official value. The writings of [[Dietrich of Nieheim]] (an employee of the chancery in 1380), "De Stilo" and "Liber Cancellariæ", have been the subject of critical studies. At a more recent date we meet many treatises on the Roman chancery and on pontifical letters, but they are not formularies, though their text often contains many models.

However there has appeared an official publication of certain formulæ of the Roman Curia, i. e. the collection of formulæ for matrimonial dispensations granted by the ''[[Dataria Apostolica]]'', published in 1901 as "Formulæ Apostolicæ Datariæ pro matrimonialibus dispensationibus, jussu Emi. Card. Pro Datarii Cajetani Aloisi-Masella reformatæ".

Lastly, in a different order of ideas it may be well to mention a collection of formulæ for use in episcopal courts, the "Formularium legalepracticum" of Francesco Monacelli (Venice, 1737), re-edited by the Camera Apostolica (3 vols. fol., Rome, 1834).

From the 12th century onward the formularies of the [[papal Curia]] become more numerous but less interesting, since it is no longer necessary to have recourse to them to supplement the documents.

The formularies of the [[Cancellaria Apostolica]] are collections drawn up by its clerks, almost exclusively for their own guidance; they interest us only through their relation to the "Rules of the Chancery". The formularies of the [[Poenitentiaria]] have a higher interest for us; they appear during the 12th century when that department of Roman administration was not yet restricted to questions of conscience and the forum internum, but served as a sort of clearing-house for lesser favours granted by the Holy See, especially for [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]]s. These interesting documents, including the formularies, have been collected and edited by Göller in "Die papstliche Poenitentiarie bis Eugen IV." (Rome, 1907).

Previously, Lea had published "A Formulary of the Papal Penitentiary in the Thirteenth Century" (Philadelphia, 1892), probably the work of [[Cardinal Thomasius of Capua]] (died 1243). The "Summa de absolutionibus et dispensationibus" of [[Pope Nicholas IV|Nicholas IV]] is also important; of particular value also is the formulary of [[Benedict XII]] (1336 at the latest), made by order of that pope and long in use. It contains five hundred and seventy letters of which more than two hundred are taken from the collection of Thomasius. Attention is also directed to the list of "faculties" conferred, in 1357, on [[Cardinal Albornoz]], first edited by [[Lecacheux]] in "Mélanges d'Archéologie et d'Histoire des écoles françaises de Rome et d'Athènes", in 1898; and to later texts in [[Göller]]. We make a bare mention of the taxœ or "taxes" in use at the [[Poenitentiaria]], to which were occasionally joined those imposed by the Cancellaria; presumably they are not in any way related to the formularies.

'''Free-Form Select''' (with [[synonym]]s) is a technique in [[printmaking]], [[graphic design]] and [[image processing]].

The effect is to erase background colors or elements from a [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] to create stand-alone objects. Today, this is done with [[graphics software]] ([[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]]) and computers rather than by cutting away parts with [[scissors]] or [[scalpel]]s.

Almost every modern graphics software includes this feature, such as [[CorelDRAW]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Content/1175283343002 referred to as "Vignette Frame"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[GIMP]], and [[Paint (software)|Microsoft Paint]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] only&lt;/ref&gt; The motif which is to be cut-out [[freehanded]] is defined by a border path around the motif.

[[File:OrangeOrange.jpg|thumb|Coloring is a core motif in a black-and-white image.]]
Free-Form Select is also understood in coloring parts of a black-and-white images and vice versa. Coloring a single object within a black-and-white environment is sometimes called [[Sin City#Style|Sin City]] effect.&lt;!-- http://www.youtube.com/user/techtopia#p/c/C21CEDCF8589E119/2/yfJLz3ACPK4 --&gt;

'''Ivan Kushchnik Tower''' (''{{lang-ru|Башня Иоанна Кущника}}'', ''{{lang-uk|Вежа Іоанна Кущника}}'')&amp;nbsp;— a defensive [[tower]] with a [[Church (building)|church]], part of the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] [[Pechersk Lavra fortification|fortifications]], [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]].

== Name ==
A small church built into the defensive tower was consecrated in the memory of [[:ru:Иоанн Кущник|St. John Kushchnik]], who lived in 5th century in [[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]] and was considered a saint patron of [[Hetman]] [[Ivan Samoylovych]].&lt;ref name="pamyatky"&gt;[http://pamyatky.kiev.ua/streets/lavra/verhnya-teritoriya-lavri-1120-st/svyato-uspenska-kiyevo-pecherska-lavra-muri-oboronni-verhnoyi-teritoriyi-1698-1701-19-stolittya/svyato-uspenska-kiyevo-pecherska-lavra-vezha-ioanna-kushchnika-1696-1701 An account of historic and cultural monuments, Kyiv] ({{lang-uk|Звіт пам'яток історії та культури, Київ.}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The tower is irregular-octagonal in plan, elongated in east-west direction. It is built from brick, covered in white plaster and decorated with profiled [[cornice]]. The tower has three stories covered with tinned [[cupola]] and gilded cross on top. Ceilings of the ground and the first floors were originally wooden, but were later replaced by stone, thus increasing tower fire resistance. The tower height from the ground to the tip of the cross is 25 meters, its other dimensions decrease with height being 9,0 x 7,3 meters at the ground level and 8,5&amp;nbsp;x 7,0 meters on the first floor level.&lt;ref name="pamyatky" /&gt; Octagonal walls have windows for [[shotgun]]s and small cannons. The tower had a gallery on the monastery side, supported by wooden consoles connected to the general system of defensive walls. The upper tier of the tower has a semicircular window openings. The structure is built in a Kiev style of [[Ukrainian Baroque]].&lt;ref name="pamyatky" /&gt;

== History ==
The tower was built between 1696 and 1701. It was heavily damaged by the great Lavra fire of 1718.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CK%5CY%5CKyivanCaveMonastery.htm Kyivan Cave Monastery] at [http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/ the Encyclopedia of Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt; Historic documents state that three towers with churches, among them St. John Kushchik, were set to be renovated in 1721, along other restorations of Lavra, but the plan was not realized until 1797. However, there was some maintenance before that – in 1785 the tower received a tin roof.&lt;ref name="pamyatky" /&gt;

In 1918 the tower was damaged again – this time from the explosion at Zvirinets, then repaired the same year. Major renovations in 20th century were done in 1953&lt;ref name="pamyatky" /&gt; and in 1972. The last one was carried out under supervision of art historian V. Pidgora and architect A. Kulagin. During that renovation the lower walls and vaults of the tower were strengthened, the windows of the top floor and tier under cupola were reopened, and the cross re-gilded.&lt;ref name="pamyatky" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6589">'''KISS''' is an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] for "'''Keep it simple, stupid'''" as a design principle noted by the [[U.S. Navy]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=TDal/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPar/&gt; The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore [[simplicity]] should be a key goal in [[design]], and that unnecessary complexity should be avoided. The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]].&lt;ref name=BRich/&gt; The term "KISS principle" was in popular use by 1970.&lt;ref name=Pit/&gt; Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward",&lt;ref name="monash"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.monash.edu/business/marketing/marketing-dictionary/k/kiss-principle |title=Kiss principle definition by MONASH Marketing Dictionary| date=1994-11-18 | accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; "keep it small and simple" and "keep it stupid simple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.apache.org/~fhanik/kiss.html| title=Kiss Principle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The acronym was reportedly coined by [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], lead engineer at the [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[Skunk Works]] (creators of the [[Lockheed U-2]] and [[SR-71 Blackbird]] spy planes, among many others).&lt;ref name=BRich/&gt;

While popular usage has transcribed it for decades as "Keep it simple, stupid", Johnson transcribed it as "Keep it simple stupid" (no comma), and this reading is still used by many authors.&lt;ref name=misra&gt;Ram B. Misra (2004), "Global IT Outsourcing: Metrics for Success of All Parties", ''Journal of Information Technology Cases and Applications'', volume 6 issue 3, page 21. [http://web.njit.edu/~jerry/Outsourcing/out-JITCA-6-3-2004-2.pdf Online version]. Retrieved 2009-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no implicit meaning that an engineer was stupid; just the opposite.&lt;ref name=BRich/&gt;

The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools. Hence, the "stupid" refers to the relationship between the way things break and the sophistication available to repair them.

The acronym has been used by many in the [[List of military slang terms|U.S. military]], especially the [[List of U.S. Navy acronyms and expressions|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Air Force]], and in the field of [[software developer|software development]].

==Variants==
The principle most likely finds its origins in similar [[Minimalism|minimalist]] concepts, such as [[Occam's razor]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication", [[Mies Van Der Rohe]]'s "[[Less is more (architecture)|Less is more]]", [[Bjarne Stroustrup]]'s "Make Simple Tasks Simple!", or [[Antoine de Saint Exupéry]]'s "It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away". [[Colin Chapman]], the founder of [[Lotus Cars]], urged his designers to "Simplify, then add lightness". [[Heath Robinson]] machines and [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldberg's machines]], intentionally overly-complex solutions to simple tasks or problems, are humorous examples of "non-KISS" solutions. Also Shakespeare's "Brevity is the soul of wit".

A variant — "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler" — is attributed to [[Albert Einstein]], although this may be an editor's paraphrase of a lecture he gave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/#more-2363|title=Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler|publisher=Quote Investigator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film animation==
Master animator [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] explains the KISS principle in his book ''[[The Animator's Survival Kit]]'', and [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] write about it in ''[[Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life]]'', a considerable work of the genre. The problem faced is that inexperienced animators may "over-animate" in their works, that is, a character may move too much and do too much.  Williams urges animators to "KISS".

The '''Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts''' ('''ALBA'''; {{lang-fr|Académie libanaise des Beaux-Arts}}; {{lang-ar|الأكاديمية اللبنانية للفنون الجميلة}}) was originally a stand-alone [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[institute]], now one of the [[Faculty (university)|faculties]] at the [[University of Balamand]], teaching courses in [[fine art]]. It was founded in 1937, and it was the first national institution of [[higher education]] in Lebanon. In 1988, it joined the [[University of Balamand]] during its foundation as one of the three founding faculties at the time.

The faculty currently offers several programs in [[French language|French]] in its original location in [[Sin el Fil]], [[Beirut]]. They include, but are not limited to, [[architecture]], [[decorative art]]s, [[plastic arts]], [[Urban planning|urban]] and [[regional planning]], Graphic Design, Digital art direction, Fashion design and [[Audiovisual education|audiovisual directing]]. In October 2000, the University of Balamand launched new programs in [[English language|English]] for the faculty at its main campus in [[El-Koura]], which now consists of [[Architecture]], [[Interior Architecture]], [[Graphic Design]] and [[Computer Graphics And Interactive Media]].

== History ==

Founded in 1937 by a group of young classical musicians led by the engineer [[Alexis Boutros]].{{fact|date=December 2016}}

=== Details on the foundations of its fields ===

In 1943, a branch of [[architecture]] was sponsored by the famous French engineer [[Daniel Abou Dargham]].

In 1948, the school of letters was created which graduated specialists in literature, history and geography.

There followed in 1949 by the school of political and [[Economics|economic science]].

In 1950, the academy set up a school of law, which was forced to close later in 1959.

In a later stage, additional fields of study were added to the basic core such as the school of classic dance, the school of acting and the school of [[sculpture]].

The academy added new sections of [[publicity]] and information in 1975, and [[audio-visual]] production in 1987, and [[urban studies]] in 1994

Soon after the death of Alexis Boutros, Mr. Georges Haddad was appointed dean of Alba in 1979. He struggled during the civil war to keep the programs running. He managed to achieve the fusion with University of Balamand in 1988.

In 2000, the Academy started offering the "Interior Architecture and design and Graphic Design" programs in English under supervision of Mr. [[George Fiani]].

In 2009, the Architecture and CGIM programs were offered at Balamand Campus. The same year, The long-time caretaker of ALBA, Mr. George Haddad died.

Mr. Bekhazi was shortly after appointed "Dean of ALBA" by the University of Balamand.

In 2014, mr. George Fiani was appointed Director of AlBA-Balamand Campus

==Anime==
The anime adaptation from the manga series, titled as '''''Kin'iro no Corda ~primo passo~''''' was first broadcast by [[TV Tokyo]] starting from October 2006 to March 2007. [[Kōjin Ochi]] directs the series, while [[Reiko Yoshida]] did the series composition.

The anime is produced by [[Ruby Party]], a sub-division in Koei that produces dating-simulation games that are targeted towards the female audience.

The anime also premiered on [[Animax]] under the title, '''''La Corda D'Oro ~primo passo~'''''. It was aired across its respective networks worldwide, including [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]], also translating and dubbing the series into English for its English language networks in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]], and other regions.

The last volume of the DVD has compiled the special episode together. Even so, it has yet to be broadcast in Japan. However, it was aired on Animax’s Southeast Asia English networks.

The series was later collected into 9 DVD volumes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14134">[[File:Moroccan Architecture.jpg|350px|thumb|A [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[townscape]]]]

'''Moroccan architecture''' dates from 110 BCE with the massive pisé ([[mud brick]]) buildings. The architecture has been influenced by [[Islamic architecture|Islamization]] during the [[Idrisid dynasty]], [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] exiles from Spain, and also by France who [[French protectorate in Morocco|occupied Morocco]] in 1912.

[[Morocco]] is in Northern-Africa bordering the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Atlantic]]. The country's diverse geography and the land's long history marked by successive waves of settlers and military encroachments are all reflected in Morocco's architecture.

== History ==
[[File:Mud-Brick-City.jpg|220px|thumbnail|left|Mud brick city of [[Ait Benhaddou]], Morocco]]
Morocco's first independent state called the Berber kingdom of Mauretania was ruled by the [[Berbers]] clan. It was first documented during 110 BC. During the time of the Berbers, the country has been through several sieges by a number of invaders. Nevertheless, the Berbers ritual and beliefs still remained and became the country's cultural heritage including its antique architecture. The Berbers are known for their use of earth or [[mud brick]] called pisé (French). Many of the massive pisé buildings had defensive functions as main trading posts and ports or guard walls against pirates and rivals. This ancient building method prevails in all sizes of buildings. Since pisé is a water- permeable material, the foundation is required to be rebuilt regularly; however, the repeating use of forms, materials and patterns resulted as Morocco's distinctive architecture. Moreover, Moroccan traditional architecture also gained influences from neighboring countries and intruders.

== Influences ==

=== Islam ===
{{See also|Islamic architecture#Moroccan architecture}}
[[File:Cve.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Koutoubia Mosque]] in [[Marrakech]], completed in the [[Almohad]] period 1184–1199]]

The conversion of the Berber tribes in Morocco to Islam by [[Idris I of Morocco]] greatly influenced the overall architectural style of the country. The elegance of Islamic features is blended in and adapted into buildings and interior designs such as the use of tiling, fountains, geometric design and floral motifs. Which could be seen in mosques, palaces, plazas as well as homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Montague |first=M. |year=2012 |title=Marrakesh by design: Decorating with all the colors, patterns, and magic of Morocco |location=New York |work=Artisan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials chosen for the interiors of Moroccan classical architecture, are due in part to the necessity of cooling in the arid land climate of Morocco.

* Tiles – [[Zellige]] tiling, often wrongly labelled "mosaic", is used to decorate the surfaces of buildings and objects, principally interior walls, floors, and fountains. Modern use of [[zellige]] has extended the use to furniture and other interiors.
* Fountains – Before the conversion, water was already an important part of Moroccan culture; however, Islam made water much more important functionally because of the ritual ablution before prayer. Thus, fountains, also representing [[paradise]], could be found everywhere in order to serve everyone.
* Mosques – Following the introduction of Islam, [[mosques]] were built in Morocco with their distinct architectural features.
* Geometric Design and Floral Motifs [[Arabesque]] – Based on Islamic beliefs, avoiding the use of human or animal images is preferable resulting in the spread of floral motifs ([[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]s) and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]]. The motifs in Moroccan architectural decor are chiefly carved into stone, plaster and wood.

Moroccan Islamic architecture is not confined to the country. For example, [[Sheikha Salama Mosque]] in the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] city of [[Al Ain]] has two [[minaret]]s which partly look Moroccan.&lt;ref name="RoughGuides2016B"&gt;{{cite book |work=[[Rough Guides]] UK |title=The Rough Guide to Dubai |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |chapter= |page=266 |isbn=0-2412-9865-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3awnDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT266&amp;dq=sheikha+salama+mosque&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0xuiGw_3dAhVNWxoKHQSXCToQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sheikha%20salama%20mosque&amp;f=false |date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moorish (Spain 711-1492) ===
[[File:Vgarden.jpg|thumb|[[Alhambra]] garden in [[Granada]], Spain, 13th–14th century]]

Modern day Spain was a Moorish domain from the early 8th century to the late 15th century and was known as [[Al-Andalus]] 711 AD to 1492 AD. 
During the 11th century the berber dynasty of the [[Almohads|Almohad Caliphate]], ruled Morocco and the southern part of modern-day Spain the most famous of their remaining buildings are 
the [[Koutoubia Mosque]] in Marrakesh, the [[Giralda]] of [[Seville]], Spain and the [[Hassan Tower]], in Rabat, Morocco.
The [[Almoravids|Almoravid dynasty]] ruled Morocco and the southern half of Spain through the 12th century.
The [[Marinids|Marinid dynasty]] from the 13th through the 15th century, rule both Moroccan and Southern Spain until the [[Reconquista]] with the fall of Granada in 1492, effectively ending the Moorish era in Iberia.
Moorish architecture therefore evolved into a distinct form. The elements of which are as follows

* '''Arches''' – Arches are common feature in Morocco, which can be divided into two types. The first arch is the horseshoe which is clover shaped. The second is cusped like a rounded keyhole. These are called [[Moorish]] arches. 
* '''Tiling''' – Overlapping roof tiling became popular after the influence of [[Spain]]; the tiles are mostly hand glazed.

=== French ===
[[File:Alley-354451 1920.jpg|thumb|A Moroccan alley]]

[[France]] occupied Morocco in 1912. Later, as a result of the unorganized growth of real estate in the late 1800s to early 1900s, the French protector declared regulations for building standards which directly affected the architecture at that time, as follows:

# Buildings could not be higher than four stories.      
# Land use regulation required twenty percent of a planned area to be courtyards or gardens.
# Balconies must not overlook neighboring residences.
# Roofs of all buildings should be flat.

The building regulations maintained the country's preexisting architectural features and balanced the rapid urbanization.

== Types of house ==
=== Riad ===
{{main article|Moroccan Riad}}

The Riad also known as Dar is the Moroccan traditional house, which normally has two or more storeys around a courtyard.&lt;ref name="WilbauxLebrun2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilbaux |first1=Quentin |last2=Lebrun |first2=Michel |last3=McElhearn |first3=Kirk |title=Marrakesh: The Secret of Courtyard Houses |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpdO5eaQpWUC&amp;pg=PA380 |year=2008 |publisher=www.acr-edition.com |isbn=978-2-86770-130-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Villa ===

Villas are larger stand-alone housing in the urbanized area which do not need to follow traditional architectural style.

== Architectural Features ==
[[File:Fes Bab Bou Jeloud 2011.jpg|thumb|left|A distinctively Moroccan arch: [[Bab Bou Jeloud]], [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]]]

Arches, most often the [[horseshoe arch]] are used in almost every aspect of Moroccan housing whether it is doors, entrances, windows or niches.

Domes are often integrated with altars or commemoratory monuments as well as modern villas.

The interior doors of villas are usually oversized and decorative. In contrast, very small doors are used in dars. Doors are often adorned with delicate metal work, carving or color.

In contrast with doors, windows in Moroccan architecture are often unremarkable. They are normally arched glass panes with fewer adornments compared to doors.

[[Mashrabiya]] is an Islamic [[dowel]] work, made by carving large wood partitions in elaborate [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]]. Its purpose is to conceal the women from the visitor’s prying eyes according to Islamic tradition.

The fountain is a conspicuous feature in every house, often made of marble or cement. It is built in the heart of the courtyard, living room or guest room.

== Elements of Classic Moroccan Interiors ==

[[File:Doorway in Ben Youssef Madrasa.JPG|thumb|upright|A small doorway in [[Ben Youssef Madrasa]], [[Marrakech]]. The wooden doors are carved with a [[girih]] pattern of strapwork. The arch is surrounded with [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]s; to either side is a band of [[Islamic calligraphy]], above colourful [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]] [[zellige]] tilework.]]
{{further information|Islamic geometric patterns}}

=== Woodwork ===

[[Woodwork]] can be found in both urbanized and more traditional areas of Morocco. The woodwork serves as the main finishing. This intricate woodwork can be found on various surfaces of buildings especially the interiors, such as wall, ceiling window, gallery and balcony. The wood itself does not need to be finished or painted after the long process of delicate carving.&lt;ref&gt;Jereb, J. (1996). ''Arts &amp; crafts of Morocco''. San Francisco: Chronicle Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plaster ===
The plaster used for sculpting is called "gabs" or "jybs" in Moroccan, with the gypsum extracted abundantly from quarries in [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]], [[Asni]], [[Meknès-Tafilalet|Meknès]] and [[Ouazzane]]. [[Tadelakt]], [[qadad]], and non-waterproof plasters are used. They may be polished smooth or elaborately carved into [[yeseria]].

=== Metalwork ===

[[Copper]], [[bronze]], [[iron]] and [[brass]] are materials commonly used for studs, door knobs, window frames and door frames as well as room partitions.

=== Ceramics ===
A wide variety of [[ceramics]] is produced in Morocco. The painted and glazed ceramics are used for architectural work and tableware. Some are commonly used as roof tiling and decorative [[zellige]] tilework. The process of tiling, arranging and cutting them requires expertise in order to deliver a detailed piece of work.&lt;ref&gt;Aboufadil, Y., Thalal, A., &amp; Raghni, M. (2013). "Symmetry groups of Moroccan geometric woodwork patterns". ''Journal of Applied Crystallography'', 46, 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color Palettes ==
Morocco is known for their vivid and colorful design. However the diversity of colors that are included in the design all holds different connotations.&lt;ref&gt;Montague, M. (2012). Marrakesh by design: Decorating with all the colors, patterns, and magic of Morocco. New York: Artisan.

[[File:ThomasSchweicker2.jpg|thumb|Self portrait by mouth and foot artist [[Thomas Schweicker]] (1540–1602)]]
'''Mouth and foot painting''' is a technique to create [[drawing]]s, [[painting]]s and other works of art by maneuvering brushes and other tools with the mouth or foot. The technique is mostly used by artists who through illness, accident or congenital disability have no use of their hands.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2012}}
[[File:Naked Angels Logo.png|thumb|right|Naked Angels Logo]]

'''Naked Angels''' is an [[Theater in the United States|American]] [[theater]] company founded in 1986 and based in [[New York City]]. It was named after [[John Tytell]]'s book about the Beat Generation, ''[[Naked Angels]]''. It is notable for having produced plays on controversial social topics, such as the critically acclaimed Broadway transfer ''[[Next Fall (play)|Next Fall]]'', and for featuring many [[Hollywood]] stars.

Naked Angels was originally based out in a former picture-frame factory on West 17th Street in [[Manhattan]]. It "soon became the 'it' place for a generation of about-to-be famous young actors and playwrights."&lt;ref name="partyover" /&gt;

One of the company's longtime efforts is "The Issues Project", featuring plays or groups of plays focusing on socially relevant issues, often in collaboration with organizations like [[Amnesty International]], The [[Center for American Progress]], Project A.L.S. and The Culture Project. Also known are the group's long-running [http://www.nakedangels.com/development-programs/ "Tuesdays@9"] [[cold reading (theatrical)|cold reading]] series, where new playwrights, novelists, short-story writers, and actors get together to review work that is still being written.

In 2005, the company partnered with Fox Broadcasting Company to produce Naked TV, an annual showcase of short plays by emerging playwrights. Based on these stagings, Fox executives chose to turn some of the one-act plays into pilot scripts for the primetime network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Lee|title=Fox Gets 'Naked'|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/fox-gets-naked/|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=Backstage|date=April 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adalian|first1=Joseph|title=Network bares 'Naked TV' search for material|url=https://variety.com/2004/scene/markets-festivals/fox-stalks-writers-1117900565/|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=Variety|date=February 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lacob|first1=Jace|title=Television That's a Little More "Naked"|url=http://www.televisionaryblog.com/2006/05/television-thats-little-more-naked.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=BuzzFeed|date=May 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for "glamorous parties" and "provocative productions", after the first decade the group seemed to have lost the focus on theater. In 1995 the venue on 17th Street (often called "The Place") was closed and by that time many of the early members had gone on to fame in [[Hollywood]] or on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref name="partyover" /&gt;

{{featured article}}
{{italic title}}
[[File:Petrus Christus Nativité Haute résolution.jpg|thumb|370px|''Nativity'',  c. mid-1450s. Oil on wood, 127.6 cm&amp;nbsp;× 94.9 cm&amp;nbsp; (50.2 in&amp;nbsp;× 37.4 in), [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.]]
The '''''Nativity''''' is a devotional mid-1450s oil-on-wood panel painting by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Petrus Christus]]. It shows a [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity scene]] with [[grisaille]] archways and ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' sculptured reliefs. Christus was influenced by the first generation of Netherlandish artists, especially [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden]], and the panel is characteristic of the simplicity and naturalism of art of that period. Placing archways as a framing device is a typical van der Weyden device, and here likely borrowed from that artist's ''[[Altar of Saint John]]'' and ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]''. Yet Christus adapts these painterly motifs to a uniquely mid-15th century sensibility, and the unusually large panel&amp;nbsp;– perhaps painted as a central altarpiece panel for a [[triptych]]&amp;nbsp;– is nuanced and visually complex. It shows his usual harmonious composition and employment of [[Perspective (graphical)|one-point-perspective]], especially evident in the geometric forms of the shed's roof, and his bold use of color. It is one of Christus's most important works. [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Max Friedländer]] definitely attributed the panel to Christus in 1930, concluding that "in scope and importance, [it] is superior to all other known creations of this master."&lt;ref name="Upton58"/&gt;

The overall atmosphere is one of simplicity, serenity and understated sophistication. It is reflective of the 14th-century ''[[Devotio Moderna]]'' movement, and contains complex Christian symbolism, subtly juxtaposing [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testament iconography. The sculpted figures in the archway depict biblical scenes of sin and punishment, signaling the advent of [[Jesus|Christ]]'s sacrifice, with an over-reaching message of the "Fall and Redemption of humankind".&lt;ref name = "NGA"/&gt; Inside the archway, surrounded by four angels, is the [[Holy Family]]; beyond, a landscape extends into the far background.

Art historians have suggested completion dates ranging from the early 1440s to the early 1460s, with c. 1455 seen as probable. The panel was acquired by [[Andrew Mellon]] in the 1930s, and was one of several hundreds from his personal collection donated to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington. It has suffered damage and was restored in the early 1990s for an exhibition at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

==Description==
[[File:Petrus christus, natività di washington 05.jpg|thumb|180px|Angels in vestments adoring the [[Child Jesus|Christ Child]] who lies on Mary's robe]]
The panel measures 127.6&amp;nbsp;cm × 94.9&amp;nbsp;cm (50.2&amp;nbsp;in × 37.4&amp;nbsp;in), unusually large for a 15th-century [[Early Netherlandish Painting|Early Netherlandish]] single-panel painting.&lt;ref name="Upton53"/&gt; It covers four oak boards.&lt;ref name = "A215"&gt;Ainsworth (1994), 215&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no evidence of missing wing panels, its size suggests it was a central altarpiece of a large [[triptych]].{{efn|No triptychs painted by Christus have survived, but several reconstructions have been suggested. In size the ''Nativity'' is larger than [[Robert Campin]]'s ''[[Mérode Altarpiece]]'', and several triptychs by [[Jan van Eyck]]. See Upton (1975), 53}}  Art historian Joel Upton writes that with its size, style, tone and composition, Christus painted "an ''[[Andachtsbilder|Andachtsbild]]'', given monumental, ciboriumlike dimensions".&lt;ref name="Upton53"&gt;Upton (1975), 53&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinction between the figures and the space around them is characteristic of Christus, as is its [[Perspective (graphical)#One-point perspective|one-point perspective]]. The background landscape is typically serene, as are what Upton describes as the "charming, almost doll-like figures who make up the cast of characters."&lt;ref name="Upton52"&gt;Upton (1975), 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel is set in a shed enclosed by two pillars and an archway, rendered in sculpture-like [[grisaille]].&lt;ref name="Upton53"/&gt; Each pillar is supported by a relief hunched figure (''[[Atlas (architecture)|atlante]]'') at the base, holding the weight on its shoulders. On each pillar stand statues of [[Adam and Eve]]&amp;nbsp;– Adam on the left and Eve to the right.&lt;ref name="Upton54"/&gt; A marble threshold connects the two structures.&lt;ref name="Hand42"/&gt; On the top corners of the arch are two [[spandrels]];&lt;ref name = "Silver21"&gt;Silver (1982), 21&lt;/ref&gt; the [[archivolt]]s contain six biblical scenes in relief from the [[Book of Genesis]], depicting the [[Fall of Man]]. Two are of Adam and Eve; their [[Adam and Eve#Expulsion from Eden|expulsion from paradise]] and Adam tilling the soil. The others are of [[Cain and Abel]]: their sacrifice to God; Cain slaying Abel; God appearing to Abel; Cain expelled to the [[Land of Nod]].&lt;ref name = "Birkmeyer105"&gt;Birkmeyer (1961), 105&lt;/ref&gt;

In the shed [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] share an intensely private moment before the [[Annunciation to the shepherds]] of the [[Child Jesus|Christ child]]'s birth to the shepherds.&lt;ref name="Upton58"&gt;Upton (1975), 58&lt;/ref&gt; They are rendered in bright colors. Mary wears a long flowing blue robe, Joseph a green-lined red cape over a brown robe. He holds his hat in hand, and his [[Patten (shoe)|pattens]] are respectfully removed, left lying on the ground.&lt;ref name="Hand42"&gt;Hand (1987), 42&lt;/ref&gt; They gaze reverently at the newborn figure of Jesus who lies on Mary's robe.&lt;ref name = "A158"/&gt;   Mary's features have a softness and sweetness more characteristic of Christus's later paintings and remarkably similar to his ''[[Madonna of the Dry Tree]]'', according to [[Maryan Ainsworth]].&lt;ref name = "A161"&gt;Ainsworth (1994), 161&lt;/ref&gt;  Kneeling in adoration to either side are four small angels.&lt;ref name="Hand42"/&gt;

[[File:Petrus Christus Nativity (c. 1460s) detail.jpg|thumb|left|360px|Background detail (with [[Craquelure|crackle]] pattern apparent) showing a 15th-century Netherlandish town with two domed structures representing [[Jerusalem]]]]
Animals are visible in stalls. Behind them is a crumbling wall with three low [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] windows.&lt;ref name = "Birkmeyer107"&gt;Birkmeyer (1961), 107&lt;/ref&gt; Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning against the wall, looking into the shed.&lt;ref name = "A161"/&gt; Two are positioned to the left and two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue.&lt;ref name= "Upton100"/&gt; Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway,&lt;ref name="Upton55"&gt;Upton (1975), 55&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and [[Passion (Christianity)|Christ's Passion]].&lt;ref name = "NGA"&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.47.html "The Nativity"]. ''National Gallery of Art''. Retrieved December 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The large domed building is based on the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulcher]] in Jerusalem,&lt;ref name = "A161"/&gt; a replica of which the Adornes family built in [[Bruges]] in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel.&lt;ref name="Martens13ff"&gt;Marten (1990), 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.&lt;ref name="Upton51"&gt;Upton (1975), 51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Petrus christus, natività di washington 03.jpg|thumb|220px|Detail of the right archway showing [[Eve]] on a pedestal, eating the [[forbidden fruit]]]]

Light shines into the shed from outside through the low windows. The shadows cast suggest the dawn of a new day.&lt;ref name="Upton57"&gt;Upton (1975), 57&lt;/ref&gt; The four onlookers in the rear are in light and shadow, especially noticeable on the face of the man second from the right. Here Christus borrows an optical device from the work of his predecessors [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden]],&lt;ref name="Gellman147"/&gt; but is bolder and more accomplished with his use of light,&lt;ref name = "Pächt29"/&gt; which  art professor Lola Gellman describes as having "no counterpoint in previous art."&lt;ref name="Gellman147"&gt;Gellman (1970), 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
The panel is rich in Christian iconography,&lt;ref name = "Birkmeyer103"/&gt; which reflects the shift in religious attitudes to a more meditative and solitary devotion in the 14th century, exemplified by the ''[[Devotio Moderna]]'' movement. The painting is devotional; its [[iconography]] clearly juxtaposes [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]] imagery, conveying themes of punishment and redemption, against the belief that a second chance is available through the birth of Christ.&lt;ref name="Upton50ff"&gt;Upton (1975), 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of the Nativity changed significantly in European art following [[Bridget of Sweden|St Bridget]]'s visions of the event. According to Upton, the scene "became a source of emotional reward for one's faith, a private vision in response to one's contemplation."&lt;ref name="Upton59"/&gt; In Bridget's version of the event, Mary does not lie in a bed while giving birth. The event occurs in a cave, where, dressed in white, Mary kneels or stands in devotion before the infant lying on the ground. Joseph holds a candle to illuminate the birth. [[Robert Campin]]'s c. 1420 ''[[Nativity (Campin)|Nativity]]'' is representative of Bridget's narrative; the cave has been substituted by a shed with animals, Mary's handmaidens are present, while angels and shepherds rejoice.&lt;ref name="Upton59"&gt;Upton (1975), 59&lt;/ref&gt; Christus simplified the narrative: removing the handmaidens and relegating the animals to the background. Mary's white dress is replaced with a deep-blue robe. His ''Nativity'' is somber and subdued, an embodiment of the "austere calm of timeless worship."&lt;ref name="Upton61"&gt;Upton (1975), 61&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Nativity Robert Campin.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Robert Campin]]'s c. 1420 ''[[Nativity (Campin)|Nativity]]'' depicts the scene in accordance with [[Bridget of Sweden|St Bridget]]'s visions.]]
The ''Nativity'' conveys both the Old Testament themes of sin and punishment and the New Testament doctrine of sacrifice and redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1994), 158–161&lt;/ref&gt; Although Adam and Eve to either side of the arch are suggestive of those in van Eyck's  ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', they differ significantly. Here they are painted as grisaille statues in contrast to van Eyck's lifelike versions; and, unlike van Eyck's, here Adam and Eve stand in shame hiding their nudity.&lt;ref name="Upton54"&gt;Upton (1975), 54&lt;/ref&gt; Earthly sin and strife, anger and revenge, are represented in the warriors in the corner spandrels, and signify that which Christ's birth would bring to an end.&lt;ref name = "Silver21"/&gt;

Themes of punishment and redemption are further explored in the six scenes on the arch,&lt;ref name="Upton63ff"/&gt; where the reliefs show the events from {{bibleverse||Genesis|4:1–16|NIV}} (from left to right): The angel of God expelling Adam and Eve from the [[Garden of Eden]]; post-Expulsion life "when Adam delved and Eve spun"; the sacrifices of Cain and Abel; Cain killing Abel; (top) God banishing Cain; Cain saying farewell to his parents, or possibly his brother [[Seth]] leaving to find the [[Tree of Life]],&lt;ref name="Hand42"/&gt; a Jewish legend from ''[[Life of Adam and Eve|The Apocalypse of Moses]]'', a [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphical]] work from antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch (2009), 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The two uppermost reliefs on the arch, which have a central focus and function as [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]], bring attention to the juxtaposition of Old and New Testament themes. The relief to the left shows Cain and Abel sacrificing to God; on the right Cain commits the sin of murder, which God punishes.&lt;ref name="Upton65"/&gt; The two reliefs also function as a temporal device, leading the viewer directly to the moment of Christ's birth and mankind's redemption, which occurs below in the shed.&lt;ref name="Upton63ff"&gt;Upton (1975), 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;   The viewer is reminded that mankind must sacrifice to Christ, who lies directly below, or risk punishment and expulsion from the church, just as God expelled Cain.&lt;ref name="Upton65"&gt;Upton (1975), 65&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fall of man acted out on the archway reminds the viewer of the "necessity of Christ's sacrifice".&lt;ref name="Hand42"/&gt;

[[File:Petrus Christus Nativity (Cain and Abel).jpg|thumb|300px|The two uppermost scenes on the archway show scenes of sacrifice and punishment.]]
[[File:Petrus Christus Nativity detail (shrub).jpg|300px|thumb|The tuft of grass in the geometrically styled roof truss conveys multiple symbolic meanings.]]

The semicircle of rock inside the doorsill remind the viewer to abandon sin.{{efn|"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door." ([[s:Bible (King James)/Genesis#Chapter 4|Genesis 4:7]])}} The viewer is reminded to reach a full understanding of the significance of the event, achieved with the two groupings of shepherds at the rear of the shed. Two of the four are active and two are passive. The man dressed in blue on the left is listening; the man in blue to the right is seeing, while their counterparts in red do neither. Although actively looking and listening, the two men in blue do not appear to have a full understanding of the event.&lt;ref name="Upton69ff"&gt;Upton (1975), 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; Upton explains the medieval viewer would have understood that in the iconography Christus presented "man who would listen without hearing, and look without seeing." The viewer is reminded to comprehend the painting's vision and iconography, to fully recognize the significance of Christ's coming, to hear and see the word of God, and to obey God's wishes.&lt;ref name = "Upton100"&gt;Upton (1990), 100&lt;/ref&gt;

The tuft of grass sprouting from the roof's central truss above the figures conveys multiple meanings. Although the shrub is naturally rendered, Christus almost certainly placed it there for its symbolic value; its positioning suggests he followed a program of disguised iconography.&lt;ref name = "Steefel137"/&gt; The most obvious meaning is of new life and new beginnings.&lt;ref name="Upton71ff"&gt;Upton (1975), 71–77&lt;/ref&gt; On a secular level, the shrub may have indicated Christus's membership in the Confraternity of the Dry Tree, which he joined sometime around 1462–63.&lt;ref name ="Sterling19"&gt;Sterling (1971), 19&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Christus and his wife were listed as members in 1462; in 1463 they appeared on the list of new members. See Sterling (1971), 19; and Hand (1987), 41}}  The confraternity was prestigious, including among its ranks [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Burgundian]] nobility, such as [[Philip the Good]] and his wife [[Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabella]], wealthy foreign merchants and members from Bruges's upper classes.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth34"/&gt; The tuft of grass also symbolizes the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]],&lt;ref name = "Steefel137"&gt;Steefel (1962), 137&lt;/ref&gt; and Upton theorizes that by placing it there, Christus "has given expression to the legend" of Adam's third son, Seth, whose quest for a branch was a popular legend in the medieval period. Furthermore, alludes to [[Moses]] and the [[burning bush]]. According to Upton, in Christus's ''Nativity'' Joseph assumes Moses's role of protector and law-bringer; just as Joseph has removed his [[Patten (shoe)|patten]]s in the presence of Christ, Moses removed his shoes in the presence of the bush.&lt;ref name="Upton71ff"/&gt;

The setting represents the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]&amp;nbsp;– the angels are clothed in [[Eucharist]]ic [[vestments]], with those on the far right dressed in a deacon's [[cope]].&lt;ref name = "A158"&gt;Ainsworth (1994), 158&lt;/ref&gt; None wear the celebrant's [[chasuble]], suggesting Christ is the priest.&lt;ref name = "NGA"/&gt; The shed roof is a [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] over an altar. A later addition to the painting, added perhaps in the 17th century, and since removed, was a gold [[paten]] on which the infant lay, clearly showing Jesus as the Eucharistic [[Sacramental bread|host]].&lt;ref name = "A161"/&gt; Mary, Joseph and the angels are the first to worship the infant Christ and the shed  "becomes the altar of the first mass".&lt;ref name="Upton67"&gt;Upton (1975), 67&lt;/ref&gt; Upton explains that when viewed in the context of the first mass the iconography is more clearly defined.&lt;ref name="Upton68"&gt;Upton (1975), 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Christus was the first Netherlandish painter to achieve proficiency in strict mathematical compositional rules with his use of [[Orthogonality|orthogonals]], creating a unified perspective. The concept of compositions "based on unitary perspective" was largely a pioneering effort on Christus's part, although he borrowed from the earlier masters.&lt;ref name = "Pächt29"&gt;Pächt (1999), 29&lt;/ref&gt; Compositionally, the ''Nativity'' is one of Christus's most complex and important works,&lt;ref name="Hand42"/&gt; which Ainsworth says is masterfully integrated with the use of color.&lt;ref name = "A158"/&gt; X-radiography reveals sketched orthogonal lines on the [[underpainting]], used to indicate where the horizontal and vertical axis should meet at the main figures' heads, and that he used a compass to sketch the spandrels.&lt;ref name = "A161"/&gt;

The painting contains several geometric constructions.&lt;ref name="Upton55"/&gt; The roof of the shed's [[truss]]es form series of triangles connecting lines joining the base of the pedestals and the crossbeams. These surround the gathering of the [[Holy Family]], who form an inverse pattern. According to art historian Lawrence Steefel, "the detail participates in an almost emblematic pattern of repeated triangles which establish a rhyme scheme above and below, of roof structure and figure disposition."&lt;ref name = "Steefel137"/&gt; Upton writes that a "clearly defined diamond" is visible within the apex in the roof. From there it extends down to Eve, and the bottom apex is formed where the infant lies on the ground. It then extends up to Adam and back up to the roof. "This diamond shape," he writes, "supplemented by the rectangle within it, formed by the shed supports, the base of the triangle and the ground line in the shed, circumscribes the main event of the painting."&lt;ref name="Upton56ff"&gt;Upton (1975), 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatial and temporal borders separating the earthly and heavenly spheres are often seen in Netherlandish art, usually in the form of frames or arches.&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis (1998), 18&lt;/ref&gt; A boundary is achieved here with the grisaille archway,&lt;ref name = "Birkmeyer103"&gt;Birkmeyer (1961), 103&lt;/ref&gt; strongly reminiscent of van der Weyden's work. Art historians speculate Christus may have imitated his c. 1455 ''[[:File:Rogier van der Weyden - The Altar of St. John - Google Art Project.jpg|Altar of Saint John]]''.&lt;ref name ="Sterling19"/&gt; Instead of merely imitating, Christus innovated and extended the use of van der Weyden's arch motif; his arch is meant to be an opening, or a screen, for the viewer to see into the holy space, instead of a simple framing device in which figures are placed directly in-line or under the arch.  The multi-hued threshold stones at the bottom emphasize its function says Upton, who writes: "it is an opening through which one passes: a true frame or doorway to the picture&amp;nbsp;... Yet, since this arch is painted in grisaille, distinct from the rest of the panel, it must also be seen as a separate entity, much like an elaborate border around an illuminated manuscript page."&lt;ref name="Upton54"/&gt; The shadows cast by the grisaille figures stress "its function as a diaphragm between real and illusory space".&lt;ref name="Upton57"/&gt;

[[File:Dieric Bouts - Nativity - WGA02981.jpg|thumb|220px|Central panel of [[Dieric Bouts]] c. 1445 ''[[Triptych of the Virgin's Life (Bouts)|Mary Altarpiece]]''. This piece is similar in style to Christus's ''Nativity'']]
A very similar archway is found in [[Dieric Bouts]]'s c. 1445 ''[[Triptych of the Virgin's Life (Bouts)|Mary Altarpiece]]'', including spandrels with warriors. Art historians are unsure which was painted earlier&amp;nbsp;– Christus's ''Nativity'' or Bouts's altarpiece. Equally, van der Weyden's arched triptychs were executed at roughly the same period, but art historians are more certain Rogier's archivolt design set the precedent.&lt;ref name="Hand44" &gt;Hand (1987), 44&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Bouts and van der Weyden, Christus appears to have used the device to encompass a single scene, incorporating all the main characters within the arch, instead of a linked series of scenes with separate archways.&lt;ref name="Hand46" &gt;Hand (1987), 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The arch is only a prelude to the complex divisions beyond.&lt;ref name = "A158"/&gt; The space inhabited by the Holy Family is holy ground. Mary, Joseph, the Christ child and the four surrounding angels occupy a space partitioned in the front by the archway and by the wall at the rear.&lt;ref name = "Birkmeyer103"/&gt; A semicircle of figures is positioned around Christ, echoed in the semicircle of rocks placed directly inside the doorsill. Mary and Joseph are echoed by the colorful vertical [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] columns on the sides, and by the statues of Adam and Eve.&lt;ref name="Upton56"&gt;Upton (1975), 56&lt;/ref&gt; The rear of the shed where the four men stand, the small valley with the shepherds, the town, and the background landscape are also spatially discrete areas, which create a "steady, measured movement into space in place of the more abrupt jumping from foreground to distant background common to Flemish painting." They also function to surround the Holy Family while simultaneously preventing its isolation from the world.&lt;ref name="Upton55"&gt;Upton (1975), 55&lt;/ref&gt; Ainsworth writes that the "message of the painting quietly emerges from the strict, perspectively correct space constructed to engage the viewer."&lt;ref name="A158"&gt;Ainsworth (1994), 158&lt;/ref&gt; Upton agrees, explaining that the use of geometric devices emphasize the focal point, which "falls well below the horizon in the exact center of the panel", a perspective that would have given the 15th center viewer, kneeling in front of the panel, a "sense of physical relationship between the actual and ideal act of worship."&lt;ref name="Upton55"/&gt;

==Dating and condition==
The ''Nativity'''s dating has long been a source of debate among scholars. Estimations range from the mid-1440s to the mid-1450s;  early in Christus's career to about the time van der Weyden painted his c. 1455 ''Altar of St John''. Generally the mid-1450s seems the most accepted.&lt;ref name="Hand44" /&gt; Ainsworth considers it, along with Christus's ''Holy Family'' (currently in [[Kansas City]]), one of the most important attributed to him and believes it belongs in his later oeuvre,&lt;ref name = "A62"&gt;Ainsworth (1994), 62&lt;/ref&gt; possibly as late as the mid-1460s.&lt;ref name = "A161"/&gt; Evidence such as when Christus joined the Confraternity of the Dry Tree (c. early 1460s) points to it as a later work along with the ''[[Portrait of a Young Girl (Christus)|Portrait of a Young Girl]]''.&lt;ref name ="Sterling19"/&gt;  Its use of perspective and assimilation of van Eyck's and van der Weyden's earlier influences also suggest a later date.&lt;ref name = "A62"/&gt; Furthermore, the softer facial types utilized in the ''Nativity'' are typical of Christus's later work, and suggest a date around the mid-1450s.&lt;ref name="Hand44" /&gt; Technical analysis ([[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] evidence) suggests a date of c. 1458, based on the tree felling date.&lt;ref name = "A215"/&gt;  Christus painted two other versions of the Nativity: one in Bruges and the other in Berlin. The Bruges ''Nativity'' is dated 1452&amp;nbsp;– whether the date was added by Christus or during a restoration is unknown&amp;nbsp;– and technical analysis of the brushstrokes suggests it to be earlier than the Washington ''Nativity''.&lt;ref name = "A32"/&gt;
[[File:Petrus Christus - Nativity - WGA04837.jpg|thumb|230px|Christus's earlier version of the ''Nativity'', now at the [[Groeningemuseum]] in [[Bruges]], is signed and dated 1452.&lt;ref name = "A32"&gt;Ainsworth (1994), 32&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Determining the execution date relies on stylistic analysis, and the degree of van der Weyden's influence. The dating of the work to the 1440s is based on the notion that Christus borrowed heavily from the immediate influence of van der Weyden and Bouts. Although some of the similarities are undeniably striking and might be attributed to following a template, the degree of sophistication in the ''Nativity'' far surpasses the other two painters, according to Ainsworth. She writes that Bouts and van der Weyden "merely expand the narrative" in their use of the archway motif, whereas Christus shows a strong cause and effect between sin and redemption, innovations which almost certainly evolved later in his career, placing the date no earlier than the mid-1450s.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth158ff" &gt;Ainsworth (1994), 158–160&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christus Nativity detail (2).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detail of the painting before it was cleaned and restored in the early 1990s, when the gold [[paten]] on Mary's gown and the faint halo around her head were removed.&lt;ref name= "Campbell639"/&gt;]]
The [[underdrawing]] is visible through modern technical analysis, revealing the main group of figures and contour lines in the folds and drape of the clothing. The angels' wings to Mary's left are visible, but not those to the right, probably because of later overpainting.&lt;ref name="Hand42"/&gt; In the underdrawing Mary's gown extends far to the left of the angel, but Christus apparently changed his mind about its execution.&lt;ref name = "A161"/&gt;

The work has suffered damage: cracking where three wood panels are joined, paint loss to parts of the [[Craquelure|crackle]] pattern, and discoloration of varnishes. The largest area of paint loss occurred on Joseph's shoulder. Mary's robe has been completely restored and overpainted. Some paint loss is barely discernible in the areas around her hair.  In many areas the paint layers and underlying support are in good condition.&lt;ref name = "NGA"/&gt;

The ''Nativity'' was one of 13 works hung at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s 1994 exhibition, "Petrus Christus: Renaissance Master of Bruges". It underwent significant restoration in preparation. Technicians removed over-paint probably dating to its Spanish provenance. The addition included the gold paten on Mary's robe, pigment under the Christ child, and the halos above Mary and Jesus.&lt;ref name= "Campbell639"&gt;Campbell (1994), 639&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1916, Friedländer questioned the presence of halos in Christus's work, rarely seen in mid-15th century Netherlandish painting. When the halos were carefully examined they were found to be later additions; before the exhibition they were removed from several paintings, including the ''[[Portrait of a Carthusian]]''.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth2005,51" &gt;Ainsworth (2005), 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting is today in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., which was conceived by Pittsburgh financier [[Andrew Mellon]] in the late 1930s. It was one of 126 paintings from his personal collection donated to the gallery and was on display at the museum opening in March 1941&amp;nbsp;– three years after his death.&lt;ref name="Richter174ff"&gt;Richter (1941), 174–178&lt;/ref&gt;

It belonged to Señora O. Yturbe of Madrid, who sold it in 1930 to Franz M. Zatzenstein, founder of the Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin.&lt;ref name = "NGA"/&gt; That April, the [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Duveen Brothers]], less affected by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]] than other dealers, paid Zatzenstein £30,000, in cash, for the painting and sold it immediately to Mellon. A dealer usually had to go through the lengthy process of sending photographs of a painting via trans-Atlantic ship to an American buyer and then wait for a reply; the transaction for the ''Nativity'' is exceptional because it is the first painting of which the photograph was wired via [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] cable from England to America. To avoid the export fees due if the painting been sent directly to New York, the Duveens took a circuitous route&amp;nbsp;– from Madrid to Germany, then to Paris and America.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest (2005), 323–325&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 it was acquired by the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, and gifted to the National Gallery a year later.&lt;ref name = "NGA"/&gt;

Given its size and orientation, the panel was probably meant to stand alone, but may have been conceived as the wing of triptych altarpiece.&lt;ref name="Upton53"/&gt; Who commissioned the piece or how it came to be in the possession of a Spanish owner is unknown. At least half of Christus's known patrons were Italian or Spanish, and he often changed his style to suit their desire.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth34"&gt;Ainsworth (1998), 34&lt;/ref&gt; Around eight of his paintings&amp;nbsp;– only about 25 are extant – have come from either Italy or Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Lane (1970), 390&lt;/ref&gt; giving credence to speculation that he spent time there.  Yet the existence of the thriving export market in early Netherlandish panel painting suggests equally that it could have been painted in Bruges and transported south.&lt;ref name ="Sterling8ff"&gt;Sterling (1971), 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patricia Preece''' (January 1894 – June 1966), born '''Ruby Vivian Preece''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preecefamilyhistory.co.uk/grobirs94_95.htm Preece Family History and One Name Study (1894–1895)], accessed 2 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was an English artist associated with the [[Bloomsbury Group]] and the second wife of painter [[Stanley Spencer]], for whom she modelled.  As a teenager, in 1911, Preece was involved in the death of dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]].  While swimming in his lake, she lost her footing and called out; the 74-year-old Gilbert dived in to assist her, dying of a heart attack. She soon adopted the name Patricia and became engaged, but her progressive views displeased her fiancé, who terminated their engagement.

In 1918, Preece met her lifelong lover, [[Dorothy Hepworth]], at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]].  After further studies in Paris, the two returned to Britain. In 1928, they moved to [[Cookham]] and befriended the artist Stanley Spencer.  Spencer became obsessed with the flirtatious Preece, and he showered her with gifts.  She persuaded him to divorce his first wife and to sign his house over to her.  Preece married Spencer in 1937, but she did not leave Hepworth and refused to have sexual relations with Spencer.  She eventually evicted Spencer from the house, and would not grant him a divorce, but continued to receive payments from him.  After he was knighted in 1959, she insisted on being styled Lady Spencer and claimed a pension as his widow.

Throughout their lives, the gregarious Preece exhibited and sold the shy Hepworth's paintings under her own name, causing the artist [[Augustus John]] to declare Preece one of the six greatest women artists in England.  In later years, Preece traded in antiques.  The Preece-Spencer relationship was dramatised in the 1996 [[Olivier Award]]-winning play ''[[Stanley (play)|Stanley]]''.

==Early life; death of Gilbert==
Preece was born in [[Kensington]] in London to an Army officer, James Duncan Preece (1866–1940), and Ada Maude Webb (1865–1936), who married in 1891 in Kensington.  She had an elder sister, Sibyl Duncan Preece (1892–1991), and a younger brother, Graham Duncan Preece (1899–1975).  By 1911, Preece and her brother were boarding at a school at 76 Welldon Crescent, [[Harrow on the Hill|Harrow]].&lt;ref&gt;"76 Welldon Crescent, Harrow", UK 1911 Census&lt;/ref&gt; The school was run by two young women, Rebbie Freuer Wright (b. 1886) and Winifred Isabel Emery (1890–1972), the niece of the actors [[Cyril Maude]] and [[Winifred Emery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidney Dark|Dark, Sidney]] and Rowland Grey.

Gilbert: His Life and Letters'', Methuen &amp; Co Ltd, London (1923) pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gascoyne&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/76473?docPos=1 Biography] of [[David Gascoyne]], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', accessed 2 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:gilberts-lake-1899.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Gilbert's Lake, seen in 1899]]
Dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], a friend of the Emery family, had an estate nearby called [[Grim's Dyke]], on which there was a lake some distance from the house.  On 29 May 1911, the 74-year-old Gilbert had arranged to give a swimming lesson in the lake to Preece and Emery.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Tom.

The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 1 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The three met at about 4 pm that day, and the young women entered the water before Gilbert.  At the subsequent [[coroner]]'s inquest, Preece stated, "I found that I could not stand and called out and Sir William swam to me. I put my hand on his shoulder and I felt him suddenly sink. I thought he would come up again. My feet were on the mud then. Miss Emery called for help and the gardeners came with the boat."  The family doctor, Dr W.W. Shackleton, and Dr Daniel Wilson of nearby Bushey Heath Cottage Hospital, certified that Gilbert had died at about 4:20 pm that afternoon of [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (heart failure) brought on by excessive exertion. The coroner's jury, meeting on 31 May 1911, recorded a verdict of accidental death.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (''Grim's Dyke''), pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;  The incident is described in the documentary ''[[Metro-land (TV)|Metro-land]]''.  Newspapers printed verbatim the statement that Preece had given at the inquest, and they described her as a "fair-haired seventeen-year-old schoolgirl." Her father was a named mourner at Gilbert's funeral.&lt;ref name=Pople&gt;Pople, Kenneth.

''The Art and Vision of Stanley Spencer'', accessed 3 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, Preece had changed her first name to Patricia.  She was at a [[finishing school]] in [[Lytham St Annes]] and became engaged to an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve.  She returned to London during World War I and lived in Kensington with her mother and sister while her father was serving in the war.  She sketched fashion illustrations for periodicals, drove ambulances and became involved with the [[suffragette]] movement.  Her fiancé ended their engagement.&lt;ref name=Pople/&gt;

==Art studies; the Spencers==
In 1918, Preece enrolled at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]], where she met a talented artist [[Dorothy Hepworth]], who became her lifelong companion.&lt;ref name=Pople2&gt;Pople, Kenneth. [http://www.ikpople.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/The%20Last%20Postscript%202.html "Renunciation :  The Last Postscript"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121223102756/http://www.ikpople.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/The%20Last%20Postscript%202.html |date=2012-12-23 }}. ''The Art and Vision of Stanley Spencer", accessed 3 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  With the help of Hepworth's wealthy family, they set up a home and studio together.  Both studied drawing with [[Henry Tonks]].    Preece's early work was praised by [[Vanessa Bell]], [[Duncan Grant]] and [[Roger Fry]].&lt;ref name=Models&gt;Jiminez, Jill Berk and Joanna Banham.

Upon their return to London in 1925, however, they tried to avoid the opprobrium suffered by open lesbians and often claimed to be sisters.&lt;ref name=Models/&gt;  They became more involved with the [[Bloomsbury Group]], some of the members of which they had met earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.john-noott.com/artist/preece~patricia/preece~patricia.php "Patricia Preece"]. John Noott Galleries website, accessed 3 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  They spent summer holidays in Wales or Cornwall where Preece was again rescued from drowning, this time by a local mineworker.  Preece had a reputation for happily accepting casual flirtations from admirers, only to reject them when they became more serious.  In 1928, Preece and Hepworth moved to [[Cookham]], living in a cottage purchased by Hepworth's parents.&lt;ref name=Pople/&gt;  The gregarious Preece signed many of the shy Hepworth's paintings and negotiated with dealers to exhibit and sell the work as Preece's, fooling many in the art world, including the artist [[Augustus John]], who declared Preece one of the six greatest women artists in England.&lt;ref name=Chilvers/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtgallery.com/artists/Hepworth.html "Dorothy Hepworth"].

[[File:Self-portrait (1914) by Stanley Spencer.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Stanley Spencer]] as a young man]]
In 1929, Preece met Cookham artist [[Stanley Spencer]] and his artist wife, [[Hilda Carline]], while she was substituting as a waitress in a teashop in Cookham.  Preece and Hepworth became friendly with Spencer and his wife, sometimes minding their daughters and joining their art picnics.  Carline's brother [[Richard Carline|Richard]] was attracted and took Preece dining and dancing, until he understood the nature of her relationship with Hepworth.  The Hepworths lost their fortune in the [[Great Depression]], and from 1930, Preece and Hepworth were struggling to make mortgage payments.  Spencer introduced Preece to his extensive art-world contacts. In May 1933, Spencer's cosmopolitan patron, [[Edward Beddington-Behrens]] invited Preece to travel with Stanley to Switzerland for a commission (Preece spoke fluent French, while Stanley spoke none). In 1933, Preece first modelled for Spencer, sitting for ''Portrait of Patricia Preece''.&lt;ref name=Models/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Stanley. [http://www.jameshymangallery.com/pages/artistsingle/1409/all/1409.html "Portrait of Patricia Preece"], James Hyman Fine Art and Photographs, accessed 27 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1934, Spencer was concerned about Preece's finances and deteriorating health.  He suggested that Preece and Hepworth move into the top floor of his house, but they did not do so.  Carline was also concerned about their artist friends but was already suspicious of Spencer's relationship with Preece.  Nevertheless, in 1934, Spencer persuaded Carline to paint a portrait of Preece.  The [https://web.archive.org/web/20120324231156/http://www.ikpople.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/patportbig2.jpg resulting image] shows both Carline's ambivalent feelings about Preece and the latter's change in demeanour since her more lighthearted days of financial independence.&lt;ref name=Pople/&gt;

Soon afterwards, it became obvious that Spencer was obsessed with Preece.  Carline spent more time with her mother and two daughters in [[Hampstead]].&lt;ref name=Pople/&gt; Preece used her awareness of Spencer's sexual interest in her to manipulate him. Carline later wrote: "She vamped him to a degree unbelievable. … If he went to her house, she always received him half or quarter dressed."&lt;ref name=Chilvers/&gt; He bought her large amounts of clothing, jewellery and other gifts.&lt;ref name=Models/&gt; Spencer's fantasy was to have both Carline and Preece as wives, both inspiring his art.&lt;ref name=Pople/&gt; In 1935, Preece accompanied Spencer for a second commission in Switzerland. Between 1935 and 1937, Spencer painted his famous series of nude portraits of Preece.&lt;ref name=Models/&gt; Preece, aware of Spencer's fantasy for her to be his wife, insisted that he must obtain a divorce from Carline before she would marry him. Spencer became convinced that if he married Preece, he would then be able to persuade Carline to join them in a ''ménage-à-trois''.&lt;ref name=Pople2/&gt; Spencer's contact with his daughters became limited; his older daughter Shirin later commented that, even as a young child, "I knew what she was doing to Daddy."&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Michael.

==Marriage and later years==
[[File:hepworth-preece-spencer.jpg|thumb|right|255px|Hepworth (left), Preece, Spencer and Jas Wood (right) at the wedding of Preece and Spencer]]
After receiving numerous pleading letters from her husband, Carline divorced Spencer in 1937, and less than a week later, he married Preece in [[Maidenhead]].&lt;ref name=SFGate&gt;Elliott, Vicky. [http://articles.sfgate.com/1998-07-19/news/17726967_1_paintings-patricia-preece-flesh/2 "Lives Laid Bare – The second wife of the British painter Stanley Spencer..."]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} SF Gate, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 19 July 1998, accessed 2 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StanleyDNB&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36211?docPos=3 Spencer, Stanley], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', accessed 2 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Preece and Hepworth, however, travelled together to St. Ives for the "honeymoon", while Spencer remained in Cookham to finish a painting.  Carline went to Cookham and, finding a warm welcome from Spencer, she spent the night with him.  Spencer explained his idea of a three-way marriage to her, but she could not accept being his mistress, having been his wife.  Preece professed to be shocked by his "adultery" with Carline and refused thereafter to have sexual relations with him.  Preece persuaded Spencer to sign his house and financial affairs over to her.&lt;ref name=Pople2/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/arts/highlights/010713_stanley.shtml "Sir Stanley Spencer Stands Alone"], BBC World Service, 14 July 2001, accessed 14 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/pharos/collection_pages/20th_pages/PD.966-1963/TXT_SE-PD.966-1963.html "Stanley Spencer, 1891 - 1959"]. Fitzwilliam Museum website, accessed 3 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The painful intricacies of the three-way relationship became the subject in 1996 of a play, ''[[Stanley (play)|Stanley]]'', by [[Pam Gems]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/stanley-5145 ''Stanley''], Internet Broadway Database, accessed 5 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Now maintaining two families and three houses, Spencer's finances rapidly deteriorated, and he was sued for debt.  Preece continued to live with Hepworth, evicting Spencer from his home in Cookham in 1938 in order to rent it out. Spencer fled to London, where his museum friends and art dealer helped him to put his finances in order, although he was forced to live modestly for many years.&lt;ref name=Pople2/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Spencer had two serious affairs&lt;ref&gt;While in London, he had an affair with Daphne Charlton and her husband George.  After the war, now living in a cottage in Cookham, and still seeing Charlton, he also had an affair with a musician, Charlotte Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to love, and frequently visit, his first wife, until her death in 1950.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Spencer attempted to divorce Preece in the 1950s, but she hired lawyers and prevented this. After he was knighted in 1959, she always insisted on being styled Lady Spencer and claimed a pension as his widow. During the post-war years, she also conducted a profitable hobby in trading antiques. Hepworth continued to paint, and her paintings continued to be exhibited under Preece's name.&lt;ref name=Pople2/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Preece died, aged 72, in [[Maidenhead]], Berkshire. Hepworth survived her by a dozen years, slowly losing her eyesight, and was sometimes cared for by Preece's sister Sybil from London. She died aged 80 in 1978. Preece and Hepworth are buried together in Cookham Cemetery. Carline had earlier been laid to rest in the cemetery. Spencer's remains were cremated and buried in the churchyard of the church in Cookham.&lt;ref name=Pople2/&gt;

Preece's posthumous memoir of her life with Spencer (earlier written with Louise Collis) was published by Heinemann in 1972 as ''Stanley Spencer: A Private View''.  The painful intricacies of the Preece-Spencer-Carline relationship became the subject in 1996 of a play by the feminist playwright [[Pam Gems]]. Titled ''[[Stanley (play)|Stanley]]'', it played at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] and, later, on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]].  It won the [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Best New Play award]] for 1997.

== History ==
The Royal Scottish National Orchestra (RSNO) Chorus evolved from a choir formed in 1843 (then the Glasgow Choral Union) to sing the first full performance of [[Handel’s Messiah]] in Scotland.  Today, the Chorus' main role is to perform alongside the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]], which it does in around six different programmes each year, including an annual performance (usually on 2 January) of Handel's Messiah.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
The RSNO Chorus has around 120 members, from across the central belt of Scotland.  The Chorus rehearses on a Wednesday evening in Glasgow, at the RSNO's new purpose-built home, at 19 Killermont Street.  This purpose-built flexible 600-seat venue is used as a performance space, a rehearsal space for the Orchestra and Chorus, and as a recording facility (primarily for the RSNO, but also available for external use).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The Chorus regularly holds open rehearsals to allow potential new members to join for an evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Artistic Team ==
'''Gregory Batsleer - Chorus Director'''

The Chorus is directed by [[Gregory Batsleer]].  In 2015, Gregory was announced that year's winner of the Arts Foundation Choral Conducting award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Gregory splits his time between Scotland and London.  In Scotland he is also Chorus Director of the [[Scottish Chamber Orchestra]] Chorus, a post he has held since 2009, and in London he is the Artistic Director of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]’s Choir in Residence Programme and Principal Conductor of the Portrait Choir. 

'''Edward Cohen - Accompanist'''

The RSNO Chorus is accompanied in its weekly rehearsals by Edward Cohen.  Edward trained at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], [[Indiana University]], and the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]], where he currently holds a position as keyboard lecturer and staff accompanist. Edward also enjoys a busy freelance performing career, and works with a number of choirs and ensembles throughout Scotland and further afield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Polly Beck - Vocal Coach'''

Polly studied at the RSAMD (now the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]]), and later the Postgraduate Opera Course at the RNCM, for which she won an entrance scholarship. Polly returned to Scotland to work with [[Scottish Opera]], and has performed as a soloist with several UK orchestras, and in many festivals.

Polly currently teaches, as a Vocal Instructor focusing on voice and performance skills, for Inverclyde Music Service. She is also Vocal Coach for Inverclyde Senior Choir, and teaches at the [[University of Glasgow]], the Junior Conservatoire of the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland|RCS]] and the [[National Youth Choir of Scotland]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== RSNO Chorus Tours ==
In addition to concerts throughout the year in Scotland, both with the RSNO and independently, the RSNO Chorus has been fortunate to be invited to perform with orchestras in many different parts of the world, often at the request of world-class conductors. The RSNO Chorus has most recently toured to Prague, where they performed [[Mozart's Requiem]] with the [[Czech National Symphony Orchestra]], under the baton of [[Libor Pešek]], as part of the Prague Proms.  The Chorus has also toured to Copenhagen, Hong Kong, Israel, and Australia, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''''Rustic Wedding Symphony''''', Op. 26 (''Ländliche Hochzeit'') is a symphony in [[E-flat major|E flat major]] by [[Karl Goldmark]], written in 1875,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AF0m0117DIwC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=rustic+wedding+symphony&amp;source=web&amp;ots=3jnmB7ur5n&amp;sig=KkU4AZX-M85ZW325bQkFkbujzRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result  David Ewen: Music for the Millions – The Encyclopedia of Musical Masterpieces]&lt;/ref&gt; a year before his renowned [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Goldmark)|Violin Concerto No. 1]].
The symphony was premiered in [[Vienna]] on 5 March 1876, conducted by [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Rustic+Wedding The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Brahms]], who was a frequent walking companion of Goldmark's, and whose own [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 1]] was not premiered until November 1876, told him "That is the best thing you have done; clear-cut and faultless, it sprang into being a finished thing, like Minerva from the head of Jupiter".&lt;ref name=braunstein&gt;Joseph Braunstein, notes to Abravanel recording&lt;/ref&gt; Its first American performance was at a New York Philharmonic Society concert, conducted by [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]] on 13 January 1877.&lt;ref name=braunstein/&gt;

The work does not conform to the standard structure of a symphony, and it could just be named a Suite. It is in five movements rather than the usual four, which is same as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|''Pastoral Symphony'']], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|''Rhenish Symphony'']].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1093WaBF3p4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=rustic+wedding+symphony&amp;source=web&amp;ots=PrYutZIOts&amp;sig=mzgn8HLDZKo-YyCN0gYctRNdGQk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result Michael Talbot, The Finale in Western Instrumental Music]&lt;/ref&gt; It is full of Central European charm, joviality and good humour.  While Goldmark did not provide any specific program for the work, he did give each of the movements titles suggestive of aspects of a wedding in the countryside. 

The first movement is a Wedding March (''Hochzeitsmarsch'') followed by a set of 13 variations.  While variations are commonly found in symphonies, it is most unusual for them to appear in the first movement.  The variations offer constant changes of tempo, meter, rhythm, mood and harmony, and display his fine craftsmanship.&lt;ref name=braunstein/&gt;
* The theme of the March is reminiscent of ''[[Adeste Fideles]]'', and is stated by cellos and basses in octaves.
* Variation 1 is played in horns, clarinets and flutes
* Variation 2, ''Poco animato'', introduces the violins
* Variation 3, full orchestra
* Variation 4, ''Andante con moto'', B flat minor, the theme played by the violins
* Variation 5, ''Allegretto'', basses, bassoons and horns
* Variation 6, ''Allegro vivace'', horns, bassoons, flutes and violins
* Variation 7 involves part writing, again in a minor key
* Variation 8, ''Allegro scherzando'', strings, flutes, oboes and clarinets
* Variation 9, minor key, basses, violins and flutes
* Variation 10, ''Molto vivace'', violins with other strings pizzicato
* Variation 11, ''Andante con moto'', violins, oboe and clarinet
* Variation 12, ''Moderato'', a new melody based on the original theme, oboe, bassoon, viola and two violins
* Variation 13, after a brief fanfare, the original theme is played in the original tempo, but with the full orchestra, and then ends quietly.&lt;ref name=faulkner&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-XWDqySOhrAC&amp;pg=PA474&amp;lpg=PA474&amp;dq=rustic+wedding+symphony&amp;source=web&amp;ots=C5HFIVMSKa&amp;sig=9gszQG8CVJ0VKd_RVCS4U9NbFuI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA475,M1 Anne Shaw Faulkner, What We Hear in Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second movement is a Bridal Song (''Brautlied'').  The third movement, ''Serenade'', opens with a theme played by two oboes, later developed by the strings.&lt;ref name=faulkner/&gt;  It includes an imitation of bagpipes, played on oboe, clarinet, bassoon and cellos.

The fourth movement, In the Garden (''Im Garten''), is slow and lyrical, its middle section moving to E-flat minor.  The finale, ''Dance'', is the only movement of the work written in [[sonata form]].  It opens with a fugue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buywell.com/booklets/4768743.pdf Raymond Tuttle, Notes to Decca recording]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Garden theme briefly reappears, before the Dance returns to end the movement rousingly.

The ''Rustic Wedding Symphony'' was a favourite of conductors such as [[Thomas Beecham]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_concert_review.php?id=4252 classical.source.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonard Bernstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/sydney-symphony/2008/03/16/1205602189219.html Harriet Cunningham, review of Sydney Symphony performance, Sydney Morning Herald, 17 March 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been recorded a number of times, by conductors such as Beecham, Bernstein, [[André Previn]], [[Maurice Abravanel]], [[Jesús López-Cobos]], [[Yondani Butt]] and [[Stephen Gunzenhauser]].

[[File:Edwin Landseer - Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Titania and Bottom - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Edwin Landseer]], ''Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Titania and Bottom'', 1851, [[National Gallery of Victoria]].]]

'''''Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Titania and Bottom''''' is an 1851 oil-on-canvas painting by British artist [[Edwin Landseer]].  Landseer was mainly known for his paintings of animals: this is his only painting of a fairy scene.  The painting depicts a scene from the third act of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.  It has been in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in [[Melbourne, Australia]] since 1932.

The painting shows [[Titania]], Queen of the Fairies, after she has been given a love potion, embracing the temporary object of her love, the mechanical [[Nick Bottom]].  Bottom has been also enchanted and has the head of an [[Asinus|ass]].  They are observed by other fairy folk, and the scene is decorated with flowers and rabbits.

The work measures {{convert|82.0|xx|133.0|cm}}.  It was one of several paintings of scenes from works by Shakespeare commissioned by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] in 1847 to decorate the dining room of his house in London.  Landseer was paid £450.  Brunel left the choice of subject to the artists, and Landseer may have chosen this scene so he could include several animals. Other works were commissioned from [[Charles West Cope]], [[Augustus Egg]], [[Frederick Richard Lee]], [[Charles Robert Leslie]], and [[Clarkson Frederick Stanfield]].

The painting was first exhibited the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1851, and was immediately a popular success.  It was praised by [[Queen Victoria]] in her diary, and by [[Lewis Carroll]], who admired the [[white rabbit]]; the work may have influenced the white rabbit in his book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.

After Brunel's death in 1859, the painting was sold at auction in April 1860 and acquired by [[Lord Robert Pelham-Clinton]] for £2,800.  After the death of Pelham-Clinton, it was acquired by [[Adelbert Brownlow-Cust, 3rd Earl Brownlow]], and later sold to [[Sir William Quilter, 1st Baronet]].  It was then sold to [[Henry Lowenfeld]] at [[Christie's]] in 1909 for £2,400 (the auction also included [[Holman Hunt]]'s ''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'').  After Lowenfeld's death in 1931, his widow sold the painting to the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne (funded from the [[Felton Bequest]]) where it remains today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">'''Smoking concerts''' were live [[performance]]s, usually of [[music]], before an [[audience]] of men only, popular during the [[Victorian era]].  These social occasions were instrumental in introducing new musical forms to the public.  At these functions men would smoke and speak of politics while listening to live music.  These popular gatherings were sometimes held at hotels. The crews of HMS Curlew and HMS Hawkins attended a Smoker aboard USS Huron in Wei-hai-wei harbour, China, on 19 August 1921.

Although the concerts are now obsolete, the term continued and is used for student-organised variety performances, especially at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]. Annual Smoking Concerts were held at [[Imperial College London]] into the 1980s and continue at [[Glasgow University Union]].

The saying "Booking for smoking concerts now" came into use at this time meaning that a person had recovered and was in the prime of health.  This saying is used in the works of writer [[P.G. Wodehouse]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The [[Liverpool Medical Students Society]] at the [[University of Liverpool School of Medicine]] still hold an annual smoking concert, a tradition going back 130 years. Each of the five year groups present a play annually.[http://www.lmssonline.co.uk/]

'''''Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire''''' is a multimedia project created by [[Lucasfilm]] in 1996. The original idea was to create a story set between the films ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (a time no ''[[Star Wars]]'' novel had explored before), and to explore all commercial possibilities of a full motion picture release without actually making a film. The venture reinvigorated interest in the franchise ahead of the theatrical [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|Special Editions]] of the [[Star Wars Trilogy|''Star Wars'' trilogy]] released in the following year.

Several products were released, including a novel, a junior novelization, a comic book series, a video game, a soundtrack, trading cards, [[role-playing game]]s, posters, model kits, [[Micro Machines]] toys, statuettes, vinyl dolls, and a series of [[action figure]]s and vehicles.&lt;ref name="GPro96"&gt;{{cite magazine|editor=Wes Nihei|title=Shopping for Shadows|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=96|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1996|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the narratives in the print media seldom intersected, it was necessary that characters, scenes, and dialogue match when they did come together. Author [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]] has expressed his support of adapting the story as an animated film.&lt;ref name=SWinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://starwarsinterviews.com/various/authors/steve-perry-author/|title=Steve Perry (Author)|website=Star Wars Interviews|last=Perry|first=Steve|date=March 2010|accessdate=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire TPB|last=Wagner|first=John|year=1997|publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]]|isbn=978-1569711835|page=i}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (project)|The Force Unleashed]]'' later followed in the project's footsteps by creating multimedia involved in a film's release without making a movie.

The main plotline is told in a novel by [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]]. [[Princess Leia]] leads an attempt to liberate the frozen [[Han Solo]] from [[Boba Fett]], but is unsuccessful. [[Darth Vader]] searches for his son [[Luke Skywalker]], whom is being targeted by [[Prince Xizor]], the most powerful crimelord in the galaxy. [[Emperor Palpatine]] orders Vader to trust Xizor, even though the latter is plotting to overthrow them. Xizor kidnaps Leia in his attempt to bait Luke. [[Lando Calrissian]] and [[Dash Rendar]] sneak into the crimelord's palace on [[Coruscant ]] to save her. Luke and Leia discuss plans to rescue Han from [[Jabba the Hutt]], and Luke constructs his new [[lightsaber]].

Author Steve Perry got the job after writing the novelizations of ''[[The Mask (film)|The Mask]]'' for Bantam, and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' based upon graphic novels by [[Dark Horse Comics]], which had been licensed by [[Lucasfilm]] to create ''Star Wars'' comics. In addition to the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, Perry read the first spin-off novel in the franchise, ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'', to get an idea of how to write for Vader.&lt;ref name=SWinterview/&gt;

A prequel novel was planned, to be written by author [[Charles L. Grant|Charles Grant]], but was cancelled due to a Lucasfilm Licensing move from Bantam to [[Del Rey Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/building-a-galaxy-far-far-away-new-publisher-new-directions-1998-2005/|title=Building a Galaxy Far, Far Away: New Publisher, New Directions (1998-2005)|last=Liptak|first=Andrew|date=December 17, 2015|work=The B&amp;N Sci-Fi and Fantasy Blog|publisher=[[Barnes &amp; Noble]]|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comic book emphasizes the destiny of Boba Fett and his fellow bounty hunters, first seen in a brief scene on ''The Empire Strikes Back''. It also tells the story of Jix, Darth Vader's assistant, who infiltrated Jabba the Hutt's gang of bikers to prevent that band's attempt to murder Luke Skywalker. The series was written by [[John Wagner]] and illustrated by Kilian Plunkett.

The comics were written and drawn at the same time of the novel, so the first issue could be released immediately after the book. However, the story told by the comics is unique in many ways. The primary difference is that the comics tell what happened to Boba Fett and the other bounty hunters hired by Darth Vader to find the ''Millennium Falcon'' in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. Steve Perry, author of the project's novel, was a story consultant.

===Sequel===
A sequel comic was written, called ''Shadows of the Empire: Evolution'', which was created over five issues and later combined in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]. The series was written by Steve Perry, and was his first foray into comics.&lt;ref name=SWinterview/&gt; It was pencilled by [[Ron Randall]], inked by [[P. Craig Russell]], and colored by [[Dave Nestelle]].

The story is set around the time of ''Return of the Jedi''. Xizor, the leader of the Black Sun criminal organization, has been destroyed, and Guri, an attractive human replica droid who was Xizor's personal assassin in the original novel, is left wondering what her future will hold now that she no longer has a master. During the ongoing struggle for supremacy in the underworld, Guri endeavors to discover her human side—if it even exists. But in her quest to alter her programming and gain humanity, Guri is pursued by both bounty hunters and Rebels led by Luke Skywalker. Secrets lying in her android mind make her a valuable asset.

==Game==
{{Main|Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire (video game)}}
[[LucasArts]]'s ''Shadows of the Empire'' was one of the first games available for the [[Nintendo 64]], and later for Windows. The most commercial product in the ''Shadows of the Empire'' line, the game was first released in December 1996 as an exclusive N64 title five months after the console's launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-shadows-of-the-empire/ Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire], MobyGames, accessed December 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The PC version came nearly a year later in September 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.ign.com/objects/003/003033.html IGN: Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire], IGN PC, accessed December 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game, players control mercenary [[List of Star Wars characters#R|Dash Rendar]] in his efforts to help Luke Skywalker and rescue Princess Leia from Prince Xizor's hands. It is divided into four parts (or chapters):
* '''Chapter 1''': Dash is drawn into the [[Battle of Hoth]].
* '''Chapter 2''': Dash Rendar confronts bounty hunters from the original films—[[IG-88]] and [[Boba Fett]]—in an attempt to reacquire Han Solo.
* '''Chapter 3''': Boba Fett has escaped and the player's mission changes: you must now save Luke Skywalker's life by fighting a deadly gang of [[Speeder bike|swoop bikers]] in [[Mos Eisley]], then recover secret Imperial plans for the second [[Death Star]] with Luke's help.
* '''Chapter 4''': Dash Rendar, with Luke and Lando Calrissian, travels to [[Coruscant]] to rescue Princess Leia from Prince Xizor's stronghold.

Certain parts of the game contradict elements from the book and comic, but the overall story remains the same.

The N64 and PC versions of the video game differ somewhat. The PC version has sharper and smoother gameplay graphics when using a 3D card. Both versions have slightly different cutscenes—the PC version has full-motion cinematic cutscenes with sound effects and voices, while the N64 version utilizes artwork with text at the bottom of the screen.

[[Varèse Sarabande]] published a score composed by [[Joel McNeely]], after a suggestion by [[John Williams]], and performed by the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]] and Chorus. Themes from the movies can be heard in tracks one (the main theme from ''Star Wars'' and "Carbon Freeze") and eight ("[[The Imperial March]]" and "The Force Theme"). The tenth track also contains credited appearances of "The Imperial March". The disc also includes an interactive track for personal computers, containing concept art and additional information about the project. The multimedia track includes an overview of the ''Shadows of the Empire'' project; a creative team gallery; information about McNeely, the orchestra, and the efforts to put together a soundtrack for the novel; and information about the book, the game, the comic series, and the toys based on the characters. The liner notes give plot summaries for each track's corresponding section of the novel. McNeely wrote, "Unlike with film music, I have been allowed to let my imagination run free with the images, characters and events from this story. I have also had the luxury to loiter as long as I like with a character or scene. Every passage represents some person, place or event in this story."

[[Ben Burtt]] wrote a poem for the liner notes, about an ancient battle on [[Coruscant]], which McNeely used in some compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=[[Star Wars Insider]]|title=Scoring the Trilogy|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]|issue=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lyrics, Burtt made references to the ''[[Star Wars: Droids|Droids]]'' series he was involved in writing.

==Toys==
&lt;!-- [[Image:Sote2pakvadercard.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|An example of an action figure produced for the project.]] --&gt;
[[Kenner Products|Kenner]] was one of the companies that made the toy line for the ''Shadows of the Empire'' project.&lt;ref name="GPro96"/&gt; Their line contained action figures (including new characters such as Xizor and Dash Rendar), vehicles (from the Outrider to swoop bikes) and "two-pack" pairings of new and classic characters (such as IG-88 and Boba Fett). The classic characters figures were given a new spin with Chewbacca disguised as Snoova, a Wookiee bounty hunter, and Luke Skywalker costumed in an Imperial uniform (all the better to infiltrate Imperial City).

[[Galoob|Lewis Galoob Toys]], famous for their line of "[[Micro Machines]]" miniature toys and playsets, also developed a full ''Shadows of the Empire'' toy line. It included three sets of miniatures and a boxed Action Fleet set with two swoop bikes and riders and four miniature articulated figures. Also included in the sets are the classic ''Star Wars'' characters (Luke, Vader, the Emperor) as well as the new ''Shadows'' characters (Xizor, Dash Rendar, Guri and Leebo).

===Kenner action figures===
* [[Boba Fett]] vs. [[IG-88]]
* [[Chewbacca]] in Bounty Hunter Disguise (with Vibro-Axe and Heavy Blaster Rifle)
* [[Dash Rendar]] (with Heavy Weapons Pack)
* [[Princess Leia|Leia]] in [[Princess Leia|Boushh]] Disguise (with Blaster Rifle and Bounty Hunter Helmet)
* [[Luke Skywalker]] in Imperial Guard Disguise (with Taser Staff Weapon)
* [[Prince Xizor]] (with Energy Blade Shields)
* Prince Xizor vs. [[Darth Vader]]

===Kenner vehicles===
* ''[[Outrider (Star Wars)|Outrider]]'' - Dash Rendar's spaceship
* ''[[Slave I]]'' - Boba Fett's spaceship
* [[Speeder bike|Swoop bike]] with Swoop Trooper

The model making company [[Ertl Company|Ertl]] released several plastic model kits of ''Shadows of the Empire'', including the Virago (Xizor's spaceship), Prince Xizor, and the Emperor.

Collectible and gift company Applause released two vinyl figures, of Dash Rendar and Prince Xizor as well as a cold-cast resin statuette of the villains: Xizor, the Emperor and Darth Vader.

==Trading cards==
The [[Topps]] company developed the ''Shadows of the Empire'' trading card line.&lt;ref name="GPro96"/&gt; The 100-piece ''Shadows of the Empire'' card set from Topps represents all three platforms that tell the story—the book, comic series, and game. The cards are the work of [[The Brothers Hildebrandt|Greg and Tim Hildebrandt]], the twin artists who painted one of the more popular original ''Star Wars'' release posters. The 100 card set featured double UV-coating and an extra-thick 20 pt. card stock, all with full-bleed painted images on a 21/2" x 31/2" card. The ''Shadows of the Empire'' card series is highlighted by 72 cards that virtually storyboard the events in Steve Perry's novel. The series also contains six cards dedicated to vehicles, another six to the comics, and six more keyed to the video game. Each pack came with nine cards.

==References in other media==
The 1996 [[Star Wars (radio)#Return of the Jedi|''Return of the Jedi'' radio drama]] by [[Brian Daley]] makes several references to ''Shadows of the Empire''.

In the 1997 Special Edition re-release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', [[Speeder bike|swoop bikes]] and ASP labor droids make an appearance, as does Dash Rendar's ship, the ''[[Outrider (Star Wars)|Outrider]]''. Though originally developed for the Special Edition of ''A New Hope'', the [[Sentinel-class landing craft]] (also known as the "Imperial landing craft") also made its first appearance in ''Shadows of the Empire''.

Several missions in the ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance|X-Wing Alliance]]'' (1999) computer game refer to ''Shadows of the Empire''. The game involves assisting Dash Rendar in the capture of the Imperial freighter ''Suprosa'', which was carrying the design schematics of the second [[Death Star]]. Dash Rendar's ''Outrider'' can be seen in the game, as well as in the game ''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter|Bounty Hunter]]'' (2002).

A one-shot comic book was released from writer [[Ryder Windham]] in January 2000. It was called ''Shadow Stalker'', and was a prelude to ''Shadows of the Empire'' expanding on the adventures of Jix. The series also incorporated characters from the [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] ''Star Wars'' newspaper strip story "Iceworld".

==History==
[[File:Calvin Coolidge receiving statue of Boy Scout outside the White House 1927.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Calvin Coolidge]] receiving a copy of the statuette, outside the White House, 1927.]]
McKenzie sat on the executive board of the Boy Scouts organization in [[Philadelphia]] for more than 20 years. Asked to produce a figure of "an ideal scout," the sculptor chose several young scouts to model in uniform. In 1915, he gave the executive board an 18-inch bronze figure, together with rights to the royalties resulting from sales of copies. He said that the boy's uncovered head denoted reverence, obedience to authority, and discipline. The hatchet held by the scout is a symbol of truthfulness and the hope it would never be unsheathed for wanton destruction, but "applied unceasingly to the neck of treachery, treason, cowardice, discourtesy, dishonesty, and dirt." &lt;ref name= Buck&gt;Buck, Diane M. and Virginia A. Palmer (1995). ''Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook'', p. 49. The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenzie's life-sized version of the work was unveiled at Philadelphia's Cradle of Liberty Council on June 12, 1937.

A replica in [[Ottawa, Illinois]], adorns the grave of [[William D. Boyce]] (1858–1929), founder of the Boy Scouts of America, who modeled the organization on Great Britain's [[The Scout Association|Boy Scouts Association]].

===Cradle of Liberty Council===
{{main|Cradle of Liberty Council v. City of Philadelphia}}
The Philadelphia headquarters was built by the Boy Scouts of America on city-owned land in 1929, with the council paying a nominal $1-per-year rent. In 2008, the City of Philadelphia filed an anti-discrimination lawsuit in response to the BSA's national policy of excluding openly gay scout leaders, demanding that the Cradle of Liberty Council defy the BSA policy, pay a market-rate rent on the building, or vacate it. The council won the lawsuit in Federal court, and the judge ordered the city to pay its $877,000 in legal fees. Instead, the city settled with the council, paying the bulk of its legal fees but requiring it to vacate the building. ''The Ideal Scout'' was removed in 2013.

'''''The Last Judgment''''' is a [[triptych]] by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], created after 1482.

The triptych currently resides at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The outside of the shutters panel are painted in [[grisaille]] on panel, while the inside shutters and the center panel are painted in oil. The left and right panels measure 167.7 x 60&amp;nbsp;cm and the center panel measures 164 x 127&amp;nbsp;cm. It is not to be confused with either a fragmented piece of art by Bosch [[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych fragment)|under the same title]] (now at [[Munich]]), or another [[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych), Bruges|full painting by Bosch]], possibly by a painter in his workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/art/b/bosch/7triptyc/8lastjud.jpg WGA.hu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The left panel shows the [[Garden of Eden]], at the top God is shown seated in Heaven while the [[Fallen angel|Rebel Angels]] are cast out of Heaven and transformed into insects. At the foot of the panel, God creates [[Eve]] from the rib of [[Adam]]. In the midground Eve is tempted by the Serpent, while the couple are finally seen being chased by the Angel into the dark forest, in the central panel where Jesus judges the souls while surrounded by the Saints. The right panel shows a hellscape, where the wicked are punished.

==Provenance==
[[File:Jheronimus Bosch Last Judgment triptych (Vienna) exterior.jpg|left|220px|thumb|The closed triptych.]]
The oldest mention of the painting is in a 1659 inventory of [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]]'s collection, as by   "Hieronimo Bosz". In the late 18th century, the work was acquired by count  Lambert-Spritzenstein, from whom it later went to the current location. In the 17th-18th centuries, the triptych has been widely repainted and has lost part of the colors{{cn|date=September 2013}}.

Some art historians&lt;ref name="Varallo"&gt;{{cite book|first=Franca |last=Varallo|title=Bosch|publisher=Skira|location= Milan|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified this work as that acquired by [[Philip I of Castile]] in 1504, while others deny this. [[dendrochronology|Dendrochronologic]] analysis proved that the painting was executed not before 1482&lt;ref name="Varallo"/&gt; There is copy of the work, attributed to [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], in the  [[Gemäldegalerie]] of  [[Berlin]].

==Description==

The painting's composition has similarities with the ''[[Haywain Triptych]]'' or the ''[[Garden of Earthly Delights]]'': both also show the Garden of Eden in the left panel and the Hell at right. The central panel depicts a [[Last Judgement]], in a more obscure atmosphere than the Hell one.

===Shutters===
Like in other contemporary [[Flemish art|Flemish]] triptychs, the shutters are externally painted in [[grisaille]], depicting two saints. At left is [[St. James, son of Zebedee|St. James]] in pilgrimage within a wicked land with a hung man (perhaps a reference to some episode in the [[Golden Legend]]) ; at right is instead [[St. Bavo]], the patron of Flanders, donating to the poor with his hawk on his left wrist.

One of the characters in the latter panel, the old woman with a child, appears in a drawing attributed to Bosch, now in a [[San Francisco]] private collection.&lt;ref name="Varallo"/&gt;

[[File:Bosch Last Judgement Detail.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail of the left panel.]]

===Left panel===
The left panel depicts the [[Garden of Eden]] of the biblical history, as a green landscape in the lower three-quarters. In the upper section Bosch portrayed God sitting on his throne, surrounded by a luminous halo.&lt;ref name="Varallo"/&gt; Around him is a cloudy sky, with angels fighting rebellious angels who are turning into devils as they fall.

Below are, reading from the bottom, God creating Eve from Adam's rib, with Adam sleeping at her feet; the Serpent tempting Eve and the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]; and, finally, Adam and Eve expelled from the Garden by an angel, who holds a sword, into a dark forest.&lt;ref name="Varallo"/&gt;

===Central panel===
The central painting depicts a [[Last Judgement]], basing on John's [[Book of Revelation]]. Above is Christ as a judge, surrounded by the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], [[John the Evangelist]] and the apostles. The celestial zone, painted in a bright blue, contrasts with the rest of the panel, which is occupied by a dark brownish punishment of the Damned, while the Blessed occupy only a small portion. 
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch, The Last Judgment.JPG|240px|thumb|The central ''Last Judgement''.]]
The punishments come from monstrous creatures of Hell: the damned are burned, speared, impaled, hung from butcher hooks, forced to eat impure food (the Gluttonous), or subjects to cogs of bizarre machines. This scene has strong similarities with the right panel in Bosch's ''Garden'' at the [[Museo del Prado]].

'''The Mama Ayesha's Restaurant Presidential Mural''' is a large mural featuring eleven [[United States|American]] [[President of the United States|President]]s, starting with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and ending with [[Barack Obama]]. Created by [[El Salvador]]-born artist [[Karla Rodas]] (aka Karlisima) in 2009, the mural was funded by the [[D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities]].&lt;ref name="CityPaper"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jule Banville | year=2009 | title=In Depth: Best Obama Mural on the Outside of a Restaurant | work=Best of DC 2009 | publisher=Washington City Paper | url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/bestofdc/2009/artsandentertainment/indepth/best-obama-mural-on-the-outside-of-a-restaurant | accessdate= 2 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described by locals as being DC's "largest postcard."&lt;ref name="Marchand"&gt;{{cite web | author=Anne Marchand | year=2009 | title=Karlisima Creates Presidential Mural | work=Painterly Visions | publisher= | url=http://annemarchand.blogspot.com/2009/01/karlisima-creates-presidential-mural.html | accessdate= 2 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Presidential Mural.ogv|thumb|The Presidential Mural in Washington, DC]]
The mural, painted on the exterior wall of a [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] restaurant in the [[Adams Morgan]] neighborhood, depicts selected United States Presidents standing in front of the [[White House]]. The owner of the restaurant, Mama Ayesha, stands in the middle between [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], with their arms interlocked. A [[bald eagle]] is shown flying in the upper left corner near trees losing their leaves in the Fall season, in the background is the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. [[Cherry blossom]] trees are shown in bloom by the White House. On the right side of the mural is the [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool]], the [[Jefferson Memorial]], the [[Washington Monument]] and the [[United States Capitol]]. In front of the reflecting pool is a section painted blue for the next President. A mosaic of the [[United States Flag]] appears on either side of the painting.&lt;ref name="CityPaper"/&gt;

==Funding and concept==
The mural was funded by the [[DC Commission on the Arts &amp; Humanities]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], Mama Ayesha's Restaurant, and private donors. Karlisima started the mural in 2007 and completed it in 2009.&lt;ref name="Karlisima"&gt;{{cite web | author=Karla Cecilia Rodas Cortez | year=2009 | title=The Mama Ayesha's Restaurant Presidential Mural | work= | publisher=Karlisima | url=http://www.karlisima.com/index.html | accessdate= 2 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mural's concept was planned by Mama Ayesha's family members, who have run the restaurant since its opening in 1960. Originally Mama Ayesha was not going to be the female centerpiece of the work. The family had invited [[Helen Thomas]], a renowned White House reporter and regular customer at the restaurant, to be included in the mural; she was to be shown seated at a desk with pen and paper in her hand. The family's request was politely declined by a "modest" Thomas, who supported portraying Mama Ayesha in her place.&lt;ref name="CityPaper"/&gt;

==Karlisima==
Karla Rodas, a native of [[El Salvador]], moved to [[Alexandria, Virginia]] with her family as a child. A graduate of [[Annandale High School]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], she returned to the District to become one of the city's most well-known muralists. Her work is seen on the walls and in the collections of local establishments such as Famous Luigi's, Cafe Atlantico, and Wesley United Methodist Church, among others.&lt;ref name="CityPaper"/&gt;

Rodas provided this statement upon completion of the mural:&lt;ref name="Marchand"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The P.A.B.C. initiative (Public Art Building Communities), has allowed me to make a bridge between the community, the Restaurant Mama Ayesha’s, the arts and all the people who have made this mural a reality. This could not be done without the support of all the community and the help of the DC Commission and the Restaurant and all the entities who funded the project. I hope that this mural will become a teaching tool of the History of the Presidents for schools, children and the public in general. This is a gift to the City of Washington DC to celebrate this historical moment in American History and will remain open to the public to see for generations to come. This is fulfilling the idea that mural art is available for the public and for the masses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==

In 2009 the mural was ranked as the second-best Obama mural in the city (after [[Shepard Fairey|Shepard Fairey's]] murals at the restaurant Marvin), in the [[Washington City Paper]]'s "Best of D.C."&lt;ref name="CityPaper"/&gt;

'''''Torch Song Trilogy''''' is a collection of three plays by [[Harvey Fierstein]] rendered in three acts: ''International Stud'', ''Fugue in a Nursery'', and ''Widows and Children First!'' The story centers on Arnold Beckoff, a [[Jews|Jewish]] homosexual, [[drag queen]], and  [[torch song|torch]] singer who lives in [[New York City]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The four-hour play begins with a [[soliloquy]] in which he explains his cynical disillusionment with love.

==Summary==

Each act focuses on a different phase in Arnold's life. In the first, Arnold meets Ed, who is uncomfortable with his [[bisexuality]]. In the second, one year later, Arnold meets Alan, and the two settle down into a blissful existence that includes plans to [[adoption|adopt]] a child, until tragedy strikes. In the third, several years later, Arnold is a single father raising gay teenager David. Arnold is forced to deal with his mother's intolerance and disrespect when she visits from [[Florida]].

The first act derives its name (''International Stud'') from an actual [[gay bar]] of the same name at 117 Perry Street in Greenwich Village in the 1960s and 1970s. The bar had a [[Dark room (sexuality)|backroom]] where men engaged in anonymous sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huzbears.com/nychistory/gv.html |title=GREENWICH VILLAGE: A GAY HISTORY |publisher=Huzbears.com |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926104437/http://www.huzbears.com/nychistory/gv.html |archive-date=September 26, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The backroom plays a central role in the act.

The award-winning and popular work broke new ground in the theatre: "At the height of the post-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] clone era, Harvey challenged both [[gay]] and straight audiences to champion an effeminate gay man's longings for love and family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Charles Busch | title=Torch Song Trilogy June 1982 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2002_Nov_12/ai_94598303 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213003839/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2002_Nov_12/ai_94598303 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=December 13, 2004 | work=The Advocate | date=November 12, 2002 | accessdate=June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, directed by Peter Pope, opened on June 10, 1982 at the [[Helen Hayes Theatre|Little Theatre]], where it ran for 1,222 performances and 8 previews. Fierstein, Joynt, and Getty were joined by Court Miller as Ed and [[Fisher Stevens]] as David. Later in the run, [[David Garrison]] and [[Jonathan Hadary]] portrayed Arnold, [[Craig Sheffer]] was cast as Alan, and [[Barbara Barrie]] replaced Getty.

The play won Fierstein two [[Tony Award]]s, for Best Play (with John Glines' historic Tony speech that acknowledged his lover and co-producer Larry Lane) and Best Actor in Play; two [[Drama Desk Award]]s, for Outstanding New Play and Outstanding Actor in a Play; and the [[Theatre World Award]].

The [[West End theatre|West End]] production starring [[Antony Sher]], with [[Rupert Graves]] as Alan, opened on October 1, 1985 at [[Albery Theatre]] on St. Martin's Lane, where it ran for slightly more than seven months.

The cast featured Cas Marino as Arnold, Ian M. McDonald as Ed, Susan Erenberg as Lady Blues, Christian Thomas as Alan, Amie Backner as Laurel, Chris Kelly as David, and Mary Lynch as Mrs. Beckoff.

The play was revived at the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] in London in 2012, with [[David Bedella]] playing Arnold.

''Torch Song Trilogy'' was produced by [[The Studio Theatre]] in Washington, DC as part of its subscription series September – October 2013. It was directed by [[Michael Kahn (theatre director)|Michael Kahn]], artistic director of The Shakespeare Theatre, also in Washington, DC.

In the fall of 2017, a significantly revised version of the play, cut down by Fierstein from its original four-plus hours to two hours and forty-five minutes and retitled simply ''Torch Song'', was produced [[Off Broadway]] by [[Second Stage Theatre]], with [[Michael Urie]] as Arnold and [[Mercedes Ruehl]] as Mrs. Beckoff, and directed by [[Moises Kaufman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerard |first=Jeremy |url=http://deadline.com/2017/10/review-harvey-fiersteins-torch-song-with-michael-urie-mercedes-ruehl-1202191537/ |title=Torch Song Is Revived With Michael Urie &amp; Mercedes Ruehl: Review |publisher=Deadline |date=2017-10-19 |accessdate=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Urie-led production transferred to the [[Hayes Theater]] on Broadway in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vine |first=Hannah |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/see-harvey-fierstein-march-torch-song-to-its-new-home-on-broadway |title=See Harvey Fierstein March Torch Song to Its New Home on Broadway |publisher=Playbill |date=2018-02-21 |accessdate=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McPhee|first=Ryan|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/full-off-broadway-company-to-join-michael-urie-and-mercedes-ruehl-in-broadways-torch-song# |title=Full Off-Broadway Company to Join Michael Urie and Mercedes Ruehl in Broadway’s Torch Song| publisher=Playbill| date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''International Stud'' first premiered in 1978 at La MaMa, where Fierstein made his professional acting debut in [[Andy Warhol]]'s play ''Pork'' in 1971. Mel Gussow of The New York Times panned the play as a "sincere but sentimentalized view of a transvestite extremes." Despite the criticism, Ellen Stewart, founder of La MaMa, chose to produce ''A Fugue in the Nursery'' and ''Widows and Children First''! in 1979, though she personally found the work "too talky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=treeol9deZ8C&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=review+a+fugue+in+the+nursery+fierstein&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3MzOjyc5px&amp;sig=c6kzp7bWnPeYeBuCk-mXLtBMcoc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4Dk5VdblDNW1sQSkwYG4CQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=review%20a%20fugue%20in%20the%20nursery%20fierstein&amp;f=false |title=Nostalgia in Jewish-American Theatre and Film, 1979-2004 |author=Ben Furnish |accessdate=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Glines, a nonprofit organization dedicated to forwarding gay-themed cultural endeavors, financially supported Fierstein in reworking the three one-act plays as a singular theatrical event, which became ''Torch Song Trilogy'' and earned excited praise from Mel Gussow. "Arnold's story becomes richer as it unfolds," he wrote, saying that Fierstein's performance "[was] an act of compelling virtuosity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gdmJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=reviews+torch+song+trilogy+la+mama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y0bfhXsxf_&amp;sig=Odi7N3tSKJ5y9FA_WE6IwKyztGk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lvsqVfv3DcKhNp-VgJAF&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=reviews%20torch%20song%20trilogy%20la%20mama&amp;f=false |title=The Queer Encyclopedia of Film &amp; Television |author=Claude J.

==Responses From Teaching==
The central character of this play, Arnold, is a sharp-tongued, nurturing, compassionate, vulnerable, and he is someone who is unable to act normal around his mother, his lovers, and his adopted son because he loves each so dearly. This play allows readers to look beyond the invisible cultural assumptions and make it a comfortable experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Marvin|title=Teaching Torch Song: Gay Literature in the Classroom|journal=English Journal|date=1993|volume=82|issue=5|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher from a high school in Texas decided to add Torch Song Trilogy in his curriculum. This play was particularly important to teach due to the comfort that society feels in being silent about subjects relating to sexuality. The teacher is convinced that silence can only hurt chances of young adults who are emerging whole during their school years. 
This play was chosen to educate the students that love comes in all forms. Not only did this play help expand conservative minds, but the play is magically structured so that the audience is invited to build a dialogue with the onstage characters. The writing of this play is innovative and the structure of the play itself is unique that it offers ideas for students to explore and expand their ideas on how to creatively write. Fierstein displayed the relationship between Arnold and his son, as well as his partner in a way that the society considers “normal”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Torch Song Trilogy|journal=English Journal|date=1993|volume=82|issue=4|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of this play is love, which is a universal language. Although the teacher in Houston, thought that conventional parents would be opposed to the idea that their children are learning about homosexuality, most were open to the idea and spoke about real-life experiences their friends have lived through or they have seen. The student's parents helped their children to try to understand a world where the heterosexuals were the ones being treated the way the homosexuals were. Some students spoke about their friend's experiences about various sexual preferences and how this play helped them understand that homosexuality is not something to be afraid of. The risk of teaching this type of story was much less than expected. This play provides a forum to explore the differences between the taboo topics of sexual orientation and gender. The difference between sexism and homophobia is distinguished as well as identifying gender roles and the society’s preconceived notion of what a “drag”, “trans”, “gay”, “lesbian” “questioning”, “a-sexual” might be. Most of these students were a group of twenty-one-year-olds, who are politically correct, but there was concern that arose about teaching this type of literature in a public high school setting.

==Film adaptation==

'''''Urushi-e''''' ({{lang|ja|漆絵}} "[[lacquer]] picture[s]") refers to three different types of [[Japanese art|Japanese artworks]]:&lt;ref&gt;Doshin, Sato, ''Shibata Zeshin: From Lacquer Arts to Painting'', Nezu Museum, Tokyo, 2012, p. IX&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Richard, ''Images from the Floating World, the Japanese Print'', Dorset Press, New York, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[woodblock printing in Japan|Woodblock prints]] overpainted with a mixture of ink and animal glue to produce shiny areas resembling lacquer.
* Painting in lacquer on three-dimensional lacquer objects.
* Paintings painted with actual lacquer on paper or occasionally silk.

==Prints==
''Urushi-e'' woodblock prints were made using thick, dark black lines, and were sometimes hand-colored. The ink was mixed with an animal-based glue called ''[[nikawa]]'', which thickened it and gave it a lustrous shine, said to resemble lacquer. Most often, this was used not in creating the entire print, but only in enhancing a particular element, such as an [[Obi (sash)|obi]] or a figure's hair, to give it shine and make the image more luxurious overall.

Prints which include ''urushi-e'' elements are likely to also feature the use of [[mica]], metal dusts, and other elements which enhanced the appearance, quality and value of the works. The technique was most popular in the early 18th century, and can be seen in works by [[Okumura Masanobu]], [[Torii Kiyomasu]] and [[Torii Kiyonobu&amp;nbsp;I]], among many others.

==Paintings==
In painting, the term refers to the use of colored lacquers, produced by mixing pigments with clear lacquer. The use of colored lacquer for painting goes back to the prehistoric [[Jōmon period]], and became especially popular in the [[Nara period]] (8th century), when a great many works were made using red lacquer against a black background. Until the 19th century, however, the use of natural pigments restricted the colors accessible to artists to red, black, yellow, green, and light brown.

Artist [[Shibata Zeshin]] (1807-1891) is particularly famous for his innovations in this regard, and was perhaps the first to use lacquer not just as a decorative element (in painting boxes, furniture, and pottery) but as a medium for painted scrolls. Zeshin experimented extensively with various substances, which he mixed with lacquer to create a variety of effects, including simulating the appearance of various metals (iron, gold, bronze, copper), and imitating the appearance and texture of Western [[oil painting]].
