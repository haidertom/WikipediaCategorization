      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5099">'''''23 Minutes Over Brussels''''' is a recording of a live performance by [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] on June 16, 1978, at the [[Ancienne Belgique]] in [[Brussels]], Belgium, while supporting [[Elvis Costello]] and [[The Clash]]. The recording was first released as a promo in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/suicide/21__minutes_in_berlin___23_minutes_in_brussels/ |title=21½ Minutes in Berlin / 23 Minutes in Brussels by Suicide : Reviews and Ratings - Rate Your Music|publisher=rateyourmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remained largely unheard until its release in 1998 with the reissue of the band's [[Suicide (1977 album)|self-titled debut album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Suicide-Suicide/release/627068 |title=Suicide - Suicide (CD, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording "gives some indication of the public's reaction to this confrontational duo in their heyday".&lt;ref name="Hear Before You Die Page 386"&gt;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2008 Edition)-Dimmery, Robert Page 386&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
A friend of the band, Howard Thompson, recorded the performance on cassette tape, and it was later released as a flexi-disc insert for a music magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/641/ Recording notes&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, while [[Mute Records]] was rereleasing Suicide's catalog, the tape was remastered and included as a bonus track for their [[Suicide (1977 album)|first album]]. The entire performance is mixed as a single track.

==History==

Before Suicide even starts playing, booing can be heard from the crowd indicating that they wanted to hear the main act, [[Elvis Costello]], straight away. Suicide is introduced and begins to play "Ghost Rider". Once it ends, there is booing from the crowd. The second song is "Rocket U.S.A". After that, at roughly 9:30, the audience can be heard chanting "ELVIS! ELVIS!". This attitude continues through the third and fourth songs, "Cheree" and "Dance".

The audience becomes more active during the performance of "[[Frankie Teardrop]]". At roughly 19:30, loud applause can be heard; someone steals [[Alan Vega]]'s microphone (a woman at 20:35 can be heard saying "They took the mic"). Shortly afterwards, the music stops and the promoter comes on, warning the audience that if they don't give the microphone back, there will be "no show". Vega joins in, swearing at the audience. After receiving the microphone, he continues to sing "Frankie Teardrop" [[a cappella]]. After even more booing, Vega shouts "SHUT THE FUCK UP! THIS IS ABOUT FRANKIE!". A few moments later, there is rapturous applause as the band leaves the stage.

Later, Elvis Costello played a very short and angry set in which he made no secret of his outrage over Suicide's treatment by the crowd. This incited a riot. The show was cancelled and Vega's nose was broken. The story is detailed in the liner notes of the 2000 re-release.&lt;ref name="headheritage1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/641/ |title=Julian Cope presents Head Heritage &amp;#124; Unsung &amp;#124; Reviews &amp;#124; Suicide - 23 Minutes Over Brussels |publisher=Headheritage.co.uk |date=1978-06-16 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack |url=http://poundforpound.blogspot.com/2008/12/suicide-23-minutes-over-brussels.html |title=Pound for Pound: Suicide - 23 Minutes Over Brussels |publisher=Poundforpound.blogspot.com |date=2008-12-15 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Suicide would only become famous after the peak of their activity was over. During the 1980s and 90s, they were responsible for influencing many bands and shaping genres such as [[industrial music]], [[dance music]] and notably [[electroclash]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} This performance has been called "a record of proof of an innovative band’s struggle with an unreceptive audience" and has been compared to the audience's reactions to [[Electric Dylan controversy|Dylan going electric]]. It also "clearly demonstrates two individuals flying in the face of convention, screaming their guts out to be heard, and failing to make a poignant imprint on the listening audience".&lt;ref name="headheritage1"/&gt; [[Allmusic]] said that "though the (reissues) extra tracks dilute the original album's impact somewhat, they're worthwhile supplements to one of the punk era's most startlingly unique works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phares |first=Heather |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r19328/review |title=Suicide [First Album&amp;#93; - Suicide |publisher=AllMusic |date=1978-06-16 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In review of their debut album for [[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]], [[Chris Shade]] called it a "riotous comedy", and noted that "(their) lack of [[rock 'n' roll]] accoutrements such as a drummer or guitarist often aroused violent reactions in their bewildered audiences".&lt;ref name="Hear Before You Die Page 386"/&gt;

'''Ailerán''', also known as '''Ailerán sapientis''' (Ailerán the Wise) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[scholar]] and [[saint]] who died on 29 December, 664 or 665. His [[feast day]] is December 29.

==Biography==
Ailerán was one of the most distinguished scholars at the School of [[Clonard Abbey|Clonard]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref name=grattan&gt;Grattan-Flood, William. "St. Aileran." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 20 Sept. 2012 [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01234c.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

His early life is not recorded, but he was attracted to Clonard by the fame of Saint [[Finnian of Clonard|Finnián]] and his disciples. He became [[Reader (liturgy)|lector]] of the school&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/product.php?intProductID=134 Ailerani Interpretatio Mystica Progenitorum Domini Iesu Christi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406132134/http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/product.php?intProductID=134 |date=2012-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 650. He died of the [[Yellow Plague]], and his death is recorded in the [[Annals of Ulster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://brigid-undertheoak.blogspot.com/2010/01/irish-saints-of-december-aireran-wise.html Aileran]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his knowledge of the works of [[Origen]], [[Philo]], [[St. Jerome]], [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], and others, he was well versed in patristic literature.

==Works==

According to [[John Colgan]], numerous works can be ascribed to Ailerán, including the ''Fourth Life of [[Saint Patrick]]'', a Latin litany, and the ''Lives'' of [[Saint Brigid]] and Saint [[Féichín of Fore]]. Ailerán's best known work is his mystical interpretation of the ''Ancestry of Our Lord Jesus Christ'', according to the [[genealogy of Jesus]] in [[Gospel of Matthew|Saint Matthew's Gospel]].&lt;ref name=grattan/&gt; This was published in the [[Benedictine]] edition of the [[Church Fathers|Fathers]], and the editors said that they published it although Aileran was not a Benedictine, because he " unfoulded the meaning of the Sacred Scripture with so much learning and ingenuity that every student of the Sacred Volume and especially preachers of the Divine Word will regard the publication as most acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/WestCorkHistory/Monasteries.php Monasticism in Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; Another work of his is titled ''A Short Moral Explanation of the Sacred Names'', which could be a fragment of a larger work.

[[File:Closeup_of_blackthorn_aka_sloe_aka_prunus_spinosa_sweden_20050924.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The astringents and acids in fresh [[blackthorn]] berries (sloes) give the fruit its sourness.]]
An '''astringent''' (sometimes called '''adstringent''') is a chemical that shrinks or constricts [[body tissue]]s. The word derives from the [[Latin]] ''adstringere'', which means "to bind fast". [[Calamine lotion]], [[Witch hazel (astringent)|witch hazel]], and [[Anemopsis|yerba mansa]], a Californian plant, are astringents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nathistoc.bio.uci.edu/Plants%20of%20Upper%20Newport%20Bay%20%28Robert%20De%20Ruff%29/Saururaceae/Anemopsis%20californica.htm ''Anemopsis californica''] from University of California, Irvine&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astringency''', the dry, puckering [[mouthfeel]] caused by the [[tannin]]s in unripe fruits, lets the fruit mature by deterring eating. Ripe fruits and fruit parts including [[blackthorn]] (sloe berries), ''[[Aronia]]'' chokeberry, [[chokecherry]], [[bird cherry]], [[quince]] and [[persimmon]] fruits, and [[banana]] skins are very astringent; citrus fruits, like lemons, are somewhat astringent. Tannins, being a kind of [[polyphenol]], bind salivary proteins and make them precipitate and aggregate,&lt;ref&gt;Fennema, ''Food Chemistry'', 4th ed., p. 656.&lt;/ref&gt; producing a rough, "sandpapery", or dry sensation in the mouth. The tannins in some [[tea]]s and red grape [[wine]]s like [[cabernet sauvignon]] and [[merlot]] produce mild astringency. 

==Uses==
In medicine, astringents cause constriction or contraction of [[mucous membrane]]s and exposed tissues and are often used internally to reduce discharge of [[blood serum]] and mucous secretions.&lt;ref name="Brodin1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brodin|first=Michael|title=The Over-The-Counter Drug Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xyJw_aLOM9sC&amp;pg=PA382|accessdate=4 June 2014|year=1998|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-01380-6|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen with a [[sore throat]], [[hemorrhage]]s, [[diarrhea]], and [[peptic ulcer]]s. Externally applied astringents, which cause mild coagulation of skin [[protein]]s, dry, harden, and protect the [[skin]].&lt;ref name="Ciullo1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter A.

Although designed to be a [[chair]], due to its amorphous nature it is often confused with [[Tuffet|tuffets]] and [[Ottoman (furniture)|ottomans]].

== History ==
'''Sacco''',&lt;ref name="Vitra Design Museum"/&gt; the first artifact of that kind, was introduced in 1968 by three Italian designers: Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro.&lt;ref name="Vitra Design Museum"/&gt; The object was created in the Italian Modernism movement.&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"&gt;{{cite book |last=Raizman |first=David |editor-last=May |editor-first=Susie |title=History of Modern Design Second Edition |publisher=Laurence King Publishing |date=2010 |pages=256–306 |chapter=Part V: Humanism and Luxury: International Modernism and Mass Culture after Word War II (1945-1960) |isbn=978-1-85669-694-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Being a post war era phenomenon, Italian modernism’s design was highly inspired with new available technology. Post war technology allowed an increase in the processes of production, by introducing new materials such as polystyrene. The idea of mass-produced goods made within an inexpensive price range appealed to consumers. It therefore created the need for a revolution in the creative and manufacturing process. ‘The designer was an integral member of a process that included marketing as well as engineering’ (Raizman 284).&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt; The inspiration left by Corradino D’Ascano’s [[Vespa]] design for the [[Piaggio]] Corporation in 1946, added value to the essence of the designer. With successful designs, brands could sell more products, and therefore the identity of the designer played an important advertising role.&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt;
Another important figure of the Italian modernism period was [[Gio Ponti]]. Inspired by modernism's art movements, Ponti created new forms of objects. His asymmetrically balanced designs freed the Italian objects form their classic representations. The designer promoted Italian designs on famous exhibitions called ‘Milan [[Triennale]]’ :  “These exhibitions, organized as early as the 1920s … were responsible for increasing the visibility of Italian design in an international setting ” (Raizman 285).&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt; After becoming an editor of the [[Domus (magazine)]] in 1947, Ponti contributed to not only Italian design of that time, but also : “the human and creative element in modern industrial design as well as its practical, economic and social benefits.”(Raizman 285)&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt;

Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro, inspired by their designer predecessors, came up in 1968 with the design of Sacco the ‘shapeless chair’. Although it was not the first design of an amorphous chair in Italian history, Sacco was the first successful product created in partnership with [[Zanotta (company)|Zanotta]]. The predecessor of the product had a major design flaw of not being able to sustain its form and therefore never reached production. Sacco picked up that flaw and with the use of leather for exterior and right placed stitching. It is worth mentioning that the use of leather was not coincidental as at that time the textile was an Italian national pride product.&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt; The target user of the chair was the lax, hippie community and their non-conformist household. "In an era characterized by the hippie culture, apartment sharing and student demonstrations, the thirty-something designers created a nonpoltrona (non-chair) and thus launched an attack on good bourgeois taste."&lt;ref name="Vitra Design Museum"/&gt;

==Other bean bag chair products inspired by Sacco==
Other designers have followed the ‘shapeless’ chair design, creating a range of inspired products that take after Sacco.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/02/beanbag-chair-make-your-own# | title=How to bag a beanbag chair | publisher=The Guardian | date=2 June 2009 | accessdate=10 January 2014 | author=Griffiths, Sally}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst many, the most successful contemporary model would be [[Jukka Setala]]’s Fatboy. The product launched in 2002 brought the Finnish designer global recognition. The new form of the bean bag chair has less stitching and a more geometrical take in the means of shape. It also has (just like ALL bean bags) an [[Expanded polystyrene|EPS]] filling which is more durable than [[PVC]] that hardly anyone use.&lt;ref name="Fatboy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatboy.com/nl/bean-bags/original# |title=Fatboy original |publisher=Fatboy |date=2002 |accessdate=16 October 2014 |author=Fatboy }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, he announced on his website that he had remarried.&lt;ref name="Ben"/&gt;

Bova was an avid fencer in his younger days and organized Avco Everett's fencing club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12407.Ben_Bova|title=Ben Bova|website=Goodreads|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bova worked as a [[technical writer]] for [[Project Vanguard]] in the 1950s and later for the [[Avco]] Everett Research Laboratory&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2009/feb/14/ben-bova-we-need-more-kantrowitzs-impure-research/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320071111/http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2009/feb/14/ben-bova-we-need-more-kantrowitzs-impure-research/ |date=March 20, 2012 |title=Ben Bova: We need more of Kantrowitz’s ‘impure research’, By BEN BOVA, Posted February 14, 2009 at 7:01 p.m, Naples Daily News }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s. when they conducted research in [[laser]]s and [[fluid dynamics]]. At Avco Everett he met [[Arthur Kantrowitz|Arthur R. Kantrowitz]] (later of the [[Foresight Institute]]).

In 1972, Bova became editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction]]'', after [[John W. Campbell]]'s death in 1971. At ''Analog'', Bova won six [[Hugo Award]]s for [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor|Best Professional Editor]].&lt;ref name="ws791020"/&gt;

Bova served as the science advisor for the television series ''[[The Starlost]]''&lt;ref name="ws791020"/&gt; and left in disgust after the airing of the first episode (1973). His novel ''The Starcrossed'', loosely based on his experiences, featured a thinly veiled characterization of his friend and colleague [[Harlan Ellison]]. Bova dedicated the novel to "Cordwainer Bird", the pen name Ellison uses when he does not want to be associated with a television or film project.

In 1974, he wrote the screenplay for an episode of the children's [[science fiction|science-fiction]] television series ''[[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|Land of the Lost]]'', titled "The Search".

After leaving ''Analog'' in 1978, Bova went on to edit ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'', from 1978 to 1982.&lt;ref name="ws791020"/&gt;

Bova holds the position of President Emeritus of the [[National Space Society]] and served as President of [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA) from 1990 to 1992.

He appeared as the Guest of Honor at the Florida convention Necronomicon in 1995 and 2011. In 2000, he attended the [[58th World Science Fiction Convention]] (Chicon 2000) as the Author Guest of Honor.

In 2007, [[Mary Parent|Stuber/Parent Productions]] hired him as a consultant to provide insight into what the world may look like in the near future, for their film ''[[Repo Men]]'' (2010) starring [[Jude Law]] and [[Forest Whitaker]]. Also in 2007 he provided consulting services to [[Silver Pictures]] on the [[Altered Carbon#Film adaptation|film adaptation]] of [[Richard K. Morgan]]'s [[hardboiled]] [[cyberpunk]] science-fiction novel ''[[Altered Carbon]]'' (2002). He was awarded the [[Robert A.

'''''Cairn in Snow''''', also known as '''''Dolmen in the snow''''', ({{lang-de|'''Hünengrab im Schnee'''}}, literally "Giant's grave in the snow") is a [[landscape painting]] by the German painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]].  Friedrich is noted for his landscapes depicting features such as trees or [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] ruins, silhouetted against the sky or in morning mists.  The painting depicts leafless trees in the winter snow, with the tops of two of the trees broken off and the third bent by the prevailing wind, giving the work a haunted, spectral air.  It is a [[Romantic period|Romantic]] [[allegory|allegorical]] landscape, depicting a stone [[cairn]] or [[dolmen]] set amid three oak trees on a hilltop, with a contemplative melancholy mood.  It was probably painted around 1807, making it among Friedrich's first oil paintings.  It measures {{convert|61|x|80|cm}} and has been held by the [[Galerie Neue Meister]] in Dresden since 1905.

The main elements of the painting are taken from different locations in eastern Germany.  The cairn is thought to be based on the [[Neolithic]] burial site at {{ill|Großsteingrab Gützkow|de}}, near the town [[Gützkow]] in [[West Pomerania]]; the [[megalith]] was destroyed before 1818, but Friedrich had sketched it since at least 1802.  Friedrich sketched the trees at [[Neubrandenburg]], most clearly an 1807 [[sepia (color)|sepia]] sketch ''Hünengrab am Meer'' ("Dolmen by the sea").  Similar oak trees reappear in several works by Friedrich, including ''Monk in the Snow'' (1808, also known as ''Winter''), ''[[The Abbey in the Oakwood]]'' (1818), ''Monastery graveyard under snow'' (1818) and ''Oak tree in snow'' (1829).  The hill is located near [[Wustrow, Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Wustrow]].  The painting also includes four ravens, two above the cairn, one to the right, and a fourth high in the tree to the right.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The painting alludes to Christian and pagan symbolism.  Trees and forests were seen as symbols of life endurance, longevity, and immortality.  [[Sacred groves]], often a group of trees in ancient times, were associated with secrecy and initiation rites, and they were regarded as untouchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y9882e/y9882e08.htm|title=Forest and tree symbolism in folklore |publisher=www.fao.org|accessdate=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/648638/world-tree|title=World tree|publisher= global.britannica.com|accessdate=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main trees depicted in this painting by Friedrich appear to have had most of their old branches chopped off. The three trees around the cairn recalls the three wooden crosses on [[Golgotha]] at the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], and the stone chamber where Christ's body was [[entombment of Christ|entombed]].  The painting also alludes to the permanence of the ancient stone landmark, the strength of the oak tree to withstand the storm broken and bowed but not defeated, and the continuity of life in the middle of winter.

Art critics have interpreted the painting as a meditation on life and death, and on the political situation in Germany following the defeats of [[Prussia]] by Napoleon's French army at the [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt]] in 1806.  Around the same times, Friedrich was working on his 1807 ''[[Tetschen Altar]]''.

The painting was first owned by the [[Greifswald University]] professor {{ill|Karl Schildener|de}}.  It painting is described in 1828 in the ''Greifswald academical journal'' (II, 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;40&amp;ndash;41).&lt;ref&gt;[http://skd-online-collection.skd.museum/de/contents/showArtist?id=241955 "Hünengrab im Schnee"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730230821/http://skd-online-collection.skd.museum/de/contents/showArtist?id=241955# |date=2017-07-30 }}, Staatliche Kunstsammlung Dresden.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Noir, [http://timedoesnotrest.wordpress.com/2013/04/29/caspar-david-friedrich/ "Caspar David Friedrich"], Time Does Not Rest, 29 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The work was sold at auction in Leipzig in 1845 and acquired by Friedrich's friend and fellow painter [[Johan Christian Dahl]].

'''''Calm Waters''''' is a 2013 large glass and paint installation by artist [[Katherine Bradford]]. It is located on the [[Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital|Eskenazi Health]] campus, near downtown [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], and is part of the [[Eskenazi Health Art Collection]].

== Description ==
''Calm Waters'' is a 2013 mixed-media [[Installation art|installation]] by artist Kathy Bradford, which consists of seven panels of ⅜-inch thick glass that sit several inches in front of a painted abstract pattern resembling waves in blue, gray, and teal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/calm-waters|title=Calm Waters {{!}} Public Art Archive|website=www.publicartarchive.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The glass panels consist of sand-carved clear laminated glass and clear, white, and gray etched glass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A technique known as glue-chipping, which creates a sparkle effect, is also used on the panels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The layered arrangement of glass and paint, which measures 77" x 238" overall, creates the illusion of both notable depth and change or movement as pedestrians walk past. Of the work's subject and purpose, the artist says:

“This imagery is of a large body of calm water with cloud reflections throughout the composition. This imagery is intended to transport the thoughts of the viewer, creating relaxation and calmness. Combining the art glass with the painted wall behind the glass surface creates multiple colors shifting throughout the composition. It is intended to intrigue the viewer and encourage further investigation.” -Kathy Bradford&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7891">[[File:XuBeihong.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Xu Beihong]], the first chairman of the China Artists Association]]

The '''China Artists Association''' ({{zh|s=中国美术家协会}}), originally the '''China National Art Workers' Association''' ({{zh|s=中华全国美术工作者协会|links=no}}), is the official national association of Chinese artists, with its headquarters in [[Beijing]]. It was established in July 1949, with [[Xu Beihong]] as its first chairman. It has 6,000 members, and the current chairman is [[Liu Dawei]].

==Organization==
The China Artists Association is under the leadership of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee]], and managed by the [[Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee Publicity Department]].&lt;ref name="Wiseman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wiseman |first1=Mary |last2=Liu |first2=Yuedi |title=Subversive Strategies in Contemporary Chinese Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xURshm0rC8QC&amp;pg=PA284 |date=21 March 2011 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-18795-2 |page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; It previously operated provincial-level branches in all of China's provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, but in 1990 the provincial branches were reorganized into provincial artists associations and admitted into the national association as group members.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caanet.org.cn/AboutCAA/jianjie.aspx |title=中国美协简介 |accessdate=2016-02-26 |language=Chinese |publisher=China Artists Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national association oversees many specialized subordinate committees, including those for [[Chinese painting]], [[oil painting]], sculpture, architecture, ceramics, print, fresco, animation, ethnic art, and children's art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caanet.org.cn/yiweihui/yiweihui.aspx |title=各专业委员会 |publisher=China Artists Association |language=Chinese |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association organizes the national art exhibition, China's largest art exhibition, every five years.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt; Ten sessions have been held as of 2011. Regional artists associations would select works from artists in the local area and submit them to the higher level for consideration. For individual artists, having works selected for the national exhibition brings fame and improves prospects for promotion. Many of them become heads of lower-level artists associations.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt;

The association's headquarters are located in the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall in Beijing. Its official publication is ''Fine Arts'', a monthly magazine.&lt;ref name=culture&gt;{{cite web |title=China Artists Association |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artists/2003-09/24/content_26939.htm |publisher=Chinese Ministry of Culture |accessdate=2016-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111819/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artists/2003-09/24/content_26939.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chip art''', also known as '''silicon art''', '''chip graffiti''' or '''silicon doodling''', refers to microscopic artwork built into [[integrated circuits]], also called chips or ICs.  Since ICs are printed by [[photolithography]], not constructed a component at a time, there is no additional cost to include features in otherwise unused space on the chip.  Designers have used this freedom to put all sorts of artwork on the chips themselves, from designers' simple initials to rather complex drawings.  Given the small size of chips, these figures cannot be seen without a [[microscope]].  Chip graffiti is sometimes called the hardware version of [[Easter egg (media)|software easter eggs]].

Prior to 1984, these doodles also served a practical purpose.  If a competitor produced a similar chip, and examination showed it contained the same doodles, then this was strong evidence that the design was copied (a [[copyright]] violation) and not independently derived.  A 1984 revision of the US copyright law (the [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984]]) made all [[mask work|chip masks automatically copyrighted]], with exclusive rights to the creator, and similar rules apply in most other countries that manufacture ICs.  Since an exact copy is now automatically a copyright violation, the doodles serve no useful purpose.

==Creating chip art==
[[Image:ChipWorksLandShark.jpg|left|thumb|Image of a [[Land Shark (Saturday Night Live)|Land Shark]] from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' inside an [[Analog Devices]] AD1939 chip.]]
Integrated Circuits are constructed from multiple layers of material, typically [[silicon]], [[silicon dioxide]] ([[glass]]), and [[aluminium|aluminum]]. The composition and thickness of these layers give them their distinctive color and appearance. These elements created an irresistible palette for IC design and layout engineers. 

The creative process involved in the design of these chips, a strong sense of pride in their work, and an artistic temperament combined compels people to want to mark their work as their own. It is very common to find initials, or groups of initials on chips. This is the design engineer's way of "signing" his or her work.

Often this creative artist's instinct extends to the inclusion of small pictures or icons. These may be images of significance to the designers, comments related to the chip's function, [[inside jokes]], or even [[satirical]] references. Because of the difficulty in verifying their existence, chip art has also been the subject of online hoaxes (e.g. the never-seen "[[Bill Gates|bill]] sux" comment on a [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] chip&amp;mdash;the reputed "photo" showing the inscription is a hoax&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.snopes.com/business/hidden/chipshot.asp an account of "Bill Sux" as an urban legend.]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The mass production of these works of art as parasites on the body of a commercial IC goes unnoticed by most observers and is discouraged by semiconductor corporations, primarily from the fear that the presence of the artwork (which is clearly unneeded) will interfere with some necessary function in the chip or design flow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/design/the-secret-art-of-chip-graffiti The Secret Art of Chip Graffiti] ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' article on chip artwork, by H. Goldstein, Volume: 39, Issue: 3, Mar 2002, pp. 50-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some laboratories have started collaborating with artists or directly producing books and exhibits with the micrographs of these chips. Such is the case of [[Harvard]] chemist [[George M. Whitesides|George Whitesides]], who collaborated with pioneer photographer [[Felice Frankel]] to publish ''On the Surface of Things'', a highly praised photography book on experiments from (mostly) the Whitesides lab. Also, the laboratory of [[Albert Folch Folch|Albert Folch]] (who, perhaps not coincidentally, works in [[BioMEMS]], the same field as George Whitesides) at the [[University of Washington]]'s Bioengineering Dept. has a highly popular online gallery with more than 1,700 free [[BioMEMS]]-related chip art micrographs and has already produced three art exhibits in the Seattle area, with online sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/afolch/FolchLabART.html Folch Lab ART Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cymon and Iphigenia''''' is an oil on canvas painting by [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton]]. The painting does not bear a date but was first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], London, in 1884. The [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]], Australia, purchased it at a [[Christie's]] auction in London in 1976.{{TOC LIMIT|2}}

==Background==
According to a story published in 1897, Leighton spent six months searching throughout Europe for a model to match his imagined ideal of [[Iphigenia]] for his intended portrayal of Cymon and Iphigenia. He saw a young actress, [[Dorothy Dene]], in a theatre in London and his search was over.{{r|Inquirer}} Possessing a classical Greek style beauty, Dene had golden wavy hair with excellent skin texture and colouration on her face; she was taller than average with graceful arms and legs together with an “exquisitely moulded bust”.{{r|Inquirer}} She appeared in several other of Leighton's works, including ''Greek Girls Playing Ball'' and ''Summer Moon''.{{r|Inquirer}} Lena, one of Dene's younger sisters, appears in the painting as the child slave.{{r|Artmagick}} Other paintings by Leighton featuring Dene are: ''The Bath of Psyche'', ''Clytie'', ''Perseus and Andromeda'', ''Solitude'', ''The Return of Persephone'' and ''The Vestal.''{{r|Artmagick}}

The painting took eight months to complete;{{r|Inquirer}} a succession of line drawings were done first as Leighton tried to capture the position he wanted for the central figure,{{r|Nahum}} around 56 – including several of foliage and other elements of the piece – of these are known to exist.{{r|Kensington}} The English art critic [[Peter Nahum]] describes the painting as "central among Leighton's later works",{{r|Nahum}} an opinion Mrs Russell Barrington considered was shared by Leighton.{{sfnp|Barrington|1906|p=258|ps=none}} Leighton's painting ''Idyll'' dating from a few years earlier has some similar elements but lacks the complexities of ''Cymon and Iphigenia''.{{sfnp|Mallais|Tadema|1886|p=16|ps=none}} The two compositions each highlight the difference between the fair complexion of a female with a dark skinned male; both feature a full-length woman reclining beneath a tree and similar lighting techniques are used.{{sfnp|Mallais|Tadema|1886|p=16|ps=none}}

==Description==
The overall dimensions of the undated oil on canvas painting are {{convert|163|by|328|cm}}.{{r|AGNSW}} Based on [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s{{r|Times}} ''[[The Decameron]]'', the painting depicts a scene from the first tale of day five; Iphigenia is sleeping in the woods and Cymon, a young nobleman,  stands gazing at her beauty which fills him with inspiration.{{sfnp|Ruvoldt|2004|p=99|ps=none}} After seeing her, Cymon changes from a badly mannered lout to an ideal [[polymath]].{{sfnp|Ruvoldt|2004|p=101|ps=none}} Nahum felt it "emphasised the transforming power of beauty."{{r|Nahum}} Boccaccio set the story in the springtime; Leighton preferred the ambience of a more autumnal feel.{{sfnp|Rhys|1900|p=45|ps=none}} The artist was very precise about the mood he wanted to reflect by describing the specific setting of the time of day as "the most mysteriously beautiful in the whole twenty-four hours".{{sfnp|Barrington|1906|p=258|ps=none}} He wished to capture the overall impression of drowsiness just before drifting to sleep especially on long hot days as night begins to fall.{{sfnp|Rhys|1900|p=45|ps=none}} The painting is set when there is the "merest lip of the moon" showing on the horizon above the sea and the atmosphere is "haunted still with the flush of the after-glow from the sun already hidden in the west."{{sfnp|Barrington|1906|p=258|ps=none}}

Iphigenia lies with her face and torso pivoted slightly to her right, her arms are raised above her head.{{r|Nahum}} Her body is loosely covered by material{{sfnp|Rhys|1900|p=45|ps=none}} and the depiction of her figure is described as "masterly" by a writer using the name of "Mentezuma" in his report included in the [[Art Amateur]] about the Royal Academy exhibition of 1884.{{sfnp|Mentezuma|1884|p=51|ps=none}} Other sleeping figures are Iphigenia's servants{{sfnp|Rhys|1900|p=45|ps=none}} and a dog.{{sfnp|Mentezuma|1884|p=51|ps=none}} According to Greenhough White, Leighton had the ability to show "the perfection of repose" and the "self-abandonment and unconsciousness of sleep" and it was utilised to full effect in this painting and his earlier work entitled ''Summer Moon''.{{sfnp|White|1899|p=477|ps=none}}

==Exhibitions and provenance==
The first time the painting was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] was at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition|summer exhibition]] in 1884.{{r|AGNSW}} After viewing it at the exhibition an unnamed French critic reported that he could not recall "a more original effect of light and colour, used in the broad, true, and ideal treatment of lovely forms."{{sfnp|Rhys|1900|p=45|ps=none}} The following year, in 1885, it was exhibited in Berlin.{{sfnp|Barrington|1906|p=258|ps=none}} It was again displayed at the Royal Academy in the winter of 1897, a memorial exhibition of his works as Leighton had died on 25 January 1896.{{r|Timeline}}  It was included in the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]]'s annual loan exhibition in 1897.{{r|AGNSW}} [[William Quilter|Sir W.E. Cuthbert Quilter]] owned the painting until it was sold among his art collection in July 1909.{{r|AGNSW}} It changed ownership a number of times in the UK, with owners including [[Albu Baronets|Leopold Albu]], and Pamela Cavendish (mother of [[Hugh Cavendish, Baron Cavendish of Furness]]), before being purchased at auction by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Australia, in February 1976.{{r|AGNSW}}  It returned to at the Royal Academy from mid-February to April 1996, in an exhibition devoted to the work of Leighton.{{r|AGNSW}} The Art Gallery of New South Wales also purchased a colour study of the painting, measuring {{convert|23.5|by|46.5|cm}}, in 1986.{{r|Colour study}}

'''Daphni''' or '''Dafni''' ([[Modern Greek]]: Δαφνί; [[Katharevousa]]: Δαφνίον, ''Daphnion'') is an eleventh-century [[Byzantine]] monastery {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} northwest of central [[Athens]] in the suburb of [[Chaidari]], south of Athinon Avenue ([[Greece Interstate 8A|GR-8A]]). It is situated near the forest of the same name, on the [[Sacred Way]] that led to [[Eleusis]]. The forest covers about {{cvt|18|km2|mi2|0}}, and surrounds a laurel grove. "Daphni" is the modern Greek name that means "laurel grove", derived from Daphneion (Lauretum).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Daphne Monastery: History, Architecture, Mosaics|last=Kyriacopoulou|first=Helen|publisher=Society for Peloponnesian Studies, 1956|year=1956|isbn=|location=Athens|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Daphni Monastery was founded towards the end of the sixth century A.D. on the site of the Sanctuary of [[Apollo]] which had been desecrated by the [[Goths]] in 395.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The Sanctuary of Apollo was built in the [[Ionic style]] using the thinnest and smallest columns. The columns stand on a base with an ornamental scroll at the top. A few of the columns of the temple have been preserved. One of the four Ionic columns of the ancient Sanctuary of Apollo remains at the site, as it was re-used in the Daphni Monastery. The other columns were removed and taken to London by [[Thomas Bruce, Earl of Elgin]] (of [[Elgin Marbles]] fame). The columns, column bass, and column tops from the Sanctuary of Apollo are currently in the possession of the [[British Museum]]; they are currently not on display but can be seen on the museum’s [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3682783&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Dhafni+monastery&amp;images=true&amp;museumno=1816.0610.232&amp;page=1 website] .

The first monastery on the site was constructed in the style of a castle with a [[basilica]] in the middle. It was fortified with enclosing walls and small [[monastic cell|cells]] that were usually just inside the walls and used by monks or nuns. The walls were attached to the church rather than standing free around the perimeter of the property and one of the columns from Apollo was built into the southern wall of the church.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some of the rectangular blocks of porous stone were also salvaged and used in the western outer wall of the church. This first monastery fell into decline when Greece was severely damaged following invasions of barbarians from the North and the sea in the ninth and tenth Centuries A.D.

During a period of renewed prosperity In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Daphni Monastery was restored. A new octagonal church, a [[refectory]] and a chapel for the cemetery were built.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architecture of Greece|last=Darling|first=Janina|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Westport, CT|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old basilica was completely demolished except for the enclosing walls and cells from the former church which were incorporated into the new church. Traces of old frescoes found on the walls show a person with bands, perhaps Emperor [[Basil II]], holding a scroll. The craftsmanship used in the church construction suggests Basil II brought in workers from [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Daphni Monastery fell into decline after it was sacked by [[Frankokratia|Frankish]] [[Fourth Crusade|crusaders]] in 1205. The region became part of the [[Duchy of Athens]] under [[Othon de la Roche]]. Othon gave the Daphni Monastery to the [[Cistercian]] [[Abbey of Bellevaux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Byzantine Mosaics in Greece|last=Diez|first=Ernest|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1931|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=409}}&lt;/ref&gt; who added their own cloister and twin pointed arches [[Gothic architecture|in the Gothic style]] to the façade of the church. The Daphni Monastery became a popular burial place for Knights. In 1458, immediately after the coming of the Turks and the visit of Sultan [[Mehmed II]] to Athens, the Cistercians abandoned the Daphni Monastery and the Duchy of Athens was abolished.

The Daphni Monastery, along with the famous monasteries of [[Hosios Loukas]] near [[Delphi]] and [[Nea Moni]] on the island of [[Chios]], are designated [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] for their significant historical and architectural value. These monasteries are famed as masterpieces of middle Byzantine architecture, and are especially noted for their sumptuous interior gold mosaics.

== Architecture ==
The exterior of the church has a [[cloisonné]] style, which is very common for middle Byzantine churches in Greece.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The cloisonné style of masonry consists of rectangular blocks of stone separated or framed on all four sides by bricks. The windows are set off from the cloisonné work by arched frames made of brick. The contrast between the light color of the stone blocks of the cloisonné and the red bricks around the windows, and the orange roof create a sophisticated and understated elegance.

The floor plan for the Church of Daphni is a simple Greek cross-octagon arranged with various levels of light and illumination. The upper church, particularly the dome symbolizes the Heavens while the lower area symbolizes the earth. A square bay in the center of the church is covered by a broad dome. Squinches, small half-domes that span the corner of a square are connected by tall L-shaped piers to form the transition from the square to the circle of the dome. The four squinches in the square bay transform it into an octagon. The wall surfaces fan out at the top above the squinches and join together to form the circular base of the dome. 
[[File:Ground.Plan of the Monastery-Church at Daphni. John M. Neale. A history of the Holy Eastern Church. P.183.jpg|thumb|Ground Plan of the Monastery-Church at Daphni
]]
A [[Greek cross]] is formed by four [[barrel vault|barrel-vaulted]] arms of the same length that project from the center bay. Small bays covered with groin vaults (ceilings made up of two barrel vaults) that intersect at right angles give the building its rectangular shape. The bays that fill in the cross are only one-story high and with a low-level of illumination to subordinate them from the Greek cross.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Mosaics ==
The interior of The Daphni Monastery has an elegant interplay of spaces and light with the windows at the base of the dome illuminating the vertical space above; as the space becomes taller, it also become brighter. This graduated light enhances the radiant gold-ground [[tesserae]] used to create the remarkable quality of the mosaics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The unknown artist was from the early [[Komnenian period]] ({{circa|1100}}). The wide assortment of colored shades of glass tesserae further enhances the mosaics. Several important studies have been conducted on the composition of the glass used in the tesserae for these mosaics as the unusually bright color of the gold-ground tesserae and the deep brilliance of the colors combine with important stylistic qualities to make these mosaics unique &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=James|first=Liz|year=2006|title=Byzantine Glass Mosaic Tesserae: Some Material Considerations|url=|journal=Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 30|volume=1|pages=29–47|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the factors that identifies mosaics from different areas is the variance in glass used. The glass can be crafted locally or imported from other areas; in the case of Daphni, it is believed the glass was created on site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Light on Old Glass: Recent Research on Byzantine Mosaics and Glass|last=Entwistle|first=Christopher|publisher=British Museum|year=2013|isbn=|location=Loneon|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This group of mosaics is considered one of the most important and best-preserved mosaic cycles from this period. They are evidence of the iconographic and stylistic conceptions formulated at the end of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclastic crisis]] (AD 843) by the [[Church of Constantinople]]. The decoration shows a rigid consistency in the distribution of subject characteristic of Constantinopolitan art.

In Byzantine theology, the church building was a symbol of the Christian universe, intended to reflect the splendor of heaven. A standardized program in Byzantine churches established the order in which the representations were arranged. The most sacred characters were depicted in the dome and the apse, while below, the dome scenes were arranged from higher to lower levels relating to their level of religious importance.

Visitors to the church are immediately drawn to the most important and famous of the mosaics: [[Christ Pantocrator]] (Lord of the Universe) watching over all from the crown of the dome. He is depicted with a stern face and a threatening gaze with only his head and shoulders shown. This medallion is recognized as representing high artistic quality and as “one of the greatest creations in art”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Christ is wearing a purple robe and a blue mantle, he is the [[King of Kings]] and shows strength, austerity and power. The artist created a bold and realistic drawing, executed with very simple means. The eyebrows are shown with a strong arch to accentuate the vertical lines and the long nose that intersects with the horizontal lines of the halo to create a symbolic cross. Several studies have been conducted in an attempt to determine whether significant changes have been made during restorations to the appearance of the Christ Pantocrator mosaic, but there is general agreement that changes have not been significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cormack|first=Robin|year=2008|title=Rediscovering the Christ Pantocrator at Daphni|jstor=20462776|journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes|volume=71|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christ is surrounded by sixteen Prophets at the base of the dome, between the windows that illuminate Christ as the dominant figure in the church. The prophets are wearing ancient garments and hold a parchment containing text proclaiming the glory of Christ or the [[Second Coming]].

[[File:Final_pictures_Christ_in_the_Apse.jpg|thumb|Christ Pantocrator]]
On the [[pendentives]] there are four scenes from the life of Christ. The [[Crucifixion]] scene shows three figures: Christ on the cross, with Mary and Saint John are at the foot of the cross, one on each side. The figures are arranged in the shape of a triangle against the empty golden background. Each figure is separate and unified with the other figures. This balanced arrangement is similar to the way Greek sculptors placed their figures in the pediments of temples. The figure of St. John is depicted in a bending position, with his weight on one leg – a pose used by Greek sculptors. The body of Christ is depicted in a classic, athletic style, but unlike Greek sculpture, the anatomy is not true to life. The faces of Saint John and the Madonna have the flatness and heavy lines of the Byzantine style, but they express the calm of Greek statues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "the ensemble represents a visualization of the Christian [[cosmos]], its effect created by an intricately conceived interplay of pictures and architecture. Space in fact fuses the decoration into one giant image, in which the ruler, hailed by the prophets surrounding him, presides in his sphere above the host of saints that people the lower part of the room."

Other important mosaics include: Prayers of Joachim and Anna, Annunciation of Joachim, The Virgin with Anna, Annunciation of the Mother of God, The Baptism of Christ, The Washing of the Disciples, Entering Jerusalem, Christ at the Last Supper, The Crucifixion, The Resurrection, Dormition of the Mother of God, Angel to Receive the Mother of God, Prophet Sophonia, St. Bacchus.

Byzantine art often survives as an ecclesiastical art. The Daphni Monastery was built during a period of [[Macedonian Renaissance|renaissance in culture and art]] and a return to classical traditions. The figures in the mosaics are more naturalistically represented, and they blend more smoothly into their surroundings&lt;ref name="Setton409"&gt;''The Latins in Greece and the Aegean from the Fourth Crusade to the End of the Middle Ages'', K. M. Setton, ''The Cambridge Medieval History:Vol IV, The Byzantine Empire'', ed. J.M. Hussey, D.M. Nicol and G. Cowan, (Cambridge University Press, 1966), 409.&lt;/ref&gt; The decoration of the monastery is inspired by the spirit of the times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Faces are dematerialized, austere and depicted with unemotional expressions. The bodies are heavy and rigid, common characteristics in depicting the icons of the Bishops, Monks and the Martyrs. The pictorial perspective, the figure styles and gestures, the modeling of the figures along with simplicity of design, and the dazzling splendor of color reflecting from the gold and silver tesserae distinguish the Daphni mosaics among the mosaics of the eleventh and twelfth centuries as particularly grand specimens of Byzantine art in general.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Dragon Awards''' are fan-voted awards that "recognize outstanding achievement in science fiction and fantasy literature, comics, gaming and filmed entertainment". They are given out annually at [[Dragon Con]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] since 2016.&lt;ref name="dragon-awards-20160331"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Dragon Con|title=The Dragon Awards|url=http://awards.dragoncon.org/2016/03/31/the-dragon-awards/|date=March 31, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award process consists of two steps: a nomination step where each voter nominates one work of choice in each category, and a voting step where the finalists selected from the nominated works are voted on by each voter. The nominations and votes are collected electronically. Participation is available to everyone, requiring no membership or other fees to vote.&lt;ref name="dragon-awards-pr-20160404"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Official Press Release|publisher=Dragon Con|url=http://awards.dragoncon.org/2016/04/04/official-press-release/|date=April 4, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Controversy''':
The Dragon Awards have been criticized in Science-Fiction and fantasy fandom because of the appearance that the awards were created in conjunction with campaigns by the Rabid and [[Sad Puppies]] to attack the [[Hugo Award]], giving the impression that Dragon Con as a convention is itself aligned with these campaigns. &lt;ref&gt;http://corabuhlert.com/2016/09/06/the-2016-dragon-awards-or-participation-trophies-for-puppies/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics, such as bloggers "Camestros Felapton", Mike Glyer of File 770, and their commenters,&lt;ref&gt;http://file770.com/2018-dragon-awards-ballot/comment-page-1/&lt;/ref&gt; have noted that the Dragon Awards process is not transparent, but "opaque".&lt;ref&gt;https://camestrosfelapton.wordpress.com/category/dragon-awards/&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Dragon Awards process, "The Dragon Awards reserves the right to invalidate suspect or questionable ballots without notice." Language describing the review of nominations does not state that nominations are counted numerically but are "gathered and reviewed to create a final ballot."&lt;ref&gt;http://awards.dragoncon.org/faq/fan-faq/&lt;/ref&gt; Neither counts of nominations nor votes have ever been made public. The system for voting is done by email and unprotected Survey Monkey, and is easily subject to mass voting campaigns, whether by self-promoting authors, or by organized political groups. In its first year, the Dragon Awards lined up with the slate promoted by [[Vox_Day|Vox Day]]&lt;ref&gt;https://camestrosfelapton.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/the-obligatory-dragon-awards-post/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, nominated authors, Allison Littlewood, [[John Scalzi]], and [[N.K. Jemisin]]  asked Dragon Con to remove their names from the ballot. John Scalzi then reconsidered and kept his name on the ballot. The Dragon Awards initially refused to remove authors names, and received criticism across blogs and Science-Fiction related publications. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jimchines.com/2017/08/dragon-awards/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16118054/john-scalzi-alison-littlewood-dragon-awards-controversy-sci-fi-horror&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://nkjemisin.com/2017/08/withdrawing-from-the-dragon-awards/&lt;/ref&gt;


There are currently fifteen categories for the awards.

By the famous bronzier [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]], c. 1810.]]

A '''French Empire-style mantel clock''' is a type of elaborately decorated [[mantel clock]] made in France during the [[Napoleonic Empire]] between 1804–1814/15, although the timekeepers manufactured throughout the [[Bourbon Restoration]] (1814/1815–1830) are also included within this [[art movement]] since they share subject, decorative elements, shapes and style.

==Precedents==
Already by the end of the 18th century, from the mid-1770s on, the French clocks participated of a new art movement; the [[Neoclassicism]]. The predominant style in architecture, painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts, that had come into its own during the last years of Louis XV's life, chiefly as a reaction to the excesses of the Rococo but partly through the popularity of the excavations at ancient [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]], in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349146/Louis-XVI-style|title=Louis XVI style|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the clocks also did without the excessive ornamentation and overelaborate designs of the preceding [[Rococo]] style so typical of the [[Louis XV]] reign.

The timekeepers manufactured both over the [[Louis XVI]] and the [[French First Republic]] historical periods incorporated this new artistic language with classical designs, allegories and motifs. In the case of the Louis XVI pieces, stone (usually white marble, alabaster or biscuit) was combined with gilded and/or patinated bronze, although certain cases were completely cast in bronze. Some models were architectural (i.e., with no figures) while others displayed classical-style figurines.

During the 1790s, the production of gilded-bronze considerably increased as working conditions became easier. The freedom of trade initiated by the [[French Revolution]] allowed many casters, who during the ancien régime worked in workshops strictly limited to making bronze, to develop large factories. They took advantage of this opportunity to execute all stages of bronze making within one factory and drew, cast, gilded, assembled and sold objects of their own workshops.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/20079738 Charlotte Vignon, ''Deverberie &amp; Cie: Drawings, Models, and Works in Bronze'' (2003): p. 170. Cleveland Studies in the History of Art. Vol. 8]&lt;/ref&gt;
Artisans still benefited from pre-Revolution training and worked according to the standards of a luxury art from the ancien régime, but they had better means of production and organization.

==Characteristics==
===Materials and techniques===
{{double image|left|Sketch of a French Empire mantel clock.jpg|170|Empire clock sketch.jpg|190|Two sketches representing; an allegory of "Music" on the left and the "Genius of Arts" on the right.}}

The use of [[gilt-bronze]] to make luxury goods could be argued to have reached its peak at the beginning of the 19th century in France. This medium was not new, as it had enjoyed international reputation in Europe since the reign of [[Louis XIV]] that continued during the entire [[ancien régime]]. One reason for this success is the technical qualities inherent in bronze. Cheaper than gold and silver, it is a common material easy both to mold and ennoble by gilding with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. For this reason, it became the favorite material for clock cases, candelabra and furniture ornaments. Thanks to the skill of remarkable bronze casters and chasers these objects were not merely timekeepers, but became [[objets d'art]].

This golden age ended about 1830, when the generation of craftsmen and laborers died out,&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; cheaper metals started to be more increasingly used (e.g. [[brass]]) and bronze casting entered into a higher [[mechanization]], sacrificing craftsmanship in furtherance of productivity and reduction in costs and manufacturing time.

In the Empire style timepieces, [[bronze]] was the main material used and both the patinated and specially [[ormolu]] techniques were extensively used, reaching its zenith during this age.&lt;ref name="zaandam.klokkenmuseum.info"/&gt; Indeed, the fine modeling, gilt and patina finishes used in these series-produced pendulum clocks are matchless. Most cases were totally cast in bronze and others combined with a stone base made of [[marble]], [[alabaster]] or [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]. However, wood (mahogany or fruit wood) and carved [[crystal]] (the latter used during the Restoration) were (less frequently) employed too.

During this period there were between 40 and 60 workshops with founders, gilders, silverers, and chasers in Paris.&lt;ref name="www.uhrenaktuell.de"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uhrenaktuell.de/empire-zaandam/Empire_Pendules-Catalogue.pdf |format=PDF |author=Pier Van Leeuwen |title=Empire-style mantel clocks: A golden dream in timepieces'' (2003): p. 2 exhibition catalogue}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders usually made a wax model from a draft and from this wax model a negative plaster cast was made, which could be reproduced more often. Then using this plaster cast a mould was made, in which the bronze was cast. By combining figures and mountings several versions of one design were produced.

[[File:Protective mask.jpg|thumb|A sort of mask used to protect the gilder from the poisonous [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] fumes.]]
Due to exposure to the harmful [[mercury (element)|mercury]] fumes caused during the ''"dorure au mercure"'' ([[fire-gilding]]) process, unfortunately most gilders did not survive beyond 40 years of age as a consequence of [[mercury poisoning]]. Even in those days, they took all kind of precautions, in particular chewing bread, better companies gave them a piece of leather to be placed over the tongue then a silver coin on it and at the end of the day the coin had "turned" to gold, there was also a kind of mask devised to inhale the air from behind the head, but none of these measures were in any way sufficient.

This provoked that the use of this hazardous chemical element was outlawed by the French legislation after around 1830, although continued to be commonly employed until circa 1900 and even was still in use around 1960 in very few workshops. To replace ormolu, other gilding techniques (like [[electroplating]] from the mid-19th century on) were utilized instead.

Regarding the mechanism, towards the end of the 18th century, round clock movements became a reliable mass-produced product. Known as ''"Pendule de Paris"'' (Paris, or French, clock movements), they were an 8-day movement with anchor escapement, silk thread suspended pendulum with a count wheel striking on a bell every hour and half-hour. By the 1840s the simple and very effective silk suspension was being replaced by various adjustable spring suspension systems.

It is necessary to emphasize that unlike the clocks built in the 18th century, where the majority of them were signed, the authorship in many of the Empire ones remain anonymous, making it difficult to attribute one particular work to a certain bronze sculptor. To this must be added that it was a common practice among bronziers selling pieces to each other and even to copy or readapt others' designs. When signed, they usually bear the name on the dial and could be the bronzier's name as well as the retailer's name or the movement maker.

A small clock, usually covered by a glass bell, could cost 150 [[francs]] and 7.000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alte-spieluhren.de/empire_pendulen_feuervergoldete_bronzeskulpturen.htm#Marmor|title=Feuervergoldete Bronzeskulpturen der französischen Pendulen des Empire 1796 - 1830|work=alte-spieluhren.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; francs for the biggest works intended to decorate the halls of palaces and big houses. The total price comprised the work of the different people involved in its manufacturing process:
* About 10% for the model design.
* Casting, 20%.
* Chiseling, 30%.
* Gilding, 30%.
* The movement only represented between 5 and 10%.
This meant that about 90% of the production costs were the sculpture and the case making.

===Style and design===
[[File:George Washington French Empire mantel clock.jpg|left|thumb|C. 1810-1815 piece presenting [[George Washington]] in full military dress. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]

The clocks were manufactured following the style then in vogue, the [[Empire style]], a phase within the Neoclassical scope, based on the classical antiquity art; both the ancient Greece and specially the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="zaandam.klokkenmuseum.info"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zaandam.klokkenmuseum.info/ |title=Pier Van Leeuwen, Empire mantel clocks: A golden dream in timekeepers |year=2003 |publisher= zaandam.klokkenmuseum.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were a great diversity of case shapes, the most common and popular ones were the clocks with a rectangular or oblong base sustained by four (or more) legs of different forms and patterns. The [[pedestal]] front was normally decorated with either garlands, acanthus tendrils, acroterions, laurel wreaths, scrolls, flowers and other classical decorative motifs, or depicting finely chased mythological and allegoric scenes in relief as a [[frieze]] of a Greek-Roman temple. On top of the base (in the center or to one side) sat the plinth that accommodated the clock dial, however in other models it was also placed in cart wheels, rocks, shields, globes, tree trunks, etc.

These timekeepers were embellished with fine bronze figures of art, sciences, and high ideals allegories, gods, goddesses, muses, cupids, classical literary heroes and other allegorical or mythological compositions. Sometimes historical personages such as [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[George Washington]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], philosophers and classical authors, were the main theme as well. Hence they are also known as figural or sculptural clocks (rather than architectural).

[[File:French Empire mantel clock.jpg|thumb|An 1822 clock depicting the [[nereid]] [[Acis and Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]], [[Catherine Palace]]. The respective allegoric composition in relief of the frieze, represents the [[Galatea (Raphael)|"Triumph of Galatea"]], based on the homonymous [[fresco]] by [[Rafael Sanzio]].]]
Likewise, another of the sculptor's source of inspiration for the composition of a certain design were both [[classical sculpture]]s and celebrated paintings. Examples of the first one include the [[Sleeping Ariadne]] and [[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]] by [[Antonio Canova]] or Psyche crowning Amor after a model by Claude Michallon. In painting can be quoted the [[Oath of the Horatii]] by [[Jacques-Louis David]], Héro et Léandre by Pierre-Claude-François Delorme, etc.

The classical gods served as models and symbols for the era. For instance, the [[chariot clock]]s or "''pendules au char''" were an exceptional category within the Empire clocks. Apollo, Diana and Cupid depicted as triumphant chariot drivers, were the most popular gods used. It was habitual during the Napoleonic times and particularly under the ''"Directoire"'' and ''"Consulat"'' regimes that clocks glorify the conduct of warfare.&lt;ref name="www.uhrenaktuell.de"/&gt;

More domestic and romantic subjects, like the "temple of love", gained popularity after the downfall of the Napoleon's Empire. During the Restoration (1815–1830) the representation of warfare scenes was not as common as in the early Empire.

Finally, under the reign of [[Charles X]] (1824–1830), the case designs started gradually to develop away from a proportionate and strict [[classicism]] towards a baroque style which announced the [[eclecticism]] and [[historicism (art)|historicisms]] in forms, so typical, on the other side, of the rest of the 19th century. That's why during the second half of that century and early 20th, among all of the different revival styles of mantel clocks available; Rococo, Louis XVI, etc., timepieces in the Empire style were made as well, normally they were replicas or adaptations based on preexisting models.

Empire clocks in general and the largest and most notable examples in particular from the top bronziers, such as [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]], Claude Galle, [[André-Antoine Ravrio]], Louis-Stanislas Lenoir-Ravrio, etc., are considered more than just clocks. They are [[works of art]] as well, sculptural études, where the balance in composition and the study of objects, animals and the human bodies forms and expressions are carefully and meticulously reflected in the bronze figures, achieving a high degree of realism, perfectionism and delicacy.

These timepieces were devised to decorate the console tables or mantelpieces of a given hall or room in [[palaces]], European and American [[mansions]], houses, offices, etc. Today many of them are part of royal collections and can be seen in palaces, official residences, embassies, ministries, museums all over the world, etc.

Even nowadays a few companies replicate this style, proving that the attention to detail, exquisite taste, superb workmanship, elegance and refinement achieved by the different artists and craftsmen involved in its manufacturing, are everlasting and timeless alike.

'''Harry Stendhal'''  is an American gallerist and arts organization founder.   As an art dealer he operated the Stendhal gallery in the [[Soho (Manhattan)|Soho]] section of [[New York City]] and then the Maya Stendhal Gallery in [[Chelsea (Manhattan)|Chelsea]] section of New York City (in partnership with his sister Maya) and exhibited among other artists; the painters [[Ron English (artist)|Ron English]] and Rick Prol, the [[Dada]]ist [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]]&lt;ref&gt;http://1995-2015.undo.net/it/mostra/40027&lt;/ref&gt; and the Fluxus group members [[Ken Friedman]] and [[Larry Miller (artist)|Larry Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=AOkCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=harry+stehndhal+ron+english&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T8r3ZVNbhq&amp;sig=-q6W2jhUdV0SL6okyVebFsc-Rd0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB4YGY6ZLRAhWl1IMKHTWHBzAQ6AEIIjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=harry%20stehndhal%20ron%20english&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www.artnet.com/magazine/news/jones/jones10-7-03.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artsjournal.com/artopia/2009/10/ken_friedman_99_events.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.art-agenda.com/shows/fluxus-to-george-with-love-at-maya-stendhal-gallery/&lt;/ref&gt; During the second incarnation of his gallery he became ensnared in a legal imbroglio with the filmmaker and visual artist [[Jonas Mekas]]. Therein the then octagenarian accused the gallerist of selling his artwork without his consent and or reimbursement for among other things as an avenue for Stendhal to cover his tab at [[Cipriani]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nypost.com/2010/07/13/stendhal-is-rogues-gallery-suit/amp/?client=ms-android-att-us&lt;/ref&gt; The  case was eventually settled.&lt;ref&gt;http://thevillager.com/villager_100/alifetimeofcuttingedge.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

After exhibiting George Macunias' work at his now closed commercial gallery he  opened the foundation in 2011. &lt;ref&gt;http://georgemaciunas.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization which runs a gallery space purpose' is to exhibit the entire inter-disciplinary body work of [[George Maciunas]] the  Lithuanian born co-founder of the [[Fluxus]] art movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/finding-yoko-onos-new-york/2015/05/07/26b0668e-ea9f-11e4-aae1-d642717d8afa_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Stendhal's exhibitions of Maciunas' work have been covered by among others [[Anthony Haden-Guest]] in the [[Financial Times]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f9f6e33a-b62c-11da-9cbb-0000779e2340.html?ft_site=falcon&amp;desktop=true#axzz4UDlXe5qk&gt;

In 1991 the Soho gallery hosted a benefit organized for the charity [[God's Love We Deliver]] which brings meals to homebound people with Aids and other serious illnesses organized by late fashion photographer [[Francesco Scavullo]] and featuring men's suits by such designers as [[Issac Mizrahi]], [[Todd Oldham]] and [[Romeo Gigli]] which were then embellished (painted upon) by such artists as [[Ronnie Cutrone]] and  Ron Enlish.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/18/style/chronicle-198891.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Stendhal himself is a presence on the New York City social scene whose events draw press coverage as does his goings on about town.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/legacy/socialdiary/2005/05_13_05/socialdiary05_13_05.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patrickmcmullan.com/site/search.aspx?t=person&amp;s=Harry+Stendhal&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hippocampus''' or '''hippocamp,''' also ''hippokampoi'' (plural: hippocampi or hippocamps; {{lang-el|ἱππόκαμπος}}, from {{lang|el|ἵππος}}, "horse" and {{lang|el|κάμπος}}, "sea monster"&lt;ref name="dictionary.com"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hippocampus Word origin of ''Hippocampus''] at [[reference.com]]; compare the nameless monster [[Campe]].&lt;/ref&gt;), often called a '''sea-horse'''&lt;ref&gt;The hyphen  distinguishes from the [[seahorse]], a real [[fish]].&lt;/ref&gt; in English, is a mythological creature shared by [[Phoenicia]]n&lt;ref name= "IAA"&gt;Israel Antiquities Authority, [http://www.antiquities.org.il/hoards_eng.asp Yizre'el Valley silver hoard] (retrieved Jan 10 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]], and [[Greek mythology]], though its name has a Greek origin. The hippocampus has typically been depicted as having the upper body of a [[horse]] with the lower body of a [[fish]].

==Mythology==


Coins minted at [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] around the 4th century BC show the patron god [[Melqart]] riding on a winged hippocampus and accompanied by dolphins.&lt;ref name= "IAA" /&gt; Coins of the same period from [[Byblos]] show a hippocampus diving under a galley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/stater-of-byblos-with-galley-3024 Stater of Byblos with galley | Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coinarchives.com/a/results.php?results=100&amp;search=Byblos Byblos at NumisBids]&lt;/ref&gt;

A gold sea-horse was discovered in a hoard from the kingdom  of [[Lydia]] in [[Asia minor]], dating to the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Waxman, ''Loot: The Battle over the Stolen Treasures of the Ancient World,'' Chapter 6; [https://web.archive.org/web/20081210070246/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Loot-Chasing-the-Lydian-Hoard.html excerpt in ''Smithsonian''], Nov. 14, 2008 (retrieved Jan 10 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek and Roman===
[[File:Roman Baths, Bath - Sea Horse Mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|237px|Hippocampus in Roman mosaic in the [[thermae]] at [[Aquae Sulis]] ([[Bath, Somerset|Bath]])]]

In the ''[[Iliad]]'', [[Homer]] describes [[Poseidon]], god of horses, earthquakes, and the sea, drawn by [[brass|brazen]]-hoofed horses over the sea's surface,&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''[[Iliad]]'' xlii. 24, 29;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], describes the horse of Poseidon emerging from the sea and galloping across the [[Libya]]n sands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' (iv.1353ff)&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to the specifically "two-hoofed" hippocampi of [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]] in his ''Argonautica'': "[[Orion (mythology)|Orion]] when grasping his father’s reins heaves the sea with the snorting of his two-hooved horses."&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Flaccus, ''Argonautica'' 2.507.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] imagery, however, Poseidon (or Roman [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]) often drives a sea-[[chariot]] drawn by hippocampi. Thus hippocampi sport with this god in both ancient depictions and much more modern ones, such as in the waters of the 18th-century [[Trevi Fountain]] in Rome surveyed by Neptune from his [[niche (architecture)|niche]] above.

The appearance of hippocampi in both [[freshwater]] and [[seawater|saltwater]] is counter-intuitive to a modern audience, though not to an ancient one. The Greek picture of the natural [[hydrological cycle]] did not take into account the condensation of atmospheric water as rain to replenish the [[water table]], but imagined the waters of the sea oozing back landwards through vast underground [[cavern]]s and [[aquifer]]s, rising replenished and freshened in springs.&lt;ref&gt;This made credible the mythic undersea passage of the fountain nymph [[Arethusa (mythology)|Arethusa]] from Greece to [[Sicily]]. The summary given of the ancients' view of the hydrological cycle is outlined by the Roman Epicurean [[Lucretius]]'  ''[[On the Nature of Things|De rerum natura]]'' (vi.631-38).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piazza di trevi - fontana di trevi hippocampus crop.jpg|thumb|right|267px|[[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]s and ''winged'' hippocampi in the [[Trevi Fountain]], Rome]]

Thus it was natural for a temple at [[Helike]] in the coastal plain of [[Achaea]] to be dedicated to ''Poseidon Helikonios'', (the Poseidon of Helicon), the sacred spring of [[Mount Helicon|Boeotian Helikon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]]: "The sea was raised by an earthquake and it submerged [[Helike]] and also the temple of Poseidon Helikonios..." (''Geography'' 8.7.2).&lt;/ref&gt; When an earthquake suddenly submerged the city, the temple's bronze Poseidon accompanied by hippocampi continued to snag fishermens' nets.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Eratosthenes]], noted by Strabo (''loc. cit.'').&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, the hippocampus was considered an appropriate decoration for [[mosaics]] in Roman [[thermae]] or public baths, as at [[Aquae Sulis]] modern day [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in Britannia (''illustration, below'').

Poseidon's horses, which were included in the elaborate sculptural program of gilt-bronze and [[ivory]], added by a Roman client to the temple of Poseidon at [[Corinth]], are likely to have been hippocampi; the Romanised Greek [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] described the rich ensemble in the later 2nd century AD (''Geography of Greece'' ii.1.7-.8):

===Etruscan===
Hippocampi appear with the first Oriental-phase of [[Etruscan civilization]]: they remain a theme in Etruscan tomb wall-paintings and reliefs,&lt;ref&gt;Etruscan sea creatures, including a range of hippocampi, are set in cultural context and ordered by typology in Monika Boosen, ''Etruskische Meeresmischwesen: Untersuchungen zur Typologie u. Bedeutung'' (''Archaeologica'' 59) (Rome:Bretschneider) 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  where they are sometimes provided with wings, as they are in the Trevi fountain. Katharine Shepard found in the theme an Etruscan belief in a sea-voyage to the other world.&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Shepard, ''The Fish-Tailed Monster in Greek and Etruscan Art'', 1940, pp 25ff; the thesis was, exceptionally, reviewed (by G.W. Elderkin) in ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''45'''.2  (April 1941), pp. 307-308: available on-line through JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pictish===
The sea-horse also appears in [[Pictish Stones|Pictish stone carvings]] in Scotland.  The symbolism of the carving (also known as "[[Pictish Beast]]") is unknown. Although similar  but not identical to Roman sea-horse images, it is unclear whether this depiction originates from images brought over by the Romans, or had a place in earlier [[Pict]]ish mythology.&lt;ref name="Hilgarth"&gt;Nigella Hillgarth, Birch Aquarium at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, [http://scrippsblogs.ucsd.edu/onboard/2010/01/08/seahorses-in-myth-legend-art/Seahorses in Myth, Legend &amp; Art]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, January 8, 2010 (retrieved January 10, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval and Renaissance, and Modern===
[[File:Complete Guide to Heraldry Fig364.png|thumb|200px|The "sea-horse" in medieval heraldry was a legendary creature that was part horse and part fish, not to be confused with the later heraldic ''hippocampus'', which was a natural [[seahorse]].]]
[[File:Hippocampus, Dublin.jpg|thumb|Hippocampuses in [[Dublin]], Ireland.]]
The mythic hippocampus has been used as a [[Charge (heraldry)|heraldic charge]], particularly since the Renaissance, most often in the [[armorial bearings]] of people and places with maritime associations.  However, in a [[blazon]], the terms ''hippocamp'' and ''hippocampus'' now refer to the real animal called a ''seahorse'', and the terms ''seahorse'' and ''sea-horse'' refer to the mythological creature.  The above-mentioned fish hybrids are seen less frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, Arthur Charles. ''Complete Guide to Heraldry'', 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea-horse is also a common image in Renaissance and post-renaissance art, for example, in the [[Trevi fountain]], dating to 1732.

A winged hippocampus has been used as a symbol for [[Air France]] since its establishment in 1933 (inherited from its predecessor [[Air Orient]]); it appears today on the engine [[nacelle]]s of Air France aircraft.

Bronze hippocampoi appear in [[Dublin]], [[Leinster]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on lampposts next to a statue of [[Henry Grattan]] and on [[Grattan Bridge]].

==Capricornus and related mythical animals==
Closely related to the hippocampus is the "sea goat", represented by [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], a mythical creature with the front half of a [[goat]] and the rear half of a fish. Canonical figures, most of which were not themselves [[cult image]]s, and coins of the [[Caria]]n goddess associated with [[Aphrodite]] as the ''[[Aphrodisias|Aphrodite of Aphrodisias]]'' through ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'', show the goddess riding on a sea-goat.&lt;ref name ="Imhoof-Blümer"&gt;Imhoof-Blümer, ''Kleinasiatische Müntzen'' plate IV, no 14, noted in Elderkin 1941:307&lt;/ref&gt;  Brody describes her thus:&lt;ref name="brody"&gt;Lisa R. Brody, under the direction of Christopher Ratté, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030923074738/http://www.geocities.com/lisa_brody/diss.htm "The Iconography and Cult of the Aphrodite of Aphrodisias"] (dead link- archive version [https://web.archive.org/web/20030923074738/http://www.geocities.com/lisa_brody/diss.htm here]), New York University, Institute of Fine Arts, 1999. ([https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Iconography_and_Cult_of_the_Aphrodit.html?id=FIyNHAAACAAJ google books link])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|text=... a semi-nude female figure appears riding on a sea-goat, accompanied by a dolphin and a Triton. This is the goddess Aphrodite herself, shown here not in her distinctive local guise but in a more traditionally Hellenistic style. She is the marine aspect of Aphrodite, known to the Greeks as ''Aphrodite Pelagia''&amp;nbsp;.... She rides on a fantastic marine creature with the body and tail of a fish and the forepart of a goat. This sea-goat moves to the right and turns his head back to look at the goddess. This group also appears on Aphrodisian coins from the 3rd century A.D.}}

Aside from ''aigikampoi'', the fish-tailed goats representing Capricorn,&lt;ref name ="Imhoof-Blümer" /&gt; other fish-tailed animals rarely appeared in Greek art, but are more characteristic of the Etruscans. These include ''leokampoi'' (fish-tailed [[lion]]s), ''taurokampoi'' (fish-tailed [[bull]]s) or ''pardalokampoi'' (fish-tailed [[leopard]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Ther/Hippokampoi.html ''Ippokampoi''] at Theoi Project (retrieved Jan. 11, 2013); see also Booson 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judy Chicago''' (born '''Judith Sylvia Cohen'''; July 20, 1939) is an American [[feminist art]]ist, art educator,&lt;ref&gt;Chicago, Judy. (2014). ''Institutional Time.'' The Monacelli Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and writer known for her large collaborative [[art installation]] pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first [[feminist art]] program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as [[needlework]], counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as [[welding]] and [[pyrotechnics]]. Chicago's most well known work is ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', which is permanently installed in the [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]. ''The Dinner Party'' celebrates the accomplishments of women throughout history and is widely regarded as the first epic feminist artwork. Other notable art projects by Chicago include ''[[International Honor Quilt]]'', ''The Birth Project,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Birth-Project-Judy-Chicago/dp/0385187106|title=The Birth Project|last=Chicago|first=Judy|date=1985-03-05|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=9780385187107|edition=First|location=Place of publication not identified|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Powerplay,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Judy-Chicago-PowerPlay/dp/0983931232|title=Judy Chicago PowerPlay|last=Chicago|first=Judy|last2=Gallery|first2=David Richard|last3=Katz|first3=Jonathan D.|date=2012|isbn=9780983931232|location=Santa Fe, NM}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Holocaust Project.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Holocaust-Project-Darkness-Into-Light/dp/0670842125|title=Holocaust Project: From Darkness Into Light|last=Chicago|first=Judy|last2=Woodman|first2=Donald|date=1993-10-01|publisher=Viking|isbn=9780670842124|edition= 1st|location=New York, N.Y., U.S.A u.a|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early personal life==

Judy Chicago was born Judith Sylvia Cohen&lt;ref name="A305"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 305&lt;/ref&gt; in 1939, to Arthur and May Cohen, in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Her father came from a twenty-three generation lineage of [[rabbi]]s, including the [[Vilna Gaon]]. Unlike his family predecessors, Arthur became a [[labor organization|labor organizer]] and a [[Marxist]].&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; He worked nights at a post office and took care of Chicago during the day, while May, who was a former dancer, worked as a [[medical secretary]].&lt;ref name="A305"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; Arthur's active participation in the [[American Communist Party]], liberal views towards women and support of worker's rights strongly influenced Chicago's ways of thinking and belief.&lt;ref name="A306"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 306&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[McCarthyism]] era in the 1950s, Arthur was investigated, which made it difficult for him to find work and caused the family much turmoil.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; In 1945, while Chicago was alone at home with her infant brother, Ben, an [[FBI]] agent visited their house. The agent began to ask the six-year-old Chicago questions about her father and his friends, but the agent was interrupted upon the return of May to the house.&lt;ref name="A306"/&gt; Arthur's health declined, and he died in 1953 from [[peritonitis]]. May would not discuss his death with her children and did not allow them to attend the funeral. Chicago did not come to terms with his death until she was an adult; in the early 1960s she was hospitalized for almost a month with a bleeding ulcer attributed to unresolved [[grief]].&lt;ref name="F279"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

May loved the arts, and instilled her passion for them in her children, as evident in Chicago's future as an artist, and brother Ben's eventual career as a [[pottery|potter]]. At age of three, Chicago began to draw and was sent to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] to attend classes.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt;&lt;ref name="W5"&gt;Wydler and Lippard, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 5, Chicago knew that she "never wanted to do anything but make art"&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; and started attending classes at the Art Institute of Chicago.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;  She applied but was denied admission to the Art Institute,&lt;ref name="A306"/&gt; and instead attended [[UCLA]] on a scholarship.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt;

==Education and early career==

While at UCLA, she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA [[NAACP]]  chapter and eventually became its corresponding secretary.&lt;ref name="A306"/&gt; In June 1959, she met and became romantically linked with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple [[hitch hike]]d to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her.&lt;ref name="A308"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 308&lt;/ref&gt; The couple lived in [[Greenwich Village]] for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961.&lt;ref name="A311"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 311&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in 1962 and was a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, devastating Chicago and causing her to suffer from an [[identity crisis]] until later that decade. She received her [[Master of Fine Arts]] from UCLA in 1964.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt;

While in grad school, Chicago's created a series that was [[abstract art|abstract]], yet easily recognized as male and female [[sexual organs]]. These early works were called ''Bigamy,'' and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract [[human penis|penis]], which was "stopped in flight" before it could unite with a [[vagina|vaginal form]]. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works.&lt;ref name="A311"/&gt; Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes.

In 1965, Chicago displayed work in her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles; Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show.&lt;ref name="Illustrated Career History"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chicago|first=Judy|title=Illustrated Career History|url=http://www.judychicago.com/about/career-history.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227074456/http://www.judychicago.com/about/career-history.php|archivedate=2014-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the "California Women in the Arts" exhibition at the [[Lytton Center]], to which she answered, "I won't show in any group defined as Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday when we all grow up there will be no labels." Chicago began working in [[ice sculpture]], which represented "a metaphor for the preciousness of life," another reference towards her husband's death.&lt;ref name="A314"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 314&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pasadenalifesaversstudy.jpg|thumb|right|''Study for Pasadena Lifesavers,'' prismacolor, 1968.]]

In 1969, the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] exhibited a series of Chicago's spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an "experimental" gallery. ''[[Art in America]]'' noted that Chicago's work was at the forefront of the [[conceptual art]] movement, and the ''Los Angeles Times'' described the work as showing no signs of "theoretical New York type art."&lt;ref name="A314"/&gt; Chicago would describe her early artwork as [[minimalist]] and as her trying to be "one of the boys".&lt;ref name="L455"&gt;Lewis and Lewis, 455.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago would also experiment with [[performance art]], using [[fireworks]] and [[pyrotechnics]] to create "atmospheres", which involved flashes of coloured smoke being manipulated outdoors. Through this work she attempted to "feminize" and "soften" the landscape.&lt;ref name="A315"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 315&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' which was a series of abstract paintings that placed [[acrylic paint]] on [[Plexiglas]]. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes "turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle," representing her own discovery that "I was [[orgasm|multi-orgasmic]]." Chicago credited ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women's sexuality and representation.&lt;ref name="A315"/&gt;

===From Cohen to Gerowitz to Chicago: Name change===

As Chicago made a name for herself as an artist and came to know herself as a woman, she no longer felt connected to her last name, Cohen. This was due to the late grief of the death of her father and the lost connection to her name through marriage, Judith Gerowitz, after her husband's death. She decided she wanted to change her last name to something independent of being connected to a man by marriage or heritage.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; During this time, she married sculptor [[Lloyd Hamrol]], in 1965. (They divorced in 1979.)&lt;ref name="F280"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery owner [[Rolf Nelson]] nicknamed her "Judy Chicago"&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; because of her strong personality and thick [[Chicago accent]]. She decided this would be her new name, and sought to change it legally. She changed her last name from an ethnically charged, Gerowitz, to an ethnically neutral Chicago. In doing so, she freed herself from a certain social identity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jewish Identity in Modern Art History|last=Soussloff|first=Catherine|publisher=U of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago was described as being "appalled" by the fact that she had to have her new husband's signature on the paperwork to change her name legally.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; To celebrate the name change, she posed for the exhibition invitation dressed like a [[boxer]], wearing a [[sweatshirt]] with her new last name on it.&lt;ref name="A315"/&gt; She also posted a banner across the gallery at her 1970 solo show at [[California State University, Fullerton|California State University at Fullerton]], that read: "Judy Gerowitz hereby divests herself of all names imposed upon her through male social dominance and chooses her own name, Judy Chicago."&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; An advertisement with the same statement was also placed in ''[[Artforum]]'s'' October 1970 issue.&lt;ref name=Levin2007p139&gt;[[#SrcLevin2007|Levin, ''Becoming Judy Chicago; A Biography of the Artist'', p. 139]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic career==

===The feminist art movement and the 1970s===
In 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at [[Fresno State College]], hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work.&lt;ref name="A317"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 317&lt;/ref&gt; At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape "the presence and hence, the expectations of men."&lt;ref name="A318"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 318&lt;/ref&gt; She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the [[Feminist Art Program]], a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, [[Vanalyne Green]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], Cay Lang, [[Karen LeCocq]], Jan Lester, [[Chris Rush]], Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, [[Faith Wilding]], Shawnee Wollenman, [[Nancy Youdelman]], and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed $25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851420315|title=Institutional time : a critique of studio art education|last=1939-|first=Chicago, Judy,|isbn=9781580933667|oclc=851420315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]] reestablished the [[Feminist Art Program]] at [[California Institute of the Arts]]. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by [[Joyce Aiken]] in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.{{refn|Aiken opened the all-women's [[co-op]] [[Gallery 25]] with her students, developed the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100 and the Distinguished Women Artist Series, which helped develop programming and exhibitions about women at the museum.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Laura Meyer |author2=Nancy Youdelman | year= | title=A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Art Experiment | work=A Studio of their Own | publisher= | url=http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/legacy.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

Chicago is considered one of the "first-generation feminist artists," a group that also includes [[Mary Beth Edelson]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], and [[Rachel Rosenthal]]. They were part of the [[Feminist art movement]] in Europe and the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|United States]] in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Thomas Patin and Jennifer McLerran | title=Artwords: A Glossary of Contemporary Art Theory |location=Westport, CT | publisher=Greenwood | year=1997 |page=55 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/27960870 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago became a teacher at the [[California Institute for the Arts]], and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created [[Womanhouse]], alongside [[Miriam Schapiro]], which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; With [[Arlene Raven]] and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]], Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles [[Woman's Building]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Woman's Building records, 1970-1992 | work=[[Archives of American Art]] | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/womans-building-records-6347/more#biohist | accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/Judy_Chicago#biography|title=Judy Chicago|website=SFMOMA|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as "an experimental program in female education in the arts.  Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women."&lt;ref name="L455"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moravec|first=Michelle|title=Looking For Lyotard, Beyond the Genre of Feminist Manifesto|journal=Trespassing|date=2013|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://trespassingjournal.com/Issue2/TPJ_I2_Moravec_Article.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with [[geometric]] forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the "feminine". Chicago was strongly influenced by [[Gerda Lerner]], whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of [[women's history]] would continue to struggle independently and collectively.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt;

===Womanhouse===
{{main|Womanhouse}}
Womanhouse was a project that involved Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]]. It began in the fall of 1971. They wanted to start the year with a large scale collaborative project that involved woman artists who spent much of their time talking about their problems as women. They used those problems as fuel and dealt with them while working on the project. Judy thought that female students often approach art-making with an unwillingness to push their limits due to their lack of familiarity with tools and processes, and an inability to see themselves as working people. 
"The aim of the Feminist Art Program is to help women restructure their personalities to be more consistent with their desires to be artists and to help them build their art-making out of their experiences as women."&lt;ref name=Schapiro&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schapiro|first1=Miriam|last2=Chicago|first2=Judy|title=Womanhouse catalog essay|url=http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|publisher=Womanhouse|accessdate=7 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611044304/http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|archive-date=11 June 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Womanhouse is a "true" dramatic representation of woman's experience beginning in childhood, encompassing the struggles at home, with housework, menstruation, marriage, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1975, Chicago's first book, ''Through the Flower'', was published; it "chronicled her struggles to find her own identity as a woman artist."&lt;ref name="Illustrated Career History" /&gt;

===''The Dinner Party''===
[[File:Judy Chicago The Dinner Party.JPG|thumb|right|''[[The Dinner Party]]'' as installed at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
{{Main|The Dinner Party}}

Chicago decided to take Lerner's lesson to heart and took action to teach women about ''their'' history. This action would become Chicago's [[masterpiece]], ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', now in the collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref name="BM1"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=The Dinner Party | work=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art | publisher=Brooklyn Museum | url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/index.php | accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took her five years and cost about $250,000 to complete.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; First, Chicago conceived the project in her [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] studio: a large triangle, which measures 48-feet by 43-feet by 36-feet, consisting of 39 [[place setting]]s.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; Each place setting commemorates a historical or mythical female figure, such as artists, goddesses, activists and martyrs. The project came into fruition with the assistance of over 400 people, mainly women, who volunteered to assist in [[needlework]], creating sculptures and other aspects of the process.&lt;ref name="F281"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 281.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''The Dinner Party'' was first constructed it was a traveling exhibition. Through the Flower, her non-profit organization, was originally created to cover the expense of the creation and travel of the artwork. Jane Gerhard dedicated a book to Judy Chicago and ''The Dinner Party'', entitled "The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and The Power of Popular Feminism, 1970-2007".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.throughtheflower.org|title=Through the Flower and Judy Chicago|website=www.throughtheflower.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many art critics including Hilton Kramer from The New York Times, who were unimpressed by her work.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/insider/judy-chicago-dinner-part-art-reviews-times.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Kramer felt Judy's intended vision was not conveyed through this piece and "it looked like an outrageous libel on the female imagination".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Although art critics, felt her work lacked depth and the dinner party was just "vaginas on plates", it was popular and captivated the general public. Chicago was able to debut her work in 6 countries on 3 different continents. She was able to reach over a million people through her artwork. Her piece of work may not have agreed with critics but was able to captivate the public with her feminist message and honor the 39 historical figures and 999 other women featured in her work.

===''Birth Project'' and ''PowerPlay''===

From 1980 until 1985, Chicago created ''Birth Project''. It took five years to create. The piece used images of [[childbirth]] to celebrate woman's role as mother. Chicago was inspired to create this collective work because of the lack of imagery and representation of birth in the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/08/style/judy-chicago-women-s-lives-and-art.html|title=JUDY CHICAGO: WOMEN'S LIVES AND ART|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|date=1985-04-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-11|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation reinterpreted the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which focused on the idea that a male [[god]] created a male human, [[Adam]], without the involvement of a woman.&lt;ref name="F281"/&gt; Chicago described the piece as revealing a "primordial female self hidden among the recesses of my soul...the birthing woman is part of the dawn of creation."&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; 150 needleworkers from the United States, [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] assisted in the project, working on 100 panels, by [[quilting]], [[macrame]], [[embroidery]] and other techniques. The size of the piece means it is rarely displayed in its entirety. The majority of the pieces from ''Birth Project'' are held in the collection of the [[Albuquerque Museum]].&lt;ref name="F281"/&gt;

Chicago was not personally interested in motherhood. While she admired the women who chose this path, she did not find it right for herself. As recently as 2012, she said, "There was no way on this earth I could have had children and the career I've had."&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooke|first=Rachel|title=The art of Judy Chicago|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/04/judy-chicago-art-feminism-britain|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Birth Project'', Chicago returned to independent studio work. She created ''PowerPlay,'' a series of drawings, [[weaving]]s, paintings, [[cast paper]] and bronze [[reliefs]]. Through the series, Chicago replaced the male [[gaze]] with a feminist one, exploring the construct of masculinity and how power has affected men.&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2012 | title=Judy Chicago | work= | publisher=Jewish Virtual Library | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/jchicago.html | accessdate=15 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A new kind of collaboration and ''The Holocaust Project''===

In the mid-1980s Chicago's interests "shifted beyond 'issues of female identity' to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust."&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Judy Chicago in the UK | author=Galit Mana | journal=[[Jewish Renaissance]] |date=October 2012 | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' (1985–93)&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; is a collaboration with her husband, photographer [[Donald Woodman]], whom she married on [[New Year's Eve]] 1985. Although Chicago's previous husbands were both [[Jewish]], it wasn't until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage.  Chicago met poet Harvey Mudd, who had written an [[epic poem]] about the [[Holocaust]]. Chicago was interested in illustrating the poem, but decided to create her own work instead, using her own art, visual and written. Chicago worked alongside her husband to complete the piece, which took eight years to finish.&lt;ref name="F281"/&gt; The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life: the death of her brother Ben, from [[Lou Gehrig's disease]], and the death of her mother from [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="F282"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago used the tragic event of the Holocaust as a prism through which to explore victimization, oppression, injustice, and human cruelty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To seek inspiration for the project, Chicago and Woodman watched the documentary ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', which comprises interviews with Holocaust survivors at  [[Nazi concentration camps]] and other relevant Holocaust sites.&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; They also explored photo archives and written pieces about the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="W6"/&gt; They spent several months touring concentration camps and visited [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; Chicago brought other issues into the work, such as [[environmentalism]], [[Native American genocide]],&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; and the [[Vietnam War]]. With these subjects Chicago sought to relate contemporary issues to the moral dilemma behind the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; This aspect of the work caused controversy within the Jewish community, due to the comparison of the Holocaust to these other historical and contemporary concerns.&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' consists of sixteen large scale works made of a variety of mediums including: [[tapestry]], [[stained glass]], metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the [[sewing]] of [[Audrey Cowan]]. The exhibit ends with a piece that displays a Jewish couple at [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. The piece comprises 3000 square feet, providing a full exhibition experience for the viewer.&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' was exhibited for the first time in October 1993 at the [[Spertus Museum]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; Most of the work from the piece is held at the [[Holocaust Center (Pittsburgh)|Holocaust Center]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="F284"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next six years, Chicago created works that explored the experiences of concentration camp victims.&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; Galit Mana of ''Jewish Renaissance'' magazine notes, "This shift in focus led Chicago to work on other projects with an emphasis on Jewish tradition", including ''Voices from the Song of Songs'' (1997), where Chicago "introduces feminism and female sexuality into her representation of strong biblical female characters."&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt;

===Current work and life===

In 1985, Chicago was remarried, to photographer Donald Woodman. To celebrate the couple's 25th wedding anniversary, Chicago created a "Renewal Ketubah" in 2010.&lt;ref name="Illustrated Career History" /&gt;

In 1994, Judy Chicago started "Resolutions: A Stitch in Time" which took 6 years to complete. The public audience later got to see this project at the Museum of Art and Design in New York in 2000.&lt;ref name="Judy Chicago"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/judy-chicago-9246631|title=Judy Chicago|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Chicago and Woodman moved into the historic [[Belen Hotel]], an historic railroad hotel in [[Belen, New Mexico]] which Woodman had spent three years converting into a home.&lt;ref name="Judy Chicago"/&gt;

Chicago's archives are held at the [[Schlesinger Library]] at [[Radcliffe College]], and her collection of women's history and culture books are held in the collection of the [[University of New Mexico]]. In 1999, Chicago received the UCLA Alumni Professional Achievement Award, and has been awarded [[honorary degree]]s from [[Lehigh University]], [[Smith College]], [[Duke University]]&lt;ref name="JWE"&gt;{{cite web | author=Debra Wacks | year=2012 | title=Judy Chicago | work= | publisher=Jewish Women's Archives | url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/chicago-judy | accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russell Sage College]].&lt;ref name="F284"/&gt; In 2004, Chicago received a Visionary Woman Award from [[Moore College of Art &amp; Design]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite web|title=Visionary Woman Awards|url=http://www.moore.edu/support_moore/visionary_woman_awards|work=Support Moore|publisher=Moore College of Art &amp; Design|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chicago was named a [[National Women's History Project]] honoree for [[Women's History Month]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="NWHP"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2008 | title=Judy Chicago | work=2008 Honorees | publisher=National Women's History Month Project | url=http://nwhp.org/whm/chicago_bio.php | accessdate=15 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago donated her collection of feminist art educational materials to [[Penn State University]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Judy Chicago Art Education Collection {{!}} Penn State|url = http://judychicago.arted.psu.edu/|website = judychicago.arted.psu.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="PSU"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Penn State Receives Judy Chicago Feminist Art Education Collections | work=Local News | publisher=Gant Daily | url=http://gantdaily.com/2011/06/12/penn-state-receives-judy-chicago-feminist-art-education-collections/ | accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2011, Chicago returned to Los Angeles for the opening of the "Concurrents" exhibition at the [[Getty Museum]]. For the exhibition, she returned to the [[Pomona College]] football field, where in the late 1960s she had held a firework-based installation, and performed the piece again.&lt;ref name="LAT1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jori Finkel | year=2011 | title=Q&amp;A Judy Chicago | work=Censorship | publisher=Los Angeles Times | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/30/entertainment/la-ca-pst-judy-chicago-and-rebecca-mcgrew-2-20111030 | accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago had two solo exhibitions in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2012, one in [[London]] and another in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; The Liverpool exhibition included the launch of Chicago's book about [[Virginia Woolf]]. Once a peripheral part of her artistic expression, Chicago now considers writing to be well integrated into her career.&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; That year, she was also awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Palm Springs Art Fair.&lt;ref name="Judy Chicago"/&gt;

Chicago strives to push herself, exploring new directions for her art; she even attended car-body school to learn to air-brush and has recently begun to work in glass.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; Taking such risks is easier to do when one lives by Chicago's philosophy: "I'm not career driven. [[Damien Hirst]]'s dots sold, so he made thousands of dots. I would, like, never do that! It wouldn't even occur to me."&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; Chicago's subject matter, however, has broadened from the focus of ''The Dinner Party''. In the words of the artist: "I guess you could say that my eyes were lifted from my vagina."&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;

Chicago has permanent collections in numerous museums around the world. Those include, [[The British Museum]], [[The Brooklyn Museum]], The [[Getty Trust]], The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], [[New Mexico Museum of Art]], [[The National Gallery of Art]], [[The National Museum of Women in the Arts]], The [[Penn Academy of the Fine Arts]], and The [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artstor.org/content/judy-chicago|title=Judy Chicago {{!}} Artstor|website=www.artstor.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her interview with [[Gloria Steinem]], Chicago spoke of her "goal as an artist", stating that it "…has been to create images in which the female experience is the path to the universal, as opposed to learning everything through the male gaze."&lt;ref&gt;"Judy Chicago" by Gloria Steinem, December/January 2018 issue of "Interview", pp. 28-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and work==
Chicago trained herself in "macho arts," taking classes in auto body work, [[boat building]], and pyrotechnics. Through auto body work she learned [[spray painting]] techniques and the skill to fuse color and surface to any type of media, which would become a signature of her later work. The skills learned through boat building would be used in her sculpture work, and pyrotechnics would be used to create [[fireworks]] for performance pieces. These skills allowed Chicago to bring [[fiberglass]] and [[metal]] into her sculpture, and eventually she would become an apprentice under [[Mim Silinsky]] to learn the art of porcelain painting, which would be used to create works in ''The Dinner Party''. Chicago also added the skill of [[stained glass]] to her artistic tool belt, which she used for ''The Holocaust Project''.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; Photography became more present in Chicago's work as her relationship with photographer Donald Woodman developed.&lt;ref name="W6"&gt;Wylder and Lippard, 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2003, Chicago has been working with [[glass]].&lt;ref name="PSU"/&gt;

Collaboration is a major aspect of Chicago's installation works. ''The Dinner Party'', ''The Birth Project'' and ''The Holocaust Project'' were all completed as a collaborative process with Chicago and hundreds of volunteer participants. Volunteer artisans skills vary, often connected to "stereotypical" women's arts such as [[textile arts]].&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; Chicago makes a point to acknowledge her assistants as collaborators, a task at which other artists have notably failed.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerhard|first1=Jane|title=The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and the power of popular feminism. 1970-2007|date=2013|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|isbn=0-8203-3675-0|pages=2, 228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Through the Flower==

In 1978, Chicago founded [[Through the Flower]], a non-profit feminist art organization. The organization seeks to educate the public about the importance of art and how it can be used as a tool to emphasize women's achievements. Through the Flower also serves as the maintainer of Chicago's works, having handled the storage of ''The Dinner Party,'' before it found a permanent home at the Brooklyn Museum. The organization also maintained The Dinner Party Curriculum, which serves as a "living curriculum" for education about feminist art ideas and [[pedagogy]]. The online aspect of the curriculum was donated to [[Penn State University]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="PSU"/&gt;

==Teaching career==

Judy Chicago became aware of the sexism that was rampant in modern art institutions, museums, and schools while getting her undergraduate and graduate degree at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in the 1960s. Ironically, she didn’t challenge this observation as an undergrad. In fact, she did quite the opposite by trying to match -- both in her artwork and in her personal style --  what she thought of as masculinity in the artistic styles and habits of her male counterparts. Not only did she begin to work with heavy industrial materials, but she also smoked cigars, dressed “masculine”, and attended motorcycle shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chicago|first=Judy|last2=Meyer|first2=Laura|date=1995-12-28|title=Judy Chicago, Feminist Artist and Educator|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/j015v17n01_13|journal=Women &amp; Therapy|volume=17|issue=1-2|pages=125–140|doi=10.1300/j015v17n01_13|issn=0270-3149}}&lt;/ref&gt; This awareness continued to grow as she recognized how society did not see women as professional artists in the same way they recognized men. Angered by this, Chicago channeled this energy and used it to strengthen her feminist values as a person and teacher. While most teachers based their lessons on technique, visual forms, and color, the foundation for Chicago’s teachings were on the content and social significance of the art, especially in [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keifer-Boyd|first=Karen|date=January 2007|title=From Content to Form: Judy Chicago's Pedagogy with Reflections by Judy Chicago|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00393541.2007.11650096|journal=Studies in Art Education|volume=48|issue=2|pages=134–154|doi=10.1080/00393541.2007.11650096|issn=0039-3541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stemming from the male-dominated art community Chicago studied with for so many years, she valued art based on research, social or political views, and/or experience. She wanted her students to grow into their art professions without having to sacrifice what womanhood meant to them. Chicago developed an art education methodology in which "female-centered content," such as menstruation and giving birth, is encouraged by the teacher as "[[The personal is political|personal is political]]" content for art.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago, Judy, (n.d.). ''Art Practice/Art Pedagogy'', Judy Chicago Art Education Collection, Penn State, Box 11, Folder 6, page 1 at http://judychicago.arted.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Art-Practice-Art-PedagogyTranscript-and-Slide-Presentation-Boxx-11-6.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago advocates the teacher as facilitator by actively listening to students in order to guide content searches and the translation of content into art. She refers to her teaching methodology as "participatory art [[pedagogy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Keifer-Boyd, K. (2007). From content to form: Judy Chicago's pedagogy with reflections by Judy Chicago. Studies in Art Education: A Journal of Issues and Research in Art Education, 48(2), 133-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

The art created in the [[Feminist Art Program]] and [[Womanhouse]] introduced perspectives and content about women’s lives that had been taboo topics in society, including the art world.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Jill (Ed.). (2012). ''Entering the picture: Judy Chicago, The Fresno Feminist Art Program, and the collective visions of women artists''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard, Jane F. (2013). ''The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and the power of popular feminism. 1970-2007''. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Chicago developed the [[Feminist Art Program]] at California State University, Fresno, and has implemented other teaching projects that conclude with an art exhibition by students such as [[Womanhouse]] with [[Miriam Schapiro]] at CalArts, and ''SINsation'' in 1999 at Indiana University, ''From Theory to Practice: A Journey of Discovery'' at Duke University in 2000, ''At Home: A Kentucky Project with Judy Chicago and Donald Woodman'' at Western Kentucky University in 2002, ''Envisioning the Future'' at California Polytechnic State University and Pomona Arts Colony in 2004, and ''Evoke/Invoke/Provoke'' at Vanderbilt University in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago, Judy. (2014)  Institutional Time: A Critique of Studio Art Education. New York, NY: Monacelli Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Several students involved in Judy Chicago’s teaching projects established successful careers as artists, including [[Suzanne Lacy]], [[Faith Wilding]], and [[Nancy Youdelman]].

In the early 2000s, Chicago organized her teaching style into three parts preparation, process, and art-making.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each has a specific purpose and is crucial. During the preparation phase, students identify a deep personal concern and then research that issue. In the process phase, students gather together in a group to discuss the materials they plan on using and the content of their work. Finally, in the art-making phase, students find materials, sketch, critique, and produce art.

Pagodas were created in India using earth, then in China using wood, which spread to the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], and then Japan; however, the pagoda tradition of [[East Asia]] diverged, with China creating pagodas using bricks, Korea creating pagodas using stone, and Japan continuing to use wood.&lt;ref name="stone pagoda"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yu|first1=Hong-jun|title=Smiles of the Baby Buddha: Appreciating the Cultural Heritage of Ky?ngju|publisher=창비 Changbi Publishers|isbn=9788936470562|pages=26–28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrNxoKa-SQoC&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sinha|first1=P.

Korean stone pagodas were first created in [[Baekje]] during the early 7th century and then inherited by [[Later Silla]]; 90% of the pagodas in Later Silla were made of stone.&lt;ref name="stone pagoda" /&gt; The stone pagoda tradition was propagated by the great abundance of high quality granite in Korea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sinha|first1=P.

[[Goryeo]], a devoutly Buddhist state, also inherited the stone pagoda tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jinyoung|first1=Lim|last2=Lyong|first2=Ryoo Seong|title=K-architecture: Tradition Meets Modernity|publisher=길잡이미디어|isbn=9788973755820|pages=35–36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C_xpBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of Korean wood pagodas are the [[Hwangnyongsa|Hwangnyongsa Pagoda]] and [[Palsangjeon]] of Silla.

'''Käthe Fanny Schuftan''' (12 January 1899 – 21 February 1958) was a German Jewish artist whose paintings and drawings expressed both human suffering and the aspiration of spirit,&lt;ref&gt;Tribute given at her funeral by [[Eugene Halliday]], {{cite web|url=http://www.eugenehalliday.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Halliday-Review-Winter-2012-2013-Vol-2-Issue-2.pdf|title=Halliday Review Winter 2012–2013|accessdate=1 February 2015}} p. 21 (22 of pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid 20th century. Josef Paul Hodin wrote that she "worked in an Expressionist style reminiscent of [[Käthe Kollwitz]]' social pathos".&lt;ref name="Hodin"&gt;Josef Paul Hodin, "[[John Milne (sculptor)|John Milne]]: sculptor, life and work", London: Latimer New Dimensions 1977, Section 2, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt; An artist at the time of the [[Weimar culture]], she was tortured and imprisoned by the Nazis in the early 1930s, and her work was destroyed. She escaped in 1939, arriving in [[Manchester]], England, not long before the outbreak of the [[World War II]]; she lived and worked there until her death in 1958.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;Obituary, by [[Margo Ingham]], ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'', 24 February 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breslau==
Käthe Fanny Schuftan was born on 12 January 1899 in [[Breslau]], now [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]; her father was the chemist Dr. Georg Schuftan, her mother Else née Mugdan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archeion.net/repo/82/1425/PL_82_1425_0_0_337/index.djvu|title=Archiwum Państwowe we Wrocławiu, sygn. 1425 (Standesamt Breslau I), seria 1 (Geburtenregister), 1899, tom 1|accessdate=1 February 2015}} Nr. 88, p. 49/206 in DejaVu version&lt;/ref&gt; The chemist [[Paul Schuftan]] was her older brother.

==Berlin==
In Berlin, Käthe Schuftan and her younger sister Lotte were involved in underground activities of the SAP.&lt;ref name="Urteil"&gt;de Gruyter online database ''National Socialism, Holocaust, Resistance and Exile 1933–1945'', {{cite web|url=http://db.saur.de/DGO/basicFullCitationView.jsf?documentId=wh41|title=Urteil 2H 20/34 – 8J 1713/33|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1933, she was detained and tortured by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] at the former Volkshaus (People's House) in [[Berlin]]-[[Charlottenburg]],&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Rainer Sandvoß, ''Die "andere" Reichshauptstadt: Widerstand aus der Arbeiterbewegung in Berlin von 1933 bis 1945'', Berlin: Lukas 2007, pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.klausenerplatz-kiez.de/archive/2011/09/19/rede_zur_einweihung_der_stele|title=Dr. Heinrich-Wilhelm Wörmann, Rede zur Einweihung der Stele zur Erinnerung an das Volkshaus Charlottenburg am 10.

Schuftan arrived in [[Manchester]], England in June 1939.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; During the war years she worked in a munitions factory.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; Her obituary stated that after the war she earned her living at commercial art. She had two one-person shows of her work and exhibited in group exhibitions in Manchester.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; Schuftan befriended the young [[John Milne (sculptor)|John Milne]] who later went on to work as an assistant to [[Barbara Hepworth]] before making his own career.&lt;ref name="Hodin" /&gt; Her work was selected for the annual exhibition of the [[Manchester Academy of Fine Arts]] three times between 1940–1942.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Academy of Fine Arts Exhibition Catalogues 1940, 1941, 1942, Manchester City Art Gallery Archive&lt;/ref&gt; She exhibited with the [[Manchester Group]], which included [[L.

==Plot==
[[File: Las Meninas. Movie Set 2.jpg|thumb|left|230px|&lt;small&gt;[[Serhiy Mykhalchuk]] (DoP, left) and Ihor Podolchak. Movie set. 2006&lt;/small&gt;]]
The film is about what the routine of everyday life can do to the human mind and psyche. It also reflects on the importance of the choices we make and how limited these choices are in the first place. The plot evolves around a family of four. They live in the suburbs, in a strange villa that appears, through a complex game of mirrors, to be more like a piece of [[installation art]] than a real house. The main character, who hardly appears on screen, is the son, a man in his thirties. Suffering from [[asthma]] and [[eczema]] since childhood, he uses his condition to manipulate his parents and his sister.  Thus the existence of the terrorized family turns into an endless ritual of attempting to satisfy his whims, and always on the alert for yet another one of his “health crises”.
''Las Meninas'' resembles the scattered pieces of a [[puzzle]]. It is up to the viewer to assemble them in order to form his very own picture – something that makes the film itself personal and unique.

==Cast==

The idea for the script appeared in 2004, inspired by Doctor Janos Sanocky’s account of a case from his medical practice. The dialogue was co-written by the Lithuanian-Russian writer Andrey Levkin.
The shooting of the film took place between September 15 and October 24, 2006, in Kyiv. Most of the film was shot through the mirrors,&lt;ref name="format.ua"&gt;[http://format.ua/index.php?go=Articles&amp;in=11&amp;id=87 ''Художник Ігор Подольчак та його кіно'']. format.ua Retrieved November 4, 2009 {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which caused serious difficulties for the director of photography, since there was a permanent challenge for the crew to avoid getting into the shot.
Editing, effects, color correction, and rendering of the film took 14 months. All post-production work except for rendering was done by Ihor Podolchak himself. ''Las Meninas'' was the first feature film in Ukraine created entirely with the [[Digital intermediate]] process.&lt;ref name="AJA"&gt;[http://www.aja.com/news/index_article.php?id=33 AJA KONA 3 Enables Post Production for ''Las Meninas''] aja.com Retrieved November 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the music in the film was written for cello and piano by composer [[Alexander Shchetynsky]]. Director and composer paid attention to the central role of music as a semantic counterpoint to the dialogue and visual imagery, so the sound level of the film can be viewed as an integral sound installation. American video clip director [[Dean Karr]] co-directed the music part of the film.

The Leningrad School.''- Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – pp.9, 27, 233, 295, 367, 386, 387, 390, 394-397, 400, 402, 404-406, 412, 414, 416-418, 420, 422, 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
'''Lev Nikolaevich Orekhov''' was born November 8, 1913, in the industrial city of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], located in Moscow region of the [[Russian Empire]].

In 1932, Orekhov entered at the first course of the painting department of the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]]. There, he studied under [[Boris Fogel]], [[Semion Abugov]], [[Genrikh Pavlovsky]].

In 1939, Lev Orekhov graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in [[Alexander Osmerkin]] workshop. His graduation work was a genre painting named ''A Rest of collective farmers in haymaking time during the lunch break''.&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915 - 2005''. - Saint Petersburg: Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007. p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1939, Lev Orekhov participated in art exhibitions. He painted portraits, landscapes, still-life, genre scenes, and sketches from the life. In 1950s, he was most famous for his [[Crimea]] etudes done from nature, later for summer landscapes and genre scenes of Russian countryside life.

In the 1950s, Lev Orekhov painted plein air, with special attention to lighting and tonal relationships. He painted with an accented stroke. In the 1960s, his style morphed towards more decorative and graphic quality of painting. His drawing and composition become more abstract.

Since 1946, Lev Orekhov was a member of the [[Leningrad Union of Artists|Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists]]. He died on November 6, 1992 in Saint Petersburg. His paintings reside in museums and private collections in Russia, France, England, the U.S., Italy, and other countries.

"Barnard's images speak of the fleeting nature of political power and the often makeshift working environments that lurk beyond the gaze of the TV camera or the official portrait."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/28/chateau-despair-photography-margaret-thatcher | date = 28 February 2013 | accessdate = 21 December 2014 | first = Sean | last = O'Hagan | authorlink = Sean O'Hagan (journalist) | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | title = How Margaret Thatcher's HQ turned into Chateau Despair}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chateau Despair'' was included in critic [[Sean O'Hagan (journalist)|Sean O'Hagan]]'s list of "The best independent photobooks of 2013" in ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Sean O'Hagan | authorlink = Sean O'Hagan (journalist) | url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography-blog/2013/dec/13/best-independent-photobooks-2013 | title = The best independent photobooks of 2013 | date = 13 December 2013 | website = [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Statesman]] made it their Picture Book Of The Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/cultural-capital/2013/02/picture-book-week-chateau-despair | date = 15 February 2013 | accessdate = 22 December 2014 | newspaper = [[New Statesman]] | title = Picture Book Of The Week: Chateau Despair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the group exhibition ''Theatres of War'', curated by [[Mark Power]] in 2007, "Barnard documented the tragically tacky 'care packages' dispatched to American troops stationed abroad". [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]], reviewing the exhibition in ''The Guardian'' explained Barnard's photographs by asking "how can soldiers who ask their families to send them Beanie Babies and whoopee cushions hope to understand the gangs of Islamic insurgents they are fighting?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/15/poland.peterconrad | date = 15 July 2007 | accessdate = 22 December 2014 | first = Peter | last = Conrad | authorlink = Peter Conrad (academic) | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | title = Modern wounds stir ghost of Schindler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnard's "complicated and intriguing multimedia project"&lt;ref name="photoworks-11"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = Bang bang You're Dead | first = Gordon | last = Macdonald | authorlink = Gordon MacDonald (editor) | journal = Photoworks Biannual | issue = 11 | publisher = [[Photoworks]] | isbn = 978-1903796283}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Virtual Iraq'' "examines the use of interactive media by the US army to recruit, train and treat military personnel before and after they embark on a tour of duty to the Middle East. It [...] explores the relationship between the US army, virtual reality and the gaming industry"&lt;ref name="eastbourne-herald"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/local/virtual-iraq-comes-to-school-1-1420348 | date = 11 September 2008 | accessdate = 21 December 2014 | newspaper = [[Eastbourne Herald]] | title = Virtual Iraq comes to school}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their Flatworld project. Barnard filmed it at the [[Institute for Creative Technologies]], "a research centre also funded by the military to create training applications using virtual reality in advanced technologies."&lt;ref name="photoworks-11" /&gt; [[Gordon MacDonald (editor)|Gordon MacDonald]], reviewing ''Virtual Iraq'' in ''Photoworks Biannual'',&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Gordon MacDonald's text, ''Bang bang You're Dead'', for Photoworks Biannual 11, is reproduced within Barnard's web site [http://lisabarnard.co.uk/essays/bang-bang-youre-dead-gordon-macdonald-photoworks-issue-11/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; said "Barnard’s project does not aim to direct you towards the ridiculous aspects of Flatworld or to point out the serious moral questions its existence raises. It achieves more than this by simply removing Flatworld from its context and holding all of its contradictions still to be viewed."&lt;ref name="photoworks-11" /&gt;

Her second book, ''Hyenas of the Battlefield, Machines in the Garden'', examines the use of drones in the [[War on Terror]].

Barnard was [[senior lecturer]] on documentary photography at [[University of South Wales]],&lt;ref name="uni-south-wales-bio" /&gt; then a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in photography there from 2017.

'''''Los Sueños''''' (''Dreams'' or ''Visions'') is a [[satirical]] prose work by the Spanish Baroque writer [[Francisco de Quevedo]]. Written between 1605 and 1622, it was first published in [[Barcelona]] in 1627 under the title ''Sueños y discursos de verdades descubridoras de abusos, vicios y engaños en todos los oficios del mundo'' ("Dreams and discourses on truths revealing abuses, vices and deceptions in all the professions and estates of the world").&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the English translation (''Dreams'') by R.K. Britton (Aris &amp; Phillips, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Los Sueños'' consists of five sections, each describing a satirical dream vision of the next world:
#''El Sueño del Juicio Final'' ("The Dream of the Last Judgement")
#''El Alguacil Endemoniado'' ("The Bedevilled Constable")
#''Sueño del Infierno'' ("The Vision of Hell")
#''El Mundo por de dentro'' ("The World from the Inside")

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38982">'''Body shape''' refers to the many physical attributes of the [[human body]] that make up its appearance, including size and countenance. [[Body shape]] has come to imply not only sexual/reproductive ability, but [[Wellness (medicine)|wellness]] and [[physical fitness|fitness]]. In the [[Western culture|West]], slenderness is associated with happiness, success, youth, and social acceptability. Being [[overweight]] is associated with laziness. The media promote a weight-conscious standard for women more often than for men.&lt;ref name="Sex Roles"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Silverstein, Perdue, Peterson, and Kelly|title=The role of the mass media in promoting a thin standard of bodily attractiveness for women|journal=Sex Roles|year=1986|volume=14|issue=9–10|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/rn84077187531j83/|accessdate=11 April 2012|doi=10.1007/BF00287452|pages=519–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Deviance from these norms result in social consequences.&lt;ref name=SG&gt;{{cite book|last=Grogan|first=Sarah|title=Body Image Understanding body dissatisfaction in men, women, and Children|year=2008|publisher=Psychology Press|edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media perpetuate this ideal in various ways, particularly glorifying and focusing on thin actors and actresses, models, and other public figures while avoiding the use or image of overweight individuals. This [[The Thin Ideal|thin ideal]] represents less than 5% of the American population.&lt;ref name="Summary Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAESAR: Summary statistics for the adult population (ages 18–65) of the United States of America|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA406674|accessdate=17 March 2012|last1=Harrison|first1=C.R. |last2=Robinette|first2=K.M. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been stated that the increase in [[eating disorder]]s over the past several decades has coincided with an overall decrease (pound-wise) in women's [[ideal body weight]] portrayed by the [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="No Longer Just a Pretty Face" /&gt; A group of researchers examined the magazines [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]], [[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]], [[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]], and [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] from 1959 to 1999.  [[Fashion model]]s became increasingly thinner during the 1980s and 1990s, making [[The Thin Ideal|the thin ideal]] even more difficult for women to achieve.  Photos depicting the models' entire bodies significantly increased in number from the 1960s to the 1990s.  From 1995 to 1999 models were dressed in far more revealing outfits than they were from 1959 to 1963.&lt;ref name="No Longer Just a Pretty Face"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sypeck|first=Mia Foley|author2=Gray, James J. |author3= Ahrens, Anthony H.|title=No Longer Just a Pretty Face: Fashion Magazines' Depictions of Ideal Female Beauty from 1959 to 1999|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|date=November 2004|volume=36|issue=3|pages=342–347|pmid=15478132|doi=10.1002/eat.20039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's magazine]]s have been criticized for their conflicting messages, with an emphasis on [[food]], [[cooking]], [[child rearing]], and entertaining.  75% of women's magazines contain at least one ad or article about how to alter one's appearance through [[cosmetic surgery]], [[Dieting|diet]], or [[exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Malkin, Wornian, Chrisler|title=Women and Weight: Gendered Messages on Magazine Covers|journal=Sex Roles|year=1999|volume=40|doi=10.1023/A:1018848332464|pages=647–655}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25% of the women's magazines surveyed included tips for dieting or messages about weight loss.  Many women's magazines focus on how to lead a better life by improving physical appearance.  Megenta magazine released an article on "How to dress for your body type" giving tips and tricks to look the best in an outfit while striving to encourage women to feel comfortable in their skin.&lt;ref name="Magenta Magazine"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://magentamagazine.co.za/health_beauty/dressing-for-your-body-type-tips-tricks-with-style-by-loren/|title=How to dress for your body type - Magenta Magazine|date=2018-02-02|work=Magenta Magazine|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magenta Magazine"/&gt; Men's magazines provide information about hobbies, activities, and entertainment in order for men to better their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty and Body Image in the Media |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118094138/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm |archivedate=2009-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the research pertaining to how the media effects body image examines the change in models and magazine articles over time. Garner, Garfinkel, Schwartz, and Thompson paid particular attention to the difference in body shape of Playboy centerfolds over a 20-year period. They found that over the years, the body mass, bust, and hip measurements decreased; however, the height increased.  They also determined that the Playboy centerfolds were 13%-19% lower than the normal body weight for women of their age (Cusumano, Thompson 1997). Other studies found that over the years, magazines like Seventeen, YM, and Cosmopolitan all had an increase in articles pertaining to diet and exercise. Anderson and DiDomenico (1992) compared women's and men's popular magazines and found that diet and exercise articles appeared more than 10 times as much in women's magazines than men's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthpsych.psy.vanderbilt.edu/2009/BodyImageMedia.htm|title=Effects of the Media on Body Image|last=Kovar|first=Allie|date=30 April 2009|website=Vanderbilt Psychology Department|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
Modeling and fashion industries have come under fire in recent years for embracing and promoting an ultra-thin appearance, giving "unhealthy stigma".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/summer-rayne-oakes/the-skinny-of-fashions-body-image-issue_b_3308004.html|title=The Skinny of Fashion's Body-Image Issue|last=Oakes|first=Summer|date=22 May 2013|website=Huffington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a data research done by Might Goods using 3,000 models from 20 leading model agencies, 94% of the models are underweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mightygoods.com/underweight-fashion-models|title=94% of All Fashion Models are underweight|last=|first=|date=11 September 2017|website=Mighty Goods|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in a recent study conducted by Jennifer Brenner and Joseph Cunningham, it was observed that the majority of female models were underweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brenner|first=Jennifer B.|last2=Cunningham|first2=Joseph G.|date=1992-10-01|title=Gender differences in eating attitudes, body concept, and self-esteem among models|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00289949|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=27|issue=7-8|pages=413–437|doi=10.1007/BF00289949|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average American female fashion model begins working in the modeling business at ages 13–17 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/220912/average-age-for-models-to-start-in-the-business/|title=Models - average age for starting in the business {{!}} Survey 2011|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average female model in the United States weighs in ranging from 90 pounds to 120 pounds  and an average of 5'8" to 5'11" tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/maceyjforonda/street-style-surveys-what-are-the-ideal-stats-for-a-fashion|title=Street Style Surveys: What Are The Ideal Stats For A Fashion Model?|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the average weight of a female is 168.5 pounds, and the average height for females is 5'4".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm|title=FastStats|date=2017-08-14|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the AMA (American Medical Association), thin models on the catwalk as well as social media and fashion photography lead to unrealistic body expectations, which in turn could lead to eating disorders and other emotional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=Viewpoints&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=TopicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=42&amp;docId=GALE%7CEJ3010659244&amp;docType=Viewpoint+essay&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=OVIC&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CEJ3010659244&amp;topicId=00000000LVXR&amp;searchId=&amp;userGroupName=uiuc_oak&amp;inPS=true&amp;u=uiuc_oak&amp;authCount=1|title=Gale - Enter Product Login|website=go.galegroup.com|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the mass advertisement promoting thin body, plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery, women and young girls are being bombarded with this very idea of achieving thin body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://centerforchange.com/battling-bodies-understanding-overcoming-negative-body-images|title=Battling Our Bodies: Understanding and Overcoming Negative Body Images|last=Hawkins|first=Nicole|date=August 2014|website=Center For Change|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is being control by some countries such as Israel and France in which they regulate the body mass indexes of models and let the public know whether the ad images is manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/2017/9/6/16263360/lvmh-kering-skinny-model-ban|title=This isn't the answer to fashion's body image issues|last=Lieber|first=Chavie|date=6 September 2017|website=Racked|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photoshop is, "the altering (a photographic image) with Photoshop software or other image-editing software especially in a way that distorts reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/photoshop|title=Definition of PHOTOSHOP|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerie, the lingerie line for American Eagle, began the campaign Aerie Real in which models were no longer photoshopped. A 2016 study showed that some women showed a smaller decrease in body satisfaction when seeing the photos of women untouched in comparison to the greater decrease in body satisfaction when seeing previous photos that were retouched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Convertino|first=Alexandra D|last2=Rodgers|first2=Rachel F|last3=Franko|first3=Debra L|last4=Jodoin|first4=Adriana|title=An evaluation of the Aerie Real campaign: Potential for promoting positive body image?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1359105316680022|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|doi=10.1177/1359105316680022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many well-known magazines have been called out for photoshopping, a few examples being ''AdWeek, InStyle, Modeliste Magazine, and Fashion Magazine.'' Celebrities have recently commented on changes that were made of their photos by such magazines. In 2015, Zendaya, a current 21 year old actress, singer, and dancer, posted two pictures side by side of her magazine photoshoot calling out the changes that were made by the magazine, Modeliste Magazine. She stated that, "There are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/708613/zendaya-gets-photoshopped-singer-slams-magazine-for-promoting-unrealistic-beauty-ideals|title=Zendaya Slams Magazine for Photoshopping Her Pics|work=E!

Victoria's Secret puts on an annually televised Fashion Show in which its beautiful models walk down the runway in lingerie and latest releases for PINK, the clothing store of Victoria's Secret. In the televised showing, the models usually include how they prepared for the Fashion Show by showing clips of working out and dieting to prepare for the big day. A study published in 2013 analyzed the responses viewers were tweeting during the showing. Viewers discussed food, weight, eating disorders, and self-harm. The results of this study showed that vulnerable viewers could experience negative affect, or even engage in harmful behaviors, during or after viewing the show or others like it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-01|title=Suffering by comparison: Twitter users' reactions to the Victoria&amp;#x27;s Secret Fashion Show|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144513000594|journal=Body Image|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=648–652|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2013.05.001|issn=1740-1445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
In 28 [[primetime]] [[Situation comedy|situational comedies]] analyzed by researchers in 2002, 33% of the central female characters were below average weight.  As the thinness of a female character increased, the number of compliments she received from men did as well. Research has shown below average weight female characters are over represented, while above average weight female characters are underrepresented in situational comedies as compared to the norms of the US population. Primetime television shows that appeal to a primarily  [[female]] audience, such as [[Friends (TV series)|Friends]] or [[Ally McBeal]] are helmed by young, attractive, and thin women.  Extremely skinny or [[Emaciation|emaciated]] women are shown on [[fashion industry]] related shows, like [[House of Style]].&lt;ref name="Hegemonic Depictions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henriks|first=Alexandra|title=Examining the effects of hegemonic depictions of female bodies on television: a call for theory and programmatic research|journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication|date=9 November 2010|volume=19|issue=1|pages=106–123|doi=10.1080/07393180216550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male characters often negatively comment on average and above average weight females' body shapes and weights and audiences usually react by laughing.  Male characters are not immune to unfair representation.  33% of male characters were below average weight and 13% were above average weight.  By comparison, approximately 30% of men in the US are overweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Fouts, Gregory  |author2=Vaughan, Kimberely |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Television Situation Comedies: Male Weight, Negative References, and Audience Reactions|journal=Sex Roles|date=June 2002|volume=46|issue=11/12|pages=439–442|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vux1891n61umjl2g/|accessdate=9 March 2012|doi=10.1023/A:1020469715532}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2003 a study was conducted on ten top-rated American primetime fictional television programs.  33% of female television characters were underweight.&lt;ref name="Overweight and Obese"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Greenberg, Eastin, Hofschire, Lachlan, and Brownell|title=Portrayals of Overweight and Obese Individuals on Commercial Television|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=August 2003|volume=93|issue=8|url=http://www.yaleruddcenter.org/resources/upload/docs/what/bias/portrayals-of-overweight-and-obese-individuals.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2012|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.8.1342|pages=1342–1348|pmid=12893625|pmc=1447967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was done of 10 primetime television programs on each of the 6 major [[TV network]]s ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[UPN]], [[NBC]], and [[WB Television Network|WB]]) with the largest [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen audience ratings]] during the 1999–2000 season.  Of the 1018 characters on all of the shows 14% of females and 24% of males were overweight or obese.  These numbers represent less than half the percentage of overweight or obese males and females in the general population.  Overweight female characters were less likely to be considered attractive, display physical affection, or to connect with romantic partners.  Overweight males characters were less likely to interact with friends or romantic partners and less likely to talk about dating.  Overweight males characters were often shown eating.  These statistics are representative of the fat stigmatization present in many US television programs.&lt;ref name="Portrayals of Overweight and Obese Individuals on TV"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Greenberg, Eastin, Hofschire, Lachlan, and Brownell|title=Portrayals of Overweights and Obese Individuals on Commercial Televisions|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=August 2003|volume=93|issue=8|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.8.1342|pages=1342–1348|pmid=12893625|pmc=1447967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small number of fat female television characters that do exist are consistently depicted in relation to thinner, highly [[sexualized]] female characters.  These characters are used as props, against which thinner women are compared, judged and valued.

A study in Fiji showed that the introduction of western television had a detrimental effect on young women's perceptions and eating behaviors. Three fourths of the girls in the study reported feeling fat after prolonged exposure to western television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=A.E.|title=Television, disordered eating, and young women in Fiji: negotiating body image and identity during rapid social change|journal=Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry|date=2004|volume=28 4|pages=533–59|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, analysts sampled 135 scenes featuring overweight individuals from popular television programs and movies and coded for [[Anti-fat bias|anti-fat]] humor. The majority of anti-fat humor found was verbal and directed at the individual in their presence, with no regard for their feelings.&lt;ref name="Obesity TV/Movies"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Himes and Thompson|title=Fat Stigmatization in Television Shows and Movies: A Content Analysis|journal=Obesity|year=2007|volume=15|pages=712–718|url=http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/v15/n3/full/oby2007635a.html|issue=3|doi=10.1038/oby.2007.635}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-deprecation|Self-deprecating]] fat comments were much less common than those about or directed at another person.  Male character were three times more likely to engaged in fat commentary than female characters.  Media programs containing fat stigmatization content often are popular and have high ratings, suggesting that the general public finds it acceptable to overlook such remarks in the context of the story.&lt;ref name="Obesity TV/Movies" /&gt;

According to Renee Hobbs, EdD, associate professor of communications at Temple University, the average teen girl gets about 180 minutes of media exposure daily and only about 10 minutes of parental interaction a day. Girls often take drastic measures in an attempt to become like the media images they view. Many end up with very low self-esteem and dangerous eating disorders.  Elissa Gittes, MD, a pediatrician in the division of adolescent medicine at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh says "We're seeing girls at younger ages starting to be dissatisfied with their bodies, proactively trying to change them, and feeling like they need to emulate something different than what their bodies can do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/helping-girls-with-body-image#1|title=Helping Girls With Body Image|last=Heubeck|first=Elizabeth|date=|website=WebMD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games==
In 2009 a content analysis of 150 top-selling [[video game]]s found that games rated for children depicted female characters as significantly thinner than female characters in games rated for adults. Females in video games had significantly larger heads, but smaller chest sizes, waists, and hips than the average American woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martins, Williams, Harrison, and Ratan|title=A Content Analysis of Female Body Imagery in Video Games|journal=Sex Roles|year=2009|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9682-9|volume=61|pages=824–836}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a study showed that after playing video games, both female and male college-aged participants had significantly lower body esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlett|first=Christopher P.|last2=Harris|first2=Richard J.|date=2008-10-01|title=The Impact of Body Emphasizing Video Games on Body Image Concerns in Men and Women|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-008-9457-8|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=59|issue=7–8|pages=586–601|doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9457-8|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The muscular male body in mass media and video is the cause of many symptoms such as body dissatisfaction and body esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlelt|first=Christopher|date=2008|title=Meta-Analyses of the Effects of Media Images on Men's Body-image Concerns|url=https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2008.27.3.279|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume= 27|pages= 279–310|via=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, adolescent boys age 13-18 spend nine hours on average playing video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlett|first=Christopher|date=May 2008|title=The Impact of Body Emphasizing Video Games on Body Image Concerns in Men and Women|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-008-9457-8|journal=Sex Roles|volume= 59| issue = 7-8|pages= 586–601|via=Springer Link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to these unattainable avatars within video games lead to higher body dissatisfaction, and in turn lead to many other social and psychology problems. Garner reported that 41% of teenage 13–19 years old boys were found to be dissatisfied with their overall body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199702/body-image-in-america-survey-results|title=Body Image in America: Survey Results|last=Garner|first=David|date=1 February 1997|website=Psychology Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research done by Zeely Sylvia from Bridgewater State University found that: players who played game with character who had a more average body size and shape would display less  body esteem concern than players who played with unrealistic muscular body character. The research concludes that muscularity concerns play a large role in the construct of male body image, and may have a substantial influence on male body esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sylvia|first=Zeely|date=2013|title=Virtual Ideals|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1262&amp;context=undergrad_rev|journal=The Effect of Video Game Play On Male Body Image|volume= 9|pages= 165–166|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-fiction media==
In 2001, British newspaper ''The Independent'' wrote about the silhouette of American TV stars like [[Calista Flockhart]] and [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] and compared it to that of the women in Pop group [[Destiny's Child]] saying, "The lollipop silhouette long-favoured by the female stars of American sitcoms, which involves disproportionately large heads wobbling atop stick-thin bodies does not say rich and it doesn't say clever. It says take me to a clinic. The New Athleticism, however, sends out a rather different set of messages: strong, confident, independent woman."&lt;ref name=SG/&gt;

[[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[Richard Carmona]] speaks of obesity as the "terror within" and says "unless we do something about it, the magnitude of the dilemma will dwarf [[9/11|9–11]] or any other terrorist attempt." The news media has been criticized for its alarmist and overly dramatized reporting on the issue of weight and obesity.  By using key words such as "war" or "epidemic" in their reporting, the news media attracts greater attention to the issue.  News reports likely reinforce the stigma of fat bodies, linking them to disease and likening fatness to a health behavior instead of an inalterable trait.&lt;ref name="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.00399.x-i1/pdf"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saguy and Almeling|title=Fat in the Fire?

In September 2011 nationally syndicated columnist [[Michael Kinsley]], the founding editor of [[Slate (magazine)|Slate magazine]], wrote harshly critical remarks about [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] and his weight. Kinsley wrote "New Jersey Governor Chris Christie cannot be president: He is just too fat . . .why should Christie's weight be more than we can bear in a president? Why should it even be a legitimate issue if he runs? One reason is that a presidential candidate should be judged on behavior and character . . . Perhaps Christie is the one to help us get our national appetites under control. But it would help if he got his own under control first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michael|first=Kinsley|title=Requiem for a Governor Before He's in the Ring: Michael Kinsley|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-30/requiem-for-a-governor-before-he-s-in-the-ring-michael-kinsley.html|publisher=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's media==
A content analysis done of children's videos and books found that 72% of videos and 7.5% of books placed emphasis on physical attractiveness.  In 60% of videos, a character's love for another depends on physical appearance and attractiveness. Examples include [[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]], where the prince invites maidens to the ball to select a bride and [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]], where the Beast falls in love with Belle purely based upon her physical appearance.  In 72% of videos and 10% of books characters with thin bodies have desirable traits.  In 84% of videos and 10% of books female physical attractiveness is associated with kindness, sociability, and happiness.  While 60% of videos portray female thinness, only 32% show male muscularity.  No physical attraction is shown between a slender character and an obese character, with the exception of Beauty and the Beast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook-Cottone|first=Catherine|date=28 Mar 2018|title=Eating Disorders|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10640266.2018.1451684|journal=The journal of treatment and prevention|volume= 26|pages= 105–106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2010 involved one hundred and twenty one girls age 3-6 to determine the effects of brief exposure to appearance‐related media on young girls' body image. The exposure ended up not affecting body dissatisfaction. Although nearly all the girls did like how they looked ⅓ would change one physical thing and half were worried of becoming fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Sharon|last2=Tantleff-Dunn|first2=Stacey|date=2010-06-01|title=Am I too fat to be a princess?

In 64% of children's videos and 20% of books obesity is related to negative traits.  Obese characters are often shown as evil, unfriendly, cruel, and unattractive. Ursula from [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] is an obese, unattractive octopus.  In 40% of videos and 20% of books at least one obese character is disliked by others.  Obese characters are shown thinking about food or depicted in setting related to food in 52% of videos and 20% of books.  Children's media is perpetuating the "what is beautiful is good" stereotype through its portrayals of thin and obese characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Herbozo, Tantleff-Dunn, Gokee-Larose, and Thompson|title=Beauty and Thinness Messages in Children's Media: A Content Analysis|journal=Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment &amp; Prevention|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=21–34|doi=10.1080/10640260490267742|pmid=16864302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Media==
Social media consists of websites like Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest and Facebook enable users to produce and share content. Thinspiration images that promote the idealization of thinness and pro-eating disorder websites are becoming increasingly more prevalent throughout social media. Pro-eating disorder (i.e. pro-ana and pro-bulimia) websites are forms of social media where  individuals can share advice and images that encourage their peers to engage in eating disorder behaviors. These websites have been shown to have deleterious effects because they communicate to the viewer that the thin ideal is something that is not only attainable but also necessary. Women are more likely to compare themselves online when they feel the need to improve their appearance. Women with low self-esteem are more likely to feel dissatisfied after comparing themselves to images on social and women who struggle with preexisting eating disorders may exacerbate them through social media fueled body comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perloff|first1=Richard M.|title=Social Media Effects on Young Women's Body Image Concerns: Theoretical Perspectives and an Agenda for Research|journal=Sex Roles|date=29 May 2014|volume=71|issue=11-12|pages=363–377|doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0384-6|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study on college women in the US concluded that women who spent a significant amount of time on Facebook had increased body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eckler|first1=Petya|last2=Kalyango|first2=Yusuf|last3=Paasch|first3=Ellen|title=Facebook use and negative body image among U.S. college women|journal=Women &amp; Health|date=2 March 2016|volume=57|issue=2|pages=249–267|doi=10.1080/03630242.2016.1159268|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lasting effects on viewers==
"A study of 6,928 girls ages 9 to 14 years old found that the desire to emulate the appearance of females on television, in movies, and in magazines was predictive of beginning purging behavior at least on a monthly basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrie|first1=Z.|last2=Sullivan|first2=E.A.|last3=Davies|first3=P.S.W.|last4=Hill|first4=R.J.|title=Media Influence on the Body Image of Children and Adolescents, Eating Disorders|journal=Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment &amp; Prevention|date=2006|volume=14|issue=5|pages=355–364|doi=10.1080/10640260600952506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 92% of women feel pressure to conform to the standards of beauty which the media perpetuates.  After viewing images of women with "ideal" body weights, 95% of women overestimate their body size and 40% overestimate the size of their waist, hips, cheeks, or thighs.  Those with [[eating disorder]]s, such as [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia nervosa]], show a significant increase in overestimation of body size after viewing such images.  Similarly males who are exposed to body-related advertisements show an increase in body dissatisfaction and depression.&lt;ref name="Hegemonic Depictions" /&gt;  Men shown advertisements containing images of exceptionally muscular men were shown to be dissatisfied with their own musculature, not their body fat, after viewing such advertisements.  This finding is consistent with previous evidence that states muscularity is more important than body fat in men's body satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Muscle Dysmorphia"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leit, Gray, and Pope|title=The Media's Representation of the Ideal Male Body: A Cause for Muscle Dysmorphia?|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|year=2002|volume=31|issue=3|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eat.10019/pdf|doi=10.1002/eat.10019|pages=334–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The correlation between media image and body image has been proven; in one study, among European American and African American girls ages 7 – 12, greater overall television exposure predicted both a thinner ideal adult body shape and a higher level of disordered eating one year later. Adolescent girls are the most strongly affected demographic; "More and more 12-year-old girls are going on diets because they believe what you weigh determines your worth," Cutler observed. "When all you see is a body type that only two percent of the population has, it's difficult to remember what's real and what's reasonable to expect of yourself and everyone else." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamilton.edu/news/story/the-medias-effect-on-womens-body-image&lt;/ref&gt;

Put simply, the beauty ideal in American culture is: thin. "Large populations of 'average' girls do not demonstrate clinically diagnosable eating disorders—pathologies that the culture marks as extreme and unhealthy—but rather an entirely normative obsession with body shape and size," Cutler said. "This ongoing concern is accepted as a completely normal and even inevitable part of being a modern girl. I think we need to change that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamilton.edu/news/story/the-medias-effect-on-womens-body-image|title=The Media's Effect on Women's Body Image|last=Ossola|first=Alexandra|date=1 September 2010|website=Hamilton|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young adults and teens are very vulnerable to addict of social media usage because they do not know different life, world, and functioning without it. "Teens and young adults are considered particularly at risk. They're a generation raised on the internet, social media, and digital technology so these things are integral, indispensable parts of their lives. Young people also are impressionable, eager for acceptance, and relatively inexperienced, which can cloud judgment." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Good, Bad, and In-between of Social Media|url=https://carrierclinic.org/resources/good-bad-in-between-of-social-media/|website=carrierclinic.org|publisher=carrierclinic.org|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovejoy finds in her research—which compares the perceptions of body image and eating disorders in black and white women through a literature review—that the strategies (e.g., resistance to mainstream beauty ideals) that black women use to challenge mainstream depictions of female bodies and develop positive self-valuations are often strengthened through support from other black women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These same types of supportive communities were not replicated in the same way for white women in the literature. Lovejoy argues that this difference in support can influence the way black and white women are affected by damaging ideals of body image and beauty. Namely, black women may be less susceptible to these damaging ideals than white women as a result of strong support within their communities.

However, such research does not suggest that black women are not affected by damaging ideals of body image and beauty. Maya A. Poran finds that "[c]ontrary to popular theories that propose that Black women are protected by a 'Black Culture' that buffers them from negative effects of body representations—thereby leaving them with higher body esteem," black women in her study did experience "(1) pressures to be thin, (2) pressures from the preferences of men of diverse ethnicities, (3) competition with other Black women in the realms of beauty, and (4) a strong sense of being misrepresented by media images of thin Black women." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore, while it is important to recognize the contribution of supportive communities on the positive self-valuation that some black women may experience, it is important that this not obscure the damaging impact that harmful ideals of body image and beauty may have on black women.

'''Monochromacy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''mono'', meaning "one "and ''chromo'', meaning "color") is the ability of organisms or machines to distinguish only one single frequency of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic light spectrum]]. In the physical sense, no source of electromagnetic radiation is purely monochromatic but can be considered as a [[gaussian distribution]] of frequencies shaped around a peak. In the same way, a visual system of an organism or a machine cannot be monochromat but will distinguish a continuous set of frequencies around a peak, depending by the intensity of the light. Organisms with monochromacy are called monochromats.

Many species, such as all [[marine mammal]]s, the [[owl monkey]] and the [[Australian sea lion]] (pictured at right) are monochromats under normal conditions. In [[human]]s, absence of color discrimination or poor color discrimination is one among several other symptoms of severe inherited or acquired diseases, as for example inherited [[achromatopsia]] ([[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man|OMIM]] 216900 262300 139340 613093), acquired achromatopsia or inherited [[blue cone monochromacy]] (OMIM 303700).

==Humans==
Vision in humans is due to a system that starts with [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] photoreceptors, passes through [[retinal ganglion cells]] and arrives in the brain [[visual cortex]]. [[Color vision]] is achieved through cone cells, each one able to distinguish between a continuous band of frequencies, retinal ganglion cells and the visual cortex.

Rods, which are extremely abundant (about 120 million), are in the periphery of the human retina. Rods respond only to faint levels of light and are very light sensitive, therefore, completely useless in daylight because bright light bleaches them.&lt;ref name="Kalat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalat|first=James|title=Biological Psychology|year=2013|publisher=Jon-David Hague|isbn=978-1-111-83100-4|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cones, which are mostly near the [[fovea centralis|fovea]] in the eye and are less active in dim light, more useful in bright light, are essential for color vision.&lt;ref name="Kalat" /&gt; There are three types of cones in normal human eyes (short, medium and long wavelength, sometimes called blue, green and red); each detects a different range of wavelengths. Rods outnumber cones by about 20 to 1 in the human retina, but cones provide about 90% of the brain's input.&lt;ref name="Kalat" /&gt; Cones respond faster than rods and have three types of pigments with different color sensitivities, where rods only have one and so are achromatic (colorless).&lt;ref name="Kalat" /&gt; Because of the distribution of rods and cones in the human eye, people have good color vision near the fovea (where cones are) but not in the periphery (where the rods are).&lt;ref name="Kalat" /&gt;

These types of color blindness can be inherited, resulting from alterations in cone pigments or in other proteins needed for the process of [[Visual phototransduction|phototransduction]]:&lt;ref name="NEITZ2-COL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neitz|first1=J|last2=Neitz|first2=M|title=The genetics of normal and defective color vision|journal=Vision Res.|date=2011|volume=51|issue=7|pages=633–651|pmid=21167193|pmc=3075382|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2010.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Anomalous trichromacy]], when one of the three cone pigments is altered in its spectral sensitivity but [[trichromacy]] (distinguishing color by both the green-red and blue-yellow distinctions) is not fully impaired.
#[[Dichromacy]], when one of the cone pigments is missing and colour is reduced to the green-red distinction only or the blue-yellow distinction only.
# Monochromacy, when two of the cones are not functional. Vision reduced to blacks, whites, and greys.
# Rod Monochromacy ([[Achromatopsia]].), when all three of the cones are non functional and light perception is achieved only with rod cells. Color vision is heavily or completely impaired, vision reduced to seeing only the level of light coming from an object. [[Dyschromatopsia]] is a less severe type of achromatopsia.

Monochromacy is one of the symptoms of diseases that occur when only one kind of light receptor in the human [[retina]] is functional at a particular level of illumination. It is one of the symptoms of either acquired or inherited disease as for example acquired [[achromatopsia]], inherited autosomal recessive [[achromatopsia]] and [[Sex linkage#X-linked recessive inheritance|recessive X-linked]] [[blue cone monochromacy]].&lt;ref name="NATHA_BCM1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nathans|first1=J|last2=Davenport|first2=C M|last3=Maumenee|first3=I H|last4=Lewis|first4=R A|last5=Hejtmancik|first5=J F|last6=Litt|first6=M|last7=Lovrien|first7=E|last8=Weleber|first8=R|last9=Bachynski|first9=B|last10=Zwas|first10=F|last11=Klingaman|first11=R|last12=Fishman|first12=G|title=Molecular genetics of human blue cone monochromacy|journal=Science|date=1989|volume=245|issue=4920|pages=831–838|pmid=2788922|doi=10.1126/science.2788922}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATHA_BCM2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nathans|first1=J|last2=Maumenee|first2=I H|last3=Zrenner|first3=E|last4=Sadowski|first4=B|last5=Sharpe|first5=L T|last6=Lewis|first6=R A|last7=Hansen|first7=E|last8=Rosenberg|first8=T|last9=Schwartz|first9=M|last10=Heckenlively|first10=J R|last11=Trabulsi|first11=E|last12=Klingaman|first12=R|last13=Bech-Hansen|first13=N T|last14=LaRoche|first14=G R|last15=Pagon|first15=R A|last16=Murphey|first16=W H|last17=Weleber|first17=R G|title=Genetic heterogeneity among blue-cone monochromats|journal=Am.

*Rod monochromacy (RM), also called [[Achromatopsia#Congenital|congenital complete achromatopsia]] or total color blindness, is a rare and extremely severe form of an [[autosomal recessive]]ly inherited retinal disorder resulting in severe visual handicap. People with RM have a reduced visual acuity, (usually about 0.1 or 20/200), have total color blindness, [[Photophobia|photo-aversion]] and [[nystagmus]]. The nystagmus and photo-aversion usually are present during the first months of life, and the prevalence of the disease is estimated to be 1 in 30,000 worldwide.&lt;ref name="Eksandh"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eksandh L, Kohl S, Wissinger B | title = Clinical features of achromatopsia in Swedish patients with defined genotypes | journal = Ophthalmic Genet. | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–20 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12187429 | doi = 10.1076/opge.23.2.109.2210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, since patients with RM have no cone function and normal rod function,&lt;ref name="Eksandh" /&gt; a rod monochromat cannot see any color but only shades of grey. Also see [[Pingelap#Color-blindness]].
*Cone monochromacy (CM) is the condition of having both rods and cones, but only having one functioning type of cone. A cone monochromat can have good pattern vision at normal daylight levels, but will not be able to distinguish hues.

In humans, who have three types of cones, the short (S, or blue) wavelength sensitive, middle (M, or green) wavelength sensitive and long (L, or red) wavelength sensitive cones&lt;ref name="NATHA1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nathans|first1=J|last2=Thomas|first2=D|last3=Hogness|first3=D S|title=Molecular genetics of human color vision: the genes encoding blue, green, and red pigments|journal=Science|date=1986|volume=232|issue=4747|pages=193–202|pmid=2937147|doi=10.1126/science.2937147}}&lt;/ref&gt; have three differing forms of cone monochromacy, named according to the single functioning cone class:

#[[Blue cone monochromacy]] (BCM), also known as S-cone monochromacy,&lt;ref name="NATHA_BCM1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NATHA_BCM2"/&gt; is an X-linked cone disease.&lt;ref name="pmid12187427"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weleber RG | title = Infantile and childhood retinal blindness: a molecular perspective (The Franceschetti Lecture) | journal = Ophthalmic Genet. | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 71–97 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12187427}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a rare congenital stationary cone dysfunction syndrome, affecting less than 1 in 100,000 individuals, and is characterized by the absence of L- and M-cone function.&lt;ref name="pmid15094734"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michaelides M, Johnson S, Simunovic MP, Bradshaw K, Holder G, Mollon JD, Moore AT, Hunt DM | title = Blue cone monochromatism: a phenotype and genotype assessment with evidence of progressive loss of cone function in older individuals | journal = Eye (Lond) | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–10 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15094734 | doi = 10.1038/sj.eye.6701391 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BCM results from mutations in a single red or red–green hybrid [[opsin]] gene, mutations in both the red and the green opsin genes or deletions within the adjacent LCR ([[locus control region]]) on the X chromosome.&lt;ref name="NATHA_BCM1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NATHA_BCM2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eksandh" /&gt;
#Green cone monochromacy (GCM), also known as M-cone monochromacy, is a condition where the blue and red cones are absent in the [[fovea centralis|fovea]]. The prevalence of this type of monochromacy is less than 1 in 1 million.
#Red cone monochromacy (RCM), also known as L-cone monochromacy, is a condition where the blue and green cones are absent in the fovea. Like GCM, RCM is also present in less than 1 in 1 million people. Animal research studies have shown that the nocturnal wolf and ferret have lower densities of L-cone receptors.&lt;ref name="Peichl" /&gt;

*Cone monochromacy, type II, if its existence were established, would be the case in which the retina contains no rods, and only a single type of cone. Such an animal would be unable to see at all at lower levels of illumination, and of course would be unable to distinguish hues. In practice, it is hard to produce an example of such a retina, at least as the normal condition for a species.

==Animals that are monochromats==
It used to be confidently claimed that most [[mammal]]s other than [[primate]]s were monochromats. In the last half-century, however, evidence of at least [[dichromat]]ic color vision in a number of mammalian [[order (biology)|orders]] has accumulated. While typical mammals are dichromats, with S and L cones, two of the orders of [[sea mammals]], the [[pinniped]]s (which includes the seal, sea lion and walrus) and [[cetacean]]s (which includes dolphins and whales) clearly are cone monochromats, since the short-wavelength sensitive cone system is genetically disabled in these animals.{{dubious|lacking the 2 S cone could make them dichromats|date=January 2014}} The same is true of the [[owl monkey]]s, genus ''Aotus''.

Researchers Leo Peichl, Guenther Behrmann and Ronald H. H. Kroeger report that of the many animal species studied, there are three carnivores that are cone monochromats: [[raccoon]], [[crab-eating raccoon]] and [[kinkajou]] and a few [[rodents]] are cone monochromats because they are lacking the S-cone.&lt;ref name="Peichl"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peichl|first=Leo|last2=Behrmann |first2=Gunther |last3=Kroger |first3=Ronald H. H.|title=For whales and seals the ocean is not blue: a visual pigment loss in marine mammals|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|date=April 2001|volume=13|issue=8|page=9|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0953-816x.2001.01533.x/abstract;jsessionid=565D9B2BF9D892AD4E7F77A927553E6A.f01t01|accessdate=22 November 2013|doi=10.1046/j.0953-816x.2001.01533.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers also report that the animal's living environment also plays a significant role in the animals' eyesight. They use the example of water depth and the smaller amount of sunlight that is visible as one continues to go down. They explain it as follows, "Depending on the type of water, the wavelengths penetrating deepest may be short (clear, blue ocean water) or long (turbid, brownish coastal or estuarine water.)" &lt;ref name="Peichl" /&gt; Therefore, the variety of visible availability in some animals resulted in them losing their S-cone opsins.

==Monochromat capability==
According to [[Jay Neitz]], a renowned color vision researcher at the [[University of Washington]], each of the three standard color-detecting cones in the retina of [[trichromat]]s can pick up about 100 gradations of color. The brain can process the combinations of these three values so that the average human can distinguish about one million colors.&lt;ref name="Roth 2006" &gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7675">A '''music director''', '''musical director''', or '''director of music''' may be the director of an [[orchestra]] or [[concert band]], the director of music for a film, the director of music at a radio station, the head of the music department in a school, the coordinator of the musical ensembles in a university, college, or institution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/19/arts/music/19russ.html|title=Celebrating Undefinable Songwriting|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Ben Ratliff]]|date=19 May 2008|accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (but not usually the head of the academic music department), the head [[bandmaster]] of a military band, the head [[organist]] and [[choirmaster]] of a church, or an [[Organist and Master of the Choristers]] (a title given to a Director of Music at a cathedral, particularly in England).

==Orchestra==
The title of "music director" or "musical director" is used by many [[symphony orchestra]]s to designate the primary [[conducting|conductor]] and artistic leader of the orchestra. The term "music director" is most common for orchestras in the United States. With European orchestras, the titles of "principal conductor" or "chief conductor" are more common, which designate the conductor who directs the majority of a given orchestra's concerts in a season. In [[musical theatre]] and [[opera]], the music director is in charge of the overall musical performance, including ensuring that the cast knows the music thoroughly, supervising the musical interpretation of the performers and pit orchestra, and conducting the orchestra.

In the 20th century, the title and position typically brought with it an almost unlimited influence over the particular orchestra's affairs. As implied by the name, the music director not only conducts concerts, but also controls what music the orchestra will perform or record, and has much authority regarding hiring, firing, and other personnel decisions over an orchestra's musicians. Such authoritarian rule, once expected and even thought necessary for a symphonic ensemble to function properly, has loosened somewhat in the closing decades of the 20th century with the advent and encouragement of more power sharing and cooperative management styles (with the orchestra musicians themselves, the administrative staff, and volunteer board of directors). The music director in American lingo also assists with fund-raising, and also is the primary focus of publicity for the orchestra, as what is often called its "public face".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/arts/music/25phil.html|title=Philharmonic to Add a Position at the Top|work=The New York Times|author=Daniel J. Wakin|date=25 April 2007|accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "music director" or "musical director" became common in the United States in the middle of the 20th century, following an evolution of titles. Early leaders of orchestras were simply designated as the "conductor." In the 1920s and 1930s, the term musical director began to be used, in order to delineate the fact that the person in this position was doing much more than just conducting, and to differentiate them from guest conductors who simply led one particular program or concert. [[George Szell]], for instance, was appointed as "musical director" of the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] in 1946, and his position was so named until his death in 1970. His successor, [[Lorin Maazel]], was given the title "music director." Other major American orchestras kept more current with the times and began using the simpler term in the 1950s and 1960s.

The term can also refer to the person who directs a school band or heads the music program.

==Film and theatre==
Alternatively, the term "music director" used to appear in the film credits for a professional hired to supervise and direct the music selected for a film or music [[documentary film|documentary]], but today the more common designation is [[music supervisor]].

In India, where a large number of films are produced as [[musical film|musical]]s, the term 'music director' is commonly used for the composer and music producer of the songs and score used in the film. Their roles also entail arranging, mastering, mixing and supervising recording of film music with conducting and orchestration. Usually, another artist will receive the credit for the lyrics of the songs. ''Further information: {{Section link|Music of Bollywood|Production}}''.

The "music director" for a theatrical production or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] or [[West End theatre|West End]] musical often serves as rehearsal pianist and conductor.

[[Brass band]]s, [[wind band]]s, [[choir]]s, [[opera]] companies and other ensembles may also have musical directors.

==Broadcasting==
A music director of a [[radio station]] is responsible for interacting with record company representatives, auditioning new music, offering commentary, and making decisions (sometimes in conjunction with the [[program director]]) as to which songs get airplay, how much and when. In [[college radio]], there may be more than one music director, as [[student]]s usually volunteer only a few hours each per week, and most stations have a diverse and extensive library of several different [[music genre]]s.

==Military==
[[File:Conducting the mounted band.jpg|thumb|Major Tim Cooper, Director of Music of The [[Blues and Royals]] mounted band in [[London]].]]
In the [[British Armed Forces]], a director of music is a [[commissioned officer]], always commissioned from the ranks, who leads a military band. A [[non-commissioned officer]] or [[warrant officer (United Kingdom)|warrant officer]] who leads a band is called a [[bandmaster]].

==Pop music==
In pop music, a musical director or "MD" is responsible for supervising the musical arrangements and personnel for a touring artist. This can include festivals and televised performances as well as those at traditional on-stage venues. In the modern era, the sound of a studio recording is often impossible or impractical to reproduce on stage, and it is the music director's job to assemble musicians and arrangements to adapt that material to a live setting (which may or may not include playback of prerecorded tracks). The music director generally leads rehearsals as well as each performance, allowing the lead artist to focus on performing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|author=Dias, Mike|title=What Exactly Does A Music Director Do?|url=http://themusicindustryinsider.com/how-do-i-become-a-music-director/|date=2013-07-22|publisher=''Inside''|accessdate=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Miley Cyrus' Music Director Talks Bangerz Tour Behind-the-Scenes|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6077648/miley-cyrus-bangerz-tour-behind-the-scenes|date=2014-05-08|author=Payne, Chris|publisher=''Billboard''|accessdate=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/how-to-find-work-as-a-drummer-and-musical-director-604586|title=How to find work as a drummer and musical director|author=Chamberlain, Richard|date=2014-01-21|accessdate=2018-02-27|publisher=''Music Radar''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''office toy''' (also '''executive toy''' or '''desk toy''') is a [[novelty item]] typically placed on the desk of a [[corporate executive]] or other [[office worker]]. They have no work-related function, but are often intended to provide decoration or pleasure, [[relieve stress]] or inspire [[creativity]].&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;Hsiang Cheng 'Sam' Wang (2007) The Investigation of Office Toy.

==Functions==
Different types of office toys provide different needs to their users. Although providing pleasure and being decorative could be the two major functions in office toys, there are still some differences between each types of office toys. For example, [[puzzle]]-type toys can also help inspire creativity. A [[fidget spinner]] is an office toy that is used to reduce stress or boredom.&lt;ref name=Fidget&gt;James Plafke (2016) [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jplafke/2016/12/23/fidget-spinners-are-the-must-have-office-toy-for-2017/#48a6919618a4 Fidget Spinners Are The Must-Have Office Toy For 2017] ''[[Forbes]], 23 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Design curator Donald Albrecht described executive toys as "aspirational" objects, "less tools for provoking creativity than foghorns of identity and status in a sea of corporate homogeneity."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3144">'''''Pages for Peace''''' is a book created as an after school enrichment program by the [[Groton-Dunstable Regional Middle School]] in [[Groton, Massachusetts]].  The group created the second largest book in the world (by physical dimensions).  The subject of the book they have chosen to create is [[World Peace]]. This enrichment program was created by 5th grade teacher [[Betsy Sawyer]].&lt;ref name=Pages&gt;[http://www.pagesforpeace.org/home.html Pages for Peace Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Pages for Peace'' consists of recollections and reflections on the topic of World Peace from people all over the world.

==History==
In October 2004 eight [[5th grade]] students joined Pages for Peace becoming its first members.

In late 2007 members of Pages for Peace visited The [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] to create the page turner for the book.

In September 2008 members of Pages for Peace visited the [[United Nations]] headquarters in [[New York City]] to give a presentation to the annual international youth conference, and have been invited back every year since (as of 2016).&lt;ref name=Pages/&gt;

In June 2010, ''Pages for Peace'' was awarded the Peace Abbey's "Courage of Conscience" award, which had previously been awarded to [[Mother Teresa]] and the [[Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Patrick Shea''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]] (27 April 1908 &amp;ndash; 1986) was a [[Northern Irish]] [[civil servant]] and the first [[Roman Catholic]] since [[Andrew Nicholas Bonaparte Wyse|A. N. Bonaparte-Wyse]] in the 1920s to achieve the rank of [[Permanent Secretary]] of a Government Department in [[Northern Ireland]].

==Career==
Shea was born in [[Delvin]], [[County Westmeath]], where his father, a native [[Irish language|Irish]] speaker from [[County Kerry|West Kerry]], was a member of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]]. His father had various postings until the RIC was disbanded in 1922 upon the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] via the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]/[[Partition of Ireland]]. Shea's father joined the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], attaining the rank of Head Constable and later Clerk of Petty Sessions in [[Newry]], [[County Down]], where the family later lived. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Patrick Shea attended the [[Abbey Christian Brothers Grammar School|Abbey CBS]] in Newry. Upon leaving, he joined the [[Northern Ireland Civil Service]] in June 1926. His postings included:
* Ministry of Labour, Clerical Officer 1926–1935 Belfast, Outdoor Officer [[Enniskillen]] 1935–1938, Senior Clerk, Headquarters 1938–1939
* Ministry of Finance, Assistant Principal 1939–1941, Deputy Principal 1941. His initial appointment to this office was blocked because he was a [[Roman Catholic]] by the Minister of Labour [[John F. Gordon]] who was later overruled by John M. Andrews the Minister of Finance.
* Secretary Civil Service Committee for Northern Ireland 1941
* Ministry of Education, Principal December 1947 – 1959, Establishment Officer and Accountant
* Ministry of Finance, Public Buildings and Works, 1959–1963, Assistant Secretary 1963–1969
* Ministry of Education, Permanent Secretary, December 1969–1973

After retirement he chaired [[Enterprise Ulster]] from 1973–1979. Shea commented on his own career by recalling that it ''"was my experience that some Catholics, and especially those in Belfast, where I had been told, the Bishop advised them against seeking Government employment, looked with suspicion on Catholic civil servants. We had joined the enemy, we were lost souls"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elliott, Marianne]]. ''Catholics of Ulster'', Basic Books (19 February 2002); {{ISBN|0465019048}}; {{ISBN|978-0465019045}}; p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QCagZOubDWUC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=Patrick+Shea+we+had+joined+the+enemy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pD8qUcjlZD&amp;sig=hCI19atq-y8EgedryVAsXmd3WsQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RrwmUYnJN8-y0QGtr4DgDw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Patrick%20Shea%20we%20had%20joined%20the%20enemy&amp;f=false ''A New History of Ireland, Volume II''], edited by Art Cosgrove, p. 217; {{ISBN|978-0-19-821755-8}} (hc); {{ISBN|978-0-19-953970-3}} (p)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Shea was given an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1961 and [[Order of the Bath|CB]] 1972. He was made an Honorary member of the [[Royal Society of Ulster Architects]] in  1971 and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1977. He was a long-time member of the Ulster Arts Club.

==Personal life==
He married Eithne McHugh (d. 2000) in September 1941 and they had a daughter and two sons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3025">The '''Pernik sword''' is a [[medieval]] double-edged [[iron]] [[sword]] unearthed in the ruins of the medieval fortress of [[Krakra of Pernik|Krakra]] near [[Pernik]], western [[Bulgaria]], on 1 January 1921. It bears an inscription in [[silver]] inlay on the blade. The sword is preserved in the [[National Archaeological Museum (Bulgaria)|National Archaeological Museum of Bulgaria]] in [[Sofia]]. The sword is {{convert|96|cm|in}} long and up to {{convert|4.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide.

The [[Medieval sword blade inscriptions|blade inscription]] is typical of the 12th-century "garbled" ''in nomine'' type, reading ''+IHININIhVILPIDHINIhVILPN+''. Comparable blade inscriptions range from the comparatively clear ''NNOMNEDMN'' to the heavily distorted ''00NINOMINED, OIEDOMINI, INNIOINNEDINI''. There is a scholarly tradition of attempts to interpret this type of inscription as abbreviations or contractions, e.g. reading ''INPMPNC'' as  ''I(n) n(omine) p(atris) M(ater) p(atris) n(ostri) C(hristi)''.&lt;ref&gt;Drboglav, D. (1984): Zagadki latinskih klejm na mečah IX-XIV vekov (Klassifikazija, datirovka i čtenie nadpisej). Moskva.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Štereva, I. (1975): Kam vaprosa za mečovete v srednovekovna Balgarija. V: Archeologia, kn. 2, 55-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Following such proposals, Mihailov (1985) proposed a tentative reading of the Pernik inscription along the lines of "IH(ESUS). IN I(HESUS) N(OMINE). IH(ESUS) VI(RGO). L(AUS) P(ATRIS) I(HESUS) D(OMINI) H(RISTUS). IN IH(ESUS) VI(RGO). L(AUS) P(ATRIS) N(OSTRIS)".&lt;ref&gt;Mihailov, St. (1985): Nadpisăt na latinski ezik vărhu meča ot Perniškata krepost. V: Archeologia, kn. 3, 46 sl.&lt;/ref&gt;
By contrast, Dentschewa (2005) argued for a "[[Lombardic language|Lombardic]]" interpretation of ''IH INI NI hVIL PIDH, INI hVIL PN'', meaning "I do not await eternity, I am eternity".&lt;ref&gt;Dentschewa, ''Langobardische (?)…'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">The best-known '''pleorama''' was a 19th-century moving [[Panoramic painting|panorama]] entertainment where the viewers sat in a rocking boat while panoramic views on painted canvas rolled past. The word has sometimes been used for other entertainments or innovations.

Architect [[Carl Ferdinand Langhans]] introduced a pleorama in [[Breslau]] in 1831 with scenes of the [[Bay of Naples]] on both sides of 24 "voyagers" sitting in a wooden boat floating in a pool of water. The illusion was enhanced by light and sound effects: the boatman singing, [[Vesuvius]] erupting. Writer/artist [[August Kopisch]] was involved in designing the hour-long show.

Carl Wilhelm Gropius, who had a [[diorama]] exhibit in [[Berlin]], took over management of this pleorama in 1832, and there was also a pleorama of a journey along the river [[Rhine]]. 

The Swiss writer Bernard Comment, among others, has pointed out the similarities between Langhans' pleorama and the ambitious [[mareorama]] at the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exhibition]].

A similar idea was used for a [[London]] ''padorama'' in 1834. Spectators were seated in [[railway]] carriages to watch a moving panorama of scenes visible from the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

In 1850s [[Finland]] the name ''pleorama'' was given to shows which presented historic scenes and panoramic views using glass, but posters for these do not mention anything resembling Langhans' boat concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibbild.abo.fi/nojen/ Posters in Swedish for pleoramas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''pleorama'' was coined from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] elements. Like other 19th century novelties ending in ''-orama'' - [[diorama]] and [[cyclorama]], for instance - the second half of the word has the sense of 'something seen'. The ''pleo-'' part here is understood to come from a Greek word meaning 'float' which applies to Langhans' boat in water idea. ''Pleorama'' is also the 21st century name of an innovative "floating house".

==Plot==
In [[Britannia]], 62 AD, a tribe of [[Celts|Celtic]] horsemen are brutally wiped out by Romans led by Corvus ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]). The only survivor is a boy named Milo, whose mother Corvus personally killed. The boy is captured by slave traders.

Seventeen years later, in [[Londinium]] in 79 A.D., a slave owner named Graecus ([[Joe Pingue]]) watches a class of [[gladiator]]s battle. He is unimpressed until he sees the grown Milo ([[Kit Harington]]), a talented gladiator the crowds call "the Celt". Milo is soon brought to Pompeii with his fellow slaves. On the road, they see a horse fall while drawing a carriage carrying Cassia ([[Emily Browning]]), returning after a year in [[Rome]], and her servant Ariadne ([[Jessica Lucas]]). Milo kills the horse to end its suffering and Cassia is drawn to him. Cassia is the daughter of the city governor Severus ([[Jared Harris]]) and his wife Aurelia ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]). Severus is hoping to have the new [[Titus|Emperor Titus]] invest in plans to rebuild Pompeii but Cassia warns him of Rome becoming more corrupt. A servant named Felix ([[Dalmar Abuzeid]]) takes Cassia’s horse Vires for a ride only to be swallowed up when a quake from [[Mount Vesuvius]] opens up the ground under him.

In Pompeii, Milo soon develops a rivalry with Atticus ([[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]]), a champion gladiator who, by Roman law, will be given his freedom after he earns one more victory. The gladiators are shown off at a party where Corvus, now a Senator, tells Severus the Emperor will not invest in his plans but he himself will. It is revealed Cassia left Rome to escape Corvus’s advances. When an earthquake causes some horses to become anxious, Milo helps calm one down. He then takes Cassia on a ride, telling her that they cannot be together. Returning to the villa, Corvus is ready to kill Milo (not recognizing him from the village massacre) but Cassia pleads for his life. Milo is lashed for his actions and Atticus admits respect for his rival as they prepare to face each other at the upcoming festival.

In the [[Amphitheatre of Pompeii]], to punish Milo, Corvus orders him killed in the first battle and wicked trainer Bellator (Currie Graham) convinces Graecus to sacrifice Atticus as well. The two men, and other gladiators, are chained to rocks as other gladiators come out as Roman soldiers, to recreate Corvus’s victory over the Celts. Working together, Milo and Atticus survive the battle; Atticus realizes the Romans will never honor his freedom. During the battle, Corvus forces Cassia to agree to marry him by threatening to have her family killed for supposed treason against the Emperor. When Milo and Atticus win, Cassia defies Corvus by holding a “thumbs-up” for them to live and he has her taken to the villa to be locked up. Claiming an earthquake is a sign from [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], Corvus has his officer Proculus ([[Sasha Roiz]]) fight Milo one-on-one. Their battle is interrupted when [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|Mount Vesuvius erupts]], creating massive tremors that cause the arena to collapse, sending Milo and Proculus crashing to the dungeons. Milo opens up the gates to allow his fellow gladiators a chance to attack; Proculus escapes while the gladiators kill Bellator. Seeing Corvus fallen under a collapsed beam, Severus tries to kill him, but Corvus stabs him and escapes.

The eruption sends flaming debris raining down upon the city as the populace tries to flee to the harbor. One fireball destroys and sinks a ship, killing the escaping Graecus. Aurelia tells Milo that Cassia is at the villa before dying. Milo races to the villa and manages to save Cassia, but Ariadne is killed when the villa collapses into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Atticus tries to reach the harbor, but a [[tsunami]] created by the volcano smashes into the city, destroying the harbour and the outer walls and smashing several ships. Reuniting with Atticus, Milo suggests searching the arena for horses to escape. As the gladiators face Roman soldiers at the arena, Cassia sees to the bodies of her parents, only to be abducted by Corvus. Atticus has Milo chase after the chariot carrying the two while he faces off against Proculus. Atticus is mortally wounded in the duel, but he manages to break the blade and uses it to stab Proculus.

Milo chases Corvus across the city, both barely avoiding fireballs and collapsing roads and buildings. Cassia manages to free herself before the chariot crashes into the [[Temple of Apollo (Pompeii)|Temple of Apollo]]. Milo and Corvus duel as a [[lava bomb|fireball]] destroys the temple. Cassia chains Corvus to a building as Milo declares that [[Celtic deities|his gods]] are coming to punish the Senator. Milo and Cassia ride off as a [[pyroclastic surge]] races into the city, incinerating Corvus. At the arena, Atticus proudly proclaims that he dies a free man before the surge consumes him. At the city outskirts, the horse throws off Milo and Cassia. Milo tells Cassia to leave alone, realising the horse isn't fast enough to carry them both. Instead, she sends the horse off, not wanting to spend her last moments running as she knows that they will not outrun the surge. Milo kisses Cassia as the surge engulfs them. The last shot is of the duo's petrified bodies, locked in an eternal embrace.

==Production==
The film was shot in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] from March to July 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www1.toronto.ca/staticfiles/static_files/economic_development_and_culture/docs/currently_filming.pdf | title = In Production in Toronto as of July 5, 2013 | publisher = Toronto Film, Television and Digital Media Office | format = PDF | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130730144127/http://www1.toronto.ca/staticfiles/static_files/economic_development_and_culture/docs/currently_filming.pdf | archivedate = July 30, 2013 | accessdate = February 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily at [[Cinespace Film Studios]]' [[Kipling Avenue]] facility. Constantin Film and Don Carmody Productions formerly selected Cinespace as a shooting locale for ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]'' and ''[[The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = January 31, 2013 | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=99667 | title = Cinespace signs deal for Pompeii | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130204000320/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=99667 | archivedate = February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading man Kit Harington underwent a gruelling training regimen for the film in order to [[Muscle hypertrophy|bulk up]] for the role. Harington stated he had "wanted to do a body transformation for something—it was one of those processes that I had never really done before...I became obsessed with it. To the point where I was going to the gym three times a day for six days a week. I was becoming exhausted. So the trainer stepped in and said, 'Look, you don't need to go through all of this. This is [[body dysmorphia]] now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = February 14, 2014 | author = Jennifer Vineyard | url = http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/pompeii-gave-kit-harington-body-dysmorphia.html | title = Kit Harington Dysmorphia Pompeii | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140307004808/http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/pompeii-gave-kit-harington-body-dysmorphia.html | archivedate = March 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pompeii'' was the fourth time that director Anderson used 3D cameras in his films, the first being ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife]]'' in 2010. ''[[Resident Evil (film series)|Resident Evil]]'' producers [[Jeremy Bolt]] and [[Don Carmody]] reunited with Anderson for the film. [[FilmDistrict]] bought the distribution rights in the US, and because of [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]]'s relationship with the filmmakers, they chose to release the film with [[TriStar Pictures]].&lt;ref name="upcomingmovies"&gt;{{cite web | date = April 10, 2013 | author = Peter Dimako | title = FilmDistrict lands on POMPEII | url = http://www.upcoming-movies.com/Articles/filmdistrict-lands-on-pompeii/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001033/http://www.upcoming-movies.com/Articles/filmdistrict-lands-on-pompeii/ | archivedate=December 3, 2013 | accessdate = February 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Summit Entertainment]], who released Anderson's ''[[The Three Musketeers (2011 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'', handled distribution sales outside of Germany and the US (through [[Lionsgate]]).

==Release==

===Box office===
''Pompeii'' grossed ten million in its opening weekend, finishing in third, against strong competition from ''[[The Lego Movie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = February 23, 2014 | author = Ray Subers | title = Weekend Report: 'LEGO' Obliterates '3 Days,' 'Pompeii' | url = http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3787&amp;p=.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 30, 2014, the film has grossed $23.2 million in North America and $78.6 in other territories for a worldwide total of $117.8 million.&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{cite web |title= Pompeii (2014) |url= http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pompeii.htm |work= [[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate= June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film won the [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television]]'s [[Golden Screen Award (Canada)|Golden Screen Award]] for 2014 as the year's top-grossing Canadian film.&lt;ref name="PlayBack"&gt;[http://playbackonline.ca/2015/02/04/academy-to-recognize-tv-with-golden-screen-awards/ "Academy to recognize TV with Golden Screen Awards"].

===Critical response===
Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 28% based on 145 reviews.&lt;ref name=rotten/&gt; The site's consensus reads, "This big-budget [[sword-and-sandal]] adventure lacks the energy and storytelling heft to amount to more than a guilty pleasure."&lt;ref name=rotten&gt;{{cite web | title = Pompeii (2014) | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pompeii_2013/ | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Flixster]] | accessdate = May 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has an aggregate score of 39 out of 100 based on 33 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pompeii/ |title= Pompeii Reviews |publisher= [[Metacritic]] |date= |accessdate= April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a "lukewarm" B grade approval rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Box Office: 'Lego' Tops Friday With $7.3 Million, Destroys 'Pompeii,' '3 Days to Kill'| date = February 22, 2014 | author = Pamela McClintock | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-lego-tops-friday-682558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics were rather favorable as shown by [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture.com's]] review which summarized the film as "...not a particularly original story, but it gallops along at a nice clip, with the good guys appropriately gallant and breathless and the bad guys appropriately smug and snarly... And whether it's elaborate gladiatorial battles or a chariot chase through a burning city, Anderson directs with precision, rhythm, and ruthlessness – he has an eye and an ear for violence, for the visceral impact of a kill. At his best, he creates action sequences in which you feel anything might happen, even though you usually know how they'll turn out. And the ones in Pompeii are more engaging than those of any superhero movie I saw last year... Meanwhile, the disaster renders the villains even pettier, and the devoted lovers even more romantic. That is all as it should be. From [[The Last Days of Pompeii|Bulwer-Lytton]] to Leone, the Pompeii story has never not been schlock: It ain't the Bible, and it ain't Homer. In this gorgeous, silly, exciting new version, it finds its level. Pompeii 3-D wants merely to entertain. And it does, proudly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/movie-review-pompeii.html |title=Movie Review: Pompeii |publisher=Vulture |date= |accessdate=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
The film relies for its reconstruction of historical events on two letters from [[Pliny the Younger]] to the Roman historian, [[Tacitus]]. It opens with quotation from Pliny in which he states, "You could hear the shrieks of women, the wailing of infants, and the shouting of men; some were calling their parents, others their children or their wives, trying to recognize them by their voices. People bewailed their own fate or that of their relatives, and there were some who prayed for death in their terror of dying. Many besought the aid of the gods, but still more imagined there were no gods left, and that the universe was plunged into eternal darkness for evermore."&lt;ref&gt;"The Destruction of Pompeii, 79 AD", EyeWitness to History, www.eyewitnesstohistory.com (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson became enamored of his writings, particularly their near fantastical element and their eloquence, whose influence can be seen throughout the film in the destruction of Pompeii.&lt;ref name="Rojas, Alejandro 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last = Rojas | first = Alejandro | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alejandro-rojas/paul-w-s-anderson-pompeii-scientific-historical-accuracy_b_4827109.html | title = Interview With Paul W. S. Anderson, Pompeii Director, on the Film's Scientific and Historical Accuracy | work = The Huffington Post | date = February 21, 2014 | accessdate = March 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of the eruption is based on eruptions which occurred all over the world over the last ten years. Anderson cites the volcanic eruption of [[Mount Etna]] in Italy and various eruptions of Japanese volcanoes as specific examples of volcanic eruptions which the production crew observed through footage which has been captured on film.&lt;ref name="Rojas, Alejandro 2014"/&gt; Furthermore, Anderson wanted to portray the lightning which is often seen in the ash cloud above eruptions, as he had never seen it portrayed before and he felt it was both magnificent and very terrifying. The animation team was so concerned with realism in the eruption that they would always have real photographs and footage of real eruptions visible to them on separate screens as they put together the eruption of Mount Vesuvius for the film.&lt;ref name="Rojas, Alejandro 2014"/&gt; Claims from Rosaly Lopes, a volcanologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in [[Pasadena, California]], support Anderson's work, stating that the film "realistically captured the earthquakes that preceded the eruption, the explosions and the pyroclastic flows of hot ash and gas that buried the city and its residents."&lt;ref name="Lewis, Tanya 2014"&gt;Lewis, Tanya. [http://www.livescience.com/43529-how-accurate-is-pompeii-movie.html "Lava Bombs and Tsunamis! How Accurate Is 'Pompeii' Movie?"] LiveScience. TechMedia Network, February 20, 2014. Web. March 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of the city was based on the surviving ruins of Pompeii. To ensure complete accuracy, any shots of the ancient city would be built upon existing footage of the ruins. Anderson states, "we would do a real helicopter shot over the ruins of the city so that we knew we were getting the layout of the city correct...Then we would project a computer-generated image over the top of the real photography... That is how we got the architecture of the city precise."&lt;ref name="Rojas, Alejandro 2014"/&gt; Sarah Yeomans, an archaeologist at [[University of Southern California|USC]] has praised the attention to detail in the film's depiction of Pompeii, noting, for example, the raised paving stones in the streets, the political graffiti on the buildings, and the amphitheatre where gladiatorial combat takes place.&lt;ref name="Lewis, Tanya 2014"/&gt;

Anderson has described other aspects of the film as being less rigorously historical. For example, he states that the time of the events was compacted in order to keep the intensity levels high. His portrayal of some aspects of the eruption, in particular the inclusion of fireballs raining from the sky, were included for dramatic effect rather than historical accuracy.&lt;ref name="Rojas, Alejandro 2014"/&gt; He also received minor criticism from Yeomans for his portrayal of women, who would not have been seen alone in town, involved in political affairs, or wearing the revealing clothes they wore in the film.&lt;ref name="Lewis, Tanya 2014"/&gt; Anderson portrayed these women more according to modern tastes. The characters themselves are fictional. Anderson found inspiration for them in real people, representing the famous plaster cast of the "twin lovers" of Pompeii as Milo and Cassia, and finding inspiration for Atticus in the casts of the cowering man. Anderson said he received approval from every vulcanologist and historian he has shown the movie to, having received "high marks for both scientific and historical accuracy", which is what the team was striving for.&lt;ref name="Rojas, Alejandro 2014" /&gt;

The '''''Portrait of Lucrezia Panciatichi''''' is a painting by the Italian artist [[Agnolo di Cosimo]], known as [[Bronzino]], finished around 1545. It is housed in the [[Uffizi]] Gallery in [[Florence]], Italy.

Lucrezia di Sigismondo Pucci was the wife of [[Bartolomeo Panciatichi]], a Florentine humanist and politician, also portrayed by Bronzino in another Uffizi portrait. [[Giorgio Vasari ]] describes the two portraits as: "so natural that they seem truly living". The show of refined garments and jewelry was intended not only to underline the élite position of the woman, but also aspects of her personality through a complex symbology, including the words "Amour dure sans fin" on the golden necklace, a reference to a love treatise written for the Grand Duke of Florence, [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], in 1547.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2092">The '''Royal India Society''' was a 20th-century British [[learned society]] concerned with [[India]].

The society was founded in 1910 by [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], and others, as the India Society. Sedgwick reports Coomaraswamy's stimulus as follows:

:In 1910 he became involved in a very public controversy, played out in the correspondence columns of The Times and elsewhere, on the status of Indian art. This had started when Sir [[George Birdwood]], while chairing the Indian Section of the annual meeting of the Royal Society of Arts, had announced that there was no “fine art” in India and had somewhat unwisely responded to the suggestion that a particular statue of the Buddha was an example of fine art: “This senseless similitude, in its immemorial fixed pose, is nothing more than an uninspired brazen image. . . . A boiled suet pudding would serve equally well as a symbol of passionless purity and serenity of soul.” This controversy culminated in the foundation of the India Society, later the Royal India Society, to combat the views of the Birdwoods of this world. Coomaraswamy played a major part in this endeavor.

In 1944 the Society was granted permission to become The Royal India Society under the patronage of the Dowager Queen [[Mary of Teck]]. After partition, its name was again changed to the Royal India and Pakistan Society, and then again to the Royal India, Pakistan, and Ceylon Society. In 1966 it merged with the [[East India Association]].

''' Santa Caterina del Monte di Pietà''' ("Saint Catherine of the Mount of Piety") was a [[Catholic]] church in [[Alcamo]], in the  [[province of Trapani]].

== History ==
The original church of this name was built in 1518 by the local [[Confraternity]] of the [[mount of piety]] (''Confraternita del Santo Monte di Pietà'') at the western side of the town's principal church. The confraternity's rectors decided to construct a new and better church on the [[main street]], Corso 6 Aprile, opposite the present [[Church of the saint Guardian Angel|Church of the Holy Guardian Angel]] also known as the Church of the ''Riparate''.

Cartografica, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; (The ''Riparate'' [sheltered women] were those who, abandoning an immoral life, took shelter in an institution without becoming nuns: those who became religious sisters were known as ''Repentite''.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=atlCCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT78&amp;dq=donne+riparate+significato&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=donne%20riparate%20significato&amp;f=false Alli Traina, ''101 storie su Palermo che non ti hanno mai raccontato'' (Newton Compton Editori 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The church on Corso 6 Aprile owed its importance to being the seat of this confraternity, which assisted the poor in cases of need or illness. It has long been closed to worship and has been [[deconsecration|deconsecrated]].

The confraternity's original church, which it abandoned, was in 1619 aggregated by the [[bishop of Mazara del Vallo]] to Holy Trinity [[Parish]]. It ended up being given in 1634 to the town's principal church for use as a [[courtyard]] leading to the [[sacristy]].&lt;ref name=alca/&gt;

== Description and works of art ==
The interior of the church had a single [[nave]] with paintings. One of the paintings, now in the [[Sacred Art Museum]] of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption]],&lt;ref name=catgui&gt;Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p.61, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; is of [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria]]. It dates from 1621 and is attributed to Giuseppe Carrera or Giacomo Lo Verde.

The rather handsome [[façade]] with a simple portal and four noteworthy pilasters on tall bases is of 1608.

== The Confraternity ==
The Confraternity was already in existence in 1430 and had its seat in the town's principal church. Probably in 1635, the ''Confraternity'' of the Holy [[mount of piety|Mount of Piety]] became the ''Company'' of the Holy Mount of Piety (''Compagnia del Santo Monte di Pietà'').&lt;ref name="catcon"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.76, Alcamo, Campo, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the Confraternity, "nobility and men of standing", wore as their ceremonial habit [[sackcloth]], [[baize]] cloaks and dark grey [[felt]] hats and a badge representing [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus]] in the [[burial of Jesus|tomb]].&lt;ref name="catcon"/&gt; After 1635, the members of the Company wore white sackcloth and [[visors]], with the [[emblem]] of Our Lord of Piety on their backs.

Their duties were:  
* to celebrate the feast of [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria]] on 25 November
* to help the poor with alms.
* to participate every Monday and during the [[Octave (liturgy)|octave]] of 2 November in [[Requiem Mass]] in Saint Catherine's Church for the dead
* on [[Holy Monday]] to go in procession with priests to the church of [[Saint Hippolytus]] for the victims of the 1575 [[Plague (disease)|plague]] who were buried there&lt;ref name="catcon"/&gt;

This [[cemetery]] was given to the Confraternity in 1581 for them to build there to build a church dedicated to [[God]] and the [[Virgin Mary]], and to the protectors from plague [[Saint Roch]] and [[Saint Sebastian]].

The Company was probably still active in 1924, but no longer exists.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Simple Symphony''''', Op. 4, is a work for [[string orchestra]] or [[string quartet]] by [[Benjamin Britten]].
It was written between December 1933 and February 1934 in [[Lowestoft]], using bits of score that the composer had written for the piano as a young teenager, between 1923 and 1926.  It was composed for string orchestra and received its first performance in 1934 at Stuart Hall in [[Norwich]], with Britten conducting an amateur orchestra.

The piece is dedicated to Audrey Alston (Mrs Lincolne Sutton), Britten's viola teacher during his childhood.
The piece is based on eight themes which Britten wrote during his childhood (two per movement) and for which he had a particular fondness. He completed his final draft of this piece at age twenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Britten : Simple Symphony, Op. 4|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/default.aspx?TabId=2432&amp;State_3041=2&amp;workId_3041=43248|work=Benjamin Britten : Simple Symphony, Op. 4|publisher=Chester Novello|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
*1st violin
*2nd violin
*Viola
*Cello
*Contrabass

==Structure==
It has four movements:
:I. ''Boisterous Bourrée'' 3'
::'''Themes Used'''
– Suite No. 1 in E for piano (18 October 1925), second movement (Bourrée: Allegro vivace)
– Song (Song) (1923) A Country Dance ('Now the King is home again'), text from Tennyson's The Foresters, for voice and piano.
:II. ''Playful Pizzicato'' 3'
::'''Themes Used'''
– Scherzo (piano) (1924) Sonata for Piano in B flat major, op. 5, Scherzo and Trio (Molto vivace)
– Song (1924) The Road Song of the "Bandar-Log" ('Here we go in a flung festoon', text by Rudyard Kipling), for voice and piano.
:III. ''Sentimental Sarabande'' 9'
::'''Themes Used'''
– Suite No. 3 (for piano) (1925) Suite No. 3, in F{{music|sharp}} minor, for piano, op. 25, Prelude (Allegro di molto)
– Waltz for piano (1923) [Waltz in B major for piano], (Tempo di valse)
:IV. ''Frolicsome Finale'' 3'15"
::'''Themes Used'''
– Piano Sonata No. 9 (1926) Piano Sonata No. 9, in C{{music|sharp}} minor, op. 38, Finale
– Song (1925)

Eight main themes appear in the symphony, with two movements, the most famous is the pizzicato. The entire pieces last about 20 minutes.  The second movement is popular with mandolin players as it is pizzicato. Prominent in this popular theme is 8 notes which sound familiar as echoing the opening of "Barwick Green" the theme music to the long-running BBC Radio 4 everyday story of country folk, "The Archers", written in 1924 by Arthur Wood.

==Later uses==
In 1944, the choreographer [[Walter Gore]] created a ballet also entitled ''[[Simple Symphony (Walter Gore ballet)|Simple Symphony]]'' for the [[Ballet Rambert]].&lt;ref name=Gore&gt;{{cite web|last=Potter|first=Michelle|title=‘Simple Symphony’: Walter Gore|url=http://michellepotter.org/articles/simple-symphony-walter-gore|work=Michelle Potter On Dancing|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many themes of the symphony are also used for the soundtrack ''[[Bad Blood (1986 film)|Bad Blood]]'' (1986) by [[Leos Carax]]. It appears in [[Wes Anderson]]'s film ''[[Moonrise Kingdom]]'' (2012), which prominently features many pieces by Britten. It also appears in the first season of [[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]] (2017).

The '''Symphony No. 2''' in [[D major]], [[Opus number|Op.]] 36, is a symphony in four movements written by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] between 1801 and 1802. The work is dedicated to [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]].

==Background==
Beethoven's Second Symphony was mostly written during Beethoven's stay at [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]] in 1802, at a time when his deafness was becoming more pronounced and he began to realize that it might be incurable. The work was premiered in the [[Theater an der Wien]] in Vienna on 5 April 1803, and was conducted by the composer. During that same concert, the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]] and the oratorio ''[[Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)|Christ on the Mount of Olives]]'' were also debuted.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"&gt;Steinberg, M. ''The Concerto: A Listener's Guide'', p.59–63, Oxford (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the last works of Beethoven's so-called "early period".

Beethoven wrote the Second Symphony without a standard [[minuet]]; instead, a [[scherzo]] took its place, giving the composition even greater scope and energy. The scherzo and the finale are filled with Beethovenian musical jokes, which shocked the sensibilities of many contemporary critics. One Viennese critic for the ''Zeitung fuer die elegante Welt'' (Newspaper for the Elegant World) famously wrote of the Symphony that it was "a hideously writhing, wounded dragon that refuses to die, but writhing in its last agonies and, in the fourth movement, bleeding to death."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/4147.html#tvf=tracks&amp;tv=about Beethoven Symphony No. 2], [[Allmusic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s in A, two [[bassoon]]s, two [[Horn (instrument)|horns]] in D, E and A, two [[trumpet]]s in D (first, third and fourth movements only), [[timpani]] (first, third and fourth movements only) and [[String section|strings]]. The composer also made a [[transcription (music)|transcription]] of the entire symphony for [[piano trio]] which bears the same [[opus number]].

This symphony consists of four movements:
#[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Adagio molto]], {{music|time|3|4}} – [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro]] con [[Glossary_of_musical_terminology#B|brio]], {{music|time|4|4}} ([[D major]])
#[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Larghetto]], {{music|time|3|8}} ([[A major]])
#[[Scherzo]]: Allegro, {{music|time|3|4}} (D major)
#Allegro molto, {{music|time|2|2}} (D major)

A typical performance runs 33 to 36 minutes.

===First movement===
The Introduction, ''Adagio molto'', begins in D major, changing to [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]] in [[Bar (music)|measure]] 11. In measures 12-16, it briefly [[Modulation (music)|modulates]] to B{{music|flat}} major and immediately back to D. The [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] (Allegro con brio) begins in D major with the A theme lasting until measure 57. A transition towards the B theme lasts until measure 72, modulating to [[A minor]] at measure 61. The B theme begins in A major at 73, moving to A minor again at 113 with a [[Coda (music)#Codetta|codetta]] from measure 117–136 (moving to D major in measure 120). The [[Development (music)|development]] uses material from the A theme, going through several modulations throughout and making use of the main idea from Theme A in sequence. At measure 216, the A theme returns in the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], lasting until measure 228. There is a retransition from 229–244, bringing back the B theme at measure 245, this time in the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] [[Key (music)|key]]. At 327, B{{music|flat}} major returns briefly, moving back to D in 334 with a [[coda (music)|Coda]] from measures 340–360.

===Second movement===
This movement, ''Larghetto'', is in the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] key of A major and is one of Beethoven's longest symphonic slow movements. There are clear indications of the influence of folk music and the pastoral, presaging his [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6 ("Pastoral")]].

The movement, like the first, is in [[sonata form]]. [[Franz Schubert]] quoted from the movement in the second movement of his [[Sonata in C major for piano four-hands, D 812 (Schubert)|Grand Duo]] for piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grove|first1=George C. B.|title=Beethoven and His Nine Symphonies|date=1962|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=28–33|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third movement===
This movement, ''Scherzo: Allegro'', encloses a melodious oboe and bassoon quartet within a typical-sounding Austrian side-slapping dance.

===Fourth movement===
The fourth movement, ''Allegro molto'', is composed of very rapid string passages. Musicologist [[Robert Greenberg]] of the [[San Francisco Conservatory of Music]] describes the highly unusual opening [[Motif (music)|motif]] as a hiccup, belch or flatulence followed by a groan of pain. According to Greenberg:

{{quote|Beethoven's gastric problems, particularly in times of great stress – like the fall of 1802 – were legendary. ... It has been understood almost since the day of its premiere that that is what this music is all about. Beethoven never refuted it; in fact, he must have encouraged it. Otherwise, how could such an interpretation become common coin? And common coin it is.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenberg, ''The Symphonies of Beethoven'', "Symphony No. 2: Beethoven at the Edge II", The Teaching Company (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Musicologist and composer Bryan Townsend refers to this assertion by Greenberg as "an example of musicological overreach".&lt;ref&gt;http://themusicsalon.blogspot.com/2013/07/beethoven-symphony-no-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg doesn't cite any references to back this interpretation he puts forth in his courses "The symphonies of Beethoven" and "How to listen to and understand great music".

In contrast to a mere "cookbook" [[User guide|manual]], technical documentation aims at providing enough information for a user to understand inner and outer dependencies of the product at hand.

If [[technical writer]]s are employed by the technology company, their task is to translate the usually highly formalized or abbreviated technical documentation produced during the development phase into more readable, "user-friendly" prose.

The documentation accompanying a piece of technology is often the only means by which the user can fully understand said technology; regardless, technical documentation is often considered a "necessary evil" by software developers. Consequently, the genre has suffered from what some industry experts lament as a lack of attention and precision.&lt;ref name=mob&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131009233720/http://www.istc.org.uk/what-is-technical-communication/the-documentation-scene/ The Documentation Scene] by John Mobbs.

==Forms of technical documentation==
Technical documentation may include:
* [[patent]]s
* [[specification]]s of item or of components/materials
* [[data sheet]]s of item or of components/materials

* [[manufacturing]] standards
*

During development, a multitude of document types will play a significant role:
*[[system requirements]]
*[[system design]]
*[[system architecture]]
and various intermediate or intervening documents thereof.

[[File:Pessoacopo.jpg|thumb|right| Fernando Pessoa drinking a glass of wine in a tavern in 1929.]]

'''''The Book of Disquiet''''' ('''''Livro do Desassossego: Composto por Bernardo Soares, ajudante de guarda-livros na cidade de Lisboa''''') is a work by the Portuguese author [[Fernando Pessoa]] (1888–1935). Published posthumously, ''The Book of Disquiet'' is a fragmentary lifetime project, left unedited by the author, who introduced it as a "factless autobiography."
The publication was credited to Bernardo Soares, one of the author's alternate writing names, which he called [[heteronym (literature)|semi-heteronym]]s, and had a preface attributed to Fernando Pessoa, another alternate writing name or [[heteronym (literature)|orthonym]].

These second-story eateries, usually empty except on Sundays, frequently contain curious types whose faces are not interesting but who constitute a series of digressions from life.|Fernando Pessoa, from ''The Book of Disquiet'', trans. Alfred MacAdam.}}

Much studied by "Pessoan" critics, who have different interpretations regarding the book's proper organization, ''The Book of Disquiet'' was first published in Portuguese in 1982, 47 years after Pessoa's death (the author died at age 47 in 1935). The book has seen publication in Spanish (1984), German (1985), Italian (1986), French (1988), and English (1991). The ''Book'' in 1991 had four English editions by different translators: [[Richard Zenith]] (editor and translator), Iain Watson, Alfred MacAdam and [[Margaret Jull Costa]]. The ''Book'' is a bestseller, especially in German (16 editions, from different translators and publishers).

The book was listed on the [[Bokklubben World Library|Norwegian Book Clubs list of the 100 best works of fiction of all time]], based on the responses of 100 authors from 54 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/content/view/print/505597/|title=The 100 best books of all time|date=2012-06-12|accessdate=2012-10-20|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|first=Molly|last=Driscoll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[Teresa Sobral Cunha]] considers that there are two versions of ''The Book of Disquiet''. According to Cunha, who with [[Jacinto do Prado Coelho]] and [[Maria Aliete Galhoz]] edited the first edition in 1982, there are two authors of the book: [[Vicente Guedes]] in a first phase (in the 1910s and 20s), and the aforementioned [[Bernardo Soares]] (late 1920s and 30s).

However, [[António Quadros]] considers that the first phase of the book belongs to Pessoa himself. The second phase, more personal and diary-like, is the one credited to Bernardo Soares.

Richard Zenith, editor of a new Portuguese edition in 1998, took the option of presenting a single volume, as in his English translation of 1991. In his introduction, he writes that "if Bernardo Soares does not measure up to the full Pessoa, neither are his diary writings the sum total of ''Disquietude'', to which he was after all a johnny-come-lately. ''The Book of Disquietude'' was various books (yet ultimately one book), with various authors (yet ultimately one author), and even the word ''disquietude'' changes meaning as time passes."&lt;ref&gt;PESSOA, Fernando, ''The Book of Disquietude'', tr. Richard Zenith, Carcanet Press, 1991, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|'''[[George Steiner]] on ''The Book Of Disquiet'': '''

"The fragmentary, the incomplete is of the essence of Pessoa's spirit. The very kaleidoscope of voices within him, the breadth of his culture, the catholicity of his ironic sympathies – wonderfully echoed in Saramago's great novel about Ricardo Reis – inhibited the monumentalities, the self-satisfaction of completion. Hence the vast torso of Pessoa's ''Faust'' on which he laboured much of his life. Hence the fragmentary condition of ''The Book of Disquiet,'' which contains material that predates 1913 and which Pessoa left open-ended at his death. As Adorno famously said, the finished work is, in our times and climate of anguish, a lie.&lt;br/&gt;

"It was to Bernardo Soares that Pessoa ascribed his ''Book of Disquiet'', first made available in English in a briefer version by Richard Zenith in 1991. The translation is at once penetrating and delicately observant of Pessoa's astute melancholy. What is this ''Livro do Desassossego''? Neither 'commonplace book', nor 'sketchbook', nor 'florilegium' will do. Imagine a fusion of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s [[Coleridge's notebooks|notebooks]] and marginalia, of Valéry's philosophic diary and of Robert Musil's voluminous journal. Yet even such a hybrid does not correspond to the singularity of Pessoa's chronicle. Nor do we know what parts thereof, if any, he ever intended for publication in some revised format."&lt;ref&gt;George Steiner, "A Man of Many Parts," ''The Observer'', Sunday, 3 June 2001. http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/jun/03/poetry.features1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''The City of Beautiful Nonsense''''' was a best-selling novel written by [[Ernest Temple Thurston]]. It became the inspiration for two films (see below for details). It was originally published by [[Chapman and Hall]] in 1909,&lt;ref name="Books and Persons"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|title=Books and Persons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aa29jG22CoMC&amp;pg=PA290|accessdate=September 19, 2012|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=978-1-4510-0667-4|pages=290–}}&lt;/ref&gt; but because the [[copyright]] has expired, the text of the book is now in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="Thurston1915"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernest Temple Thurston|title=The city of beautiful nonsense|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqbPAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=September 17, 2012|year=1915|publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a "new and illustrated" edition, with illustrations by Emile Verpilleux, published a year later in 1910. It may fairly be described as a sentimental novel: Temple Thurston himself wrote that "To many, from the first page to the last, it had not the faintest conception of reality, and indeed has earned for me the classification of sentimentalist". This was in the Author's Note to the sequel, entitled ''The World of Wonderful Reality'', published a decade later in 1919. His obituary in ''The Times'' (20 March 1933) stated that "there were those who might suggest that sentimentalism was too evident in Temple Thurston's work".  As well as being a vehicle for Edwardian romanticism, the novel shares the Roman Catholic faith of its author with its main characters.  It is a tale of two cities: mainly Edwardian London – the sidelights on life in London for the shabby genteel are interesting – but also Venice.

==Films==
The first film based on the novel was ''[[The City of Beautiful Nonsense (1919 film)|The City of Beautiful Nonsense]]'', a [[silent movie]] released in 1919,&lt;ref name="Advance: (1920)"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advance: (1920)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXM0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA291|accessdate=September 17, 2012|year=1920|publisher=Congregational Publishing Society|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured [[Henry Edwards (actor)|Henry Edwards]], [[Chrissie White]] and [[Henry Vibart]]

The second film was a [[Sound film|talkie]], released in 1935 as ''[[City of Beautiful Nonsense (1935 film)|City of Beautiful Nonsense]]''. It starred [[Emlyn Williams]], [[Sophie Stewart]] and [[Eve Lister]]. Both were filmed and produced in the United Kingdom.

The film was a box office success, raising $142 million from a budget of $15 million. The film received positive reviews from critics, receiving praise for its acting, direction, screenplay, score, and production merits; but it was also criticized by some critics for being "over-sentimental" and "stereotypical." The film was nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], without winning any; it also received four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, with [[Whoopi Goldberg]] winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama|Best Actress in a Drama]]. Steven Spielberg didn't receive an Academy Award nomination for his directing, but did receive a [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film|Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement]], and a Golden Globe nomination. The film was later included in [[Roger Ebert]]'s book series ''[[The Great Movies]]''.

==Plot==
Celie Harris is an [[African Americans|African-American]] teenager in early 20th century rural [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] who had had two children by her abusive stepfather, both of whom have been taken from her. She is given away as a wife to widower Albert Johnson, who already has three children, and is soon abused. Celie's sister Nettie, whom she has vowed to protect, escapes their abusive stepfather and seeks shelter at the Johnson estate. Albert immediately takes a romantic interest in Nettie and lets her stay, where she and Celie promise to write each other should they ever be separated. Nettie teaches Celie to read and the two are happy together, until Albert sexually assaults Nettie while on her way to school. She successfully fights him off, and is forcibly removed from the property.

Years later, Celie is now a meek adult who has avoided standing up to Johnson's continued abuse. His eldest son Harpo marries his girlfriend Sofia, a strong-willed, boisterous character, and Celie is shocked to find her running a matriarchal household. On Albert's advice, Harpo attempts to overpower and strike Sofia in an attempt to better control her. After he fails, he asks Celie what to do. Confronted with her own inability to stand up to abuse, she also advises Harpo to start beating Sofia. Sofia forcefully retaliates, and confronts Celie about what she told Harpo, threatening to kill him if he beats her again and telling Celie to do likewise to Albert. Sofia eventually leaves Harpo, taking her children with her.

Johnson and Harpo bring home Shug Avery, a [[showgirl]] and the former's long-time [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], as she suffers from an unknown illness. Celie, who has slowly developed a fondness for Shug through a photograph sent to Johnson, does not object to Shug's presence, and is in awe of Shug's strong-will and ability to stand up to Albert. She goes above and beyond in nursing Shug back to health, and Shug in turn takes a liking to her, writing and performing a song about her at Harpo's newly-opened bar. Obsessed with Shug, Celie follows her around and learns she is in ill standing with the reverend, who is angry about Shug’s wild lifestyle. Celie decides to follow Shug to Memphis, but gets caught by Albert while she’s frantically packing her things.

Sofia is imprisoned and separated from her children after being instigated into a violent confrontation that results in a riot. Years pass, and she is released from prison only to be immediately ordered by the judge to become a maid to the Mayor's wife, Ms. Millie. Having not seen her children in eight years, Sofia is allotted Christmas to be with her family, and Ms. Millie tries to drive her, but panics and turns around after encountering a group of Sofia's friends who are only trying to help her.

Shug returns to the Johnson household with her new husband Grady, expecting to receive a [[recording contract]]. Shug gives Celie a letter from Nettie, who tells her that she's working for a couple that has adopted Celie's children. Celie and Shug realize that Johnson has been hiding Nettie's letters from Celie; while he and Grady are out drinking, the two search the house and find a hidden compartment under the floorboards filled with dozens and dozens of letters. Engrossed in reading Nettie’s letters, Celie does not hear Albert’s calls to shave him and he beats her. Celie considers killing Albert with the straight-razor, but Shug intervenes and stops her. At a family gathering including the Johnsons, the Averys, and Sofia's family, Celie finally speaks up against Albert, to Shug and Sofia’s delight, who breaks her silence and finds her old fighting spirit, which prompts Harpo’s new wife to stand up for herself as well. Johnson continues to berate Celie, who then threatens  and curses him. Shug and Grady drive away, taking Celie with them.

Years later, Celie owns and operates a [[Tailor|tailor shop]], Johnson is old and alone, and Harpo has made amends with Sofia; the two now running the bar together. Celie's stepfather passes away, and she finally learns from Nettie’s letters that he wasn't their biological father, and that when their mother passed, the Harris property was legally inherited by Celie and Nettie. After not having performed since her illness, Shug starts singing at Harpo’s bar again. Johnson receives a letter from Nettie addressed to Celie, takes money from his secret stash and helps Nettie, her husband, and Celie’s children return to the USA, where they finally reunite while Johnson watches from a distance.

The film received positive reviews from critics, receiving praise for its acting, direction, screenplay, score, and production merits, but was criticized by some for being "over-sentimental" and "stereotypical." [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 85% based on reviews from 27 critics, with an average score of 6.9/10. The website's critical consensus states: "A sentimental tale that reveals great emotional truths in American history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/color_purple/ | title= The Color Purple (1985) | publisher= [[Fandango Media]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate= 2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Color Purple Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-color-purple |accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film four stars, calling it "the year's best film." He also praised [[Whoopi Goldberg]], calling her role "one of the most amazing debut performances in movie history" and predicting she would win the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. (She was nominated but did not win.) Ebert wrote of ''The Color Purple'':
{{blockquote|The world of Celie and the others is created so forcibly in this movie that their corner of the South becomes one of those movie places — like [[Land of Oz|Oz]], like [[Tara (plantation)|Tara]], like [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]] — that lay claim to their own geography in our imaginations. The affirmation at the end of the film is so joyous that this is one of the few movies in a long time that inspires tears of happiness, and earns them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ebert, Roger|title= The Color Purple|date=Dec 20, 1985|work= Chicago Sun Times|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19851220/REVIEWS/512200302 |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ebert's long-time television collaborator, [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', praised the film as "triumphantly emotional and brave," calling it Spielberg's "successful attempt to enlarge his reputation as a director of youthful entertainments." Siskel wrote that ''The Color Purple'' was "a plea for respect for black women." Although acknowledging that the film was a period drama, he praised its "... incredibly strong stand against the way black men treat black women. Cruel is too kind a word to describe their behavior. The principal black men in ''The Color Purple'' use their women — both wives and daughters — as sexual chattel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Siskel, Gene|title= ''Color Purple'': Powerful, Daring, Sweetly Uplifting|date=Dec 20, 1985|work= Chicago Tribune|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-12-20/entertainment/8503280315_1_color-purple-black-men-film |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Times]]'' film critic [[Janet Maslin]] noted the film's divergence from Walker's book, but made the case that this shift works:
{{blockquote|Mr. Spielberg has looked on the sunny side of Miss Walker's novel, fashioning a grand, multi-hanky entertainment that is as pretty and lavish as the book is plain. If the book is set in the harsh, impoverished atmosphere of rural Georgia, the movie unfolds in a cozy, comfortable, flower-filled wonderland. ... Some parts of it are rapturous and stirring, others hugely improbable, and the film moves unpredictably from one mode to another. From another director, this might be fatally confusing, but Mr. Spielberg's showmanship is still with him. Although the combination of his sensibilities and Miss Walker's amounts to a colossal mismatch, Mr. Spielberg's ''Color Purple'' manages to have momentum, warmth and staying power all the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Maslin, Janet|title= Film: 'The Color Purple,' from Steven Spielberg |date=Dec 18, 1985|work=New York Times|url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/spielberg-color.html|accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' found the film over-sentimental, writing, "there are some great scenes and great performances in ''The Color Purple'', but it is not a great film. Steven Spielberg's turn at 'serious' film-making is marred in more than one place by overblown production that threatens to drown in its own emotions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Color Purple|date=Dec 31, 1984|work= Variety|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790003.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some critics alleged that the movie stereotyped black people in general&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Clegg II, Legrand H.(Chairman, Coalition Against Black Exploitation, Compton)|title= Bad Black Roles In 'Purple' |date=Feb 16, 1986|work=The Los Angeles Times|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-16/entertainment/ca-8496_1_black-family-black-youths-black-man|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and black men in particular,&lt;ref name="Friendly" /&gt; pointing to the fact that Spielberg, a Jew, had directed a predominantly African American story.&lt;ref name=Matthews2&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthews, Jack|title= 3 'Color Purple' Actresses Talk About Its Impact |date=Jan 31, 1986|work=The Los Angeles Times|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-31/entertainment/ca-2876_1_color-purple|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[Oliver Stone]] defended ''The Color Purple'' as "an excellent movie, and it was an attempt to deal with an issue that had been overlooked, and it wouldn't have been done if it hadn't been Spielberg. And it's not like everyone says, that he ruined the book. That's horseshit. Nobody was going to ''do'' the book. He made the book live again."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Marc.

In 2004, Ebert included ''The Color Purple'' in his list of "Great Movies". He stated that "I can see its flaws more easily than when I named it the best film of 1985, but I can also understand why it moved me so deeply, and why the greatness of some films depends not on their perfection or logic, but on their heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=The Color Purple Movie Review (1985)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-color-purple-1985|website=rogerebert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Inspiration of Saint Matthew''''' (1602) is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] master [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio|Caravaggio]]. Commissioned by the French Cardinal Matteo Contarelli, the canvas hangs in Contarelli chapel altar in the church of the French congregation [[San Luigi dei Francesi]] in [[Rome, Italy]]. It is one of three Caravaggio canvases in the chapel: hanging between the larger earlier canvases of ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew]]'', and ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of Saint Matthew]]''. This was not an easy commission for Caravaggio, and at least two of the three paintings had to be either replaced or repainted to satisfy his patron, the [[Francesco Maria Del Monte|Cardinal Del Monte]]. 

It is instructive to compare the two versions of the latter painting to see how provocative and controversial Caravaggio was in his time. Unfortunately, the first, rejected, version of this theme was destroyed in [[World War II]], and we only have black and white and enhanced color reproductions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/cgi-bin/highlight.cgi?file=html/c/caravagg/04/25conta.html&amp;find=matthew Web Gallery of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; In the first version, ''[[Saint Matthew and the Angel]]'', the angel stands close to [[Matthew the Evangelist]] personal space and engages in what appears more direct intervention than divine inspiration. The angel intertwines with the old man, apparently whispering inspiration into his ear. The rejected painting can be compared to the earlier Caravaggio canvas of the ''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Caravaggio)|Rest on the Flight into Egypt]]''.

In the work featured on the altar, the angel belongs to an aerial and sublime dimension, enveloped in an encircling rippled sheet. The restless Matthew leans to work, as the angel enumerates for him the work to come. All is darkness but for the two large figures. Matthew appears to have rushed to his desk, his stool teetering into our space. His expression is sober.

It is thought the contemporary styles of Caravaggio and [[Annibale Carracci|Carracci]] were at odds with each other, and non overlapping. In this light it is instructive to compare and contrast a similar canvas, by Carracci's pupil, [[Giovanni Lanfranco]] presently in [[Piacenza]] as well as a painting on a similar theme by [[Rembrandt]].

'''William Onyeabor''' (26 March 1946 – 16 January 2017) was a [[Nigerian]] [[funk]] musician and businessman.&lt;ref name="New Yorker 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Donohue|first=John|title=Doctor Who|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/2014/05/05/140505goli_GOAT_nightlife_donohue|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=5 May 2014|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His music was widely heard in Nigeria in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but he remained an enigmatic figure, private and reclusive.

Onyeabor's songs are often heavily rhythmic and synthesized, occasionally epic in scope, with lyrics decrying war and sung by both Onyeabor himself and female backing vocalists. In the 2010s, some of his songs appeared on various compilations, most frequently his biggest hit, "Better Change Your Mind", which appeared on ''[[Africa 100]]'', ''World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing – The Funky Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Temptations of the Power Ballad |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/13/arts/music/13play.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 February 2005 |accessdate=27 July 2010 | first=Jon | last=Pareles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A whole new beginning; New New Pornographers, no coup for Trews and some funky good times |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/886680641.html?dids=886680641:886680641&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+25%2C+2005&amp;author=MICHAEL+BARCLAY&amp;pub=The+Record&amp;desc=A+whole+new+beginning%3B+New+New+Pornographers%2C+no+coup+for+Trews+and+some+funky+good+times&amp;pqatl=google |work=[[Waterloo Region Record|The Record]] |date=25 August 2005 |accessdate=27 July 2010 | first=Michael | last=Barclay}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970's Funky Lagos'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Various – Nigeria 70 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10573910 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=27 July 2010 |first=Scott |last=Kara}}&lt;/ref&gt; through labels such as [[Luaka Bop]].

==Biography==
Onyeabor was born into a poor family, but became financially successful enough to travel to Europe to study record manufacturing.&lt;ref name=graun&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/18/who-was-william-onyeabor-nigerian-synthesizer-whiz |title=William Onyeabor: one of music’s most insoluble puzzles to the end |last=Lynskey |first=Dorian |date=18 January 2017 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biographies claim that he studied [[cinematography]] in [[Russia]], returning to Nigeria in the 1970s to start his own Wilfilms music label and to set up a recording and production studio. He was later crowned a [[High Chief]] in [[Enugu]], where he lived as a businessman working on government contracts and running his own [[semolina]] flour mill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roughtrade.com/events/2013/10/233 "A William Onyeabor Experience", Rough Trade Records]. Retrieved 11 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=graun /&gt; His business successes saw him named West African Industrialist of the Year in 1987.&lt;ref name=graun /&gt; 

According to the Luaka Bop record label, Onyeabor "self-released eight albums between 1977 and 1985 and then became a [[born-again Christian]], refusing to ever speak about himself or his music again." The label reported that through attempting to speak with Onyeabor himself, and by talking to people who seem to have firsthand knowledge, it tried to construct an accurate biography of him for 18 months, without success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://luakabop.com/onyeabor/ "Who is William Onyeabor?", Luaka Bop Records]. Retrieved 11 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the music website Noisey, affiliated to ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine, released a 31-minute documentary entitled ''Fantastic Man'' that documents Onyeabor's history and legacy as well as Noisey's attempt to track him down for an interview.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiaRp0M2fxE/ Fantastic Man – A Film About William Onyeabor]. Retrieved 19 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 2014 also saw a touring supergroup called the [[Atomic Bomb! Band]] come together to play Onyeabor's music at a series of concerts and festivals around the world. The group is led by Music Director Ahmed Gallab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidbyrne.com/journal/rip-william-onyeabor|title=RIP William Onyeabor|publisher=David Byrne}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his band [[Sinkane]] and includes [[David Byrne]] (of [[Talking Heads]]), [[Money Mark]] (of the [[Beastie Boys]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/05/arts/music/the-songs-of-william-onyeabor-at-the-brooklyn-academy-of-music.html?_r=0 |title=The Songs of William Onyeabor, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damon Albarn]] (of [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Gorillaz]]), [[Dev Hynes]] (aka Blood Orange and Lightspeed Champion),&lt;ref name=graun /&gt; [[Alexis Taylor]] (of [[Hot Chip]]), [[Charles Lloyd (jazz musician)|Charles Lloyd]] and [[Amadou and Mariam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/23/sunno-william-onyeabor-david-byrne-meltdown-observer-review |title=Sunn O))); Atomic Bomb! review – cacophony in the key of ))) major |last=Empire |first=Kitty |author-link=Kitty Empire|date=23 August 2015|website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other admirers of Onyeabor's work include [[Dan Snaith]], [[Four Tet]] and [[Tune-Yards]].&lt;ref name=graun /&gt;  His song "Fantastic Man" was featured in Apple's iPhone 7 Plus "Barbers" commercial in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Apple|title=iPhone 7 Plus — Barbers — Apple|date=2017-05-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcMSrKi8hZA|accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, William Onyeabor made his debut radio broadcast on the [[Lauren Laverne]] Show on [[BBC 6 Music]], where he stated "I only create music that will help the world," whilst also admitting that he had never played live, and announcing that he had plans to release new material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Exclusive: Lauren chats to William Onyeabor Parts 1 &amp; 2|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02dz549|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onyeabor had four children. He died, aged 70, on 16 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Legendary Nigerian musician, William Onyeabor dies at 72|url=http://www.lindaikejimusic.com/news/legendary-nigerian-musician-william-onyeabor-dies-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Éamon a Búrc''' (1866&amp;ndash;1942) was a tailor and Irish storyteller or ''[[seanchaí]]''.

Born to an [[Irish language|Irish]]-speaking family in [[Carna, County Galway]], Ireland, Éamon a Búrc, was brought by his parents to [[Graceville, Minnesota]] in 1880. Their passage was paid for by [[Archbishop]] [[John Ireland (archbishop)|John Ireland]], who wished to fill up the [[Minnesota]] [[prairie]] with [[Irish-American]] farm families. After a severe [[blizzard]] struck on 15 October 1880, the condition of the [[Connemara]] refugees became an international scandal. The a Búrc family was evicted from their claim and resettled in a [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] [[shantytown]] which was dubbed the [[Swede Hollow|Connemara Patch]]. Éamon and his father went to work for the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] of [[James J. Hill]]. After losing a leg in a work-related accident, Éamon returned to [[Ireland]] and went to work as a [[tailor]] at his home in the village of [[Aill na Brón]], near his native Carna.

In the Fall of 1935, he was visited by [[Séamus Ó Duilearga]] and [[Liam Mac Coisdeala]], representatives of the [[Irish Folklore Commission]]. They recorded his repertoire of legends and folk poetry on a collection of [[Ediphone]] cylinders. The recordings were later transcribed, filling more than 2,000 pages of manuscript.

The Encyclopaedia of Ireland states: ''"He was perhaps the finest storyteller collected from in the twentieth century. The longest folk-tale ever recorded in Ireland - taking three nights to tell and amounting to more than 30,000 words - was collected from him."''
