'''Associação Portuguesa da Cortiça''' is the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Cork (material)|Cork]] Association, a [[consortium]] of cork growers and manufacturers. It was founded in 1956 and is based in the town of Santa Maria de Lamas in northern Portugal. The current president of APCOR is [[António Rios de Amorim]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realcork.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

A current issue for the association is the decreasing support for cork as a [[bottle]] seal, as the popularity of [[plastic]] and other [[stopper (plug)|stopper]]s rises.

There is a major discussion about which closure suits [[wine]] the best. There are several reports defending the use of [[screw cap (wine)|screwcaps]], mostly coming from [[New Zealand]], but for each report defending the use of screwcaps, there is also another report defending the use of corks.

[[Malay titles#Datuk Sri|Datuk Seri Panglima]] '''Abdul Azeez bin Abdul Rahim''' ([[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: عبدالعزيز بن عبدالرحيم; born 19 November 1966) is a [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] politician. Abdul Azeez is also the Member of the [[Dewan Rakyat|Parliament of Malaysia]] for the seat of [[Baling (federal constituency)|Baling]] in the state of [[Kedah]]. He is a member of [[United Malay National Organisation|UMNO]], a major component of the [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition. Due to his South Indian descent, he speaks fluent Tamil in addition to Malay and English.

==Government linked companies (GLC) and Non-governmental organisations (NGO)==
In 2011 Abdul Azeez became a director of [[Tabung Haji]], a Malaysian fund for Muslims to save for the ''[[hajj]]'' pilgrimage. In 2013, after his election to Parliament, he became Tabung Haji's chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/baling-mp-abdul-azeez-is-new-tabung-haji-chair/ |title=Baling MP Abdul Azeez is new Tabung Haji chair |date=2 July 2013 |work=The Malaysian Insider |accessdate=27 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204112405/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/baling-mp-abdul-azeez-is-new-tabung-haji-chair/ |archivedate=4 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However in 2018, after his reelection as member of parliament and the change of ruling government to [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH), he resigned as chairman of Tabung Haji.&lt;ref name ="TH resign"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2018/05/24/azeez-confirms-he-has-quit-tabung-haji-as-chairman/|title=Azeez confirms he has quit as Tabung Haji chairman|author= |date=24 May 2018|work=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azeez also founded and headed the Putera 1Malaysia Club (Kelab Putera 1Malaysia), a non-government organization that has, among other things, led humanitarian missions to [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/node/25442|title=NGO declares Gaza mission a success|date=22 August 2014|work=New Straits Times|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 [[Hamas]] appointed him as an honorary ambassador for [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/abdul-azeez-appointed-honorary-ambassador-for-palestine/ |title=Abdul Azeez appointed honorary ambassador for Palestine |date=13 December 2012 |work=The Malaysian Insider |accessdate=27 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204112515/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/abdul-azeez-appointed-honorary-ambassador-for-palestine/ |archivedate=4 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aída M. Álvarez''' (born 1950) is a Puerto Rican businesswoman and politician. She is the first [[Latino|Latina]] woman to hold a [[United States Cabinet]]-level position, as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, during Bill Clinton's presidency.

==Early years==
Alvarez was born in [[Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]] into a family of modest economical means, who despite their hardships always encouraged her to pursue her dreams. After she received her primary education in Puerto Rico, her family moved to [[New York City]] in hopes of improving their economic situation. In New York, she attended high school and participated in a program called "ASPIRA". "ASPIRA" was founded by [[Antonia Pantoja|Dr. Antonia Pantoja]] and has helped disadvantaged children, especially girls, gain the leadership skills and knowledge required to go to college.

Álvarez applied and was accepted at [[Radcliffe College]] of [[Harvard University]] where in 1971 she earned her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, graduating ''cum laude''. During her student years many people provided her with support.

==Journalist for the ''New York Post''==
Álvarez began her career as a [[journalist]] for the ''[[New York Post]]'' and won a "Front Page Award". She later became a news reporter and [[anchor]] for Metromedia Television (Channel Five) also in New York. In 1982, she won an [[Associated Press]] Award for Excellence and she was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for her reporting of guerilla activities in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;[http://gale.cengage.com/free_resources/chh/bio/alvarez_a.htm Gale Cengage learning] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227053753/http://gale.cengage.com/free_resources/chh/bio/alvarez_a.htm |date=December 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Álvarez ventured into the banking business by becoming an investment banker at the [[First Boston Corporation]] and at [[Bear Stearns]]. As a public servant, she spent two years at the NYC Health and Hospitals Corp. She was also a commissioner on the New York City Charter Revision Commission and a member of the Mayor's (NYC) Committee on Appointments. On June 1993, Álvarez was named Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. She created a financial safety and soundness oversight program for [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]].&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt;

==Small Business Administration==
[[File:President Clinton meeting with advisers on Air Force One.jpg|thumb|250px| Aída Álvarez with President Clinton and Clinton administration advisers on Air Force One]]
In 1997, Álvarez was appointed by [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]], Administrator of the [[Small Business Administration]], thus becoming the first Hispanic woman and Puerto Rican to serve as an executive officer in the U.S. Cabinet. She directed the delivery of a comprehensive set of financial and business development programs for [[United States|American]] small businesses. The agency provided financing worth eleven billion dollars a year to small businesses across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ns.umich.edu/htdocs/releases/story.php?id=2941 University of Michigan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Álvarez was elected to the Board of Overseers of Harvard University. Her role is to visit the graduate schools, departments and museums of the University to ensure that the University remains true to its Charter as a place of learning. She also serves on the National Trust for Historic Preservation; the Coalition for Supportive Housing and is on the Board of Trustees of the [[Latino Community Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential Election]], Álvarez was named official spokeswoman for [[Senator]] [[John Kerry]]. Álvarez had met Kerry during her days as the Small Business Administration administrator. She became familiar with his work in the [[U.S. Senate]] for small business development.&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt; As of January 2008, Alvarez sits on the board of directors for [[Wal-Mart]]. As of 2014, Álvarez sits on the Board of Directors of [[The Cisneros Center for New Americans]].

Álvarez has been featured in many magazines, among them "[[Latina Style magazine|Latina Style]]" and is featured in the book "Hard Won Wisdom" by [[Fawn Gerner]], where she is quoted as saying:

Godin said the inspiration came to him when he "watched the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] lose the [[United States presidential election, 2004|election [in 2004]]]."&lt;ref name=helloworld&gt;[http://www.helloworldblog.com/2005/05/business_blog_b.html Business Blog Tour: Seth "Pinnocchio" Godin] on HelloWord, May 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that although both candidates told lies, the candidate that won told the more believable lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 2008-07-13}} Both candidates, he said, were telling lies, but the candidate that won told the more believable lie -- that he was a strong, certain, infallible leader."&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he noticed [[Karl Rove]]'s ability to tell a story, noting that he's a "very good liar."&lt;ref name=helloworld/&gt;

== Description ==
All Marketers Are Liars uses examples from areas such as [[organic products]], the [[Goodyear Blimp]], and [[Cold Stone]] to illustrate the power of marketing an authentic story. From the book jacket:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"All marketers tell stories. And if they do it right, we believe them. We believe that wine tastes better in a $20 glass than a $1 glass. We believe that an $80,000 Porsche Cayenne is vastly superior to a $36,000 VW Touareg, even if it is virtually the same car. We believe that $225 Pumas will make our feet feel better--and look cooler--than $20 no names. . . and believing it makes it true."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Seth Godin|Godin]] uses the idea that consumers will believe whatever they want to believe. The idea that there is no concrete 'self-fulfilling truth' is expressed in the preface.&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Here's the first half of the simple summary: We believe what we want to believe, and once we believe something, it becomes a self-fulfilling truth."&lt;ref&gt;Godin, Seth "All Marketers Are Liars" pg XV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Godin claims that marketers are not, in fact, supposed to lie. Godin expresses that marketers should be storytellers - but truthful ones. From page XVI in the Preface: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Here's the second part of the summary: When you are busy telling stories to people who want to hear them, you'll be tempted to tell stories that just don't hold up. Lies. Deceptions. This sort of storytelling used to work pretty well. [[Joe McCarthy]] became famous while lying about the "Communist Threat." Bottled water companies made billions while lying about the purity of their product compared with tap water in the developed world. The thing is, lying doesn't pay off anymore. That's because when you fabricate a story that just doesn't hold up to scrutiny, you get caught. Fast."&lt;ref&gt;Godin, Seth "All Marketers Are Liars" pg XVI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following his own lead, Godin's title for the book is a lie. He wrote in the introduction: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I wasn't being completely truthful with you when I named this book. Marketers aren't liars. They are just storytellers... I was trying to go to the edges. No one would hate a book called All Marketers Are Storytellers. No one would disagree with it. No one would challenge me on it. No one would talk about it."&lt;ref&gt;Godin, Seth ''All Marketers Are Liars'' pgs 15, 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Press and reviews==
Before its publication, All Marketers Are Liars was serialized in [[Fortune Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Archibald Clark''' (1805 – 17 October 1875) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] 19th-century Member of Parliament in the [[Auckland Region]], New Zealand. He was the first [[Mayor of Auckland City|Mayor of Auckland]] in 1851. His company, Archibald Clark and Sons, manufactured clothing and was a wholesaler.

==Early life==

In 1851, local government was inaugurated in Auckland with the establishment of the Borough of Auckland. Clark was elected as the inaugural and only mayor of the borough council, serving in 1851–1852. However the legality of Auckland's elevation as a Borough was legally contested and overturned. Auckland was placed under the care of a Board of Governors, whose Chairman was Archibald Clark. He was succeeded by [[Walter Lee (New Zealand politician)|Walter Lee]], who was chairman in 1852–1854. It was not until 1871, that Auckland was formally incorporated and [[Philip Philips]] was elected as the first mayor of the city council (by the other city councillors and not by popular vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Auckland City |url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/introduction/bush/mayors.asp |publisher=Auckland Council |accessdate=17 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927130614/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/introduction/bush/mayors.asp |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auckland mayors |url=http://www.aucklandcitylibraries.com/populartopics/resourcepages/localhistory/Auckland-mayors.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728160838/http://www.aucklandcitylibraries.com/populartopics/resourcepages/localhistory/Auckland-mayors.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 July 2012 |publisher=Auckland City Libraries |accessdate=17 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bachelor of Economics''' (BEc or BEcon) is a four-year [[academic degree]] in the [[social science]]s encompassing both qualitative and [[Mathematical model|quantitative]] courses. Typical mandatory courses for the degree include [[microeconomics]], [[macroeconomics]], [[econometrics]], [[economic statistics]], [[history of economic thought]] and [[political economy]].

Some [[university|universities]] offer [[undergraduate degree]] students the opportunity to specialise in a particular area of economics, such as: [[agricultural economics]], [[econometrics]], environmental and resource economics, [[financial economics]], and [[political economy]].&lt;ref name="University of Sydney course information"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-economics|title=BACHELOR OF ECONOMICS|publisher=The University of Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
In Australia, a '''Bachelor of Economics with Honours''' degree is a four-year degree and is taken subsequently as an extension to the three-year Bachelor of Economics. The degree consists of a single-year full-time program. The degree requires more academic courses with a researched [[thesis]] component.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/uc/bachelor-of-economics-honours.html |title=Bachelor of Economics (Honours) |website=University of Sydney |access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, the [[University of Hong Kong]] offers a four-year Bachelor of Economics degree,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fbe.hku.hk/academic-programmes/undergraduate/becon |title=Bachelor of Economics [BEcon] |website=University of Hong Kong |access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an option to take a double major in Economics and Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fbe.hku.hk/academic-programmes/undergraduate/becon-fin |title=Bachelor of Economics and Finance [BEcon&amp;Fin] |website=University of Hong Kong |access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brown–Gibson model''' is one of the many techniques for [[Multi-criteria decision analysis|multi-attribute decision making]]. The method was developed in 1972 by P. Brown and D. Gibson. This is one of the few models which integrates both [[objectivity (science)|objective]] and [[subjectivity|subjective]] factors in [[decision making]].

The Brown–Gibson model can be [[mathematics|mathematically]] represented as follows –

: &lt;math&gt; M_i = C_i X \big[ DXO_i + (1-D)S_i \big] &lt;/math&gt;

where

''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = measure for an alternative ''i''

''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = critical [[design of experiments|factor]] measure, which could be either be 0 or 1 for an alternative ''i''

''O'' = [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective factor]] measure, which could be between 0 and 1; however, the sum of all objective factor measures for different alternatives should add back to 1

''S'' = [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective factor]] measure, which could be between 0 and 1; however, the sum of all subjective factor measures for different alternatives should add back to 1

''D'' = objective factor decision weight; should be between 0 and 1

One would select the alternative whose measure is the highest.

{{Good article}}
[[File:Joseph Ralph Burton.jpg|thumb|right|Sen. Burton]]
'''''Burton v. United States''''' is the name of two appeals to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] by Senator [[Joseph R. Burton]] (R-KS) following his conviction for compensated representation of a party in a proceeding in which the United States was interested: ''Burton v. United States'', 196 U.S. 283 (1905)&lt;ref&gt;Burton v. United States (''Burton I''), 196 U.S. 283 (1905).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Burton v. United States'', 202 U.S. 344 (1906).&lt;ref&gt;Burton v. United States (''Burton II''), 202 U.S. 344 (1906).&lt;/ref&gt; Burton was convicted of acting as counsel to [[Rialto Grain and Securities Company]] in the [[United States Postmaster General]]'s investigation of Rialto for [[mail and wire fraud|mail fraud]].

On Burton's first appeal, the Supreme Court reversed his convictions because [[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Trial by jury|venue]] and [[Vicinage Clause|vicinage]] could not be proper in the Eastern District of Missouri on the sole ground that Burton's bank sent the check to St. Louis after he cashed it. Further, the Court cited the prejudicial refusal of jury instructions. After Burton was retried and convicted, the Court affirmed, inter alia, on the ground that the agreement between Burton and Rialto had occurred in St. Louis.

Burton was the first defendant convicted under § 1782 of the [[Revised Statutes of the United States|Revised Statutes]], 40 years after its 1864 enactment. Burton and his supporters argued that he was selectively prosecuted, on the orders of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], for political reasons. Burton also became the [[List of United States federal officials convicted of corruption offenses|first member]] of the [[United States Senate]] to be convicted of [[Federal prosecution of public corruption in the United States|public corruption]], in fact the first member of the Senate to be convicted of any crime.&lt;ref&gt;United States Senate Historical Office, [https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Expulsion_Censure.htm Expulsion and Censure].&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Senator [[John H. Mitchell]] (R-OR) was convicted under the same statute for his role in the [[Oregon land fraud scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry A. O'Callaghan, ''Senator Mitchell and the Oregon Land Frauds, 1905'', 21 {{smallcaps|Pac. Hist. Rev.}} 255 (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Rialto Bridge at night2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rialto]] was named for the historic financial center in Venice.]]

===Rialto Co.'s matter===
In 1872, Congress created the crime of [[mail and wire fraud|mail fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jed S. Rakoff]], ''The Federal Mail Fraud Statute (Part I)'', 18 {{smallcaps|Duq. L. Rev.}} 771 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Revised Statutes of the United States|Rev. Stat.]] § 3929 authorized the [[United States Postmaster General]], "upon evidence satisfactory to him" that mail fraud was being committed, to instruct the post master at the fraudster's local post office to return [[registered mail]] addressed to the fraudster to the sender with the word "Fraudulent" written or stamped on the envelope.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Stat. § 3929.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, this authority was extended to all mail.&lt;ref&gt;Act of Mar. 2, 1895, ch. 191, 26 Stat. 465; 28 Stat. 963, 964.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Rev. Stat. § 4041 authorized the Postmaster to also bar suspected fraudsters from cashing postal [[money order]]s.&lt;ref&gt;26 Stat. 465, 466 (codified at Rev. Stat. § 4041).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rialto Grain and Securities Company]], whose principal place of business was in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], was under investigation by the Postmaster for mail fraud.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 360&amp;ndash;363.&lt;/ref&gt; The Postmaster had received two complaints and forwarded them for investigation on November 7, 1902.&lt;ref name="b283"/&gt; State courts were also investigating complaints from investors against Rialto.&lt;ref name="nyt4"/&gt; [[Hugh C. Dennis]], the President of Rialto, and other officers had been criminally indicted, but (at the time of Burton's indictment) none had been convicted.&lt;ref name="nyt4"/&gt; As of Burton's indictment, Dennis had been once acquitted in federal court and four indictments were pending against him in state courts.&lt;ref name="nyt4"/&gt; For a time, Rialto's offices had been closed due to a judicial [[Attachment (law)|attachment]] by its creditors.&lt;ref name="nyt4"/&gt;

===Burton's representation===
[[File:PNC Bank - Pennsylvania Avenue.JPG|thumb|right|Burton deposited his checks at [[Riggs National Bank]].]]
That same month&amp;mdash;while the two were in Illinois, en route from St. Louis to Chicago&amp;mdash;former state judge [[Thomas B. Harlan]], the general counsel of Rialto, arranged to hire Senator [[Joseph R. Burton]] (R-KS), a lawyer, to appear before the Postmaster as counsel for Rialto in connection with these investigations for a monthly salary of $500.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 361&amp;ndash;64, 382.&lt;/ref&gt; When the general counsel returned to St. Louis on November 18, he communicated Burton's offer to Rialto and Rialto accepted.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 361&amp;ndash;64, 382&amp;ndash;83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rialto notified Burton of its acceptance by [[telegram]] to him in Washington that same day.&lt;ref name="b283"&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton informed Rialto by mail that he had learned of the two complaints from the Postmaster, arranged for himself to be notified of any future complaints, and arranged to represent Rialto in a hearing before the Postmaster before any sanctions would issue.&lt;ref name="b283"/&gt; Burton continued to represent Rialto before the Postmaster, and draw his monthly salary, for five months.&lt;ref name="b28384"&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 283&amp;ndash;84.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton's intervention was successful, and the Postmaster's investigation was ceased without the entry of a fraud order.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 363&amp;ndash;64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rialto paid Burton by monthly checks for the first four months. Burton received the first check on November 22.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton [[Negotiable instrument|indorsed and deposited]] the checks at [[Riggs National Bank]] in Washington, D.C., which in turn sent the checks to Rialto's bank, the [[Commonwealth Trust Company]] in St. Louis, Missouri, for payment.&lt;ref name="b296"&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 296.&lt;/ref&gt; The last $500 was paid in cash to Burton in person, at Rialto's office in St. Louis, on March 26, 1903, after which Burton's representation of Rialto terminated.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 283&amp;ndash;84; ''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 364&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indictment===
A [[Grand juries in the United States|federal grand jury]] in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]] was already investigating the [[Brooks Brokerage Company]], with which Dennis, the President of Rialto, was associated.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Witnesses against Burton at the grand jury included Chief Post Office Inspector [[William E. Cochran]], Dennis, and [[W.B. Mehaney]], the Vice President of Rialto.&lt;ref name="nyt4"/&gt; About two weeks before Burton's indictment, the grand jury came into possession of the checks from Rialto to Burton.&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt;

Burton was indicted on January 24, 1904, in the Eastern District of Missouri, on nine counts of violating Rev. Stat. § 1782.&lt;ref name="nyt4"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/01/24/101338358.pdf Senator Burton Indicted], {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, Jan. 24, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 1782 (enacted 1864) provided, in relevant part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No Senator . . . after his election and during his continuance in office . . . shall receive or agree to receive any compensation whatever, directly or indirectly, for any services rendered, or to be rendered, to any person, either by himself or another, in relation to any proceeding . . . controversy . . . or other matter or thing in which the United States is a party, or directly or indirectly interested, before any Department . . . whatever. Every person offending against this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be imprisoned not more than two years, and fined not more than ten thousand dollars, and shall, moreover, by conviction therefor, be rendered forever thereafter incapable of holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the Government of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;13 Stat. 123, ch. 119 (codified at Rev. Stat. § 1782). The current version of this statute is codified at 18 U.S.C. § 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first and second counts of the indictment pertained to the receipt of the final cash payment from Rialto with reference to two separate interests of the United States.&lt;ref name="b378"&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 378.&lt;/ref&gt; The third count pertained to receipt of the final cash payment from Mahaney.&lt;ref name="b378"/&gt; The sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth counts of the indictment pertained to the receipt of the four check for the first four months.&lt;ref name="b296"/&gt;

Burton arguably could not have been arrested at the time of his indictment because Congress was in session.&lt;ref name="nyt4"/&gt; [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: Compensation and legal protection|Article One]] provides that Senators and Representatives "shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|U.S. Const.}} art. I, § 6, cl. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; But, Burton voluntarily surrendered.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; On January 24, Burton and his wife departed for St. Louis.&lt;ref name="nyt5"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/01/25/101142703.pdf Burton to Face Charges], {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, Jan. 24, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and conviction===
[[File:Horace Dyer.jpg|thumb|right|Assistant U.S. Attorney [[Horace Dyer]] prosecuted Burton at both trials.]]
Judge [[Elmer Bragg Adams]], sitting as the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, presided over Burton's trial.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Former state judge [[Chester H. Krum]] appeared as Burton's attorney.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  Assistant U.S. Attorney [[Horace Dyer]] acted as prosecutor.&lt;ref name="nyt6"/&gt;

In his opening statement, Krum argued that Burton had only agreed to act as general counsel and to allow his name to be placed in Rialto's literature, and that the agreement explicitly provided that Burton would never represent Rialto before any federal agency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/03/23/100466879.pdf Senator Burton on Trial], {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, Mar. 23, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, the prosecution began its case in chief. Post Office Department employees identified the letters of complaint received against Rialto.&lt;ref name="nyt6"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/03/24/120266556.pdf Burton Wrote for Pay], {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, Mar. 23, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest H. Kastor]], of a St. Louis advertising firm, testified that he introduced Burton to Dennis and Harlan in November 1902.&lt;ref name="nyt6"/&gt; Witnesses said that the agreement was as Krum described and that the pay was agreed as $2,500 in $500 installments.&lt;ref name="nyt6"/&gt; Dyer read into evidence the letter from Burton to Rialto.&lt;ref name="nyt6"/&gt;

The prosecution's case continued on March 24. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton had attempted to discuss the case with him the day his indictment was made public.&lt;ref name="nyt7"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/03/25/100467224.pdf Burton Needed $70,000], {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, Mar. 24, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; Cochran refused to discuss it.&lt;ref name="nyt7"/&gt; Reporter [[J.H. Aubere]] testified that he had interviewed Burton that day, and that Burton had denied practicing before the Post Office.&lt;ref name="nyt7"/&gt; [[Hector McRea]], the Controller of Rialto, testified to a meeting between Mahaney and Burton, where Burton's representation was ended because the matter before the Post Office had concluded.&lt;ref name="nyt7"/&gt; Inspector Cochran was recalled to state that his conversation with Burton took place before Aubere's interview.&lt;ref name="nyt7"/&gt; Further, Cochran testified that, on February 5, 1902, Burton had told him that he wished to represent Rialto before the Department for a fee, having been assured by other Senators that such conduct was common and legal.&lt;ref name="nyt7"/&gt; Burton also told Cochran that he needed to repay a disputed debt of $70,000.&lt;ref name="nyt7"/&gt; Finally, Mahaney testified that, on the day he personally paid Burton $500, Burton advised Rialto to destroy its correspondence with him and that two such letters were destroyed.&lt;ref name="nyt7"/&gt; Thereafter, the prosecution rested.

The defense case commenced on March 25.&lt;ref name="nyt8"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/03/26/120284669.pdf Senator Burton Wanted to Build Up Practice], {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, Mar. 25, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; The third count of the indictment was quashed as duplicative with the first.&lt;ref name="nyt8"/&gt; Burton testified that he had accepted Rialto's employment due to personal financial reversals.&lt;ref name="nyt8"/&gt; Burton testified that his duties would include acting as a criminal defense attorney for Dennis, but would not include any activity in Washington.&lt;ref name="nyt8"/&gt; Burton testified that he received notice of his appointment from Harlan on November 20, 1902, and that he had only contacted the Post Office to notify them of his intent to defend Dennis in a criminal case.&lt;ref name="nyt8"/&gt; He explained that he only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise.&lt;ref name="nyt8"/&gt;

After the jury returned deadlocked 11-1, Judge Adams delivered an [[Allen v. United States (1896)|''Allen'' charge]].&lt;ref name="b305"/&gt; Soon afterwards, the jury returned a verdict that failed to address the third count in the indictment, so the Judge Allen ordered the jury to return to deliberations without reading the verdict.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; On March 28, 1904, after forty-one total hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Burton on five counts&amp;mdash;counts one, two, six, eight, and nine&amp;mdash;but acquitted on count three.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/03/29/101389228.pdf Burton Is Guilty; Will Fight Verdict], {{smallcaps|N.Y.

Before the Supreme Court, on November 30 and December 1, 1904, Burton was represented by (former judge) [[John Forrest Dillon]] and (future Solicitor General) [[Frederick William Lehmann]] at oral argument, with [[Harry Hubbard (lawyer)|Harry Hubbard]] and [[W.H. Rossington]] also on the brief.&lt;ref name="b287"&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Solicitor General [[Henry M. Hoyt (Solicitor General)|Henry M. Hoyt]] represented the United States.&lt;ref name="b287"/&gt;

On January 16, 1905, the Court overturned Burton's convictions.

===Sufficiency of the indictment and the evidence===
Without any discussion of the merits, 5-4, the Court held that the indictment stated offenses under § 1782 and that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have convicted Burton.&lt;ref name="b29596"&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 295&amp;ndash;96.&lt;/ref&gt; Justices Harlan, Brown, McKenna, Holmes, and Day were in the majority; Chief Justice Fuller, and Justices Peckham, Brewer, and White, were in dissent.&lt;ref name="b29596"/&gt;

===Venue and vicinage===
[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] provides that: "The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed."&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|U.S. Const.}} art. III, § 2, cl. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vicinage Clause]] of the Sixth Amendment provides that: "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . . ."&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|U.S. Const.}} amend. VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton argued that both constitutional provisions were violated because the crime had not occurred in the Eastern District of Missouri. Justice Peckham, writing for the entire Court except for Justice Harlan in dissent, reversed Burton's convictions on these grounds.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 296&amp;ndash;304.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that Burton's negotiation of the check in Washington, D.C. did not constitute conduct by Burton in St. Louis (the site of the drawee bank). In other words, whatever the Washington, D.C. bank did with the check afterwards, it did for itself, not as Burton's agent. "From the time of the delivery of the check by the defendant to the bank it became the owner of the check; it could have torn it up or thrown it in the fire or made any other use or disposition of it which it chose, and no right of defendant would have been infringed."&lt;ref&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Court held that it was error for the trial judge to have submitted the question of the "understanding . . . between the defendant and the bank" to the jury.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 300.&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this argument, the Court cited several of its own precedents concerning [[negotiable instrument]] law, as well as cases from the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] and the courts of New York and Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 301&amp;ndash;04.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a single paragraph, the Court rejected the application of the [[continuing offense]] doctrine, which had been codified in Rev. Stat. § 731.&lt;ref name="Burton I, 196 U.S. at 304"&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 304.&lt;/ref&gt; "This is not a case of the commencement of a crime in one district and its completion in another, so that under the statute the court in either district has jurisdiction. There was no beginning of the offense in Missouri. The payment of the money was in Washington, and there was no commencement of that offense when the officer of the Rialto Company sent the checks from St. Louis to defendant. The latter did not thereby begin an offense in Missouri."&lt;ref&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 304 (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Harlan dissented on this ground.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 308&amp;ndash;10 (Harlan, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; "As between the accused and his client," Harlan argued, "he was not, in any true sense, compensated for the services alleged to have been rendered in violation of the statute, until by payment of the checks by the St. Louis bank he was relieved of all liability to the Riggs National Bank arising from his indorsing the checks to it."&lt;ref&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 309&amp;ndash;10.&lt;/ref&gt; Harlan concluded that the majority had "sacrificed substance to mere form," illustrating the Latin maxim "[[Qui haeret in litera haeret in cortice]]."&lt;ref name="b310"&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 310 (Harlan, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refused jury instructions===
By the same 8-1 majority, the Court found a separate and independent ground for the reversal of Burton's convictions.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 304&amp;ndash;08.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton had requested certain [[jury instructions]], which the trial judge had delivered. But, along with the requested instructions, the trial judge had stated that: "[These instructions were] asked by counsel for the defendant to give certain declarations here, and while I think they have, in the main, been covered by the charge, yet I will give them to you. . . . These are abstract propositions of law, which I give in connection with the charge, as perhaps more fully amplifying it. I am willing to give them, inasmuch as they are asked, and they contain general propositions of law."&lt;ref name="Burton I, 196 U.S. at 304"/&gt;

After the jury returned deadlocked 11-1, the trial judge delivered an [[Allen v. United States (1896)|''Allen'' charge]].&lt;ref name="b305"&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 305.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the judge refused Burton's request to instruct the jury that the earlier requested instructions stood on the same footing as the other instructions.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 305&amp;ndash;06.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that this was reversible error.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Burton I'', 196 U.S. at 306&amp;ndash;07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harlan also dissented from this ground for reversal, arguing that Burton was not substantially prejudiced.&lt;ref name="b310"/&gt;

Further, the Court disapproved of the judge's having asked the jury for the proportions of their deadlock (even though he did not ask how many were for conviction and how many were for acquittal).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In ''[[Brasfield v. United States]]'' (1926), citing ''Burton'', the Court held that such was reversible error, regardless of whether the defendant objected in the trial court.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brasfield v. United States]]'', 272 U.S. 448 (1926).&lt;/ref&gt;

While the indictment was pending, Burton was robbed in Chicago and his wallet was recovered in a mail box by postal employees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/05/13/101359679.pdf Robbed Senator Burton], {{smallcaps|N.Y.

The trial date was originally set for October 3, and subpoenas to witnesses&amp;mdash;many of whom resided in Washington, D.C.&amp;mdash;issued on September 12.&lt;ref name="nyt10"/&gt;  Judge [[Willis Van Devanter]] (a future Supreme Court justice), of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] presided over Burton's second trial.&lt;ref name="nyt14"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/05/22/101712285.pdf Burton Must Go to Jail Supreme Court Decides], {{smallcaps|N.Y.

On November 21, the prosecution introduced the letters, telegrams, and checks into evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/11/22/120279590.pdf Burton Got $500 a Month], {{smallcaps|N.Y.

}}
The second time before the Court, on April 3&amp;ndash;4, 1906, Burton was again represented by Dillon and Lehmann, plus [[Bailey P. Waggener]], again with Hubbard and Rossington on the brief, plus [[W. Knox Haynes]] and [[W.P. Hackney]].&lt;ref name="b345"&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 345.&lt;/ref&gt; All together, Burton was represented by a team of ten lawyers, led by Dillon.&lt;ref name="nyt13"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/03/31/101771811.pdf Senator's Above Courts, Burton's Brief Says], {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, Mar. 30, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; Waggener delivered the argument in chief, assisted by Lehmann.&lt;ref name="nyt13"/&gt; Assistant Attorney General (and future judge) [[Charles Henry Robb]] represented the United States.&lt;ref name="b345"/&gt;

On May 21, 1906, the Supreme Court upheld Burton's convictions. That same day, another of Burton's lawyers, former Senator [[John Mellen Thurston]], filed a petition for rehearing, which operated as a 60-day continuance, and in effect stayed the matter much longer because the Court was set to adjourn until October.&lt;ref name="nyt14"/&gt;

===Separation of powers===
[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] provides: "Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members . . . . Each House may . . . punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member."&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|U.S. Const.}} art. I, § 5, cls. 1&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton argued that § 1782 was an unconstitutional violation of the [[separation of powers]] because the Senate's power to punish its members was exclusive. Burton's brief compared the ban on legislators practicing before executive agencies to a ban on the President lobbying legislators for legislation.&lt;ref name="nyt13"/&gt; The ''New York Times'' called this "one of the most interesting efforts to get a new meaning out of the Constitution that has appeared for some time."&lt;ref name="nyt13"/&gt; A later article noted that, "[t]he decision is especially interesting because of the large array of legal talent in the case and the ingenious argument made by Bailey Wagner [sic] of Topeka that the Senate is the judge of the qualifications of its own members . . . ."&lt;ref name="nyt14"/&gt;

The Court unanimously rejected this argument.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 365&amp;ndash;70.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court cited earlier laws prohibiting members of Congress from practicing before the [[United States Court of Claims]] and from entering into contracts with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 365&amp;ndash;66 (citing Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 92, 12 Stat. 765 (codified at Rev. Stat. § 1058) and Rev. Stat. § 3739).&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Court noted that "[t]he proper discharge of those duties does not require a Senator to appear before an executive Department in order to enforce his particular views, or the views of others, in respect of matters committed to that Department for determination."&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton also argued that the provision rendering those convicted under § 1782 "incapable of holding any office of honor, trust or profit under the Government of the United States" unconstitutionally infringed on the Qualifications Clause. The Court dodged this question by holding that the provision would not bar a convicted defendant from serving in the Senate because Senators ([[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|at the time]]) were elected by the state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 369&amp;ndash;70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interests of the United States===
Burton next argued that the indictment was insufficient because the Postmaster's decision to return mail addressed to suspected fraudsters back to senders and to bar suspected fraudsters from cashing money orders was not a "proceeding . . . controversy. . . or other matter or thing in which the United States is . . . directly or indirectly interested." The Court rejected this argument, 6-3.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 370&amp;ndash;73.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Court admitted that the United States had no pecuniary interest in the proceeding, it argued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The United States was the real party in interest on one side, while the Rialto Company was the real party in interest on the other side. If the Postmaster General did not represent the United States, whom did he represent? . . . [I]t is, we think, a mistake to say that the United States was not interested, directly or indirectly, in protecting its property, that is, its mails and postal facilities, against improper and illegal use . . . ."&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 370&amp;ndash;71 (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice Brewer, joined by Justices White and Peckham dissented on this point. They argued that the statute applied only to the pecuniary interests of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 390&amp;ndash;400 (Brewer, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; These justices were among the four (in addition to Chief Justice Fuller) who would have held the indictment insufficient in ''Burton I'', presumably for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 390 (Brewer J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; The dissenters argued that the majority's interpretation would find the United States interested in any administrative proceeding, thus rendering the statutory words "before any Department, court martial, bureau, officer, or any civil, military, or naval commission whatever" to be mere [[surplusage|surplussage]].&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 396&amp;ndash;97 (Brewer, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the dissent cited the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction Era]] [[legislative history]] pointing towards a narrower interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 398&amp;ndash;99 (Brewer, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufficiency of the evidence===
Burton next argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Reviewing the evidence, the Court rejected this argument.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 373&amp;ndash;77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separate offenses of agreeing and receiving===
Section 1782 provided that "No Senator . . . shall receive or agree to receive any compensation . . . ." Burton argued that he could not simultaneously be charged with separate offenses for agreeing to receive compensation and actually receiving compensation for the same transaction. The Court rejected this argument.&lt;ref name="b377"&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 377&amp;ndash;78.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court stated that Burton's interpretation "does violence to [the statute's] words," emphasizing the word "or."&lt;ref name="b377"/&gt;

Justice McKenna disagreed with this holding. Thus, he concurred only in the affirmance of the charges alleging receipt, not the charges alleging agreement.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 389&amp;ndash;90 (McKenna, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double jeopardy===
Burton next argued that his prosecution violated the [[Double Jeopardy Clause]]. Specifically, Burton argued that his acquittal on the third count in the first trial barred his conviction on the third and seventh counts in the second trial.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 379&amp;ndash;80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court rejected this argument.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 378&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that the earlier and later counts did not describe the same offense because they named the payor as Mahaney and Rialto, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venue and vicinage===
Finally, Burton argued that the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an argument that the Court had accepted in ''Burton I''). This time, the Court rejected the argument.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 381&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 381&amp;ndash;83.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning [[offer and acceptance]] in [[contract]] law.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 384&amp;ndash;86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III does not require the physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.&lt;ref&gt;''Burton II'', 202 U.S. at 386&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Burton remained a Senator while each of his appeals were pending.&lt;ref name="expulsion"/&gt; Allegedly, his colleagues made it known that they would move to expel him if he appeared in the Senate.&lt;ref name="expulsion"/&gt; However, Burton did appear in the Senate after his conviction. On April 6, 1904, Burton appeared to push for appropriations for the acquisition of land in the Adirondacks and Catskills.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/04/06/100468057.pdf Adirondacks for the Rich], {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, Apr. 6, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 22, 1906, Burton appeared in the Senate chamber again, for 30 seconds, in order to be eligible for $1,000 in travel reimbursements from the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/01/23/101334918.pdf Burton's Step Costs $1,000], {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, Jan. 22, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton's term was due to expire on March 4, 1907.&lt;ref name="nyt14"/&gt; After his conviction was finally affirmed, a resolution to expel Burton from the Senate was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections]] on May 22, 1906.&lt;ref name="expulsion"/&gt; Burton resigned from office on June 4, 1906, before the Senate could act.&lt;ref name="expulsion"&gt;United States Senate Historical Office, [https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/expulsion_cases/092JosephBurton_expulsion.htm The Expulsion Case of Joseph R. Burton of Kansas (1906)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton served five months of his six-month sentence in the [[Iron County, Missouri|Iron County]] Jail in [[Ironton, Missouri]]. In March 1907, he returned to Abilene.&lt;ref name="expulsion"/&gt;

==Role of President Roosevelt==
[[File:Joseph Wingate Folk cph.3b47532.jpg|thumb|right|Circuit Attorney Folk visited the White House prior to Burton's indictment.]]
Contemporary rumor held that Burton's indictment had been ordered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt; Although [[Joseph W. Folk]], the Circuit Attorney for the City of St. Louis (and future Governor of Missouri), had recently visited with the President and Attorney General, the ''New York Times'' reported that "there was not a word in either of those interviews about the Burton case."&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt;

Burton himself alleged that Roosevelt had orchestrated his prosecution in March 23, 1907 speech in [[Abilene, Kansas]] after his release from prison.&lt;ref name="nyt15"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/03/24/106111433.pdf Rossevelt Plotted to Ruin Me&amp;mdash;Burton], {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, Mar. 23, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton pointed out that his was the first prosecution under § 1782 and that numerous other public officials before him had potentially violated it, under the interpretation that prevailed in the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="nyt15"/&gt;

Burton and Roosevelt had a complicated history. Burton, as a leader at the [[1900 Republican National Convention]], was perhaps instrumental in Roosevelt's securing his party's nomination.&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt; Roosevelt's last appointment to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] (whose jurisdiction, at the time, included appeals from Kansas) had been [[William Cather Hook]], a choice favored by Burton's political opponents: Senator [[Chester I. Long]] (R-KS) and Governor [[Willis J. Bailey]] (R-KS).&lt;ref name="nyt3"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/07/12/102013010.pdf Extraordinary Charge Against a Senator], {{smallcaps|N.Y. Times}}, July 12, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; When the next vacancy opened on the Eighth Circuit, Burton and his allies favored the appointment of [[Charles Blood Smith]].&lt;ref name="nyt3"/&gt; [[D.W. Mulvane]] was unsuccessful in pressing Smith's candidacy in a June 1903 meeting with Roosevelt.&lt;ref name="nyt3"/&gt;

Earlier that year, while accompanying Roosevelt on a  visit to Kansas, Burton told Roosevelt about his project to create a reproduction of [[Jerusalem]] at the time of Christ's birth for the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World's Fair]].&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt3"/&gt; Roosevelt gave Burton a letter praising the exhibit, which Burton in turn published by facsimile in a magazine advertisement for the sale of stock in the exhibit.&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt3"/&gt; The White House received a letter from the magazine inquiring into the authenticity of the letter on the same day that Mulvane returned for a second meeting to press Smith's appointment.&lt;ref name="nyt3"/&gt; Roosevelt was enraged, demanded the return of the letter, and declared that "from now on Burton would be considered politically a Democratic Senator, as far as patronage is concerned."&lt;ref name="nyt3"/&gt; "The President's indignation knew no bounds. He had never been so grossly and humiliatingly deceived during his incumbency in office."&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt;

Burton was also in a "long standing feud" with Fourth Assistant Postmaster (and future Senator) [[Joseph L. Bristow]], whom Burton had lobbied Roosevelt (and his predecessor, [[William McKinley]]) to replace.&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt; Roosevelt refused to remove Bristow except for cause, and in any case refused to appoint one of Burton's friends to replace him.&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt;

Another issue with which Burton clashed with Roosevelt was reciprocity with Cuba.&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt; Burton cited this issue in his Abilene speech.&lt;ref name="nyt15"/&gt; In order to force concessions from Roosevelt, Burton had joined with Senators from [[sugar beet|beet sugar]] states.&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt; Although Burton publicly spoke against a treaty with Cuba, he repeatedly privately informed Roosevelt that he would support the ratification of the treaty.&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', "[t]he history of Burton's manoeuvres at this time will never be fully told."&lt;ref name="nyt5"/&gt;

The '''Business Journalist of the Year Awards''' are widely recognised{{whom|date=November 2016}} as the most important global awards for business writers and [[broadcasting|broadcaster]]s. They are the only awards for business writers that are open to [[journalist]]s of all nationalities, and the only awards to cover the entire spectrum of business and financial reporting.

The Business Journalist of the Year Awards (first presented in 1999) were created because [[business information]] had become a global commodity paying little heed to national borders. In a world where goods, services, money and knowledge move ever more freely from one domain to another, the source of business information is no longer relevant - only its quality matters. That's the spirit these awards were created in, and the spirit in which they have grown.

The Business Journalist of the Year Awards are judged exclusively by journalists and governed by the World's leading business editors. The Editors' Committee comprises Martin Dickson, Deputy Editor of the ''[[Financial Times]]''; [[Robert Peston]], business editor at [[BBC|the BBC]]; [[Hugo Dixon]], [[editing|editor-in-chief]] and chairman of [[Breakingviews]]; Jesse Lewis, [[managing editor]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal Europe]]''; and Rik Kirkland, former managing editor of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3342">'''Cadbury Nigeria Plc''' is a food, [[Candy|sweets]] and drink company headquartered in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] and traded on the [[Nigerian Stock Exchange]]. [[Cadbury|Cadbury Schweppes]] history in Nigeria dates back to the 1950s when it began sourcing for [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and also importing bulk products and repacking it into tins for sale in the country. Later finding increasing market opportunities in the country, the group set up a manufacturing facility in January 1965.&lt;ref name="georgie"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/760937386|title=Impact of culture on the transfer of management practices in former British colonies : a comparative case study of Cadbury (Nigeria) Plc and Cadbury Worldwide|last=James.|first=George, Olusoji|date=2011|publisher=Xlibris|isbn=9781456833770|location=[United Kingdom]|pages=109-119|oclc=760937386}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The firm became a publicly quoted company in 1976 when Cadbury Schweppes sold 20% of its interest in the firm. The firm's investment in the [[Vertical integration|integration]] of its [[supply chain]] led to the establishment of a [[Commercial sorghum|sorghum]] conversion plant and Stanmark Industries in [[Ondo City|Ondo]], a cocoa processing plant. Stanmark provides raw materials for its key product, [[Bournvita]] and is a source of [[Currency|foreign currency]] through exportation of cocoa products. In 2006, the subsidiary processed 15,000 tonnes of cocoa beans into [[cocoa butter]], [[Chocolate liquor|cocoa liquor]] and [[Cocoa solids|cocoa powder]].

In 2006, the firm released a statement disclosing financial misstatements in a number of previous [[Annual report|annual reports]].&lt;ref name="sup" /&gt;  Immediately after the disclosure, the CEO and finance director resigned their positions. The firm later announced it will be taking exceptional item charges on its balance sheet as a result of the misstatements.&lt;ref name="georgie" /&gt; 

== Brands ==
The firm's major products are Bournvita and Tom Tom. The former was introduced to the country in 1960 and the latter in 1970. Following the establishment of a manufacturing plant in 1965, the firm spent funds on advertising Bournvita, and in the process increased the market share of the brand. Bournvita later became a market leader in its category. To improve nutritional needs, in 1994, the firm included essential vitamins and minerals in Bournvita.&lt;ref name="sup" /&gt; 

Other products of the company include Cadbury [[Cadbury Eclairs|Eclairs]], Malta sweets, [[Trebor (confectionery)|Trebor]] and Peppermint original.&lt;ref name="sup"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://superbrands.s3.amazonaws.com/AAA%20MASTER%202%20PAGE%20PDF%20Case%20Studies/Nigeria/Nigeria%20Edition%201/Nigeria%20Edition%201%20Cadbury.pdf|title=Cabdury Nigeria|last=Superbrands|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beverages contributed 58% of its revenues in 2018 and sweets contributed 26%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beverageindustrynews.com.ng/index.php/2018/10/24/cadbury-nigeria-rebounds-to-profit-on-higher-sales-cost-cutting/|title=Cadbury Nigeria rebounds to profit on higher sales, cost cutting|date=2018-10-24|website=Beverage Industry News (NG)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it markets Creme Rollers, Chocki, Hall Take 5 and Bubba Gum.&lt;ref name="georgie" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14481">'''Codentify''' is the name of a product serialization system developed and patented by [[Philip Morris International]] (PMI) for tobacco product authenticity verification and supply chain control. In the production process, each cigarette package is marked with a unique visible code (also called “Codentify”), that allows authenticating the code against a central server.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmi.com/eng/documents/Codentify_E_Brochure_English.pdf|title=Codentify E Brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=Pmi.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joossens|first=Luk|last2=Gilmore|first2=Anna B.|date=2013-03-12|title=The transnational tobacco companies’ strategy to promote Codentify, their inadequate tracking and tracing standard|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2013/03/11/tobaccocontrol-2012-050796|journal=Tobacco Control|language=en|pages=tobaccocontrol–2012-050796|doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2012-050796|issn=1468-3318|pmc=3897562|pmid=23481904|volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, PMI licensed the system to its three main competitors, namely [[British American Tobacco]] (BAT), Imperial Tobacco Group (ITG), and [[Japan Tobacco International]] (JTI), and the four companies together formed the Digital Coding and Tracking Association (DCTA) which works to promote the system in order to replace governmental revenue stamps.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Codentify is branded by its inventors as a “track &amp; trace and product authentication technology”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
In July 2004, Phillip Morris International and the [[European Union]] had settled a 12 year long legal dispute concerning cigarette smuggling charges. PMI agreed to pay 1.25 Billion USD to the EU budget and its member states. In addition, PMI was legally obligated to mark its products with trackable serial codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/jul/09/smoking.europeanunion|title=Philip Morris reaches $1.25bn EU agreement|last=Tran|first=Mark|date=2004-07-09|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-04-882_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - European Commission and Philip Morris International sign 12-year Agreement to combat contraband and counterfeit cigarettes|website=europa.eu|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fctc.org/publications/bulletins/doc_view/451-legal-analysis-of-eu-agreements-with-multinational-tobacco-companies |title=Legal analysis of the agreements between the European Union, Member States, and multinational tobacco companies |author=Madeleine Heyward LL.M. (New York) |website=Fctc.org |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Agreements were subsequently signed with the other three major tobacco companies.

PMI's daughter company, Philip Morris Products S.A. created and patented the Codentify system in 2005.

In late 2010, PMI licensed Codentify to its main competitors BAT, JTI, and ITG free of charge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Does the tobacco industry have a tracking and tracing system that governments can use?|url=http://www.fctc.org/images/stories/Codentify_final_220515.pdf|journal=WORLD NO TOBACCO DAY 2015|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four companies, which together account for 71% of global cigarette sales (excluding China), agreed to use the PMI-developed system on all of their products to ensure “the adoption of a single industry standard, based on Codentify.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hill M|title=Digital Tax Verification (DTV) Codentify, The industry Standard, October 2010 and Philip Morris International, Codentify, Brochure, 2012|url=http://www.pmi.com/eng/documents/Codentify_E_Brochure_English.pdf|format=PDF|website=Pmi.com|accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) immediately voiced concerns that “Codentify should never be used for tracking and tracing purposes as tracking and tracing provisions should be implemented under the strict control and management of governments.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fctc.org/publications/bulletins/doc_view/493-bulletin-issue-113|title=Framework Convention Alliance Bulletin|last=|first=|date=|website=Fctc.org|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the four companies formed the Digital Coding and Tracking Association (DCTA) to promote international standards and digital technologies to help governments fight smuggling, counterfeiting and tax evasion. The association was officially launched in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/association-launched-to-fight-illicit-trade-in-excisable-goods-2013-05-22|title=Association launched to fight illicit trade in excisable goods|newspaper=MarketWatch|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the DCTA, around 12% of the global cigarette market is illicit, depriving national governments of more than US$40 billion a year in lost tax revenues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aitcentral.com/content/tobacco-where-volume-counts-0|title=Tobacco: where volume counts|last=|first=|date=|website=AIT Central: fighting illicit trade|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some say this is a serious underestimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_961.pdf|title=Illicit Tobacco: What is the Tobacco Industry Trying to Do?|last=|first=|date=|website=Ash.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opus.bath.ac.uk/38005/|title=Towards a greater understanding of the illicit tobacco trade in Europe: A review of the PMI funded ‘Project Star’ report|last=|first=|date=|website=Opus.bath.ac.uk|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreements between the EU and the four major tobacco companies  aim to stem the illicit trade of cigarettes, but are seen by academics in the field as a wholly inadequate deterrent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/25/3/254 |title=Assessment of the European Union's illicit trade agreements with the four major Transnational Tobacco Companies &amp;#124; Tobacco Control |website=Tobaccocontrol.bmj.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/anti-fraud/investigations/eu-revenue/cigarette_smuggling_en |title=Tobacco smuggling - European Commission |website=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU has since not renewed this deal after MEPs complained that it was ineffective and inappropriate that governments and tobacco companies have such a deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1724b620-42b9-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d.html#axzz4EpsiGmrl |title=EU to end anti-tobacco smuggling deal with Philip Morris |website=Ft.com |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 the DCTA announced that it transferred Codentify to Inexto, an affiliate of the French Group Impala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcta-global.com/docs/DCTA_Press%20Release_1June2016.pdf |format=PDF |title=DCTA technology ownership transferred to Inexto, an affiliate of Impala Group |website=Dcta-global.com |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was criticized by leading industry watchdogs such as the FCTC and academics such as Anna Gilmore, who is the director of the tobacco control research group at the University of Bath. She said that “Inexto could not be considered sufficiently independent from the tobacco industry". Martyn Day, Scottish National Party Member of Parliament, says while Codentify was sold "the new owner is merely a front company and that the system is still under the effective control of the tobacco firms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-12-20/debates/FF51202E-34FA-48C7-B002-28DB6AF473AA/ChristmasAdjournment#contribution-2494C922-BC37-458E-A0E8-246FC3551B09|title=Christmas Adjournment - Hansard Online|website=hansard.parliament.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other academics such as Luk Joossens, who is the advocacy officer of the Association of European Cancer Leagues, said the sale was “predictable” and that tobacco companies will now “pretend” that Codentify is no longer part of the tobacco industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Saturday 4th Mar 2017 |url=https://euobserver.com/economic/133899 |title=Big Tobacco suspected of dodging EU anti-smuggling rules |website=Euobserver.com |date=2016-06-01 |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; PMI have rebutted that “Inexto is fully independent from the tobacco industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tobacco.cleartheair.org.hk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Pharmalutions-Joerss-Codentify-upd.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pharmalutions Pte Ltd |website=Tobacco.cleartheair.org.hk |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A communiqué by Argentine lawyer Alejandro Sánchez Kalbermatten to the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) explained the relationship between PMI, Inexto and Impala in a diagram.

== Technology ==
The Codentify system is based on a machine-created, unique, human-readable 12-digit alphanumeric code that is printed directly onto every individual product during the manufacturing process.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iticnet.org/file/document/watch/3616|title=Digital Tax Verification|last=|first=|date=|website=Iticnet.org|publisher=|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Factory level encryption keys are stored on a server and allows for the production of a pre-defined number of Codentify codes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The code created by the system is described as random, offering 34&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; possible combinations. A range of data can be encrypted into the code such as date and time of manufacture, the machine of manufacture, brand, variant, pack size, pack type, destination market, and price.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This system presents limitations as it only allows for the verification of the code itself, not of the product the code is printed on and is potentially open to copying.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A European Commission Assessment Report into Tracking and Tracing notes in section 5.1.2 that in addition to the Codentify code being easily copied, it also fails to link the cigarette packets to the master cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/do,cs/2015_tpd_tracking_tracing_frep_en.pdf|title=Analysis and Feasibility Assessment Regarding EU systems for Tracking and Tracing of Tobacco Products and for Security Features|last=|first=|date=|website=Ec.europa.eu|publisher=|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Codentify has been the subject of harsh criticism as a tobacco industry promoted system which is aimed at undermining public health efforts and not capable of curbing the illicit trade of cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Condentify: an industry attempt to control illicit trade|url=https://www.stopcorporateabuse.org/sites/default/files/resources/codentify-flyer.pdf|journal=Corporate Accountability International|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This criticism has come from academics and pro-health groups&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  as well as government agencies, including the [[World Health Organization|WHO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/mediacentre/news/2016/remarks-head-fctc-high-level-conference-brussels/en/|title=Dr Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the Convention Secretariat, sends her remarks to the High Level Conference: Combating tobacco industry tactics: state of play and a way forward, European Parliament, Brussels, 2 March 2016|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control|FCTC Protocol]] on the Elimination of the Illicit Trade in Tobacco products states in article 8, section 12 that tobacco tracking and regulation “shall not be performed by or delegated to the tobacco industry”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/80873/1/9789241505246_eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products |website=Apps.who.int |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whyitisbad.wordpress.com/2016/02/29/world-health-organization-is-the-solution-for-codentify/|title=World Health Organization is the Solution for Codentify|last=whyitsbad|date=2016-02-29|website=Why It's Bad|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the tobacco industry say Codentify is simply not good enough, “because it focuses too much on production and does not store product codes or track them.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-tobacco-tracking-insight-idUSKBN0ET0I720140618|title=Big Tobacco squares up as EU rules aim to track every cigarette|last=Geller|first=Martinne|newspaper=Reuters UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy criticism has also been launched at the factory-level keys the system uses to provide unique verification codes for the product. Since these secret keys are stored on company and government servers, abuse of privileges on this level would allow criminals to generate additional codes, which would appear to be genuine to the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccofact.org/blog/major-flaws-discovered-in-the-codentify-track-and-trace-system|title=Major Flaws Discovered in the Codentify Track and Trace System|website=Tobacco Industry facts|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Why It Is Bad - Tobacco Track and Trace|title=Codentify - Interview with a Tobacco Industry Insider|date=2015-05-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ7gZ_D_WMM|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decentralized nature of the system also allows for a variety of other counterfeiting efforts critics say, such as “code recycling”, using codes of products rejected in quality control, “code cloning”, printing the same code on multiple products, and “code migration”, reprinting codes used in one country elsewhere, allowing the reuse of genuine codes multiple times.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Additionally, [[Action on Smoking and Health]] (ASH) described the system as a black box created by the tobacco industry that uses unsecured equipment that is vulnerable to code recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fctc.org/images/stories/Codentify_final_220515.pdf |format=PDF |title=Does the tobacco industry have a tracking and tracing system that governments can use? |website=Fctc.org |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Accounting}}
{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}

A '''deferral''', in ''[[accrual accounting]]'', is any [[Account (accountancy)|account]] where the [[asset]] or [[liability (accounting)|liability]] is not realized until a future date ([[accounting period]]), e.g. [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuities]], [[fee|charges]], [[tax]]es, [[income]], etc. The deferred item may be carried, dependent on type of deferral, as either an asset or liability. See also [[accrual]].

Deferrals are the consequence of the [[Revenue recognition|revenue recognition principle]] which dictates that revenues be recognized in the period in which they occur, and the [[matching principle]] which dictates expenses to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. Deferrals are the result of [[cash flows]] occurring before they are allowed to be recognized under [[accrual accounting]]. As a result, adjusting entries are required to reconcile a flow of cash (or rarely other non-cash items) with events that have not occurred yet as either [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] or [[assets]]. Because of the similarity between deferrals and their corresponding accruals, they are commonly conflated.

* Deferred expense: cash has left the company, but the event has not actually occurred yet. Prepaid expenses are the most common type. For instance, a company may purchase a year of insurance. After six months, only half of the insurance will have been 'used' with another six months of the insurance still owed to the company. Thus, the company records half of the payment as an outflow (an expense) and the other half as a receivable from the insurance company (an asset).
* Deferred revenue: Revenue has come into the company, but the event has still not occurred – it is unearned revenue. A magazine company, for instance, may receive money for a one-year subscription. However, the company has not spent the resources in producing and delivering those magazines and thus accountants record this revenue as a liability equal to the amount of cash received. The magazine company, while now having more cash on hand, also now owes a year of magazines. The amount of each magazine that gets delivered is then taken out of liabilities and recorded as revenue during the economic period in which it actually happens, not just when the company gets paid for it.

==Deferral (deferred charge)==
'''Deferred charge '''(or '''deferral''') is [[cost]] that is accounted-for in latter [[accounting period]] for its anticipated future benefit, or to comply with the requirement of [[matching principle|matching]] costs with [[revenues]]. ''Deferred charges'' include costs of [[Startup company|starting up]], obtaining long-term [[debt]], [[advertising]] campaigns, etc., and are carried as a non-current [[asset]] on the [[balance sheet]] pending [[amortization]]. 
''Deferred charges'' often extend over five years or more and occur infrequently unlike '''prepaid expenses''', e.g. insurance, interest, rent. Financial [[ratios]] are based on the total assets excluding ''deferred charges'' since they have no physical substance ([[cash]] realization) and cannot be used in reducing total [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Deferred expense==
A '''Deferred expense''' or '''prepayment''', '''prepaid expense''', plural often '''prepaids''', is an [[asset]] representing cash paid out to a counterpart for goods or services to be received in a later [[accounting period]].  For example, if a service contract is paid quarterly in advance, at the end of the first month of the period two months remain as a deferred expense.  In the deferred expense the early payment is accompanied by a related recognized expense in the subsequent accounting period, and the same amount is deducted from the prepayment.&lt;ref name="NortonDiamond2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Curtis L. Norton|author2=Michael A. Diamond|author3=Donald P. Pagach|title=Intermediate accounting: financial reporting and analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wvxs17T5-D8C&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=2 April 2012|year=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-618-72185-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deferred expense shares characteristics with [[Accrued Revenue|accrued revenue]] (or ''accrued assets'') with the difference that an asset to be covered later are proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such income item is earned and the related [[revenue]] item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later period, when its amount is deducted from ''accrued revenues''.

For example, when the accounting periods are monthly, an 11/12 portion of an annually paid [[insurance]] cost is added to ''prepaid expenses'', which are decreased by 1/12 of the cost in each subsequent period when the same fraction is recognized as an [[expense]], rather than all in the month in which such cost is billed. The not-yet-recognized portion of such costs remains as ''prepayments'' (assets) to prevent such cost from turning into a fictitious loss in the monthly period it is billed, and into a fictitious profit in any other monthly period.

Similarly, cash paid out for (the cost of) goods and services not received by the end of the accounting period is added to the ''prepayments'' to prevent it from turning into a fictitious loss in the period cash was paid out, and into a fictitious profit in the period of their reception. Such cost is not recognized in the [[income statement]] (''profit and loss'' or P&amp;L) as the [[expense]] incurred in the period of payment, but in the period of their reception when such costs are recognized as expenses in [[P&amp;L]] and deducted from prepayments (assets) on [[balance sheets]].

==Deferred revenue==
'''Deferred revenue''' (or '''[[deferred income]]''') is a [[liability (accounting)|liability]], such as cash received from a counterpart for goods or services that are to be delivered in a later [[accounting period]]. When such income item is earned, the related [[revenue]] item is recognized, and the ''deferred revenue'' is reduced. It shares characteristics with ''accrued expense'' with the difference that a liability to be covered later is an obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash for them is to be paid out in a later period when its amount is deducted from ''accrued expenses''.

For example, a company receives an annual [[software license]] fee paid out by a customer upfront on the January 1. However, the company's [[fiscal year]] ends on May 31. So, the company using accrual accounting adds only five months' worth (5/12) of the fee to its [[revenues]] in [[profit and loss]] for the fiscal year the fee was received. The rest is added to ''[[deferred income]]'' (liability) on the [[balance sheet]] for that year.

The '''General Directorate of Insurance and Pensions''' ({{lang-es|Dirección General de Seguros y Fondos de Pensiones}}) (DGFSP) is the Spanish government's [[financial regulation|financial regulatory]] agency that supervises and controls Spain's [[insurance]] and [[pension fund]] sector.

It is responsible for ensuring that the sector functions properly and provides customers of insurance agencies and members of pension funds with appropriate protection. To that end, it is empowered to regulate, issue instructions to, and supervise the institutions that comprise the sector, thus guaranteeing proper operation in accordance with current legislation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meh.es/en-GB/Areas%20Tematicas/Seguros%20y%20Fondos%20de%20Pensiones/Paginas/default.aspx Structure and Functions of the General Directorate of Insurance and Pensions&lt;/ref&gt;

It is part of the ''Spanish State Secretariat for Economic Affairs'' (Secretaría de Estado de Economía) of the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Spain)|Ministry of Economy and Finance]] of [[Spain]].

==History==
The DGFSP was established under Royal Decree (Real Decreto, in Spanish) 1127/2008 of 4 July 2008, which develops the basic structure of the Ministry.

The '''Downtown Core''' ({{zh|s=市中心}}, {{lang-ms|Pusat Bandar}}, {{lang-ta|டவுன்டவுன் கோர்}}) is the historical and downtown center of the [[city-state]] of [[Singapore]] and the main commercial area in Singapore with many integrated resorts such as the Marina Bay Sands, one of the most expensive buildings in the world, with the most expensive standalone casino at bayfront avenue. There are many skyscrapers in Raffles Place, Tanjong Pagar and Marina Bay CBD with a height limit of 280m. It is one of the eleven [[Planning Areas of Singapore|planning area]]s located within the most urbanised [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]],&lt;ref name=DCDGP&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ura.gov.sg/dgp_reports/downtown/main.html|title= Downtown Core Planning Report 1995|accessdate=2007-07-15 |work= [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070612192533/http://www.ura.gov.sg/dgp_reports/downtown/main.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming the latter's dense urban core. It is bounded by [[Rochor]] to the north, [[Kallang]] to the northeast, [[Marina East]] and [[Marina South]] to the east, [[Straits View]] to the southeast, [[Bukit Merah]] to the south, as well as [[Outram, Singapore|Outram]], [[Museum Planning Area|Museum]] and [[Singapore River]] to the west.

As the financial Heart of Singapore, the Downtown Core houses the headquarters and offices of numerous corporations, as well as the [[Singapore Exchange]]. The area is also home to a large number of governmental institutions, notably the seat of [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] and the [[Supreme Court of Singapore]].

Singapore's modern history began in this area, when [[Stamford Raffles]] and representatives of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] landed along the banks of the [[Singapore River]] to set up a free port in [[Southeast Asia]]. As the old harbour grew along the mouth of the river bank, the city naturally expanded around it, creating what is now the Central Area.

The name "Downtown Core" remains relatively unheard of and the term '''Central Business District''' ('''CBD''') is commonly used in conversation instead. However, the area known as the CBD actually comprises a smaller area within the Downtown Core itself, taking up the south-western and western portions of the planning area. It is made up of eight subzones, [[Anson, Singapore|Anson]], Cecil, [[Clifford Pier]], Maxwell, Phillip, [[Raffles Place]] and [[Tanjong Pagar]] and [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]].&lt;ref name=DCDGP/&gt; The core of the CBD has since extended well beyond its boundaries and the term is even often at times used to refer to the Central Area as a whole.

==History==
{{main|History of Singapore}}
[[File:Aerial panorama of Singapore's Downtown Core.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial panorama of Singapore's Downtown Core]]
As a fledgling colony, the area which is now known as the Downtown Core was the [[financial]], administrative and commercial centre of the colony. In 1823, Singapore was reorganised according to the [[Raffles Plan of Singapore]] by [[Sir Stamford Raffles]], which specified elements like the ''Commercial Square'' (now Raffles Place) and the ''European Town'' as well as various other commercial and administrative entities located between them. This area later became the Downtown Core.

'''Eduardo Francisco Costantini''' (born September 17, 1946) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[real estate developer]] and businessman and the founder and chairman of the Museum of Latin American Art of Buenos Aires ([[MALBA]]).

==Biography==
Eduardo F. Costantini was born in [[Buenos Aires]] on September 17, 1946. He is a Bachelor in [[Economics]] graduated from [[Universidad Católica Argentina]] (1971) and [[Master of Arts]] in [[Quantitative Economics]] from the [[University of East Anglia]], [[England]] (1975).&lt;ref name=konex1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionkonex.org/b3055-eduardo-francisco-costantini|title=Biography of Eduardo F. Costantini |publisher=Fundación Konex}} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business career ===
He was controller of Penta S.A. (1970-1972) and then its Finance Director (1973-1974). Between 1975 and 1977 he was a member of the board of Huancayo S.A. During the ‘80s he became a stock-broker and then president of Consultatio Bursátil SA.&lt;ref name=exithub&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exithub.com/eduardo-costantini-argentinas-art-loving-property-tycoon/ |title=Eduardo Costantini, Argentina’s art-loving property tycoon |publisher=''ExitHub''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1991 and 1994 he was the Vice-president of [[Banco Francés del Río de la Plata]]. In 1991 he also founded Consultatio Asset Management, a company exclusively devoted to managing investment funds mainly in [[Latin America]]. That same year he founded Consultatio SA, a company devoted to the development of large scale real estate projects.&lt;ref name=latintrade&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latintrade.com/eduardo-costantini-on-argentina/ |title=Eduardo Costantini On Argentina |publisher=''Latin Trade''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this company he would develop [[Nordelta]], the largest and most innovative real estate venture in [[Argentina]]. Built in 1999, Nordelta is located in [[Tigre, Buenos Aires|Tigre]], 30&amp;nbsp;km away from Buenos Aires city center. It stretches over a surface of 1,700 hectares, it has a population of 35,000 residents and it meets all community needs: two medical centers, five schools, a mall with over 100 stores and five movie theaters, a sports club, an 18-hole golf course designed by [[Jack Nicklaus]], several restaurants, two gas stations and a five-star hotel.

In 2010 Consultatio SA developed Puertos in [[Escobar Partido|Escobar]], [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] province, conceived as an ecological urbanization project of 1,400 hectares with its own [[biological corridor]] with native species of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=infobae&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobae.com/2015/07/14/1741579-una-nueva-ciudad-vista-un-lago-escobar/ |title=Una nueva ciudad con vista a un lago, en Escobar |publisher=''Infobae.com''}} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Consultatio SA Costantini has erected many emblematic buildings of Buenos Aires, such as [[Catalinas Plaza]] (1995), [[Alem Plaza]] (1998), the Grand Bourg Tower and the corporate tower [[Catalinas Norte]], which is currently under construction, placed on the last available site of the Catalinas area in [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] at [[Puerto Madero]] northern entrance . It will be the most modern and sustainable building in Buenos Aires and the second tallest of the city.&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arq.clarin.com/urbano/Catalinas-Norte-renueva-torres-sumaran_0_1621038011.html |title=Catalinas Norte se renueva: cómo son las dos torres que se sumarán a la zona |publisher=''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]''}} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costantini had carried out real estate projects outside Argentina. He built Las Garzas complex in [[Rocha, Uruguay|Rocha]], Uruguay,&lt;ref name=iprofesional&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iprofesional.com/notas/151130-Las-Garzas-el-millonario-proyecto-de-lujo-de-Costantini-toma-forma-en-la-costa-de-Rocha |title=Las Garzas: el millonario proyecto de lujo de Costantini toma forma en la costa de Rocha |publisher=''iProfesional.com''}} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he also invested 10 million dollars in the construction of the [[Laguna Garzon Bridge|circular bridge]] –designed by [[Rafael Viñoly]]- that connects the departments of Rocha and [[Maldonado Department|Maldonado]].&lt;ref name=dezeen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2016/01/19/laguna-garzon-bridge-circular-rafael-vinoly-uruguay-lagoon/ |title=Rafael Viñoly completes circular bridge spanning a Uruguayan lagoon |publisher=''De Zeen''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2009 he founded at the [[United States]] Consultatio Real Estate, responsible of the development of Oceana [[Key Biscayne]] – a complex of exclusive apartments and vilas facing the sea- and Oceana [[Bal Harbour]], which will be finished at the end of 2016. Both projects are placed in [[Miami]] and will include art pieces by internationally renowned artists, such as [[Jeff Koons]].&lt;ref name=FORBES&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2014/10/14/the-30m-miami-penthouse-oceana-developer-doesnt-see-a-real-estate-bubble/#190860be4872 |title=The $30M Miami Penthouse: Oceana Developer Costantini Doesn't See A Real Estate Bubble |publisher=''[[Forbes]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MALBA Museum ===
[[File:Fachada_MALBA.jpg|thumb|240px|Facade of the MALBA]]
In 1995 Eduardo Costantini founded the Eduardo F. Costantini Foundation with the purpose of promoting cultural and educational activities in Buenos Aires. In September 2001 he donated over 220 internationally prestigious Latin American art pieces to open [[MALBA]], Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires (Museum of Latin American Art of Buenos Aires). This is a private non-profit institution with a net worth of over 600 works on exhibit by the main modern and contemporary artists of the region, such as [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Tarsila do Amaral]], [[Wifredo Lam]], [[Xul Solar]], [[Joaquín Torres Garcia]], [[Emilio Pettorutti]], [[Candido Portinari|Cándido Portinari]] and [[Antonio Berni]].&lt;ref name=fodors&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/south-america/argentina/buenos-aires/things-to-do/sights/reviews/malba-154815  |title=MALBA |publisher=''Fodors Travel''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, the museum mixes its permanent collection with temporary exhibits, [[Film|cinema]] and [[literature]] programs and an important educational activity for children, families, grandparents and disabled people.&lt;ref name=losandes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivo.losandes.com.ar/notas/2012/6/3/malba-645810.asp |title=El MALBA |publisher=''Los Andes''}} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costantini Foundation covers the deficit of the museum&lt;ref name=malba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malba.org.ar/transparencia-1/ |title=Recursos y marco legal |publisher=MALBA}} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; -valued in 3 million dollars per year- through funds donated by Costanini. He decided to donate part of his fortune to charity, as many other millionaires throughout the world had already done.&lt;ref name=LANACION&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1294811-cuanto-se-dona-el-aporte-de-los-argentinos-ricos |title=Cuánto se dona. El aporte de los argentinos ricos |publisher=''[[La Nación]]''}} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
As art collector and promoter, he is member of the International Advisory Board of [[São Paulo Art Biennial]] Foundation. He also was Chairman Council at the [[MoMA|Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) of [[New York City]], member of the Advisory Committee of the [[David Rockefeller]] Center of Latin American Studies at [[Harvard University]] and founder member of the Global Philanthropist Circle, [[Synergos Institute]], New York.&lt;ref name=cronista&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cronista.com/general/Eduardo-Costantini-20080815-0159.html |title=Eduardo Costanini biography.

== Awards ==
In 2008 he received the [[Konex Award]], merit diploma as “Media and service businessman” and the [[MALBA]] was recognized as the best cultural entity of the last decade.&lt;ref name=cronistakonex2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionkonex.org/b3002-malba--fundacion-costantini--museo-de-arte-latinoamericano-de-buenos-aires |title=MALBA - Fundación Costantini - Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires |publisher=Fundación Konex}} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
At the beginning of the 2000s, [[Israel]] and the US accused Syria that it enabled Arab mujahideen to percolate weapons through its borders into [[Iraq]], mainly through influential Firas Tlass.&lt;ref name=asiatimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Athanasiadis|first=Iason|title=Syria: Odd man out in a tough neighbourhood|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/EJ09Ak05.html|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Asia Times|date=9 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, it was also claimed that Iraq officials sent their banned weapons to Syria via Tlass, who had trade connections with Iraq.&lt;ref name=aps29mar&gt;{{cite news|title=Damascus Rejects 'Unfounded' Arms Claims|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SYRIA+-+March+28+-+Damascus+Rejects+'Unfounded'+Arms+Claims.-a099874218|accessdate=26 March 2013|work=APS Diplomat Recorder|date=29 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firas was also accused of corruption and of benefiting from the Assad government.&lt;ref name=bbc6712&gt;{{cite news|title=Manaf Tlas: Syrian regime 'taking country to Hell'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18737185|accessdate=6 July 2012|work=BBC|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' argued in 2011 that he was among those who got a 5% commission on deals they brokered in Syria.&lt;ref name=forbes11/&gt;

In 2012-2014 [[LafargeHolcim]]'s factory in Jalabiya, northern Syria, continued to operate as the Syrian war raged around it. Factory chief Bruno Pescheux has admitted Lafarge paid up to $100,000 a month to Syrian tycoon Firas Tlass, a former minority shareholder who gave cash to armed factions in order to keep the factory open.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france24.com/en/20171208-former-lafarge-ceo-charged-terror-financing-allegations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defection and views==
It was reported by [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] that Firas and his father, former defense minister Mustafa Tlass, arrived in Paris in March 2012. But their move was not seen as a defection.&lt;ref name=afb312&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian former defence minister Tlass in France|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g7sa3qN_SVIMtnJ4cY9u_ypkj-DQ?docId=CNG.3e2a6b317923f10174ad9bb42adbacc4.2c1|accessdate=6 July 2012|work=Agence France-Presse|date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is another report on his defection. It states that Mustafa Tlas and his son, Firas, both left Syria since the revolt against Assad began in 2011.&lt;ref name=reu12&gt;{{cite news|last=Oweis|first=Khaled Yacoub|title=Newsmaker: Syrian general breaks from Assad's inner circle|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/05/us-syria-crisis-tlas-idUSBRE8640X920120705|accessdate=5 July 2012|work=Reuters|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is added that Mustafa Tlass left for France for what he described as medical treatment, while Firas left Syria for [[Egypt]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=reu12/&gt; There is another report, indicating that Firas is in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name=gua12&gt;{{cite news|title=Top Syrian general 'defects to Turkey'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/05/top-syrian-general-defects-turkey?newsfeed=true|accessdate=5 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 July 2012|author=Julian Borger|author2=Martin Chulov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that Firas in France with his father.&lt;ref name=wsj6712&gt;{{cite news|last=Malas|first=Nour|title=Defected Syrian General Heads to Paris as Diplomats Meet|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304141204577510124016836002?mod=googlenews_wsj|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is another report, arguing that Firas travels between the United Arab Emirates and France.&lt;ref name=ajckaram&gt;{{cite news|last=Karam|first=Zaina|title=Syrian defector _ regime insider from Sunni family|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/syrian-defector-_-regime-1473048.html|accessdate=6 July 2012|work=AJC|date=6 July 2012|agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brother Manaf Tlass, a Syrian officer, defected from the Assad government and fled to [[Turkey]] and on 6 July 2012, he went to France from Turkey.&lt;ref name=reu12/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj6712/&gt; 

On 26 July 2012, Firas Tlass expressed his support for Bashar Al-Assad’s resignation. He further declared that he had provided the [[Farouq Brigades]] in the [[Free Syrian Army]], commanded by his cousin Abdul Razzak Tlass, with the humanitarian and relief aid.&lt;ref name=alhindi&gt;{{cite news|last=Al Hindi|first=Omar|title=The life and times of the defecting Syrian army man, Manaf Tlas|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/07/26/228550.html|accessdate=26 July 2012|work=Al Arabiya|date=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March 2013, he told [[Al Arabiya]] that Syria had had secret business deals with [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=mil7mar&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Elhanan|title=Assad’s Syria sold Israel oil, businessman claims|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/assads-syria-sold-israel-oil-defector-claims/|newspaper=The Times of Israel|accessdate=12 March 2013|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">'''FitzPatrick 1932''' is an early paper in the field of [[bankruptcy prediction]].  In a series of three articles in the monthly ''The Certified Public Accountant'' in 1932, Paul J. FitzPatrick presented data for 20 matched pairs of firms and discussed accounting ratios as indicators of bankruptcy.  It is historically significant as an early attempt in this field, and it is notable also for its publishing a data set, now in the public domain.  Beaver (1968), an important paper in accounting research which employs statistical analysis to a similar matched sample, cites the paper.

The dataset includes 13 accounting ratios calculated for 40 firms for each of three years.  However some fields are missing for some firm-year observations.

'''Hans Mortensen''' (born 2 September [[1943]] at [[Tórshavn]], [[Faroe Islands]]), is a retired [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] [[Businessperson|businessman]] and [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]]. He is famous for founding and managing the biggest department store in [[Tórshavn]], [[SMS]], and is also recognised for his contribution in introducing trade and business terminology into the [[Faroese language]]. Between 1963 and 1976 he was a driving force in developing elite handball in the Faroe Islands.

== Personal life ==
Mortensen was born and raised in Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands. He is the son of business owners Niels Gustav Mortensen (1913 – 1987) and Ebba Mortensen (1920 – 2000), who each ran trading businesses in one of the older trading quarters of Tórshavn between 1952 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pfformula.ipapercms.dk/SMS/SMSbl/SMSbl2012/SMSbloktober2012/|title=SMS : Hans Mortensen|date=November 2012|website=Pfformula.ipapercms.dk|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, he married Birgit Mortensen (née Sivertsen), and together they had a daughter, Elisabeth Mortensen and a son, Niels Mortensen. Niels Mortensen took over as CEO of SMS after his father stepped down from the position in 1996, and as a member of its board after Mortensen retired in 2007. After being a widower since 2001, Mortensen remarried in 2007 with Marjun á Plógv.

== Education ==
After completing primary and secondary school, Mortensen received his Upper Secondary diploma from [[Føroya Millum- og Realskúli]] and took on an apprenticeship at Føroya Banki (now [[BankNordik]]). In 1967, Mortensen graduated from the [[Niels Brock]] business school in [[Copenhagen]] and shortly after started working at the [[Magasin du Nord]] department store on [[Kongens Nytorv]] in Copenhagen. After two years at the department store, Mortensen returned to the Faroe Islands to found his own business and improve the lagging business conditions in the country.

== Sport ==
Mortensen’s life-long commitment to Faroese elite [[handball]] began in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1963, at the age of 18, Mortensen became the president of the Tórshavn handball club [[Neistin]] and immediately initiated the construction of a club venue, completed in the following year. The venue was crucial to the club’s subsequent popularity and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hvannrok.fo/2016/03/30/neistaeldsalin-hans-mortensen-var-framsiggin-hondboltsleidari/|title=Neistaeldsálin Hans Mortensen var framsíggin hondbóltsleiðari - Hvannrók|website=Hvannrok.fo|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Mortensen played on the first Faroese men’s national handball team. In 1976, Mortensen was head coach for the men’s national handball team when they achieved good results during the Men’s Handball World Championship 1976 Group C in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todor66.com/handball/World/Men_C_1976.html|title=Men Handball World Championship 1976 Group C Portugal - 26.11-01.12 Winner Portugal|first=Todor|last=Krastev|website=Todor66.com|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After completing his education in [[Denmark]], Mortensen ran his own retail business in his parents’ premises in central Tórshavn. But in 1970, Mortensen organised the first of many trade fairs in the Faroe Islands. A few attempts had been made earlier at arranging similar events in 1968 in Klaksvík.&lt;ref&gt; Cf. Tingakrossur no. 29 – 26 July 1968, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the trade fairs showed that demand for the Faroese market was bigger than the market was capable of supplying at the time.

Most businesses were located in central Torshavn, and increasing traffic and construction was causing congestion. Tórshavn's city council was therefore planning to establish a shopping street as an extension of a new pharmacy at the outskirts of the city centre to divert some of the traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Dagblaðið no. 43 – 28 juli 1976, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoydal, Gunnar: Sosialurin no. 78 – 7 July 1984, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon learning of the city plans and the reasons behind them, Mortensen suggested privatising the project in order to further promote business. After initial internal disputes, Mortensen was granted permission to build his department store, which would enable customers to run various errands in a single location.

Mortensen hired Danish architect Flemming Hansen to design a progressive department store, whose architecture would still be rooted in traditional Faroese building style. Construction began in 1976, and the department store SMS opened to the public on November 2nd, 1977. Mortensen was CEO of SMS from 1976 to 1996 and majority shareholder until 2007, when he sold all his shares to his son Niels Mortensen. Niels Mortensen has since then developed the business further. Today the SMS Group includes three shopping centers, three chain stores, a number of partnerships and a microbiological laboratory.

== Business and visions ==
Mortensen’s visions have been characterised by both progressiveness and traditionalism. The department store SMS was designed to resemble traditional Faroese boathouses, and Faroese shop names and business terminology was developed by taking into account common citizen and customer opinions, often through public naming competitions. Over time, the previous predominately Danish business terminology was replaced by newly created Faroese terminology, which continues to evolve with the introduction of new terms and technology.

In an effort to combine innovation with historic preservation, Mortensen collaborated with architects Gunnar Hoydal, Mette Skjold, and Ósbjørn Jacobsen in 2012 to create a public proposal on how to continue developing the Tórshavn city centre while maintaining its historic features.&lt;ref&gt;Hoydal, Gunnar et al, Havnin innan fyri Stóragarð: hugsjónir og dreymar, Tórshavn 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
On International Mother Language Day in 2015, Mortensen received the Faroese Mother Language Award for his longstanding contribution to society and language, particularly his innovative approaches to Faroese trade and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snar.fo/tema/skaldskapur-og-midlar/modurmalid/modurmalsvirdisloen/|title=Móðurmálsvirðisløn|website=Snar.fo|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1951 Bombay Province Rs 2500 Hundi.jpg|thumbnail|right|A hundi for Rs 2500 of 1951, stamped in the Bombay Province with a pre-printed [[revenue stamp]].]]
A '''Hundi''' is a [[financial instrument]] that developed in [[Medieval India]] for use in trade and credit transactions. Hundis are used as a form of remittance instrument to transfer money from place to place, as a form of credit instrument or IOU to borrow money and as a [[bill of exchange]] in trade transactions. The [[Reserve Bank of India]] describes the Hundi as "an unconditional order in writing made by a person directing another to pay a certain sum of money to a person named in the order."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbi.org.in/scripts/ms_hundies.aspx Hundies], Reserve Bank of India, 2013. Retrieved 26 November 2013. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126010531/http://rbi.org.in/scripts/ms_hundies.aspx |date=November 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Watermark on an Indian 2a Hundi.jpg|thumbnail|right|Government issued hundis included a [[watermark]] to prevent forgery.]]
Hundis have a very long history in India. Written records show their use at least as far back as the sixteenth century. The merchant Banarasi Das, born 1586, received a hundi for 200 rupees from his father to enable him to borrow money to start trading.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/h/hundi_indian_bill_of_exchange.aspx Hundi (Indian bill of exchange),] [[British Museum]], 2013. Retrieved 26 November 2013. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126011955/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/h/hundi_indian_bill_of_exchange.aspx |date=November 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial era, the British government regarded the hundi system as indigenous or traditional, but not informal. They were reluctant to interfere with it as it formed such an important part of the Indian economy and they also wished to tax the transactions taking place within the system.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/indiaatlse/2013/01/16/hundihawala-in-india/ Between informality and formality: Hundi/Hawala in India], Marina Martin, [[London School of Economics]] India Blog, 16 January 2013. Retrieved 26 November 2013. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530023156/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/indiaatlse/2013/01/16/hundihawala-in-india/ |date=May 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Official hundi forms were produced incorporating revenue stamps bearing the image of British monarchs, including Queen Victoria, and disputes between merchants often entered the court system, so in no way was the system an underground one even though it did not take place through normal banking channels.

==Types of Hundi==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
*'''Sahyog Hundi''': This is drawn by one merchant on another, asking the latter to pay the amount to a third merchant. In this case the merchant on whom the hundi is drawn is of some 'credit worthiness' in the market and is known in the bazaar. A sahyog hundi passes from one hand to another till it reaches the final recipient, who, after reasonable enquiries, presents it to the drawee for acceptance of the payment. Sahyog means co-operation in Hindi and Gujrati, the predominant languages of traders. The hundi is so named because it required the co-operation of multiple parties to ensure that the hundi has an acceptable risk and fairly good likelihood of being paid, in the absence of a formalized credit monitoring and reporting framework.
*'''Darshani Hundi''': This is a hundi payable on sight. It must be presented for payment within a reasonable time after its receipt by the holder. Thus, it is similar to a demand bill.
*'''Muddati Hundi''': A muddati or miadi hundi is payable after a specified period of time. This is similar to a time bill.

There are few other varieties; the Nam-jog hundi, Dhani-jog hundi, Jawabee hundi, Jokhami hundi, Firman-jog hundi, etc.

* Nam-jog hundi - such a hundi is payable only to the person whose name is mentioned on the Hundi. Such a hundi cannot be endorsed in favour of any other person and is akin to a bill on which a restrictive endorsement has been made.
* Furman-jog Hundi - such a hundi can be paid either to the person whose name is mentioned in the hundi or to any person so ordered by him. Such a hundi is similar to a cheque payable on order and no endorsement is required on such a hundi.
* Dhani-jog Hundi - when the hundi is payable to the holder or bearer,it is known as a dhani jog hundi. It is similar to an instrument payable to bearer.
* Jokhim-Hundi - normally a hundi is unconditional but a jokhim hundi is conditional in the sense that the drawer promises to pay the amount of the hundi only on the satisfaction of a certain condition. Such a hundi is not negotiable, and the prevalence of such hundis is very rare these days because banks and insurance companies refuse to accept such hundis.
* Jawabi Hundi - if money is transferred from one place to another through the hundi and the person receiving the payment on is to give an acknowledgement (jawab) for same, then such a hundi is known as a Jawabi Hundi.
* Khaka Hundi - a hundi which has already been paid is known as a Khaka Hundi.
* Khoti Hundi - In case there is any kind of defect in the hundi or in case the hundi has been forged, then such a hundi is known as a khoti hundi.

'''Keeree Kanjanapas''' (Thai: คีรี กาญจนพาสน์; {{zh|t=黃創山|p=Huáng Chuàngshān}}; English: Wong Chong Shan) was born in Bangkok, Thailand in 1950. His family roots are in Chaozhou (Guangdong Province). He is a Thai entrepreneur with extensive business interests in mass transit and real estate in Thailand.

== Seiko S. A. ==
Keeree's father Mongkol Kanjanapas (黃子明) was a businessman born in Bangkok and based in both Thailand and Hong Kong. Mongkol founded [[Stelux Holdings]] (寶光實業) and was the importer of [[Seiko]] watches. Keeree decided to use football to promote the Seiko brand and founded one of the most famous and successful football teams ever in Hong Kong, [[Seiko Sports Association]] (精工), in the 1970s and 1980s. Keeree recruited top local player [[Wu Kwok Hung]] from [[South China AA]] by offering him a HK$40,000 annual salary. With Wu and a host of foreign players, the team won a total of nine [[Hong Kong First Division League]] titles including a record seven consecutive titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesasia/2016/11/29/against-all-odds-keeree-kanjanapas-built-bangkoks-mass-transit-systems/#198847e64658|title=Against All Odds, Keeree Kanjanapas Built Bangkok's Mass Transit Systems|newspaper=Forbes Asia|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, when his plans for a super league was turned down by the [[Hong Kong Football Association]], coupled with a Stelux business downturn, Keeree dissolved the football team after a full house farewell match for Wu Kwok Hung.{{CN|date=August 2017}}

== Personal life ==
Keeree is the 13th richest man in Thailand as of 2016, up from 19th in 2012. He is worth US$1.55 billion according to [[Forbes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/keeree-kanjanapas/|title=Keeree Kanjanapas|work=Forbes|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and banking career==
Omar is married, and has four children.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;

Omar was Chairman of the [[Bank of Alexandria]], one of Egypt's largest banks.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/01/egyptian-banker-sexual-assault-bail |title=Egyptian banker charged with sexual assault is granted bail; assault is granted bail; Mahmoud Abdel-Salam Omar to reappear in court to face claims he sexually abused maid in luxury New York hotel |publisher=The Guardian |date= June 1, 2011|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also a former head of the Egyptian Banks Federation, and of the Egyptian American Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Yasser Sobhi |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/603/ec1.htm |title=Economy &amp;#124; The winds of change |publisher=Al-Ahram Weekly |date=September 18, 2002 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arabnews1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zraick |first=Karen |url=http://arabnews.com/world/article445896.ece |title=Egyptian businessman denies charges in sex case |publisher=Arab News |date=June 1, 2011 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is currently the Chairman of El-Mex Salines, an Egyptian salt production company, at which he has worked since 2009.&lt;ref name="bloomberg2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arabnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailystar1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2011/Jun-01/Egypt-general-defends-virginity-tests.ashx#axzz1OiFLFD1I |title=Middle East: Egypt general defends virginity tests |publisher=The Daily Star |date=June 1, 2011 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual assault charges==
A 44-year-old maid at the [[Pierre Hotel]] on New York City's [[Upper East Side]] told authorities that on May 29, 2011, Omar called for room service, asking for a box of tissues to be delivered to his $900-a-night room.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; She said that when she delivered the tissues to his room, Omar locked his door, grabbed her in a bear hug, and began groping her breasts and kissing her on her neck and lips, squeezed her buttocks, and ground his crotch against her leg.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arabnews1"/&gt;  She said that Omar only let her leave after she agreed to give him her phone number, and that she gave him a false one.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Police said the maid reported the incident to her supervisor immediately, but that the supervisor told her to report the incident to a hotel security official the following day, and consequently the police weren't notified until the following day.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  A police spokesman said that detectives found the maid to be credible.&lt;ref name="dailystar1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hossam El-Kady |url=http://213.158.162.45/~egyptian/index.php?action=news&amp;id=18725&amp;title=Egyptian%20exec%20held%20in%20attack%20on%20NY%20maid |title=Egyptian exec held in attack on NY maid |publisher=The Egyptian Gazette |date=May 31, 2011 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omar was arrested on May 30, 2011.  He was charged with two counts of sexual assault, consisting of [[sex abuse]] and forcible touching.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;  He appeared in [[Manhattan Criminal Court]], and was released from [[Rikers Island]] on June 3, 2011, after posting $25,000 cash [[bail]] and surrendering his passport as he awaits trial.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arabnews1"/&gt;  Omar was scheduled to return to court on August 23, 2011.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  His lawyer said he denies the charges.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;

[[File:Consolidated TB-32 production line.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Mass production of [[Consolidated B-32 Dominator]] airplanes at [[Consolidated Aircraft]] Plant No. 4, near Fort Worth, Texas, during World War II.]]

'''Mass production''', also known as flow production or continuous production, is the production of large amounts of [[standardized]] products, including and especially on [[assembly line]]s. Together with [[job production]] and [[batch production]], it is one of the three main production methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/business/production/methodsofproductionrev1.shtml Production Methods], BBC GCSE Bitesize, retrieved 2012-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''mass production'' was popularized by a 1926 article in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' supplement that was written based on correspondence with [[Ford Motor Company]].  The ''New York Times'' used the term in the title of an article that appeared before publication of the ''Britannica'' article.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of mass production are applied to various kinds of products, from [[fluids]] and particulates handled in bulk (such as [[food]], [[fuel]], [[chemicals]], and [[mining|mined]] [[minerals]]) to discrete solid parts (such as fasteners) to assemblies of such parts (such as [[household appliances]] and [[automobiles]]).

Mass production is a diverse field, but it can generally be contrasted with [[craft production]] or [[distributed manufacturing]]. Some mass production techniques, such as standardized sizes and production lines, predate the [[Industrial Revolution]] by many centuries; however, it was not until the introduction of [[machine tool]]s and techniques to produce interchangeable parts were developed in the mid 19th century that modern mass production was possible.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"/&gt;

==Overview==
Mass production involves making many copies of products, very quickly, using assembly line techniques to send partially complete products to workers who each work on an individual step, rather than having a worker work on a whole product from start to finish.

Mass production of fluid matter typically involves pipes with [[centrifugal pump]]s or [[screw conveyor]]s (augers) to transfer raw materials or partially complete products between vessels.  Fluid flow processes such as oil refining and bulk materials such as wood chips and pulp are automated using a system of [[process control]] which uses various instruments to measure variables such as temperature, pressure, volumetric  and level, providing feedback

Bulk materials such as coal, ores, grains and wood chips are handled by belt, chain, slat, pneumatic or [[screw conveyor|screw]] conveyors, [[bucket elevator]]s and mobile equipment such as front-end [[Loader (equipment)|loaders]].  Materials on pallets are handled with forklifts.  Also used for handling heavy items like reels of paper, steel or machinery are electric [[overhead crane]]s, sometimes called bridge cranes because they span large factory bays.

Mass production is [[Capital intensity|capital intensive]] and energy intensive, as it uses a high proportion of machinery and energy in relation to workers. It is also usually [[Automation|automated]] while total expenditure per unit of product is decreased. However, the machinery that is needed to set up a mass production line (such as [[robot]]s and [[machine press]]es) is so expensive that there must be some assurance that the product is to be successful to attain profits.

One of the descriptions of mass production is that "the skill is built into the tool" {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}, which means that the worker using the tool may not need the skill. For example, in the 19th or early 20th century, this could be expressed as "the craftsmanship is in the [[workbench]] itself" (not the training of the worker). Rather than having a skilled worker measure every dimension of each part of the product against the plans or the other parts as it is being formed, there were [[jig (tool)|jigs]] ready at hand to ensure that the part was made to fit this set-up. It had already been checked that the finished part would be to specifications to fit all the other finished parts—and it would be made more quickly, with no time spent on finishing the parts to fit one another. Later, once computerized control came about (for example, [[CNC]]), jigs were obviated, but it remained true that the skill (or knowledge) was built into the tool (or process, or documentation) rather than residing in the worker's head. This is the specialized capital required for mass production; each workbench and set of tools (or each CNC cell, or each [[fractionating column]]) is different (fine-tuned to its task).

==History==
=== Pre-industrial ===
Standardized parts and sizes and factory production techniques were developed in pre-industrial times; however, before the invention of [[machine tool]]s the manufacture of precision parts, especially metal ones, was very labor-intensive.

[[File:Printer in 1568-ce.png|thumb|upright|This [[woodcut]] from 1568 shows the left printer removing a page from the press while the one at right inks the text-blocks. Such a duo could reach 14,000 hand movements per working day, printing around 3,600 pages in the process.&lt;ref name="Wolf 1974, 67f."&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=67f.}}: {{quote|From old price tables it can be deduced that the capacity of a printing press around 1600, assuming a fifteen-hour workday, was between 3,200 and 3,600 impressions per day.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Crossbows]] made with bronze parts were produced in [[China]] during the [[Warring States period]]. The Qin Emperor unified China at least in part by equipping large armies with these weapons, which were equipped with a sophisticated trigger mechanism made of interchangeable parts.&lt;ref&gt;Mass-Produced Pre-Han Chinese Bronze Crossbow Triggers: Unparalleled Manufacturing Technology in the Ancient World. by David Williams. Arms &amp; Armour, Volume 5, Number 2, October 2008 , pp. 142-153(12) http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/aaa/2008/00000005/00000002/art00003  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211212949/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/aaa/2008/00000005/00000002/art00003 |date=11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Galley|Ships of war]] were produced on a large scale at a moderate cost by the [[Carthaginians]] in their excellent harbors, allowing them to efficiently maintain their control of the [[Mediterranean]]. The [[Venice|Venetians]] themselves also produced ships using prefabricated parts and [[assembly line]]s many centuries later. The [[Venetian Arsenal]] apparently produced nearly one ship every day, in what was effectively the world's first [[factory]] which, at its height, employed 16,000 people. Mass production in the publishing industry has been commonplace since the [[Gutenberg Bible]] was published using a [[printing press]] in the mid-15th century.

===Industrial===
In the [[Industrial Revolution]] simple mass production techniques were used at the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] in England to make ships' pulley blocks for the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It was achieved in 1803 by [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] in cooperation with [[Henry Maudslay]] under the management of Sir [[Samuel Bentham]].&lt;ref name="Pulleys"/&gt;The first unmistakable examples of manufacturing operations carefully designed to reduce production costs by specialized labour and the use of machines appeared in the 18th century in England. &lt;ref&gt; Brumcarrier &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PulleyShip.JPG|thumb|left|A pulley block for rigging on a sailing ship. By 1808, annual production in Portsmouth reached 130,000 blocks.]]
The Navy was in a state of expansion that required 100,000 [[Block (sailing)|pulley blocks]] to be manufactured a year. Bentham had already achieved remarkable efficiency at the docks by introducing power-driven machinery and reorganising the dockyard system. Brunel, a pioneering engineer, and Maudslay, a pioneer of machine tool technology who had developed the first industrially practical [[screw-cutting lathe]] in 1800 which standardized [[screw thread]] sizes for the first time which in turn allowed the application of [[interchangeable parts]], collaborated on plans to manufacture block-making machinery. By 1805, the dockyard had been fully updated with the revolutionary, purpose-built machinery at a time when products were still built individually with different components.&lt;ref name="Pulleys"/&gt; A total of 45 machines were required to perform 22 processes on the blocks, which could be made into one of three possible sizes.&lt;ref name="Pulleys"/&gt; The machines were almost entirely made of metal thus improving their accuracy and durability. The machines would make markings and indentations on the blocks to ensure alignment throughout the process. One of the many advantages of this new method was the increase in labour [[productivity]] due to the less labour-intensive requirements of managing the machinery.

He also used [[British Standard Whitworth|Whitworth Standard]] threads throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= |first= |last= |newspaper=The Times |date=24 January 1887 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prerequisites for the wide use of mass production were [[interchangeable parts]], [[machine tools]] and [[power (physics)|power]], especially in the form of [[electricity]].

Some of the organizational management concepts needed to create 20th-century mass production, such as [[scientific management]], had been pioneered by other engineers (most of whom are not famous, but [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] is one of the well-known ones), whose work would later be synthesized into fields such as [[industrial engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[operations research]], and [[management consultancy]]. Although after leaving the [[Henry Ford Company]] which was rebranded as [[Cadillac]] and later was awarded the [[Dewar Trophy]] in 1908 for creating interchangeable mass-produced precision engine parts, [[Henry Ford]] downplayed the role of Taylorism in the development of mass production at his company. However, Ford management performed time studies and experiments to mechanize their factory processes, focusing on minimizing worker movements. The difference is that while Taylor focused mostly on efficiency of the worker, Ford also substituted for labor by using machines, thoughtfully arranged, wherever possible.


In 1807, [[Eli Terry]] was hired to produce 4,000 wooden movement clocks in the Porter Contract. At this time, the annual yield for wooden clocks did not exceed a few dozen on average. Terry developed a [[Milling machine]] in 1795, in which he perfected [[Interchangeable parts]]. In 1807, Terry developed a spindle cutting machine, which could produce multiple parts at the same time. Terry hired [[Silas Hoadley]] and [[Seth Thomas (clockmaker)|Seth Thomas]] to work the [[Assembly line]] at the facilities. The Porter Contract was the first contract which called for mass production of clock movements in history. In 1815, Terry began mass producing the first shelf clock. [[Chauncey Jerome]], an apprentice of Eli Terry mass produced up to 20,000 brass clocks annually in 1840 when he invented the cheap 30 hour OG clock. &lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Kenneth D., and Snowden Taylor. Eli Terry and the Connecticut Shelf Clock. Ken Roberts Publishing, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of War]] sponsored the development of interchangeable parts for guns produced at the arsenals at [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] and [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], Virginia (now West Virginia) in the early decades of the 19th century, finally achieving reliable interchangeability by about 1850.&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984" /&gt; This period coincided with the development of [[machine tools]], with the armories designing and building many of their own.  Some of the methods employed were a system of gauges for checking dimensions of the various parts and [[jig (tool)|jigs]] and [[fixture (tool)|fixture]]s for guiding the machine tools and properly holding and aligning the work pieces.  This system came to be known as ''armory practice'' or the ''[[American system of manufacturing]]'', which spread throughout New England aided by skilled mechanics from the armories who were instrumental in transferring the technology to the sewing machines manufacturers and other industries such as machine tools, harvesting machines and bicycles. [[Singer Corporation|Singer Manufacturing Co.]], at one time the largest sewing machine manufacturer, did not achieve interchangeable parts until the late 1880s, around the same time [[Cyrus McCormick]] adopted modern manufacturing practices in making [[reaper|harvesting machines]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984"/&gt;

Mass production benefited from the development of materials such as inexpensive steel, high strength steel and plastics. Machining of metals was greatly enhanced with [[high speed steel]] and later very hard materials such as [[tungsten carbide]] for cutting edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;  Fabrication using steel components was aided by the development of [[electric resistance welding|electric welding]] and stamped steel parts, both which appeared in industry in about 1890. Plastics such as [[polyethylene]], [[polystyrene]] and [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) can be easily formed into shapes by [[plastics extrusion|extrusion]], [[blow molding]] or [[injection molding]], resulting in very low cost manufacture of consumer products, plastic piping, containers and parts.

An influential article that helped to frame and popularize the 20th century's definition of mass production appeared in a 1926 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' supplement. The article was written based on correspondence with Ford Motor Company and is sometimes credited as the first use of the term.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factory electrification ===
[[Electrification]] of factories began very gradually in the 1890s after the introduction of a practical [[DC motor]] by [[Frank J. Sprague]] and accelerated after the [[AC motor]] was developed by [[Galileo Ferraris]], [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and others. Electrification of factories was fastest between 1900 and 1930, aided by the establishment of electric utilities with central stations and the lowering of electricity prices from 1914 to 1917.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"&gt;{{ Cite book

Electric motors were several times more efficient than small steam engines because central station generation were more efficient than small steam engines and because [[line shaft]]s and belts had high friction losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal

Many factories saw a 30% increase in output just from changing over to electric motors.

Electrification enabled modern mass production, as with Thomas Edison’s iron ore processing plant (about 1893) that could process 20,000 tons of ore per day with two shifts of five men each. At that time it was still common to handle bulk materials with shovels, wheelbarrows and small narrow gauge rail cars, and for comparison, a canal digger in previous decades typically handled 5 tons per 12-hour day.

The biggest impact of early mass production was in manufacturing everyday items, such as at the [[Ball Brothers]] [[Ball Corporation|Glass Manufacturing Company]], which electrified its [[mason jar]] plant in [[Muncie, Indiana]], U.S. around 1900. The new automated process used glass blowing machines to replace 210 craftsman glass blowers and helpers. A small electric truck was used to handle 150 dozen bottles at a time where previously a hand truck would carry 6 dozen. Electric mixers replaced men with shovels handling sand and other ingredients that were fed into the glass furnace. An electric overhead crane replaced 36 [[day labor]]ers for moving heavy loads across the factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology |last=Nye |first=David E. |authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England |isbn= |pages=14, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Henry Ford]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Edison as I Know Him |last1=Ford |first1=Henry |authorlink=Henry Ford |last2=Crowther |first2=Samuel |year=1930 |publisher= Cosmopolitan Book Company |location= New York |page=15 (on line edition) |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/3936620.0001.001?view=toc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The provision of a whole new system of electric generation emancipated industry from the leather belt and [[line shaft]], for it eventually became possible to provide each tool with its own electric motor. This may seem only a detail of minor importance. In fact, modern industry could not be carried out with the belt and line shaft for a number of reasons. The motor enabled machinery to be arranged in the order of the work, and that alone has probably doubled the efficiency of industry, for it has cut out a tremendous amount of useless handling and hauling. The belt and [[line shaft]] were also tremendously wasteful – so wasteful indeed that no factory could be really large, for even the longest line shaft was small according to modern requirements. Also high speed tools were impossible under the old conditions – neither the pulleys nor the belts could stand modern speeds.  Without high speed tools and the finer steels which they brought about, there could be nothing of what we call modern industry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Airacobra P39 Assembly LOC 02902u.jpg|thumb|The assembly plant of the Bell Aircraft Corporation in 1944. Note parts of [[overhead crane]] at both sides of photo near top.]]

Mass production was popularized in the late 1910s and 1920s by Henry Ford's [[Ford Motor Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|}}&lt;/ref&gt; when introduced electric motors to the then-well-known technique of chain or sequential production. Ford also bought or designed and built special purpose machine tools and fixtures such as multiple spindle [[Drill#Drill press|drill presses]] that could drill every hole on one side of an engine block in one operation and a multiple head [[milling machine]] that could simultaneously machine 15 engine blocks held on a single fixture. All of these machine tools were arranged systematically in the production flow and some had special carriages for rolling heavy items into machining position. Production of the [[Ford Model T]] used 32,000 machine tools.&lt;ref name= "Hounshell1984p288"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The use of assembly lines==
[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|left|thumb|Ford assembly line, 1913. The magneto assembly line was the first.]]
Mass production systems for items made of numerous parts are usually organized into [[assembly line]]s.  The assemblies pass by on a conveyor, or if they are heavy, hung from an [[overhead crane]] or monorail.

In a factory for a complex product, rather than one assembly line, there may be many auxiliary assembly lines feeding sub-assemblies (i.e. car engines or seats) to a backbone "main" assembly line.  A diagram of a typical mass-production factory looks more  like the skeleton of a fish than a single line.

==Vertical integration==
[[Vertical integration]] is a business practice that involves gaining complete control over a product's production, from raw materials to final assembly.

In the age of mass production, this caused shipping and trade problems in that shipping systems were unable to transport huge volumes of finished automobiles (in Henry Ford's case) without causing damage, and also government policies imposed trade barriers on finished units.&lt;ref&gt;''Womack, Jones, Roos; The Machine That Changed The World, Rawson &amp; Associates, New York. Published by Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford built the [[Ford River Rouge Complex]] with the idea of making the company's own iron and steel in the same large factory site as parts and car assembly took place.  River Rouge also generated its own electricity.

Upstream vertical integration, such as to raw materials, is away from leading technology toward mature, low return industries. Most companies chose to focus on their core business rather than vertical integration.  This included buying parts from outside suppliers, who could often produce them as cheaply or cheaper.

[[Standard Oil]], the major oil company in the 19th century, was vertically integrated partly because there was no demand for unrefined crude oil, but kerosene and some other products were in great demand.  The other reason was that Standard Oil monopolized the oil industry.  The major oil companies were, and many still are, vertically integrated, from production to refining and with their own retail stations, although some sold off their retail operations.   Some oil companies also have chemical divisions.

Lumber and paper companies at one time owned most of their timber lands and sold some finished products such as corrugated boxes.  The tendency has been to divest of timber lands to raise cash and to avoid property taxes.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The economies of mass production come from several sources. The primary cause is a reduction of non-productive effort of all types. In [[craft production]], the craftsman must bustle about a shop, getting parts and assembling them. He must locate and use many tools many times for varying tasks. In mass production, each worker repeats one or a few related tasks that use the same tool to perform identical or near-identical operations on a stream of products. The exact tool and parts are always at hand, having been moved down the assembly line consecutively. The worker spends little or no time retrieving and/or preparing materials and tools, and so the time taken to manufacture a product using mass production is shorter than when using traditional methods.

The probability of [[human error]] and variation is also reduced, as tasks are predominantly carried out by machinery; error in operating such machinery, however, has more far-reaching consequences. A reduction in labour costs, as well as an increased rate of production, enables a company to produce a larger quantity of one product at a lower cost than using traditional, non-linear methods.

However, mass production is inflexible because it is difficult to alter a [[design]] or [[Manufacturing|production]] process after a [[production line]] is implemented. Also, all products produced on one production line will be identical or very similar, and introducing variety to satisfy individual tastes is not easy. However, some variety can be achieved by applying different finishes and decorations at the end of the production line if necessary. The starter cost for the machinery can be expensive so the producer must be sure it sells or the producers will lose a lot of money.

The Ford Model T produced tremendous affordable output but was not very good at responding to demand for variety, [[customization]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, or design changes. As a consequence Ford eventually lost market share to General Motors, who introduced annual model changes, more accessories and a choice of colors.&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984"/&gt;

With each passing decade, engineers have found ways to increase the flexibility of mass production systems, driving down the [[lead time]]s on new product development and allowing greater customization and variety of products.

==Socioeconomic impacts==
In the 1830s, French political thinker and historian [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] identified one of the key characteristics of America that would later make it so amenable to the development of mass production: the homogeneous consumer base. De Tocqueville wrote in his ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835) that "The absence in the United States of those vast accumulations of [[wealth]] which favor the expenditures of large sums on articles of mere luxury... impact to the productions of American industry a character distinct from that of other countries' industries. [Production is geared toward] articles suited to the wants of the whole people".

Mass production improved [[Productivity#Historical productivity: Major sources of growth and effects on living standards|productivity]], which was a contributing factor to economic growth and the decline in work week hours, alongside other factors such as transportation infrastructures (canals, railroads and highways) and agricultural mechanization.  These factors caused the typical work week to decline from 70 hours in the early 19th century to 60 hours late in the century, then to 50 hours in the early 20th century and finally to 40 hours in the mid-1930s.

Mass production permitted great increases in total production.  Using a European crafts system into the late 19th century it was difficult to meet demand for products such as sewing machines and animal powered mechanical [[reaper|harvesters]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984" /&gt;  By the late 1920s many previously scarce goods were in good supply. One economist has argued that this constituted "overproduction" and contributed to high unemployment during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mass Production, the Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression: The Macroeconomics of Electrification |last=Beaudreau |first=Bernard C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1996 |publisher=Authors Choice Press|location=New York, Lincoln, Shanghi |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Say's law]] denies the possibility of general [[overproduction]] and for this reason classical economists deny that it had any role in the Great Depression.

Mass production allowed the [[sociocultural evolution|evolution]] of [[consumerism]] by lowering the [[unit cost]] of many goods used.

The [[intellectual property]] rights on [[photograph]]s are protected in different [[jurisdiction]]s by the laws governing [[copyright]] and [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]]. In some cases photography may be restricted by civil or criminal law. Publishing certain photographs can be restricted by [[Privacy law|privacy]] or other laws. Photography can be generally restricted in the interests of [[public morality]] and the [[Child protection|protection of children]].

Reactions to photography differ between societies, and even where there are no official restrictions there may be objections to photographing people or places. Reactions may range from complaints to violence for photography which is not illegal.

===Legal restrictions on photography===
[[File:Mass photo gathering uk.jpg|thumb|Mass photo gathering in UK.]]
[[File:Mass photo gathering uk 2.jpg|thumb|Mass photo gathering in UK.]]
In the United Kingdom there are no laws forbidding photography of private property from a public place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urban75.org/photos/photographers-rights-and-the-law.html|title=Photographers Rights And The Law In The UK - the law and photography|website=www.urban75.org|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photography on private land is not restricted if the landowner has given permission.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} However, landowners are permitted to impose any conditions they wish upon entry to a property, including forbidding or restricting photography.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Two public locations in the UK, [[Trafalgar Square]] and [[Parliament Square]], have a specific provision against photography for commercial purposes without the written permission of the [[Mayor of London|Mayor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/trafalgar_square_byelaws.pdf|title=Trafalgar Square Byelaws 2012|year=2012|work=Greater London Authority Act 1999, Section 385(1)|publisher=Greater London Authority |accessdate=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/parliament_square_gardens_byelaws.pdf|title=Parliament Square Garden Byelaws 2012|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Squares' Management Team and paying a fee,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/art-culture/trafalgar-square/managing-trafalgar-square/filming-trafalgar-square/application-process Application process&lt;/ref&gt; and permission is needed to photograph or film for commercial purposes in the [[Royal Parks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/park-management/licences-and-permits/filming-in-the-royal-parks|title=Commercial filming and photography|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=The Royal Parks|via=|accessdate=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persistent or aggressive photography of a single individual may come under the legal definition of [[harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;''Linda Macpherson LL.B, Dip.L.P., LL.M'' – [http://www.sirimo.co.uk/ukpr.php The UK Photographers Rights Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[contempt of court]], a criminal offence, to take a photograph in any [[court of law]] of any person, being a judge of the court or a juror or a witness in or a party to any proceedings before the court, whether civil or criminal, or to publish such a photograph. This includes photographs taken in a court building or the precincts of the court.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Justice Act 1925 (c.86) s.41&lt;/ref&gt;
Taking a photograph in a court can be seen as a serious offence, leading to a prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Mobile court photo sentence upheld – [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/3686557.stm news.bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regina v Vincent D No. 2004/01739/A7 [2004] EWCA Crim 1271&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition on taking photographs in the precincts is vague. It was designed to prevent the undermining of the dignity of the court, through the exploitation of images in low brow "picture papers".&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, G. "Seddon, Dell and rock n' roll: investigating alleged breaches of the ban on publishing photographs taken within courts or their precincts, 1925–1967" Crim. L.R. 874&lt;/ref&gt;

Photography of certain subject matter is restricted in the United Kingdom. In particular, the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]] restricts making or possessing pornography of children under 18, or what looks like pornography of under-18s. There is no law prohibiting photographing children in public spaces.

It is an offence under the [[Counter-Terrorism Act 2008]] to publish or communicate a photograph of a [[constable]] (not including [[Police Community Support Officer|PCSOs]]), a member of the armed forces, or a member of the security services, which is of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. There is a defence of acting with a reasonable excuse; however, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] is on the defence, under section 58A of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]]. A PCSO in 2009 cited [[Terrorism Act 2000#Section 44 powers (stop and search)|Section 44]] of the Terrorism Act 2000 to prevent a member of the public photographing him. Section 44 actually concerns stop and search powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/4289832.Man_questioned_under_terrorism_law_after_taking_picture_of_police_car_in_park/|title=Man questioned under terrorism law after taking picture of police car in park|last=Cosgrove|first=Sarah|date=14 April 2009|work=Enfield Independent|accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in January 2010 the stop-and-search powers granted under Section 44 were ruled illegal by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

Following a prolonged campaign, including a series of demonstrations by photographers dealt with by police officers and PCSOs,  the Metropolitan Police was forced to issue updated legal advice which confirms that "Members of the public and the media do not need a permit to film or photograph in public places and police have no power to stop them filming or photographing incidents or police personnel" and that "The power to stop and search someone under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 no longer exists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.met.police.uk/advice-and-information/photography-advice/ |title=Photography advice|website=Metropolitan Police Service |date=  |author= |accessdate= 10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an offence under section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to take a photograph of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, or possessing such a photograph. There is an identical defence of reasonable excuse. This offence (and possibly, but not necessarily the {{nowrap|s. 58(a)}} offence) covers only a photograph as described in {{nowrap|s. 2(3)(b)}} of the [[Terrorism Act 2006]]. As such, it must be of a kind likely to provide practical assistance to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. Whether the photograph in question is such is a matter for a jury, which is not required to look at the surrounding circumstances. The photograph must contain information of such a nature as to raise a reasonable suspicion that it was intended to be used to assist in the preparation or commission of an act of terrorism. It must call for an explanation. A photograph which is innocuous on its face will not fall foul of the provision if the prosecution adduces evidence that it was intended to be used for the purpose of committing or preparing a terrorist act. The defence may prove a reasonable excuse simply by showing that the photograph is possessed for a purpose other than to assist in the commission or preparation of an act of terrorism, even if the purpose of possession is otherwise unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;R v K [2008] EWCA Crim 185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright===

[[Copyright]] can subsist in an original photograph, i.e. a recording of light or other radiation on any medium on which an image is produced or from which an image by any means be produced, and which is not part of a film.&lt;ref name="CDPAs1"&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 1(1)(a) and s 4(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst photographs are classified as artistic works, the subsistence of copyright does not depend on artistic merit.&lt;ref name="CDPAs1"/&gt; The owner of the copyright in the photograph is the photographer – the person who creates it,&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 9(1)&lt;/ref&gt; by default.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 11(1)&lt;/ref&gt; However, where a photograph is taken by an employee [[Work for hire|in the course of employment]], the first owner of the copyright is the employer, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 11(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright which subsists in a photograph protects not merely the photographer from direct copying of his/her work, but also from indirect copying to reproduce his/her work, where a substantial part of his/her work has been copied.

Copyright in a photograph lasts for 70 years from the end of the year in which the photographer dies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 12&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of this lengthy period of existence of the copyright is that many family photographs which have no market value, but significant emotional value, remain subject to copyright, even when the original photographer cannot be traced (a problem known as [[copyright orphan]]), has given up photography, or died. In the absence of a licence, it will be an infringement of copyright in the photographs to copy them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 16(2)&lt;/ref&gt; When someone dies the rights will have transferred to someone else, perhaps through testamentary deposition (a will) or by inheritance. If there was no will, or if the photographer has not specified where the rights in the material should go, then the normal rules of inheritance will apply (although these rules are not specific to copyright and legal advice should be sought).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy/c-other/c-locating.htm| title=Locating a copyright owner| publisher=Intellectual Property Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scanning old family photographs, without permission, to a digital file for personal use is prima facie an infringement of copyright.

Certain photographs may not be protected by copyright. Section 171(3) of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] gives courts jurisdiction to refrain from enforcing the copyright which subsists in works on the grounds of public interest. For example, [[patent]] diagrams are held to be in the [[public domain]], and are thus not subject to copyright.

====Infringement====
[[File:No photographs stickers.png|thumb|right|220px|"No photographs" sticker. Designed for persons at conferences who do not want any digital likeness of them taken, including video, photography, audio, etc.]]
Infringement of the copyright which subsists in a photograph can be performed through copying the photograph. This is because the owner of the copyright in the photograph has the exclusive right to copy the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 16(1)&lt;/ref&gt; For there to be infringement of the copyright in a photograph, there must be copying of a substantial part of the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s16(3)&lt;/ref&gt;
A photograph can also be a mechanism of infringement of the copyright which subsists in another work. For example, a photograph which copies a substantial part of an artistic work, such as a sculpture, painting or another photograph (without permission) would infringe the copyright which subsists in those works.

However, the subject matter of a photograph is not necessarily subject to an independent copyright. For example, in the Creation Records case,&lt;ref&gt;Creation Records Ltd v News Group Newspapers Ltd [1997] EMLR 444 (Ch)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipit-update.com/copy21.htm|title=Case Note: Creation Records Ltd. v News Group Newspapers|last=Lambert|first=Jane|date=February 2000|work=IP/IT-Update|publisher=NIPC|accessdate=2009-05-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201133421/http://www.ipit-update.com/copy21.htm|archivedate=2008-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a photographer, attempting to create a photograph for an album cover, set up an elaborate and artificial scene. A photographer from a newspaper covertly photographed the scene and published it in the newspaper. The court held that the newspaper photographer did not infringe the official photographer's copyright. Copyright did not subsist in the scene itself – it was too temporary to be a collage, and could not be categorised as any other form of artistic work.

Richard Arnold has criticized the protection of photographs in this manner on two grounds.&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;Richard Arnold, “Copyright in Photographs: A Case for Reform” [2005] [[European Intellectual Property Review]] 303&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, it is argued that photographs should not be protected as artistic works, but should instead be protected in a manner similar to that of sound recordings and films. In other words, copyright should not protect the subject matter of a photograph as a matter of course as a consequence of a photograph being taken.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Illustrated in the [http://www.ipit-update.com/copy50.htm Norowzian v Arks case]. In this case, it was noted that the copyright in a film would be infringed only though photographic copying of a substantial part, as opposed to mere recreation of the film. It was, however, also held that a film could be protected by copyright both as a film and as a dramatic work, provided, of course, that it fulfilled the requirements of protection of a dramatic work, on the facts. The claimant, was eventually unsuccessful. It was held that whilst the film in question in fact had copyright subsist in it both as a film and as a dramatic work, this copyright was not infringed, because there was no copying of a substantial part.&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that protection of photographs as artistic works is anomalous, in that photography is ultimately a medium of reproduction, rather than creation. As such, it is more similar to a film, or sound recording than a painting or sculpture. Some photographers share this view. For example, [[Michael Reichmann]] described photography as an art of disclosure, as opposed to an art of inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-first=Michael |author-last=Reichmann |author-link=Michael Reichmann |url=http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays/theartof.shtml |title=The Art of Photography |publisher=The Luminous Landscape |accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, it is argued that the protection of photographs as artistic works leads to bizarre results.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; Subject matter is protected irrespective of the artistic merit of a photograph. The subject matter of a photograph is protected even when it is not deserving of protection. For copyright to subsist in photographs as artistic works, the photographs must be original, since the English test for originality is based on skill, labour and judgment.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; That said, it is possible that the threshold of originality is very low. Essentially, by this, Arnold is arguing that whilst the subject matter of some photographs may deserve protection, it is inappropriate for the law to presume that the subject matter of all photographs is deserving of protection.

It is possible to say with a high degree of confidence that photographs of three-dimensional objects, including artistic works, will be treated by a court as themselves original artistic works, and as such, will be subject to copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-8688|title=Antiquesportfolio.com plc v Rodney Fitch &amp; Co Ltd|publisher=Pinsent Masons|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that a photograph (including a scan – digital scanning counts as photography for the purposes of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988) of a two dimensional artistic work, such as another photograph or a painting will also be subject to copyright if a significant amount of skill, labour and judgment went into its creation.&lt;ref&gt;See Sawkins v Hyperion Records [2005] EWCA Civ 565 at [79]-[84]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography and privacy===

A [[right to privacy]] came into existence in UK law as a consequence of the incorporation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] into domestic law through the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]. This can result in restrictions on the publication of photography.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Act 1998]] sections 2 &amp; 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Act 1998]] Schedule 1, Part 1, Article 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mosley v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2008] EWHC 1777 (QB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd [2004] UKHL 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray v Express Newspapers Plc [2008] EWCA Civ 446&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether this right is caused by horizontal effect of the Human Rights Act 1998 or is judicially created is a matter of some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan, "Privacy in the House of Lords, Again" (2004), 120 ''Law Quarterly Review'' 563, 565&lt;/ref&gt; The right to privacy is protected by Article 8 of the convention. In the context of photography, it stands at odds to the Article 10 right of freedom of expression. As such, courts will consider the public interest in balancing the rights through the legal test of proportionality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A very limited statutory right to privacy exists in the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]. This right is held, for example, by someone who hires a photographer to photograph their wedding. The commissioner,&lt;ref name="CDPAs2"&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 2&lt;/ref&gt; irrespective of any copyright which he does or does not hold in the photograph,&lt;ref name="CDPAs2"/&gt; of a photograph which was commissioned for private and domestic purposes, where copyright subsists in the photograph, has the right not to have copies of the work issued to the public,&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 85(1)a&lt;/ref&gt; the work exhibited in public&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 85(1)a Paragraph B&lt;/ref&gt; or the work communicated to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 85(1)a Paragraph C&lt;/ref&gt; However, this right will not be infringed if the rightholder gives permission. It will not be infringed if the photograph is incidentally included in an artistic work, film, or broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] s 85(2)(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

Local, state, and national laws govern still and motion photography. Laws vary between jurisdictions, and what is not illegal in one place may be illegal in another. Typical laws in the United States are as follows:

===Public property===
[[File:Museum photography.jpg|thumb|Some [[museum]]s do not allow [[photography]].]]
*It is legal to photograph or videotape anything and anyone on any public property, within reasonable community standards.&lt;ref name="krages_photo_rights"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krages.com/ThePhotographersRight.pdf |title=The Photographer's Right |author=Krages II, Bert P |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Photographing or videotaping a tourist attraction, whether publicly or privately owned, is generally considered legal, unless explicitly prohibited by a specific law or statute.

===Private property===
*Photography may be prohibited or restricted by a property owner on their property.&lt;ref name="krages_photo_rights" /&gt; However, a property owner generally cannot restrict the photographing of the property by individuals who are not within the bounds of the property.&lt;ref name="krages_photo_rights" /&gt;
*Photography on private property that is generally open to the public (e.g., a shopping mall) is usually permitted unless explicitly prohibited by posted signs. Even if no such signs are posted, the property owner or agent can ask a person to stop photographing, and if the person refuses to do so, the owner or agent can ask the person to leave; in some jurisdictions, a person who refuses to leave can be arrested for criminal trespass, and many jurisdictions recognize the common-law right to use reasonable force to remove a trespasser; a person who forcibly resists a lawful removal may be liable for battery, assault, or both.&lt;ref name="krages_legal_handbook"&gt;{{cite book |last = Krages | first= Bert P. |title = Legal Handbook for Photographers|url = http://www.krages.com/bpkphoto.htm|accessdate = 2011-06-21|edition = 2nd|year = 2007| publisher = Amherst Media| location  = Buffalo, NY|isbn = 978-1-58428-194-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*Entry onto private property not normally open to the public usually requires permission from the property owner.
*Some jurisdictions have laws regarding filming while in a hospital or health care facility. Where permitted, such filming may be useful in gathering evidence in cases of abuse, neglect, or malpractice.
===Outer Space===
*Remote sensing of the earth from outer space is regulated by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] which requires that a license be issued in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/CRSRA/licenseHome.html |title=Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-03-23 |website=The NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) |publisher=NOAA |access-date=2018-03-31 |quote= It is unlawful for any person who is subject to the jurisdiction or control of the United States, directly or through any subsidiary or affiliate to operate a private remote sensing space system without possession of a valid license issued under the Act and the regulations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy issues===
{{Further information|Privacy laws of the United States}}

* Photographing private property from within the public domain is not illegal, with the exception of an area that is generally regarded as private, such as a bedroom, bathroom, or hotel room.&lt;ref name="krages_photo_rights" /&gt;  In some states there is no definition of "private," in which case, there is a general [[expectation of privacy]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Should the subjects not attempt to conceal their private affairs, their actions immediately become public to a photographer using normal photographic equipment.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* Many places have laws prohibiting photographing private areas under a person's clothing without that person's permission. This also applies to any filming of another within a public restroom or locker room. Some jurisdictions have banned the use of a telephone with camera functionality within a restroom or locker room in order to prevent this. The United States enacted the Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004 to punish those who intentionally capture an individual's private areas without consent, when the person knew the subject had an expectation of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s108-1301 |title=S. 1301 [108th&amp;#93;: Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004 |publisher=GovTrack.us |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[U.S. state|State]] laws have also been passed addressing this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/AGP.Net/Components/documentViewer/Download.aspxnz?DocumentID=40459 |title=Video Voyeurism Laws |publisher=The National Center for Victims of Crime |accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial photography===
*In certain locations, such as [[California State Parks]], commercial photography requires a permit and sometimes proof of insurance.&lt;ref name="ca_state_parks_CCR"&gt;&lt;!-- I can't find a suitable template for this ---&gt;

===Other issues===
*Photographing accident scenes and law enforcement activities is usually legal.&lt;ref name="krages_photo_rights" /&gt; At the same time, one must not hinder the operations of law enforcement, medical, emergency, or security personnel by filming.
*Any filming with the intent of doing unlawful harm against a subject may be a violation of the law in itself.

==Canada==
Federal legislation governs the questions of [[copyright]] and criminal offences with respect to photography. Otherwise, the [[common law]] (except, in the case of Quebec, the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]''), generally determines when photography can take place.

:* The ''[[Copyright Act of Canada|Copyright Act]]'' provides that the duration of copyright for a photograph is the life of the author plus 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Copyright Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =C-42|section =6|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom of panorama]] is also allowed, with respect to photographs of sculptures and architectural works,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Copyright Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =C-42|section =32.2|subsection=1|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-32.2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is also protection for those who "incidentally and not deliberately include a work or other subject-matter in another work or other subject-matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Copyright Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =C-42|section =30.7|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-30.7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' provides for punishment of various offences, including [[voyeurism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CCC|162}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[child pornography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CCC|163.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; trespassing at night,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CCC|177}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[paparazzi]] behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CCC|264}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The law of [[defamation]], [[trespass]] and [[privacy]] is governed at the provincial level.
::* The common-law provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Ontario]] and [[Saskatchewan]] have enacted privacy legislation dealing with [[personality rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Conroy| first1=Amy M. |year= 2012 |title= Protecting Your Personality Rights in Canada: A Matter of Property or Privacy? |url= http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/uwojls/vol1/iss1/3/ |journal= Western Journal of Legal Studies |publisher= [[University of Western Ontario]] |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which supplement the law of trespass.
::* In Quebec, the ''Civil Code'' goes further by specifying that "keeping ... private life under observation by any means" constitutes an additional ground of invasion of privacy. In ''[[Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] held that, because of that, supplemented by Quebec's ''[[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]'' privacy provisions, a photographer can take photographs in public places but may not publish them unless permission has been obtained from the subject, except where the subject appears in an incidental manner, or whose professional success depends on public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc|link=Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc|year=1998|court=scc|num=817|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 55{{en dash}}59|parallelcite=[1998] 1 SCR 591|date=1998-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In private property, photography may be prohibited or restricted by a property owner on their property.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Photography on private property that is generally open to the public (e.g., a shopping mall) is usually permitted unless explicitly prohibited by posted signs. Even if no such signs are posted, the property owner or agent can ask a person to stop photographing, and if the person refuses to do so, the owner or agent can ask the person to leave; in some jurisdictions, a person who refuses to leave can be arrested for criminal trespass, and many jurisdictions recognize the common-law right to use reasonable force to remove a trespasser; a person who forcibly resists a lawful removal may be liable for battery, assault, or both.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Hungary==

In Hungary, from 15 March 2014 when the long-awaited Civil Code was published, the law re-stated what had been normal practice, namely, that a person had the right to refuse being photographed. However, [[implied consent]] exists: it is not illegal to photograph a person who does not actively object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xpatloop.com/news/xpat_opinion_whats_up_with_the_new_civil_code_and_press_photographs|title=Xpat Opinion: What’s Up With The New Civil Code &amp; Press Photographs? - Xpatloop.com - Expat Life In Budapest, Hungary - Current affairs|website=www.xpatloop.com|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/14/hungary-law-photography-permission-take-pictures | date = 14 March 2014 | accessdate = 20 May 2014 | first = Daniel | last = Nolan | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | title = Hungary law requires photographers to ask permission to take pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macau==
In Macau, a photographer must not take or publish any photographs of a person against his/her will without legal justification, even in a public place. Besides, everyone has a right to Personality Rights.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} People are not to be photographed, photographs of them displayed or reproduced without their prior consent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Criminal penalties include imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pj.gov.mo/NEW/Q8_ans02.htm|title="不法進行錄音錄像"|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, photography of police officers in Macau is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/news/20151206/54508142|title=澳門女子上載遭抄牌片 發帖罵警被判囚1年|website=Apple Daily 蘋果日報|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
In [[South Africa]] photographing people in public is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burchell|first=Jonathan|year=2009|title=The Legal Protection of Privacy in South Africa: A Transplantable Hybrid|url=https://www.ejcl.org//131/art131-2.pdf|journal=Electronic Journal of Comparative Law|volume=13.1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproducing and selling photographs of people is legal for editorial and limited fair use commercial purposes. There exists no case law to define what the limits on commercial use are. Civil law requires the consent of any identifiable persons for advertorial and promotional purposes. Property, including animals, do not enjoy any special consideration.

During the media coverage of the [[Nkandla (homestead)|Nkandla]] controversy it emerged that there exists a law, the [[National Key Points Act, 1980]], prohibiting the photographing of any "national key points." National key points are buildings or structures that serve a strategic or military purpose. Though it wasn't revealed what these are as part of state secrecy it was claimed that the presidential residence is one of them and should thus not be shown in media. Subsequent court action resulted in it being ruled that a list of all key points be made public. Although not currently or previously enforced the law is still in effect even after calls for it to be repealed as a relic of apartheid-era secrecy legislation.

==Sudan and South Sudan==
Travelers who wish to take any photographs must obtain a photography permit from the Ministry of Interior, Department of Aliens (Sudan)&lt;ref&gt;[https://sudan.usembassy.gov/information_for_travelers.html "Information for Travelers: Visiting Sudan"] U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; or Ministry of Information (South Sudan).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-sudan/local-laws-and-customs "Foreign travel advice: South Sudan"] Government of the United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
Regulations apply to land-based photography for certain locations. A permit is required for aerial photography in India, which normally takes over a month to be issued.&lt;ref name="ri"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reelindiapictures.com/permit-process.html |title=Reel India Pictures |publisher=www.reelindiapictures.com |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iceland==
Calling oneself a photographer, in line with most other trades in Iceland, requires the person to hold a Journeyman's or Master's Certificates in the industry. Exceptions can be made in low population areas, or for people coming from within the EEA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eng.atvinnuvegaraduneyti.is/laws-and-regulations/nr/nr/7350 "Information for Tradesmen and Others"] Ministry of Industries and Innovation. Accessed 27 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
Taking pictures of police officers in many circumstances was made illegal by a 2015 "Citizens' Security Law" with the stated purpose of protecting police officers and their families from harassment. The law has generated controversy because it may be harder to denounce police brutality. A far more limited version of the law had been in effect for several decades regarding when police work related to terrorism. A person was fined under this law for taking and publishing online a photograph of an illegally parked police car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3200903/Spanish-woman-took-picture-police-car-parked-disabled-bay-fined-nearly-600-controversial-new-gagging-law.html |title=Spanish woman who took picture of police car parked in disabled bay is fined nearly £600 under controversial new 'gagging law' |newspaper=Daily Mail |date= 17 August 2015 |author=Julian Robinson|accessdate= 10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican law is similar to the law in the United States. Authorities may intimidate or prevent any holder of a camera if they come into close perimeters of Government buildings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==South Korea==

In South Korea, taking pictures of women without their consent, even in public, is considered to be criminal [[sexual assault]], punishable by a fine of under 10 million [[South Korean won|won]] and up to 5 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/%EB%B2%95%EB%A0%B9/%EC%84%B1%ED%8F%AD%EB%A0%A5%EB%B2%94%EC%A3%84%EC%9D%98%20%EC%B2%98%EB%B2%8C%20%EB%93%B1%EC%97%90%20%EA%B4%80%ED%95%9C%20%ED%8A%B9%EB%A1%80%EB%B2%95|title="South Korean law on criminal sexual assault, Chapter 1 Article 14"|author=|date=|website=law.go.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Not specifically in source|date=July 2018}} In July 2017 an amendment to the law was voted on in favour of allowing for chemical castration of people taking such photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?newsid=01298886615999112&amp;SCD=JG31&amp;DCD=A00703|title=`몰카 찰칵했다간 철컹`…몰카범도 화학적 거세한다|first1=Ⓒ 종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리-상업적|last1=무단전재|first2=재배포|last2=금지|date=28 July 2017|website=edaily|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12971">'''Roberto Vignati''' is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] businessman who gained prominence in 2014 when it was revealed that his firm Bioart SA had been selected by the Argentinian government to act as the sole intermediary in exports of [[rice]] and [[corn]] to [[Venezuela]], and that it had made inordinate profits on the arrangement. 

Media in both countries noted that Vignati enjoyed close ties to the administration of Argentinian President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] and that, prior to the export deal, which had gone into effect in 2013, his firm had been involved only in the retail sale of [[fertilizer]] and seeds.

==Early life and education==
Vignati is from the town of Arteaga in the department of Caseros, province of [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]]. 

''Clarín'' has stated that according to some sources, Vignati's father fought on the [[Juan Peron|Peronist]] left in the 1970, and Vignati used that fact to win the friendship of Planning Minister [[Julio De Vido]].&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web| title =Argentina: vinculan a hija de Chávez en escándalo de corrupción | work =Reportero 24| date =Jul 7, 2014| url =http://www.reportero24.com/2014/07/argentina-vinculan-a-hija-de-chavez-en-escandalo-de-corrupcion/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Bioart SA===
Bioart SA was founded in 2009, but did not register as a grain wholesaler until November 2013. On paper, its owners were Vignati's sisters María Isabel and María Eugenia, but he was the company's public representative.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; 

Vignati traveled to [[Caracas]] in February 2013 with Julio De Vido, Argentina's Minister of Planning, with the intention of offering the use of silos owned by Marisa, a firm in Arteaga owned by Vignati's mother's family. The apparent result of the visit, however, was that Bioart became a central player in grain export deals that would attract a great deal of criticism. 

In May 2013, Argentina and Venezuela signed an agreement for the export of 80,000 tons of unprocessed rice. The governor of Entre Rios, [[Sergio Urribarri]], said at the time that the sales would be carried out by rice farmers themselves, without intermediaries.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; He promised that the price charged to Venezuela would yield a profit, but the Pan Am Post later commented that “what rice producers did not know...was that the 'profitability'...would actually be for the middlemen, and not Argentina’s rice producers.”&lt;ref name=panam&gt;{{cite web| last =Estrada| first =Marcela| title =Chávez’s Daughter Caught in Argentina’s Corruption Scandal| work =Panam Post| date =Jul 9, 2014| url =http://panampost.com/marcela-estrada/2014/07/09/chavezs-daughter-caught-in-argentinas-corruption-scandal/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged “middlemen” in the report were Vignati and his siblings, whose firm, Bioart SA, was granted sole permission by the Argentinian government to export rice to Venezuela. The firm ended up exporting the grain at an approximately 30% profit.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The directors of Fedenar, the national federation of Argentinian rice producers, warned in October 2013 of Bioart's intrusion in negotiations with Venezuela for rice exports. In January 2014, Fedenar filed complaints about Bioart's involvement, to no avail, with Argentinian Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich and Agriculture Minister Carlos Casamiquela. A complaint to Argentina's Ministry of Domestic Trade, which grants export permits, also had no effect. Later in January, Fedenar appealed to Urribarri, who promised to bring up the issue with President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner; but nothing came to fruition.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Fedenar complained that Bioart was not even a rice producer, questioning how a firm founded five years ago with no rice and corn export experience could gain such a lucrative deal.&lt;ref name=panam/&gt;

In March 2014, the rice sector reacted with “astonishment” at Bioart's role in the export of rice. On June 16, 2014, 27,500 tons of rice, worth over U.S. $16 million, were shipped from the port of San Pedro.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

In accordance with agreement with the Argentinian government, Bioart also had handled the export of more than 40,000 tons of corn to Venezuela at prices that were almost 80% higher than market value. The first shipment of corn took place on February 28, 2014, only fifteen days after Vignati met with María Gabriela Chávez, the daughter of Hugo Chávez, at the Argentinian embassy in Caracas. A second corn shipment took place on April 15, 2014.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

===Ecuador===
Vignati was involved in an agricultural development project in [[Ecuador]] that began in September 2010 with talks involving senior officials in that country's government. Vignati's business representative in Ecuador, Gaston Duzac, told Ecuador's Minister of Production, Santiago Leon, that the initiative had been developed by Vignati's family firm Marisa, which Duzac identified as a subsidiary of Agroexportadora SA. The latter firm is officially owned by Jorge Bulgarelli, a lawyer who has longtime personal and business connections with the Vignati family. Duzac received an $800,000 loan from the Ecuadoran state bank, [[Cofiec]], for which he turned out to have no guarantees; when Ecuadoran courts began to investigate the loan, they discovered that Duzac had fled the country with the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Roberto Vignati| work =Poderopedia| url =http://www.poderopedia.org/ve/personas/Roberto_Vignati}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Escándalo en otro negocio de la empresa vinculada a De Vido| work =Agro Meat| url =http://www.agromeat.com/151852/escandalo-en-otro-negocio-de-la-empresa-vinculada-a-de-vido}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other business activity==
Vignati owns several other businesses. Caisa SRL sells agricultural supplies in Cruz Alta, a town near Arteaga. Inarg SA, a silo and machinery manufacturing firm, was established in April 2014. Rosart Desarollo SA, a real-estate firm, was founded in June 2014. In Bell Ville, Vignati owns a stud farm called Juan Antonio, which has over 40 thoroughbred race horses. In addition, as of July 2014, Vignati was still managing a sports club in Arteaga.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Political activities==
In addition to having expressed “deep admiration” on social networks for Néstor and Cristina Kirchner as well as for [[Hugo Chávez]],&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Vignati participated in the 2013 presidential campaign of [[Nicolas Maduro]] of Venezuela.&lt;ref name=andes&gt;{{cite web| title =Empresa chavista ahora podrá vender 50.000 tn de maíz| work =Los Andes| date =Sep 8, 2014| url =http://www.losandes.com.ar/article/empresa-chavista-ahora-podra-vender-50-000-tn-de-maiz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of corruption==
On July 7, 2014, ''Clarín'' published a long article in which it revealed that Bioart SA, which it described as “a dubious company with ties to power,” had been exporting rice and corn from Argentina to Venezuela at intentionally inflated prices in accordance with a deal arranged by the Argentinian government. ''Clarín'' also noted the involvement in the deal of [[María Gabriela Chávez]], Julio De Vido, and Argentina's ambassador to Venezuela, [[Carlos Cheppi]]. ''Clarín quoted'' the Cámara de Industriales Arroceros de Entre Ríos, a rice-growers' group, as saying that the Bioart deal was benefiting “a few entrepreneurs” in Argentina while hurting many other Argentinians. According to ''Clarín'', the rice industry was “furious” over the deal, under which they were paid a far lower rate for rice sold to Venezuela than their counterparts in Uruguay and Brazil.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

''Clarín'''s July 7 report identified Vignati as the “visible face” of Bioart, and said that he traveled often to Venezuela, had top connections with politicians, and had experienced significant financial gain.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;  

Clarín's revelations attracted widespread attention. De Vido rejected all accusations of corruption, denying that Bioart S.A or any Vignati family members had any business connections to him. He continued also denying any connection to the Venezuelan government.&lt;ref name=panam/&gt;
 
The Spanish daily ''El Mundo'' reported that María Gabriela Chávez, owing to her apparent role in arranging the Bioart rice deal, had been dubbed the “queen of rice” on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Las redes sociales bautizan a la hija de Chávez como la 'reina del arroz'| work =El Mundo| date =Jul 16, 2014| url =http://www.elmundo.es/america/2014/07/16/53c6712722601d1b7a8b4583.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Clarín'' reported on July 28, 2014, that although the selection of Bioart as the sole intermediary in the sale of rice to Venezuela could be considered an instance of anti-competitive practices, as defined by the National Commission for Protection of Competition (CNDC), that organization was not likely to criticize the arrangement, because the president of the CNDC, [[Ricardo Napolitani]], is a close friend of Vignati's and has been referred to as an obedient servant of the Kirchner dynasty. Indeed, far from criticizing Vignati, Napolitani was his “protector,” ''Clarín'' was told by one source. Clarín also noted links between Vignati and other individuals in the Kirchner circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Longoni| first =Matias| title =Negocios con Venezuela: señalan a un abogado vinculado a Zannini| work =Clarin| url =http://www.clarin.com/edicion-impresa/Negocios-Venezuela-senalan-vinculado-Zannini_0_1183081693.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption charges===
In mid July 2014, opposition Venezuelan legislators [[Abelardo Díaz]] and [[Homero Ruíz]] filed corruption and fraud charges with the Public Prosecutor of Caracas in connection with Vignati's inflated prices.&lt;ref name=andes/&gt; They presented the Prosecutor with evidence of “unbridled corruption” and influence peddling in Vignati's sale not only of rice and corn but also of agricultural machinery, power plants, and black beans to Venezuela. The legislators pointed out that Bioart had only five employees in 2012 and that, until its role in grain sales to Venezuela, had officially been involved only in the retail sale of fertilizer and seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Consignaran nuevas evidencias de corrupción en la importación de alimentos desde Argentina| work =La Nacion| date =Jul 18, 2014| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ve/politica/consignaran-nuevas-evidencias-de-corrupcion-en-la-importacion-de-alimentos-desde-argentina/| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141205232445/http://www.lanacion.com.ve/politica/consignaran-nuevas-evidencias-de-corrupcion-en-la-importacion-de-alimentos-desde-argentina/| archivedate =2014-12-05| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislators also asked the prosecutor to investigate María Gabriela Chávez and former Food Minister [[Felix Osorio]] and to ask for Cheppi to be recalled as ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Vinagradoff| first =Ludmila| title =En Venezuela piden investigar sospechosas ventas de arroz| work =Clarin| date =Jul 10, 2014| url =http://www.clarin.com/politica/Venezuela-investigar-sospechosas-ventas-arroz_0_1172882817.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2014, ''Clarín'' reported that Vignati was not only exporting rice and corn to Venezuela at highly inflated prices, but had also acted as an intermediary in the export of agricultural machinery from Argentina to Venezuela, via Bioart SA and another firm, Acoplados El Grillo. ''Clarín'' noted that El Grillo, based in Arrecifes, was officially owned by Jorge Bulgarelli, the lawyer of María Eugenia Vignati, and that Roberto Vignati had earlier been involved with Bulgarelli in his ultimately scandalous effort to do business in Ecuador. ''Clarín'' also pointed out that Ricardo Rodriguez Miranda, president of Pedro Camejo, a company created by Chávez in 2007 to further Venezuela's agricultural mechanization, had known Vignati since 2008, when Rodriguez had worked for another Venezuela state company, Legumes Alba SA, and had approved contracts with Marisa, the silo firm owned by Vignati's mother's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Longoni| first =Matias| title =De arroz a maquinaria agrícola: negocios turbios con Venezuela| work =Clarin| date =Jul 28, 2014| url =http://www.clarin.com/politica/maquinaria-agricola-negocios-turbios-Venezuela_0_1183681668.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirchner ties===
On September 8, 2014, ''Los Andes'' reported that three people who knew Roberto Vignati said he had been awarded the role as grain-sales intermediary due to his close family ties with the Kirchners. ''Los Andes'' further noted that despite the controversy, Bioart had received “official permission to export another boatload of corn” to Venezuela. The precise amount of the new shipment would be 46,957 tons; the price was not made public.&lt;ref name=andes/&gt;

'''Rolf W. Schnyder''' (1935 in Zurich – 2011 in Kuala Lumpur) was a Swiss businessman known for his role as the owner and CEO of watchmaker [[Ulysse Nardin]].

== Biography ==

===The journey of an adventurer===

From the beginning a certain duality inhabited Rolf Schnyder's personality. On one side, his strong organizational skills and sharp analytical mind were typical of a Swiss German upbringing. However, there was also something unerringly romantic, a perpetual inquisitiveness and interest in the world beyond his immediate vicinity.

In 1956, Schnyder moved to Geneva to improve his French. Working in Jaeger-LeCoultre's advertising department on Geneva's historic Tour de L'Ile, Schnyder noticed that people in his office were easily intimidated by orders and correspondence that arrived in English. Realizing the insularity of the Swiss watch industry, Schnyder became determined to explore the world. He arranged to be posted for six months to his company's subsidiary, ‘De Travers' located on Cromwell Road in London. After this attachment he returned to Geneva, but somehow having been exposed to the sprawling universe beyond Switzerland he realized that he had to move again.

Like many young men, Schnyder was infected with wanderlust; he wanted to dive into the rich vivid colors of foreign lands, to eat things with flavors he'd never tasted and to experience new cultures with total immediacy. A newspaper clipping aroused his attention. A Swiss company named Diethelm was distributing a vast array of goods in Thailand and they were searching for a Swiss junior manager. Though only 22 years old, Schnyder instantly responded to the ad and his application was accepted. As he boarded in Genoa the “Asia”, a ship bound for South East Asia, he felt the world opening its infinite golden mysteries to him.

===The stranger in strange lands===

Because of his experience in the Swiss watch industry, Schnyder was immediately put in charge of Diethelm's timepiece division. Schnyder and his sales team would embark on weeklong journeys throughout Thailand trumpeting the merits of Swiss watches. Thus, while the foreign nationals gathered together to eat vague approximations of European fare in their hotels, Schnyder was at street-side restaurants learning the culture and language of his Thai friends. Schnyder's ability to remain objective and not cast a Eurocentric sense of judgment on native behavior allowed him to understand and embrace the culture of the Thai people. Lean and rangy with the rawboned good looks of an American cowboy or a professional skier, Schnyder made friends easily. He began to look forward to these sales trips, as each one offered the opportunity to learn something new about the mysterious country he now inhabited.

Schnyder also had an inborn sense of business acumen. This, combined with fine managerial skills and boundless energy, soon saw him multi-tasking. When Diethelm diversified its activities with a travel agency, Schnyder ended up running the operation. Eager to share his passion for the incredible sights of South East Asia, he initiated charter flights in a leased DC3 from Bangkok to Siem Riep where the ancient Buddhist city of Angkor Wat stood untouched by time.

In 1959 he and his friends took the historic trip down the River Kwai. They made their way through the thick forest from Kanchanaburi, a small town northwest of Bangkok, to the Burmese border. They lashed together a raft from bamboo poles with the help of a local who had plied through the forest to reclaim rails from the death railway built by Allied war prisoners during the Second World War, a task made famous by the movie, “The Bridge on the River Kwai”. From the source of the River Kwai they floated down the river on a handmade raft, capsizing at times on unexpected steep rapids. It was supposed to be a seven-day adventure trip. No one had any idea where exactly they were and how many more days were needed to get back to the office. Being late or absent was a serious offense in a tightly run Swiss office. They got finally back five days late and paid the price – a cut in holidays and bonuses. An image that Rolf Schnyder took during this adventure appeared on the cover of the Swiss magazine, Schweizer Illustrierte. An account of this trip, penned by Schnyder, could be found within its pages. It was the first of many travel reports published in Swiss and other European papers and magazines. In the next few years, Schnyder continued to explore Thailand, Laos, Bali, Cambodia and South Vietnam, where the war had just started.

He also developed a particular fondness for the white beaches around the fishing village of Pattaya which had not yet become part of the tourist track. He invested his first savings in the Nippa Lodge, Pattaya's very first hotel.

===The industrious force===
[[Image:Rolf cresta.jpg|thumb|right|Rolf W. Schnyder on the Cresta Run in St. Moritz]]
Advancing up the chain of command at Diethelm, Schnyder soon found himself in charge of the consumer products division. He was tasked with the distribution of basic goods from companies such as Procter and Gamble and Union Carbide. Ever the keen businessman, he soon realized that it would be more profitable to switch from imports to local manufacture under licence. This time it was his turn to share his culture — he imparted to his factory workers a Swiss sense of education, supervision and the institution of quality control. Schnyder recalls: “I was impressed with how fast the Thai people could learn new skills and how enthusiastic they were about their work. I could also see, in the way that they worked, that there was a high level of manual skill.”

Schnyder also played rugby for the Royal Bangkok Sports Club. During this period, Schnyder learned to run large-scale operations. His boundless energy and his ability to be involved in almost every aspect at the factories as well as his uncanny ability with Thai language abetted his success.

From 1966 to 1968, Schnyder switched gears. He left Thailand for a six-month voyage through the South Sea, sailing from Fiji to Samoa and around the islands of Tahiti and Bora Bora, visited South America and ended up in the head office of Philip Morris in New York where he got an assignment to develop the lucrative cigarette markets of South East Asia. Schnyder returned to Asia, basing himself in Hong Kong during the height of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. He applied for a visa to China to record with camera in hand the historical events that took place in the Empire of the Middle Kingdom. Westerners were not particularly welcome at the time. Having a neutral Swiss passport helped. Schnyder practiced reading verses of the Red Book but still got in trouble. On the last day in Guangzhou he was offered some antique gold carvings which Chinese no longer had the right to possess as they had been declared capitalist merchandise. Since no taxis were available, two hotel waiters offered their help to carry these artifacts to the railway station for the trip back to Hong Kong. On the way, the group was stopped by some Red Guards who were omnipresent in town and countryside. They objected to the fact that a Chinese carried goods for a white foreigner. The two waiters had to drop Schnyder's bags instantly and were sent home. Schnyder had to drop his travel bags as well, was taken to a building occupied by the Red Guards and made to quote verses from the Red Book backward and forward all night long. Only next morning was he released, given some tea and a bowl of rice and sent back to the street corner where the bags had been dropped by the waiters and himself the evening before. Nobody had touched them. It took Schnyder two trips on foot of 30 minutes each to get all his luggage to the railway station. He reached the Lo Wu bridge, the border between China and the then- British colony of Hong Kong, one day behind schedule. Nevertheless, Schnyder was met by a large group of journalists who were eager to buy the many photos which he had shot during the previous five days and which were later published in newspapers around the globe and in the important US magazine, “Life”.

Schnyder's job with Philip Morris took him around the world and also back to the Philip Morris European headquarters in Switzerland, where he met Charles and Marcel Stern, the cousins of Philippe Stern, president of Patek Philippe. The cousins' owned one of the best watch dial factories in Switzerland and they invited Schnyder for a guided tour.

As Schnyder watched dials materialize in the skilled hands of factory workers, a blue flash of inspiration blazed through him. He was absolutely certain that Thai workers could learn the trade of dial-making given the opportunity. The vastly lower cost of human labor in the Far East meant that Schnyder could craft watch dials of similar quality at a far lower price per unit which would permit the Swiss watch industry to stay competitive against the lower-priced products emerging from the Japan's Seiko. Charles and Marcel Stern were immediately sold on the idea, but the rigid Swiss syndicate that presided over the Swiss dial manufacturers was more difficult to convince. Finally, in 1968 Schnyder helped forge a joint partnership between Swiss and Asian investors to open the Cosmo dial and watchcase factory in Thailand. Schnyder immediately quit his job with Philip Morris and took the helm of this new enterprise.

Business boomed from the onset with Schnyder and the Cosmo team filling big orders from many Swiss watch companies like Mido, Certina, Rado, Tissot, Camy, Fortis and many others. Eventually even the iconic Swiss brand Omega was unable to disregard the tremendous savings offered. However, as business soared a fractured relationship erupted among the investors. Tiring of the politics involved, Schnyder sold his shares in Cosmo and moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1973.

The Precima factory, which became a key player in manufacturing watch accessories for Swiss watch companies, opened that same year. Aided by a 10- year tax-exempt grace period that allowed Schnyder to import materials tax free, business literally skyrocketed. Schnyder's trajectory of success soared. Soon he diversified to craft other micro-components, including balance springs and sapphire crystals. Business was growing at such a fast rate that Schnyder had to set up offices in Switzerland. These were located in the ASUAG building in the Seevorstadt neighborhood near Bienne. ASUAG owned several watch companies like Longines, Rado and Eterna, and key movement suppliers including ETA.

It was at this location that Schnyder met Pierre Renggli, the general manager of ASUAG, and, through him, Ernst Thomke, who headed ETA. Thomke was fascinated by the opportunities that Schnyder had created in the Far East and assisted in transferring part of the quartz module production to Precima.

===Taking the path less traveled===

In the winter of 1983 Schnyder found his calling, to restore one of the greatest names in high-end watchmaking to its former glory. Why buy a manufacture focused on making mechanical watches at a time when everyone told him this industry was dead? The answer to this question comes from the time Schnyder spent in Asia.

“In China and India, quartz watches were not successful,” relates Schnyder. “That is because watch repairmen would open the case backs and, for them, it was like looking into the back of a radio. In these cultures, the mechanical watch had residual value. Any competent repairman could open a watch up and service or fix it. They could see where the energy came from, they could identify with the mechanical movement. When I saw that these cultures adamantly refused at that time to embrace quartz watches, I knew that one day mechanical watches would come back.

“It is often said, but it is true, that the watch is a man's only piece of jewelry. This personal relationship becomes even stronger when the watch is mechanical. There is a beautiful symbiosis between a man and his mechanical watch. He gives the watch life by winding it and the watch unerringly serves him by providing him time. An almost fierce loyalty develops between a man and his watch.”

===A new era dawns===

In 1983, at 48 years of age, Schnyder returned to St. Moritz, Switzerland to ski and race his beloved skeleton bobsleds, activities that he continues to enjoy today. (He still occasionally wins a race on the Cresta Run, as he did in February 2006.)

“I was on holiday skiing when I read in the papers that Ulysse Nardin had filed for Chapter 11 (deferment of payment) to protect itself from creditors. This was during the Quartz Crisis and many famous companies in Switzerland were folding. Ulysse Nardin had many debts without any real way of paying them off,” says Schnyder. He, like many watch enthusiasts, knew Ulysse Nardin's name well. “I knew of the brand because of the many medals for accuracy and chronometric competitions that it had won. I was immediately interested in purchasing Ulysse Nardin. It was the opportunity to be involved in one of the truly great names in horology.”

However, when Schnyder visited the manufacture, he discovered nothing more than a beautiful carcass housed in the original factory building that was constructed in 1864. There was only one full-time watchmaker named Leopold Berthoud who occupied himself by creating Ulysse Nardin's marine chronometers and deck watches for collectors looking to own an anachronistic but sublimely made piece of naval history. Another person that Schnyder found at the manufacture was Jean-Jacques Haldimann. “It was essentially with these one-and-a-half employees (as Haldimann was not actually on company payroll at that time) that I started at Ulysse Nardin. I realized that if I were to undertake this resurrection, I would have to breathe life back into this carcass based on the strength of our products,” says Schnyder.

His plan for Ulysse Nardin's rebirth was to elevate it to the highest position in watchmaking. “To do this, I knew I had to make a watch that had never been made before,” he explains. Fortunately for Schnyder, the ever-helpful Haldimann was deeply embedded in the Swiss watch industry. He told Schnyder that an independent watchmaker named Jörg Spoering had created a new tourbillon. Rolf was keen to see if Spoering had other ideas for high complications. As soon as he entered Spoering's atelier in Lucerne, a bizarre clock caught his eye. Says Schnyder: “I had only a vague recollection of seeing something like it before, so I asked: ‘Is this what they call an astrolabium?' Spoering said it was and explained that the clock was made by someone named Ludwig Oechslin. He sighed and added: ‘He is supposed to be my apprentice but he is never here.'”
[[File:Oechslin-Schnyder.jpg|thumb|Rolf W. Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin working together.]]

Three weeks later Spoering arranged for Schnyder to meet Oechslin. “I pointed to the Astrolabium clock and asked: ‘Can you make it in wristwatch size?' He puzzled for a moment and answered, genuinely confused: ‘I can, but who would want it so small.'” Rolf Schnyder smiled as he replied: “I do.”
[[File:Rolf12 RVB.jpg|thumb|left|Rolf W. Schnyder posing in front of the Astrolabiumin 1985]]
Unveiled in 1985, the Astrolabium Galileo Galilei was a major critical and commercial success. Although the Astrolabium went down in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most complex watch made, its significance was far greater than the sum of its parts. The Astrolabium, a machine powered by human kinetic energy that told time through the ancient poetry of celestial positions, was a sign of things to come and marked “the beginning of a beautiful friendship” between the brilliant leader Schnyder and the poet-philosopher Oechslin. Together, what they would accomplish over the next two-and-a-half decades is, in a word, ‘extraordinary'.

During his years at the helm of Ulysse Nardin, Schnyder has created some of the most original and functionally innovative timepieces in horology. Rather than sticking to ‘tried-and-tested', Ulysse Nardin with the help of Ludwig Oechslin has constantly pushed the boundaries and opened up new worlds of manufacturing techniques and materials ahead of the rest of the watch industry. Ludwig's creative mind worked much faster than the small production team at the disposal of Schnyder. Schnyder followed up his awesome Astrolabium watch with the Planetarium Copernicus, a wristwatch that represents time through the shifting position of the planets in our solar system. In 1989 Ulysse Nardin, in cooperation with Christophe Claret, brought the world the first repeating wristwatch with Jaquemarts. Tiny figures carved in gold move on the dial synchronized in time to the repeater's hammer strikes.

In 1992 the manufacture completed the ‘Trilogy of Time' with the Tellurium Johannes Kepler, a watch that tells time using a stunning interpretation of our constantlyrotating planet. In 1993 Schnyder unveiled the Hourstriker San Marco, the fruit of his collaboration with technical wunderkind Giulio Papi. In 1994 Ulysse Nardin shifted gears and focused on the creation of the world's most functional GMT watch. The GMT ±'s ease of use and pure simple logic has been a revelation to frequent travelers.

Then in 1996, on the 150th anniversary of his manufacture, Rolf Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin raised the curtain on the world's most purely functional perpetual calendar. This amazing timepiece has all calendar displays synchronized and adjustable through a single crown. Because of its reliance on special epicyclical gearwheels rather than levers, this incredible watch can be quickly adjusted both forwards and backwards! In 1999 the perpetual calendar received the added GMT ± indicator. Incredibly, all calendar displays were synchronized to this local time indicator. To this day, Ulysse Nardin's perpetual calendars represent the high reference in watchmaking for this complication, a remarkable benchmark that has never been surpassed.

On the first year of the new millennium, Rolf Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin created a wristwatch that was irrevocably to change the face of modern horology. Their audacious Freak, a 7-day carrousel tourbillon with no hands or crown, is the world's first example of horological modern art. With its purity of design involving a movement that also gives indications of time, it still stands as the most creative innovation of the 21st century watch world. The Freak single-handedly smashed every convention known to haut de gamme watchmaking and opened the floodgates of creativity. As if this isn't enough, beating within it is the Dual Direct escapement, the first successful implementation of a non-lubricated alternative to the Swiss lever escapement. The Dual Direct escapement's wheels were made in silicium, another historical first in watchmaking history.

In 2002, Schnyder launched the Genghis Khan, the world's first carillon Westminster minute repeater tourbillon with Jaquemarts. In the same year, the Freak won the Watch of the Year award. In 2003, Schnyder and Oechslin once again conspired to change the face of watchmaking with their Sonata, the world's first alarm watch that could be set 24 hours in advance and had a dual time function. Ulysse Nardin in cooperation with GFD developed the first hairspring for the balance wheel in polycrystalline diamond.

In 2005, Ulysse Nardin created an updated version of the Freak, the Freak 28'800 V/h utilizing an updated and improved version of the Dual Direct escapement called the Dual Ulysse escapement. Schnyder also introduced the word's first watch to use diamond micro-components in its escapement, the Freak Diamond Heart.

In 2006, to celebrate the 160th anniversary of the manufacture he has so assuredly led for the last 23 years, Schnyder presents the Caliber 160, Ulysse Nardin's first completely in-house designed and executed automatic caliber. This caliber features the manufacture's Dual Ulysse escapement at its heart. Innovative design allows the plate of the movement to be customized to integrate other signature complications of Ulysse Nardin, creating integrated movements rather than the modular movements that currently dominate the high watchmaking world.

When Schnyder first took the reins of Ulysse Nardin, he inherited the original, then-empty factory first built in 1864 and enlarged in 1895. Today, there are 250 inspired workers and staff at Ulysse Nardin. Moreover, each of these men and women exude a palpable sense of pride that is a singular phenomenon in Swiss watchmaking. With each success, Schnyder has focused on selfinvesting in his manufacture to create greater self-reliance and independence. The living testament to this is a huge two-storey factory plus basement located in La Chaux-de- Fonds. Opened in 2003, this factory of dreams represents the way forward and assures the enduring viable future of one of Swiss watchmaking's greatest names. This production facility, watched over by Ulysse Nardin's immensely capable technical director Pierre Gygax and chief engineer Lucas Humair, offers the manufacture great flexibility in the creation of new products. It also offers Schnyder and his team the psychological comfort of knowing that under this roof they are capable of producing almost anything necessary to the ticking entity known as the mechanical wristwatch.

With his boundless enthusiasm, clarity of vision and the conviction to constantly raise the bar in the industry, Schnyder has done what many didn't feel was possible when he first purchased Ulysse Nardin. Not only did he rescue the manufacture and return it to its former place of glory, but on the strength of his innovations he has enabled Ulysse Nardin to transcend its past and achieve an even higher place in the rarified constellation of watchmaking's legends. In his 23 years at the helm of Ulysse Nardin, Schnyder's personality and that of the manufacture have merged. They have become one. The spirit of the watchmaker Ulysse Nardin has reached out over the great ocean of time to become inextricably intertwined with Schnyder's own great warrior spirit, a spirit that can at once wholeheartedly plunge into the humor of life while taking on and out-swimming life's perilous currents. In the years he has led Ulysse Nardin, Schnyder has fulfilled his fate.

===Family and personal life===

Schnyder often shuttled between Switzerland and Malaysia.  When he was not overseeing business in Le Locle, he was either at his home in Kuala Lumpur or visiting subsidiaries and retailers around the world.  Schnyder shared a tropical home with his wife, and they are the parents of three children.

In recognition of his contributions to watchmaking, Schnyder was awarded the "Spirit of Enterprise" Gaia Award in 2003 by the [[Musee International d'Horlogerie]] for his entrepreneurial achievements and commitments. This award was followed by the bestowment of the "Lifetime Achievement Award" by the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve: Asian Edition in Singapore for his continued contributions towards watch making technology and innovations.

When asked what he wished for when he blew out the 75 candles on his birthday cake, Schnyder commented "If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing"!

On April 14, 2011 Schnyder died at the age of 75 after a short illness. His wife attended the CHT Awards and Ball 2011 to accept the Pursuit of Excellence (Expat) Award on his behalf.

'''Réseau Canopé''' is a French public institution under the supervision of the [[French Ministry of Education]]. As the publishing arm of the  National Education service, it performs editing, production and dissemination of educational and administrative resources for professional education. It contributes to the development of [[Educational technology|information and communication technologies in education]] (ICTs) as well as artistic and cultural education. "Canopé" stands for ''Conception et accompagnement des nouvelles offres pour l'éducation'' ("Design and Support of New Offers for Education").

In 2014, it replaced the '''National Centre for Educational Documentation''' (''Centre national de documentation pédagogique'', CNDP) and its regional (CRDP) and departmental (CDDP) branches. These and a few other institutions formed the SCÉRÉN network (''Services, Culture, Éditions, Ressources pour l'Éducation nationale'': "Services, Culture, Publishing, Resources for National Education").

The network also includes:
* the [[Centre de liaison de l'enseignement et des médias d'information]] (Clemi);
* the [[Centre de ressources et d’information sur les multimédias pour l’enseignement supérieur]] (Cerimes);
* the National Education Museum.

{{Nihongo|'''Toshio Iue'''|井植 歳男|Iue Toshio|extra=28 December 1902 &amp;ndash; 16 July 1969}} was a [[Japan]]ese inventor and industrialist who founded [[Sanyo|Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd.]]. Prior to the founding of Sanyo, he played an influential role in the growth and development of [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita Electric Works]], working closely alongside his brother-in-law and lifetime confidant, [[Konosuke Matsushita]].

==Early life==
The son of a sailor from [[Awaji Island]], Iue initially followed his father's footsteps as a sailor's apprentice. When a ship he was on exploded, with Toshio barely escaping with his life, he took a job at an electric plant run by [[Konosuke Matsushita]], who was married to one of Toshio's sisters. During his tenure at the company, he became an expert salesman, convincing wary resalers of the quality of [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]]'s electric products, which were from Osaka, in an era where most electric goods in Japan were made in Tokyo.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Career at Matsushita==
After serving in the Japanese military, Iue came back to Japan and became Konosuke's brother-in-law once again when he married Mumeno Matsushita. Iue then took the lead in building a wooden boat factory for Matsushita upon request of the Japanese military during [[World War II]]. Upon Japan's defeat in the war, the General Headquarters of Allied Forces requested a change in the management of Matsushita, with one of its senior executives required to step down. Iue decided to step down so that Matsushita could continue as the head of the company.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Founding of Sanyo==
After his resignation from Matsushita, Iue was summoned to the office of the president of [[Sumitomo Bank]] after an ill-timed loan to acquire shares in Matsushita, which had become close to worthless after Japan's defeat. The bank president forgave Iue's debt, and knowing his prior talent working at Matsushita, offered him starting capital for a new business.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

Konosuke Matsushita would lend Iue an unused plant in Hyogo Prefecture, where he followed in his brother-in-law's footsteps by initially making bicycle lamps and captured 60% of the Japanese market. He named his firm [[Sanyo]], meaning "three oceans" in Japanese, hoping that he would be able to sell his products across the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The growing demand for home appliances and washing machines would fuel Sanyo's growth through the 1950s.

==Later life==
Iue retired and handed the presidency of Sanyo to his brother in 1968. During his retirement, he worked to promote development of Awaji Island and died in 1969. After a series of unprofitable quarters, Sanyo's story would go full circle as it was acquired in 2009 by [[Panasonic Corporation]], the firm where Iue originally worked at alongside his brother-in-law, Konosuke Matsushita.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

{{USBankruptcy}}

A '''trustee in bankruptcy''' is an entity, often an individual, in charge of administering a [[bankruptcy]] estate.

== United States ==
In the United States, a '''Trustee in Bankruptcy''' is a person who is appointed by the [[United States Trustee Program]], a division of the [[United States Department of Justice]]. In limited circumstances, the creditors involved in a bankruptcy case can elect a trustee.

In a [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] Bankruptcy ("Liquidation") the trustee gathers the debtor’s non-exempt property, managing the funds from the sale of those assets, and then paying expenses and distributing the balance to the owed creditors.

In a [[Chapter 13]] Bankruptcy ("Reorganization") the trustee is responsible for receiving the debtor’s monthly payments and distributing those funds proportionally to the debtor's creditors. The Bankruptcy Trustee will act on behalf of the debtor to guarantee that both the creditors’ and the debtor’s interests are maintained in accordance with the bankruptcy laws, and will often be required to act as a negotiator between the two parties.

Since the 1990s, duties similar to those of a trustee are sometimes performed by an individual called a [[Chief restructuring officer]] (CRO), generally prior to, or subsequent to, a bankruptcy proceeding (generally, a Chapter 11 proceeding). A CRO is an official of the company who has direct contact with the creditors and who has executive power to implement changes. The advantage of using a CRO is that the arrangement gives both the creditor and debtor more say over the future of the company than might be the case where a Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee is appointed.

==Canada==

See: [[Bankruptcy in Canada]]

In Canada, a trustee in bankruptcy is an individual or a corporation licensed by the official superintendent to hold in trust and, subsequently, to distribute bankrupt’s property among the creditors in accordance with the distribution scheme under the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]] (BIA). The bankrupt and all other persons holding bankrupt’s property must transfer the property to trustee. The trustee may also assist individual in preparing and submitting a consumer proposal to creditors. The trustee must arrange mandatory counselling of the bankrupt. The trustee must follow the procedures under the BIA, call creditors meetings and send the parties required notices of proceedings and documents. The trustee is responsible for preparation of pre-discharge report and may oppose the bankrupt’s discharge.
