'''Accounting ethics''' is primarily a field of [[applied ethics]] and is part of [[business ethics]] and human [[ethics]], the study of [[moral value]]s and judgments as they apply to [[accountancy]]. It is an example of [[professional ethics]]. Accounting introduced by [[Luca Pacioli]], and later expanded by government groups, professional organizations, and independent companies. Ethics are taught in accounting courses at higher education institutions as well as by companies training [[accountant]]s and [[audit]]ors.

Due to the diverse range of accounting services and recent corporate collapses, attention has been drawn to ethical standards accepted within the accounting profession.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackling|first=Beverly|author2=Barry J.

==Importance of ethics==
The nature of the work carried out by accountants and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed decision about investment.&lt;ref name="FinReportShare"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=David|author2=Anne Britton|title=Financial Reporting|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|year=2004|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1OUTXGDWeWoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA160,M1|isbn=1-84480-033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company.&lt;ref name="AccAudRely"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietz|first=David|title='Auditors Are Timid'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KesNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QHADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2763,4354640&amp;dq=investors+rely+on+accountants+auditors|date=April 26, 2002|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|accessdate=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.&lt;ref name="AcctEthicsBook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duska|first=Ronald F.|author2=Brenda Shay Duska|title=Accounting Ethics|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y4LgVJgynCsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+Accounting+Ethics|isbn=0-631-21651-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries have differing focuses on enforcing accounting laws. In Germany, accounting legislation is governed by "tax law"; in Sweden, by "accounting law"; and in the United Kingdom, by the "[[United Kingdom company law|company law]]". In addition, countries have their own organizations which regulate accounting. For example, Sweden has the Bokföringsnämden (BFN - Accounting Standards Board), Spain the Instituto de Comtabilidad y Auditoria de Cuentas (ICAC), and the United States the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB).&lt;ref name="EthicalIssuesAcct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gowthorpe|first=Catherine|author2=John Blake|title=Ethical Issues in Accounting|year=1998|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=7|isbn=0-415-17173-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pacioli.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A painting of two men. The man at the center is looking off to his right while drawing a symbol with his right hand. His left hand is resting on a page in a book. He is wearing a robe with a hood. The man on the right is looking towards the front and is wearing a long-sleeve red shirt with a black jacket. Several writing utensils and books are on a table with a green tablecloth in the front of the image.|Luca Pacioli, here in [[Portrait of Luca Pacioli|a 1495 portrait by an unknown Renaissance artist]], wrote on accounting ethics in 1494.]]
[[Luca Pacioli]], the "Father of Accounting", wrote on accounting ethics in his first book {{lang|la|[[Summa de arithmetica|Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni, et proportionalita]]}}, published in 1494.&lt;ref name="PacioliEthics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=L.

These various groups have led accountants to follow several codes of ethics to perform their duties in a professional work environment. Accountants must follow the code of ethics set out by the professional body of which they are a member. United States accounting societies such as the [[Association of Government Accountants]], [[Institute of Internal Auditors]], and the National Association of Accountants all have codes of ethics, and many accountants are members of one or more of these societies.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeb|first=Stephen E.|title=Teaching Students Accounting Ethics: Some Crucial Issues|journal=Issues in Accounting Education|volume=3|pages=316–329|date=Fall 1988|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=7569002&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=7&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, the American Association of Public Accountants (AAPA) was created; it was the first step in developing professionalism in the United States accounting industry.&lt;ref name="EvolutionEthics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casler|first=Darwin J.|title=The Evolution of CPA Ethics: A Profile of Professionalization|publisher=[[Michigan State University]]|year=1964|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1905, the AAPA's first ethical codes were formulated to educate its members.&lt;ref name="CriticalPerspectives209"&gt;{{cite book|editor=J. Edward Ketz|title=Accounting Ethics: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management|last=Preston|first=Alistair M.|author2=David J. Cooper|author3= D. Paul Scarbrough|author4=Robert C.

As a result of discussions, a list of professional ethics was incorporated into the organization's bylaws. However, because membership to the organization was voluntary, the association could not require individuals to conform to the suggested behaviors.&lt;ref name="EvolutionEthics"/&gt; Other accounting organizations, such as the Illinois Institute of Accountants, also pursued discussion on the importance of ethics for the field.&lt;ref name="IllInsEthics"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bookkeepers Repel Inference That Their Own Employers Were Aimed At.|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/403309611.html?dids=403309611:403309611&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Feb+28%2C+1907&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=DISCUSS+ACCOUNTING+ETHICS.&amp;pqatl=google|format = Fee required|accessdate=December 14, 2010|date=February 28, 1907|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAPA was renamed several times throughout its history, before becoming the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) as it's named today. The AICPA developed five divisions of ethical principles that its members should follow: "independence, integrity, and objectivity"; "competence and technical standards"; "responsibilities to clients"; "responsibilities to colleagues"; as well as "other responsibilities and practices".&lt;ref name="Perceptions5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sellers|first=James H.|title=Accounting Student Perceptions of Business and Professional Ethics|publisher=[[University of Mississippi]]|year=1981|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these divisions provided guidelines on how a [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA) should act as a professional. Failure to comply with the guidelines could have caused an accountant to be barred from practicing. When developing the ethical principles, the AICPA also considered how the profession would be viewed by those outside of the accounting industry.&lt;ref name="Perceptions5"/&gt;

==Teaching ethics==
Courses on this subject have grown significantly in the last couple of decades.&lt;ref name="EthicsPays"/&gt; Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, as well as other mediums.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt; Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way.&lt;ref name="LoebResearch4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeb|first=Stephen E.|title=Issues Relating to Teaching Accounting Ethics: An 18 Year Retrospective|journal=Research and Professional Responsibility and Ethics in Accounting|volume=11|page=4|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bW5PXF3I0HwC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22accounting+ethics%22#PPA4,M1|isbn=978-0-7623-1367-9|accessdate=May 14, 2009|doi=10.1016/s1574-0765(06)11001-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at [[Binghamton University]].&lt;ref name="AnonCenterEthics"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anonymous|title=First Center to Study Accounting Ethics Opens|journal=Journal of Accountancy|volume=176|issue=4|page=19|date=October 1993|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=558663&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination|CPA exam]].&lt;ref name="LoebResearch4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeasy.com/ethics-cpe-courses/index.aspx "State Regulatory Accounting Ethics"] retrieved April 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=35em|bgcolor=|quote='''Seven goals of accounting ethics education'''
*Relate accounting education to moral issues.
*Recognize issues in accounting that have ethical implications.
*Develop "a sense of moral obligation" or responsibility.
*Develop the abilities needed to deal with ethical conflicts or dilemmas.
*Learn to deal with the uncertainties of the accounting profession.
*"Set the stage for" a change in ethical behavior.
*Appreciate and understand the history and composition of all aspects of accounting ethics and their relationship to the general field of ethics. —Stephen E. Loeb&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt;}}

In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb proposed that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted from a list by Daniel Callahan).&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt; To implement these goals, he pointed out that accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt;

==Accounting scandals==
{{main|Accounting scandals}}
Accounting ethics has been deemed difficult to control as accountants and auditors must consider the interest of the public (which relies on the information gathered in audits) while ensuring that they remained employed by the company they are auditing.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJWhatYouLike"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Lee|title=Goal: Ethical Standards for Accounting Practices|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=27058245&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|date=May 24, 1984|publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They must consider how to best apply accounting standards even when faced with issues that could cause a company to face a significant loss or even be discontinued. Due to several accounting scandals within the profession, critics of accountants have stated that when asked by a client "what does two plus two equal?" the accountant would be likely to respond "what would you like it to be?".&lt;ref name="WSJWhatYouLike"/&gt; This thought process along with other criticisms of the profession's issues with conflict of interest, have led to various increased standards of professionalism while stressing ethics in the work environment.

The role of accountants is critical to society. Accountants serve as financial reporters and
intermediaries in the capital markets and owe their primary obligation to the public interest. The
information they provide is crucial in aiding managers, investors and others in making critical economic
decisions. Accordingly, ethical improprieties by accountants can be detrimental to society, resulting in
distrust by the public and disruption of efficient capital market operations.

}}
From the 1980s to the present there have been multiple accounting scandals that were widely reported on by the media and resulted in fraud charges, bankruptcy protection requests, and the closure of companies and accounting firms. The scandals were the result of [[creative accounting]], misleading [[financial analysis]], as well as [[bribe]]ry. Various companies had issues with fraudulent accounting practices, including [[Nugan Hand Bank#Scandal and collapse|Nugan Hand Bank]], [[Phar-Mor#Bankruptcy|Phar-Mor]], [[WorldCom#Accounting scandals|WorldCom]], and [[American International Group#Accounting fraud claims|AIG]]. One of the most widely reported violation of accounting ethics involved [[Enron]], a multinational company, that for several years had not shown a true or fair view of their financial statements. Their auditor [[Arthur Andersen]], an accounting firm considered one of the "[[Big Four auditors|Big Five]]", signed off on the validity of the accounts despite the inaccuracies in the financial statements.&lt;ref name="AASignOff"&gt;{{cite news|title=Auditors: In the palm of the banks?|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article5580824.ece|date=January 25, 2009|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|accessdate=June 18, 2009 | location=London | first1=Iain | last1=Dey | first2=Dominic | last2=Rushe}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the unethical activities were reported, not only did Enron dissolve but Arthur Andersen also went out of business.

===Causes===
Fraudulent accounting can arise from a variety of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. Several studies have proposed that a firm's [[corporate culture]] as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior.&lt;ref name="ClikeTrust"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clikeman|first=Paul M.|title=Educating for the Public Trust|journal=The CPA Journal|volume=73|issue=8|page=80|date=August 2003|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=407305991&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 7, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511003019/http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=407305991&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD| archivedate= 11 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleClimate"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Appelbaum|first=Steven H.|author2=Kyle J Deguire |author3=Mathieu Lay|title=The Relationship of Ethical Climate to Deviant Workplace Behaviour|journal=Corporate Governance|volume=5|issue=4|pages=43–55|year=2005|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=914821791&amp;sid=5&amp;Fmt=4&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 8, 2009| doi=10.1108/14720700510616587}}&lt;/ref&gt; This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt;

Until 1977, ethics rules prevented accounting and auditing firms from advertising to clients. When the rules were lifted, spending by the largest CPA firms on advertisements rose from [[United States dollar|US$]]4 million in the 1980s to more than $100&amp;nbsp;million in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="CSTAdvertise"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Lee|title=Advertising has hurt accounting's ethics: critics|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1464160.html|format = Registration required|date=May 24, 1984|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claimed that, by allowing the firms to advertise, the business side overstepped the professional side of the profession, which led to a conflict of interest. This focus allowed for occurrences of fraud, and caused the firms, according to Apj , "... to offer services that made them more consultants and business advisers than auditors."&lt;ref name="CSTAdvertise"/&gt; As accounting firms became less interested in the lower-paying audits due to more focus on higher earning services such as consulting, problems arose.&lt;ref name="WashPost1998"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crenshaw|first=Albert B.|author2=Brett D.

A 2007 article in ''Managerial Auditing Journal'' determined the top nine factors that contributed to ethical failures for accountants based on a survey of 66 members of the [[International Federation of Accountants]]. The factors include (in order of most significant): "self-interest, failure to maintain objectivity and independence, inappropriate professional judgment, lack of ethical sensitivity, improper leadership and ill-culture, failure to withstand advocacy threats, lack of competence, lack of organizational and peer support, and lack of professional body support."&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt; The main factor, self-interest, is the motivation by an accountant to act in his/her best interest or when facing a conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt; For example, if an auditor has an issue with an account he/she is auditing, but is receiving financial incentives to ignore these issues, the auditor may act unethically.

The [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) are standards and interpretations developed by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]], which are principle-based.&lt;ref name="WSJSwitch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Scannell|first=Kara|author2=Joanna Slater|title=SEC Moves To Pull Plug On U.S. Accounting Standards|url=http://s.wsj.net/article/SB121985665095476825.html?mod=fpa_whatsnews|date=August 28, 2008|publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511112508/http://s.wsj.net/article/SB121985665095476825.html?mod=fpa_whatsnews| archivedate= 11 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFRS are used by over 115 countries or areas including the [[European Union]], Australia, and Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="IFRSList"&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of IFRSs by Jurisdiction|url=http://www.iasplus.com/country/useias.htm#totals|date=March 24, 2009|publisher=[[International Financial Reporting Standards|IAS]] |accessdate=April 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090512150619/http://www.iasplus.com/country/useias.htm| archivedate= 12 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP), the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting, is largely rule-based.&lt;ref name="WSJSwitch"/&gt; Critics have stated that the rules-based GAAP is partly responsible for the number of scandals that the United States has suffered.&lt;ref name="BizJourBoil"/&gt; The principles-based approach to monitoring requires more professional judgment than the rules-based approach.&lt;ref name="BennettRules"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=907368 |last=Bennett |first=Bruce |author2=Michael Bradbury |author3=Helen Pragnell |title=Rules, Principles and Judgments in Accounting Standards |journal=Abacus |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=189–203 |year=2006 |format=Registration required |ssrn=907368 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6281.2006.00197.x |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511192601/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=907368 |archivedate=11 May 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many stakeholders in many countries such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency. When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards, they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about the pros and cons of rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor’s decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Segovia|first=Joann|title=Do Principles- vs. Rules-Based Standards Have a Differential Impact on U.S. Auditors' Decisions?|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1871151361&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=2&amp;clientId=31810&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFRS is based on "understandability, relevance, materiality, reliability, and comparability".&lt;ref name="RRCUMIFRS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosen|first=Graeme|title=A Practical Guide to IFRS for Derivatives and Structured Finance|publisher=Euromoney Books|year=2006|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/?id=00Jco44doU0C&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=relevance,+reliability,+comparability,+understandability,+and+materiality+IFRS|isbn=1-84374-267-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since IFRS has not been adopted by all countries, these practices do not make the international standards viable in the world domain. In particular, the United States has not yet conformed and still uses GAAP which makes comparing principles and rules difficult. In August 2008, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) proposed that the United States switch from GAAP to IFRS, starting in 2014.&lt;ref name="WSJSwitch"/&gt;

===Responses to scandals===
Since the major accounting scandals, new reforms, regulations, and calls for increased higher education have been introduced to combat the dangers of unethical behavior.&lt;ref name="PerfReport17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnsson|first=Hans|author2=Per Erik Kihlstedt|title=Performance-Based Reporting|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2005|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T2sIinuZlHIC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22accounting+ethics%22|isbn=0-471-73543-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By educating accountants on ethics before entering the workforce, such as through higher education or initial training at companies, it is believed it will help to improve the credibility of the accounting profession.&lt;ref name="DellaDifference"/&gt; Companies and accounting organizations have expanded their assistance with educators by providing education materials to assist professors in educating students.&lt;ref name="BizJourChampion"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mader|first=Becca|title=Enron case causes colleges to champion accounting ethics|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2002/05/06/focus1.html|date=May 3, 2002|publisher=''[[The Business Journal]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090523034641/http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2002/05/06/focus1.html| archivedate= 23 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New regulations in response to the scandals include the [[Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004]] in Australia as well as the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002, developed by the United States.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt; Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects [[whistleblower]]s and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's [[accounting records]]. In 2002, the five members of the [[Public Oversight Board]] (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB).&lt;ref name="5PCAOB"&gt;{{cite news|last=Labaton|first=Stephen|title=Accounting Ethics Panel Members Resign, Rejecting Sec Chief's Plan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YuwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M3ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3645,467306&amp;dq=accounting+ethics|date=January 23, 2002|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.&lt;ref name="ManagerialAcctBook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilton|first=Ronald W.|title=Managerial Accounting: Creating Value in a Dynamic Business Environment|publisher=McGraw Hill/Irwin|location=Boston|edition=Sixth|year=2005|page=26|isbn=0-07-111314-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) released a report entitled ''Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting: An International Perspective''.&lt;ref name="IFARebuild"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crow |first=John |author2=Christian Aubin |author3=Olivia Kirtley |author4=Kosuke Nakahira |author5=Ian Ramsay |author6=Guylaine Saucier |author7=Graham Ward |title=Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting: An International Perspective |url=http://www.ifac.org/Credibility/ViewPoints_PubDL.php?PubID=00061 |format=PDF |date=August 2003 |publisher=[[International Federation of Accountants]] |accessdate=April 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528233709/http://www.ifac.org/Credibility/ViewPoints_PubDL.php?PubID=00061 |archivedate=May 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By studying the international company collapses as a result of accounting issues, it determined areas for improvement within organizations as well as recommendations for companies to develop more effective ethics codes. The report also recommended that companies pursue options that would improve training and support so accountants could better handle ethical dilemmas.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt;
A collaborative effort by members of the international financial regulatory community led by [[Michel Prada]], Chairman of the French Financial Markets Authority, resulting in establishment of the [[Public Interest Oversight Board]] (PIOB) on 1 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The PIOB provides oversight of the IFAC standards-setting boards: the [[International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board]] (IAASB), the [[International Accounting Education Standards Board]] (IAESB) and the [[International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants]] (IESBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The most recent reform came into effect in July 2010 when President Obama signed "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act". The act covers a broad range of changes. The highlights of the legislation are consumer protections with authority and independence, ends too big to fail bail outs, advance warning system, transparency and accountability for exotic instruments, executive compensation and corporate governance, protects investors, and enforces regulations on the books.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/070110_Dodd_Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_comprehensive_summary_Final.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710034423/http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/070110_Dodd_Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_comprehensive_summary_Final.pdf |date=2010-07-10 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation also resulted in the Office of the Whistleblower, which was established to administer the SEC's whistleblower program. Congress authorized the SEC to provide monetary awards to whistleblowers who come forward with information that results in a minimum of a $1,000,000 sanction. The rewards are between 10% and 30% of the dollar amount collected.&lt;ref&gt;"Welcome to the Office of the Whistleblower." U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Home Page). Web. 31 Oct. 2011. &lt;https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Whistleblowers help identify fraud and other unethical behaviors early on. The result is less harm to investors, quickly holding offenders responsible, and to maintain the integrity of the U.S. markets.

'''Anthony Cottrell''' (21 March 1806 – 4 May 1860) was a farmer and one of fifteen investors in the [[Port Phillip Association]]. The son of Ellen  and William Cottrell, a farmer living in the South Esk County of [[Cornwall]], [[Tasmania]]. He immigrated to Tasmania in 1824 on the 'Cumberland'. He was to later befriend [[John Batman]] and [[John Charles Darke]], fellow Tasmanian investors and move to [[Port Phillip]] on the [[Yarra River]] in 1835 as one of the original settlers in what was to become [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. He later returned to Tasmania. He is officially remembered in the name of a hill and an outer western Melbourne suburb, [[Mount Cottrell, Victoria|Mount Cottrell]], near [[Melton, Victoria|Melton]].

==Marriage and business interests==
In January 1835 he married Frances Solomon. Seven months later he moved to [[Port Phillip]] to take up his new holdings he had invested and acquired via the later disputed [[Batman Treaty]]. The young couple quickly had three children who were amongst the first Europeans born in the new settlement: Ellen Lowes, 1835, Anthony Crisp, 1837, and Harriet Ann 1839.

The extraordinary claims to large areas of land made by members of the Association after [[Joseph Gellibrand]] returned from his exploration in February 1836 were such that each began to ship stock to holdings of 40,000 acres (160&amp;nbsp;km²) or more. The members of the Association claimed in 1838 to have shipped between 2500 and 500 sheep each, and Cottrell is listed with 1000. Of course the Government of NSW did not allow them to keep this land acquired by "treaty" with the aborigines, and it is not known what happened to Cottrell's claim or to his sheep. His share in the Association was sold to banker and fellow member [[Charles Swanston]] in July 1838 for 411 pounds, which corresponded to one seventeenth of the value after expenses of the assessed value of the 10,416 acres (42&amp;nbsp;km²) which the Government eventually allowed them to purchase.

By March 1839 Cottrell was later known as a stock agent, the first in Geelong, and as an auctioneer in the area West of Melbourne. Cottrell sold a wide range of Batman's possessions under orders from his executors seeking to recover funds to repay Batman's creditors after his death in May 1839. Cottrell's acquisition of this place of business came by virtue of an interesting legal agreement with Batman in January 1839, for which the deed still exists, in which he undertook to pay Eliza Batman, John Batman's wife who was about to leave for England, 60 pounds a year for the rest of her life in exchange for a peppercorn rental on a building in William Street.

In September 1840 he returned to Tasmania where several more children were born to Anthony and Frances Cottrell: William Joseph later known as William Ostler 1842; Fanny Randall 1843; Sarah Alicia Barbara 1844; and Joseph Solomon 1846. Cottrell's original land on the Nile River passed into other hands in 1839 and he acquired another smaller property of {{convert|5|acre|m2}} near Launceston that year. His later years were lived in Hobart where Anthony Cottrell died at his home in Elphinstone Road on 4 May 1860, aged 54.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15119">'''Behavioral operations research''' ('''BOR''') examines and takes into consideration human behavior and emotions when facing complex decision problems. BOR is part of [[Operations research|Operational Research]]. BOR relates to the behavioural aspects of the use of [[operations research]] in problem solving and decision support. Specifically, it focuses on understanding behaviour in, with and beyond models&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/952973172|title=Behavioral operational research : theory, methodology and practice|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|others=Kunc, Martin,, Malpass, Jonathan,, White, Leroy,|isbn=9781137535511|location=[London]|oclc=952973172}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The general purpose is to make better use and improve the use of operations research theories and practice, so that the benefits received from the potential improvements to operations research approaches in practice, that arise from recent findings in behavioural sciences, are realised .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Behavioural Operational Research (BOR)|url = http://bor.aalto.fi/ejor.html|website = bor.aalto.fi|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; BOR approaches have heavily influenced [[supply chain management]] research&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, T., Wallenburg, C.M., &amp; Wieland, A. (2017): The human factor in SCM: Introducing a meta-theory of behavioral supply chain management, International Journal of Physical Distribution &amp; Logistics Management, 47(4), 238-262, https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJPDLM-10-2015-0268&lt;/ref&gt;, amongst others.

==Overview==
[[Operations research]] (or operational research) involves a wide range of problem–solving skills aiming to help individuals or organizations to make more rational decisions as well as improving their efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Operations Research?|url=https://www.informs.org/About-INFORMS/What-is-Operations-Research|website=Informs|publisher=Informs.org|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, operations research often assumes that agents involved in the process or operating system, such as employees, consumers and suppliers, make fully rational decisions. Their decisions are not affected by their emotions as well as their surroundings and that they are able to react and distinguish between different types of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Bendoly|first1 = Elliot|title = Behavioral Operations Management|url = https://www.linkedin.com/grps/Behavioral-Operations-Management-3704620|website = Linkedin|publisher = Linkedin.com|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, this is not always true; human behavior has an important role in decision making and worker motivation, and therefore should be considered in the study of operations. This has led to the rise of behavioral operations research, which is defined as the study of impacts that human behavior has on operations, design and business interactions in different organizations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Toward a Theory of Behavioral Operations|url = http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0205|journal = Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management|date = 2008-03-11|issn = 1523-4614|pages = 676–691|volume = 10|issue = 4|doi = 10.1287/msom.1070.0205|first = Francesca|last = Gino|first2 = Gary|last2 = Pisano}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral operations research aims to understand the decision making of managers and tries to make improvements to the supply chain using the insight obtained. Behavioral operations research includes knowledge from a number of fields, such as economics, behavioral science, psychology and other social sciences. Traditional operations research and behavioral operations research have a common intellectual goal, aiming to make differences in operations outcomes, such as flexibility, efficiency and productivity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Behavioral Operations - Scholarpedia|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Behavioral_Operations|website = www.scholarpedia.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical influence==
Humans have limitations in their ability to collect and react to relevant information. When a decision or conclusion has to be made through complex information, human decision-makers often fail to comply with normative decision theories. Moreover, a person's lifestyle, social interaction and collective behaviors has clear influence on people's decisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:CognitivePsychology.svg|thumb|The breakdown of Cognitive Psychology Study which refers to the study of human mental processes and their role in thinking,feeling and behaving.|194x194px]]

===Cognitive psychology===
This is a relatively new branch of psychology which focuses on humans' ability to make decisions, solve problems, learning, attention, memory and forgetting, these are only a few of the practical applications of this science, to some extent it is also related to motivation and emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cognitive Psychology: The Science of How We Think|url = http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/f/cogpsych.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychology is interested in what is happening within the mind when new information is received, how people respond to this information, and how this response affects their behavior and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Cognitive Psychology? - Definition &amp; Theories - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|url = http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-cognitive-psychology-definition-theories-quiz.html|website = Study.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychology is considered to be one of the dominant theoretical force in behavioral science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cognitive psychology and instruction|last = Alan|first = Lesgold|publisher = Plenum Press, in coordination with NATO Scientific Affairs Division|year = 1977|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social psychology===
[[File:Asch experiment.png|thumb|191x191px|The Asch experiment shows that participants tend to adhere to the group norms.]]
People often react and behave differently when they are put into different social situations. The aim of social psychology is to understand the nature and causes of individual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/social-psychology.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212175704/http://www.simplypsychology.org/social-psychology.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-02-12 |title=Social Psychology |date=2007 |accessdate=25 October 2015 |website=SimplyPsychology |publisher=SimplyPsychology |last=McLeod |first=Saul |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It questions or provides an insight of how human behavior relies on the physical environment.&lt;ref&gt;Argyle, M., Collett, P. and Furnham, A. (1995). Social psychology at work. London: Routledge, p.271.&lt;/ref&gt; Social psychology theories explain why there are competition between individuals, why it is often the case that individuals or organisations seek to protect and maintain their status, and why it has been observed that individuals and organisations are willing to sacrifice efficiency to achieve their goal of staying at a higher hierarchical position. In addition to status, social psychology also includes people's behavior towards goal setting, feedback and controls, interdependence, and reciprocity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Organizational behavior===
The use of psychology in behavioral operations research links to the idea of judging the relationship between people's mental health and wellbeing and their behavior at work. Psychology experts often set up indicators to evaluate how an employee's surroundings, such as working environment and noise, can affect their productivity at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is the Role of Psychology in Organizational Behavior?|url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-role-of-psychology-in-organizational-behavior.htm|website = wiseGEEK|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational behavior is the study of ways people react or behave when they are organized in groups. The purpose of this study is to improve business productivity, trying to create a more efficient business organization. Organizational behavior theories are applied towards human resource trying to maximize the output from individual group members. The study of organization behavior can be broken down into different sections, including Personality, Job Satisfaction and Reward Management, Leadership, Authority, Power and Politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Organizational Behavior (OB) Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/organizational-behavior.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-01|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main streams of research==
There are four main streams of research that can be considered a part of behavior operations research. These give us an idea of the weakness of the current operations research model and the effectiveness of behavioral operations research in predicting human decisions and reactions when facing different situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Socio-technical view of technology management===
Physical technologies can be defined as a socio-technology system, which consists of humans, human activity, spaces, artifacts, tools, and communications media. This theory suggests that social interaction at the workplace is determined by the technology and techniques used at work. Therefore, a change in technology used at work can lead to unexpected consequences. This may include differences in motivation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Human factor engineering===
Human factor engineering can be applied to improve workplaces, working systems and products aiming to reduce human errors during operations as well as improving human efficiency, productivity and operational performance. It often involves improvements of large machineries to reduce accidents during work. It is believed that behavior operations research can be related to human factor engineering as systematic errors, which happens very often technology and different machineries, can affect people's decision making and their interaction with the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ogp.org.uk/pubs/454.pdf|title = Human factors engineering in projects|last = |first = |date = August 2011|journal = International Association of Oil &amp; Gas Producers|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 25 October 2015|volume = 454}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bulwhip efect.jpg|thumb|Visualisation of Bullwhip effect|300x300px]]

===The bullwhip effect===
The bullwhip effect happens along the supply chain of an organisation. This is when agents along the supply chain fail to pass on relevant and accurate information to their superior, leading to a large variation in the demand of goods and services from the customers and the supply from the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bullwhip Effect|url = http://www.quickmba.com/ops/bullwhip-effect/|website = www.quickmba.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human behavior is a very important aspect to be considered, as decision making and emotions in the market will make a big difference to the final result of the bullwhip effect. This is because managers who can calmly make decisions while others competitors panic and deliver inaccurate messages often perform better within the industry. When the market is in poor condition, 'fear' can be an important factor affecting managers' decisions. Therefore, human behavior is closely related to people's decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bullwhip Effect and Your Supply Chain|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232953|website = Entrepreneur|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===System dynamics models in operations contexts===
System dynamics models in operations contexts focuses on the importance of how components in a system interact with each other as well as providing an overview of the processes that takes place within the system. Behavioral operations research often benefits from the development of comprehensive systems models as they are able to analyse and provide an insight of the operational system. This allows the study of behavioral operations to understand how people in these settings or work conditions think about the context in which they operate. In an operations system, it often involves levers for managers to manipulate the components involved in the system. The uses of these levers are determined by human behaviors and these behaviors include feelings of stress and fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Behavioral Operations Management: Social and Psychological Dynamics in Production and Service Settings|last = Bendoly|first = Elliot|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 25 June 2015|isbn = 0199357226|location = United States|pages = 6–8|last2 = van Wezel|first2 = Wout|last3 = Banchrach|first3 = Daniel G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related problems==

===Newsvendor problem===
The [[newsvendor model]] (or newsboy or single-period or perishable) is a mathematical model used in operations management and applied economics to determine optimal level products or services to keep in stock when the demand is unknown. This model is also known as the newsvendor problem by analogy with the situation faced by a newspaper vendor who must make on time stocking decision of how many copies of newspaper to keep in stock when facing uncertain demand. If the newspaper vendor stocks too much, these newspaper may end up worthless by the end of the day as they are no longer up-to-date. However, if the newspaper vendor stocks too little, he misses the opportunity too make more profit and suffer loss of goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Newsvendor Model|last = Adelman|first = Dan|date = 1999|journal = The Operations Quadrangle: Business Process Fundamentals|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Barnes-Schuster|first2 = Dawn|first3 = Don|last3 = Eisenstein|publisher = The University of Chicago Graduate School of Business|pages = |page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assignment problem===
The assignment problem is a complex optimization problem. The problem involves number of agents and a number of tasks. The purpose is to assign each agent with a task. All agents are expected or aimed to be allocated in a way that will maximize productivity and efficiency and minimize the total cost of the assignment.

===Secretary problem===

The secretary problem can also be called the optimal stopping theory. It focuses heavily on applied probability, statistics and decision theory. The idea behind the secretary problem is that to make the best decisions when there is a pool of different options, other options are unknown, details of other options will only be given if the currently existing option is given up. The problem comes down to the idea of optimal strategy, maximizing the probability of selecting the best option.

The '''Cellophane Paradox''' (also the '''Cellophane Trap''' or '''Cellophane Fallacy'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=271113 The Cellophane and Merger Guidelines Fallacies Again, article by Pierluigi Sabbatini]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Gingerbread Paradox''') describes a type of incorrect reasoning used in market regulation methods.

The paradox arises when a firm sells a product with few [[Substitute good|substitutes]], which in turn allows the firm to increase the price of that product. The original reason was that as the price increases, the product will reach a point where it begins to attract more and more substitutes. In technical economic terms, such a product has very low [[Cross elasticity of demand|cross-price elasticity of demand]]. The situation is linked to a [[United States Supreme Court]] case and a subsequent response in economic literature.

[[Cellophane]] was a [[DuPont]] Company plastic wrapping material that had its U.S. production restricted to du Pont by numerous patents in the early 1950s. Du Pont was sued under the [[Sherman Act]] for [[monopolization]] of the cellophane market by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]], and the case (''U.S. v. E. I. du Pont''&lt;ref&gt;Decided by the Supreme Court and reported at 351 U.S. 377, 76 S.Ct. 994, 100 L.Ed.1264&lt;/ref&gt;) was decided by the Supreme Court in 1956. The Court agreed with du Pont that when evaluated at the monopolistic price observed in the early 1950s, there were many substitutes for cellophane and, therefore, du Pont had only a small share of the market for wrapping materials (i.e., it possessed little or no [[market power]]).

This reasoning was challenged by a 1955 article in the [[American Economic Review]]. In research on the du Pont company arising from his PhD dissertation, Willard F. Mueller and co-author [[George W. Stocking, Sr.]] pointed out the error of mistaking a monopolist's inability to exercise [[market power]] by raising price above the ''current'' price for an inability to have already exercised market power by raising price significantly above the ''competitive'' price. Courts that use a monopolized product's elevated market price will typically misconstrue a completed anti-competitive act as a lack of market power. Had the Supreme Court considered the substitutability of other wrappings at cellophane's competitive price, the sales of other wrappings would have been much lower; du Pont might very well have been found guilty of monopolizing the market for flexible wrappings.

As [[Richard Posner]] wrote, 
"Reasonable interchangeability at the current price but not at a competitive price level, far from
demonstrating the absence of monopoly power, might well be a symptom of that power; this
elementary point was completely overlooked by the court"
&lt;ref name="posner1976"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posner|first1=Richard|title=Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective|date=1976|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem continues to bedevil efforts by antitrust agencies to define markets.  Defining markets by cross-elasticity of demand requires a reference price:  If I raise my price by 5% from some base level, will people switch to a competing good?  The problem is that a firm that actually does have a monopoly power still faces constraints on its ability to charge whatever price it wants; those constraints are set by consumers’ willingness to pay.  If a monopolist already charges the profit-maximizing price, an increase above that price will cause consumers to stop buying the product; that’s why the lower price was already profit-maximizing.  So we can’t just use the price a company already charges as the base level, or we will conclude that even monopolists lack market power.

Antitrust can solve this problem by using some measure of average cost, not the actual market price, as the baseline for the question whether a merger would allow the merged firm to increase price.   But that means that the relevant question is not whether consumers would pay more for a can of Coke or a Harry Potter novel than they currently do; it is whether they would pay 5% more for the can of Coke than it cost to make, deliver, and sell it.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Lemley &amp; Mark McKenna, Is Pepsi Really a Substitute for Coke? Market Definition in Antitrust and IP, Geo. L.J. (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20131">'''Child labour in the diamond industry''' is a widely reported and criticized issue on [[diamond industry]] for using [[child labour]] in [[diamond mine]]s and polishing procedures in poor conditions mainly in [[India]] and [[Africa]]. In these mines, children come in contact with minerals, oil and machinery exhaust.&lt;ref name="ihscslnews"/&gt; In 1997, The [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] claimed that child labour was prospering in the diamond industry in Western India, where the majority of the world's diamonds are cut and polished while workers are often paid only a fraction of 1% of the value of the stones they cut.&lt;ref name=BBCBusiness&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/15377.stm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714093557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/15377.stm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 July 2012|title=Child Labour Crisis in Diamond Industry|date=26 October 1997|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is argued that [[economic growth]] in [[Western India]] in the 1980s-90s was associated with an increase in the number of child workers who do simple, repetitive manual tasks that do not require long years of training or experience in low-paying hazardous working conditions that involve drudgery, foreclose the option of school education for most of them.&lt;ref name=sciencedirect/&gt;

There are organizations and people who try to create a public awareness about the issue, including Janine Roberts, The [[Anti-Slavery Society]], [[Survival International]], IndianNGO, Child Labour News Service (CLNS) managed by the [[Global March Against Child Labor]], and IHS Child Slave Labor News.

==Reports==

===India===
{{Further|Child labour in India#Diamond industry}}
In 1997, the [[International Labour Organization]] published a report titled ''Child Labour in the Diamond Industry''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/dialogue/actrav/child/proj/childiam.htm|title=Child Labour in the Diamond Industry|publisher=[[International Labour Organization]]|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that child labour is highly prevalent in the Indian diamond industry. Child labourers constitute nearly 3% of the total workforce and the percentage of child labourers is as high as 25% in the diamond industry of [[Surat]]. The ICFTU further claimed that child labour was prospering in the diamond industry in western India, where the majority of the world's diamonds are cut and polished. Workers are often paid only a fraction of 1% of the value of the stones they cut.&lt;ref name=BBCBusiness&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/15377.stm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714093557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/15377.stm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 July 2012|title=Child Labour Crisis in Diamond Industry|date=26 October 1997|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pravin Nanavati, a Surat-based diamond businessman argued that, since high cost diamonds could easily be lost or broken while cutting or polishing, employing a child labourer would mean risking "[[lakhs]] of [[rupee]]s."  Some western countries have called for a [[boycott]] against the diamond industry for establishing a [[monopoly]] in the sector{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. Mohan Dhabuwala, secretary of The South Gujarat Diamond Workers Association, argued that while child labour is highly prevalent in the construction and hotel industries, there are few child labourers in the diamond industry of Surat, less than 1% according to their surveys, mainly because of stern punishments and penalties for violation of child labour laws.&lt;ref name="business-standard"&gt;{{cite web|author=Summit Khanna |location= Ahmedabad |date=2004-12-13 |url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=195628 |title=Diamond industry plays down child labour charges |publisher=Business-standard.com |accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Madhura Swaminathan from the [[Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research]] argued that economic growth in western India had been associated with an increase in the number of child workers over the previous 15 years and that children worked at simple repetitive manual tasks in low-paying hazardous jobs, foreclosing the option of school education.&lt;ref name=sciencedirect&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00063-1|title=Economic growth and the persistence of child labour: Evidence from an Indian city|year=1998|last1=Swaminathan|first1=M|journal=World Development|volume=26|page=1513|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, an India-based management consultancy firm, A. F. Ferguson &amp; Co., commissioned a study titled ''Child Labour from the Gem and Jewellery Industry'' "to spread awareness about child labour among the people connected with the industry". They studied 663 manufacturing units at 21 different locations in [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Rajasthan]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], as an initiative of the [[Gem &amp; Jewelry Export Promotion Council]]. On 12 February, the study was presented at a seminar held by the GJEPC and the Surat Diamond Association, in Surat, India. The report argued that the use of child labour in India’s diamond processing industry has been reduced from 0.55% in 1998 to 0.31% in 2005, "while for the [[synthetic stone]] industry it is estimated to be two-thirds less".

GJEPC chairman Bakul Mehta claimed that, "some 500 diamond factory owners took an oath in the city of Palanpur, Gujarat, (home town of leading Gujarati diamond merchants) not to employ children in their factories. Similarly, in Surat, 200 factory owners took the oath," and that GJEPC "remain committed to eradicating child labour from the Indian diamond industry”. He argued that "...the gem and jewelry industry cannot even think of employing children, not only for moral reasons, but that a child could be injured while polishing or cutting the diamonds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.diamonds.net/news/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=11399|title=Child Labor Practice Drops in India|last=Tanna|first=Ketan|date=14 February 2005|publisher=Rapaport News|accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=117676|title=Use of child labour in gem industry lower|date=14 February 2005|publisher=[[Indian express]]|accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/af-ferguson-report-slams-surat-diamond-industry/206061/|title=AF Ferguson report slams Surat diamond industry|last=Khanna|first=Summit |date= 23 February 2005|publisher=[[Business Standard]]|accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
On 28 August 2003, [[BBC news]] reported that during the 10-year [[civil war]] in Sierra Leone children were used as combatants and child labourers in the diamond mines of [[Koidu]] in the north-eastern district of Kono. Children aged between 5 and 16 were used in hard labour, for ten hours a day, "digging in soil and [[gravel]], before sifting with a pan for gemstones and shifting heavy mud believed to contain diamonds." In collaboration with [[World Vision]] and [[Aim Sierra Leone]], the Ministry of Gender and Children's Affairs registered 1,200 child miners to get them out of the mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3189299.stm|title=Children working in Sierra Leone mines|publisher=BBC news|date=28 August 2003 | first=Lansana | last=Fofana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2009, [[Human Rights Watch]] published a 62-page report titled ''Diamonds in the Rough. [[Human Rights]] Abuses in the Marange Diamond Fields of Zimbabwe'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/06/26/diamonds-rough-0 Diamonds in the Rough Human Rights Abuses in the Marange Diamond Fields of Zimbabwe] by [[Human Rights Watch]] 26 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; based on its researchers' "more than 100 one-on-one interviews with witnesses, local miners, police officers, soldiers, local community leaders, victims and relatives, medical staff, human rights lawyers, and activists in [[Harare]], [[Mutare]], and [[Marange]] district in eastern [[Zimbabwe]]", conducted in February 2009. 

According to the report, "following the discovery of diamonds in Marange in June 2006, the police and army have used brutal force to control access to the diamond fields and to take over unlicensed diamond mining and trading. Some income from the fields has been funnelled to high-level party members of [[ZANU-PF]], which is now part of a power-sharing government that urgently needs revenue as the country faces a dire economic crisis."  According to the report, some children work up to eleven hours per day with no pay, and by the estimate of a local lawyer, up to 300 children continue to work for soldiers in the Marange diamond fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/06/26/diamonds-deadly-toll|title=Diamonds’ Deadly Toll|date=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In December 2014, the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] issued a ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' that mentioned [[Angola]], the [[Central African Republic]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Guinea]], [[Liberia]], and [[Sierra Leone]] as part of the 74 countries with significant incidence of [[child labor]] and [[forced labor]] as far as the diamond industry is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/ List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Working conditions ==
{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}

Child Slave Labor News argued that it is reported that in the late 1980s, about 11% and in 1994, 16% of the workforce was underage in diamond industry. "Currently{{Clarify|date=September 2009}} there are over 171 million children that work in hazardous work sites such as factories and mines."&lt;ref name=ihscslnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihscslnews.org/view_article.php?id=162|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130114031418/http://ihscslnews.org/view_article.php?id=162|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-14|date=November 2006|title=Diamonds Are Forever, But Not The Lives Of Child Workers|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSLN further argued the diamond mines are dangerous work sites, "open pits of heavy minerals, oil, machinery exhaust, and any other rubbish seeps into". It is reported that diamond miners are exposed health risks and hazards, including [[malaria]], [[dysentery]], [[cholera]] and [[sexual diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yakovleva|first=Natalia|title=Corporate social responsibility in the mining industries|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CDqXX_28lkC | isbn=978-0-7546-4268-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to those diseases, child labourers who are subjected to working in poor conditions including overcrowding, abuse, long work hours and cheap pay in diamond mines suffer from [[eye strain]], [[headache]]s, [[malnutrition]], and respiratory problems. While they are paid for how many diamonds they can polish or cut per day. The ordinary amount of money a worker will get for polishing the uppermost section of a diamond is two [[rupee]]s, which is below eight US [[Cent (United States coin)|cent]]s, while workers who make smaller diamonds, might be paid 15 to 20 [[US dollar]]s per week. Child slaves in [[Surat]] sleep in their workplace or in a small hovel instead of a home. The [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] has claimed that child labour was prospering in the diamond industry in Western India, where the majority of the world's diamonds are cut and polished while workers are often paid only a fraction of 1% of the value of the stones they cut in 1997.&lt;ref name=BBCBusiness/&gt;

Child workers are used as slaves since business owners exploit them as cheap employment to raise more profit and diamond industry is "an infamous venue of exploitation towards youth workers" like mines and sweatshops in South Africa or India while the diamond is overpriced and funded for wars. The majority of the [[third world country]] families are [[Poverty|poor]] therefore rely on their children’s income to survive. Additionally since most children do not have the opportunity to gain an education from their local school system, working at a [[sweatshop]] is their only option in life.&lt;ref name=sciencedirect/&gt;&lt;ref name=ihscslnews/&gt; In other instances, employers pays the family in advance and in turn, the child works to pay off the debt, which is called bonding, yet bonded children cannot pay their family’s debt because of interest. With the increase in owed money, bonded children are forced into a life of servitude which will pass onto their descendants.

On the other hand, Civil wars usually shut down all government services. Countries like [[Sierra Leone]], which depend on [[diamond]]s for much of its economic activity, not only face disruption in production (which reduces the supply), but also a thriving [[black market]] in [[conflict diamond]]s, which drives down the price for what diamonds are produced.

== Forceful relocation of indigenous Bushman people by DeBeers ==

When the mines are located on the land indigenous people including children, they had to be moved to a different area in order to construct a mine to collect gems.&lt;ref name=ihscslnews/&gt; In [[Botswana]], a long dispute has existed between the interests of the mining company, [[De Beers]], and the [[Population transfer|relocation]] of the [[bushmen|Bushman]] [[tribe]] from the land in order to explore diamond resources. The Bushmen have been facing threats from government policies since at least 1980, when the diamond resources were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survival-international.org/tribes/bushmen The Bushmen Need You]&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign is being fought in an attempt to bring an end to what [[Survival International]] considers to be a "[[genocide]]" of a tribe that has been living in those lands for tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2919089/De-Beers-battles-with-Survival.html |title=De Beers battles with Survival |work=Telegraph |date=2005-07-17 |accessdate=2009-07-23 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2793779.stm |title=Bushmen 'moved for diamonds' |publisher=BBC news |date=2003-02-24 |accessdate=2009-07-23 | first=Alastair | last=Leithead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2005-07-08-botswana-diamonds-lose-their-sparkle |title=Botswana diamonds lose their sparkle |work=Mail and Guardian |date=2005-07-08 |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the grounds that their hunting and gathering has become "obsolete" and their presence is no longer compatible with "preserving [[wildlife]] resources", they were persecuted by the government in order to make them leave the [[nature reserve|reserve]].

{{Main|Diamonds from Sierra Leone}}

On 4 July 2005 [[United States|American]] [[hip hop music|rap]] star [[Kanye West]], released a song titled [[Diamonds from Sierra Leone]] as the lead single of his second studio album, ''[[Late Registration]]'',&lt;ref name=linernotes&gt;{{cite AV media notes |others=Kanye West |title=Late Registration |year=2005 |publisher=Roc-A-Fella Records |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing a repeated sample of the [[theme song]] for the 1971 [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' as performed by [[Shirley Bassey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/10/29/shirley_bassey_wants_to_work_with_kanye_ |title=Shirley Bassey Wants To Work With Kanye West |accessdate=2007-10-29 |author=World Entertainment News Network |date=2007-10-29 |work=Starpulsec.com |publisher=Starpulse}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is revealing the hard life of child workers in Sierra Leone, like other [[West African]] nations who since 1991 having been forced to mine [[conflict diamonds]] and die in [[civil war]]s financed by them: "''Good Morning!

'''Corporate jargon''', variously known as '''corporate speak''', '''corporate lingo''', '''business speak''', '''business jargon''', '''management speak''', '''workplace jargon''', '''corporatese''' or '''commercialese''', is the [[jargon]] often used in large [[corporation]]s, [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]], and similar workplaces.&lt;ref name="Garner2009-2"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Bryan A. Garner]]|title=[[Garner's Modern American Usage]]|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sd3byNeBdR4C|accessdate=21 March 2013|edition=3rd|date=28 July 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-987462-0|pages=168–69|chapter=Commercialese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; The use of corporate jargon is criticised for its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium, making meaning and intention opaque and understanding difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/going-forward-corporatese-should-be-confined-to-the-dustbin-20170316-guzxvi.html|title=Going forward, corporatese should be confined to the dustbin|last=Linnell|first=Garry|date=17 March 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone is associated with managers of large corporations, business management consultants, and occasionally government. Reference to such jargon is typically derogatory, implying the use of long, complicated, or obscure words, abbreviations, [[euphemism]]s, and acronyms. For that reason some of its forms may be considered as an [[argot]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;"corporate argot" in [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116165746415401680 The Jargon Jumble: Kids Have 'Skeds,' Colleagues, 'Needs'], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 24 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these words may be actually new inventions, designed purely to fit the specialized meaning of a situation or even to "[[spin doctor|spin]]" negative situations as positive situations.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Marketing speak''' is a related label for wording styles used to promote a product or service to a wide audience by seeking to create the impression that the vendors of the service possess a high level of sophistication, skill, and technical knowledge. Such language is often used in [[marketing]] [[press releases]], [[advertising copy]], and prepared statements read by executives and politicians.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Examples ==
{{See also|Glossary of business and management terms|List of buzzwords}}

Many terms have straightforward meanings in other contexts (e.g., leverage in physics, picked up with a well-defined meaning in finance), but are used more loosely in business speak. For example, ''[[deliverable]]'' is used to refer to anything that has to be done by a certain date to be verified by another party.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The phrases ''going forward'' or ''moving forward'' make a confident gesture towards the future, but are generally vague on timing, which usually means it can be removed from a sentence with little or no effect on its overall meaning.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Legal terms such as "[[Chapter 11]]" can be used without explaining what they are about: for example, Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code is about [[Bankruptcy in the United States|US bankruptcy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Costimator''' is an American-based series of [[Cost Estimating software]] developed by Thomas Charkiewicz in 1982 and is designed to model manufacturing costs.&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smock|first=Douglas|title=On-Demand Supply Management: World Class Strategies, Practices, and Technology|year=2007|publisher=J. Ross Publishing|isbn=1932159622|pages=128|url=https://www.amazon.com/On-demand-Supply-Management-World-class-Strategies/dp/1932159622}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software is designed, developed and marketed by MTI of [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield, MA.]]

== History ==

Costimator was designed by Thomas Charkiewicz, a former machinist and manufacturing manager who studied computer-aided manufacturing at the [[University of Massachusetts]]. Costimator was released in late 1982,&lt;ref name="amazon" /&gt; designed to model manufacturing costs.

In 2002, [[IBM]] bought Costimator OEM from MTI Systems, Inc.&lt;ref name="amazon_a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smock|first=Douglas|title=On-Demand Supply Management: World Class Strategies, Practices, and Technology|year=2007|publisher=J. Ross Publishing|isbn=1932159622|pages=132|url=https://www.amazon.com/On-demand-Supply-Management-World-class-Strategies/dp/1932159622}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the products on the market focused on machine shop operations. Costimator had its roots in the machining industry, but later branched out to include several other manufacturing processes.

John Kagan, the former manager of PC Cost Management at IBM and [[Lenovo]] estimated that between 2003 and 2004, IBM saved more than $10 million using Costimator.&lt;ref name="amazon_a" /&gt;

Costimator also includes a function known as IQ builder which customers can use to model their own manufacturing process based on historical data. The data was derived from the company’s customers in addition to various independent industry sources. Labor costs come from the [[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smock|first=Douglas|title=On-Demand Supply Management: World Class Strategies, Practices, and Technology|year=2007|publisher=J. Ross Publishing|isbn=1932159622|pages=133|url=https://www.amazon.com/On-demand-Supply-Management-World-class-Strategies/dp/1932159622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, MTI Systems, Inc. reached an agreement with European distributor Premier Manufacturing Solutions, LTD (Stockport, UK) to market its flagship products Costimator OEM and Costimator JS to companies throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.mtisystems.com/press_room/press_releases/press_apr_09.html|url=http://www.mtisystems.com/press_room/press_releases/press_apr_09.html|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Cimtronics and MTI Systems, Inc. also agreed to terms on a distribution partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTI Systems Announces Channel Agreement with Cimtronics|url=http://www.mtisystems.com/press_room/press_releases/press_Mar_11_1.html|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David R. Altman''' (1915-August 30, 2000) was an American advertising executive who co-founded the ''Altman, Stoller, Weiss'' advertising agency.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/08/business/david-r-altman-85-is-dead-his-ads-built-several-brands.html New York Times: "David R. Altman, 85, Is Dead; His Ads Built Several Brands" by Mary Williams Walsh] September 8, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BalSunObit&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-09-12/news/0009120286_1_altman-household-names-north-alabama Baltimore Sun: "David R. Altman, 85, a fashion advertising executive who built several obscure clothing lines into household names, died Aug. 30 in New York"] September 12, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family,&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/advertising Jewish Virtual Library: "Modern Jewish History: Advertising"] retrieved May 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Altman served as an Army weapons instructor during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; After the war, he attended [[New York University School of Law]] at night on the [[G.I. Bill]].&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; While in school, he worked during the day as the advertising director for the trade magazine, ''The Women's Reporter.''&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; Although he earned a law degree, he instead accepted a job as an account executive with the fashion house, Irving Serwer Advertising.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; In 1950, he founded Altman &amp; Stoller with fellow Irving Serwer alumni [[Max Stoller]] where he served as chairman.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/10/obituaries/max-stoller.html New York Times: "Obituary: Max Stoller"] May 10, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Altman focused on the fashion industry which was ripe for development as most clothing manufacturers typically pitched their concepts direct to the stores rather than develop the brand with the general public.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; Through his ad campaigns, Altman was credited with transforming then unknown fashion brands into household names.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; He developed the [[Wrangler (jeans)|Wrangler jeans]] brand with ads that promised that the jeans would fade exactly how teenagers wanted them.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt;  He transitioned Monet jewelry from being perceived as low-cost to a premier brand by photographing inexpensive pieces on supermodels.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; He promoted the [[Russ Togs]] brand with a red neon sign the read ''RRRRRRRRRuss Toggs'' at the entrance to the [[Queens–Midtown Tunnel|Midtown Tunnel]] in [[Manhattan]], elongating the name into a sexy purr.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; His creed was "Find your character; create your character; concentrate on your character."&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt;

In 1955, the firm became ''Altman, Stoller, and Chalk'' with the addition of [[Howard W. Chalk]] as a partner; Chalk left the company to start ''Chalk, Nissen, Hanft''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/19/business/howard-w-chalk-76-former-ad-executive.html New York Times: "Howard W. Chalk, 76, Former Ad Executive"] December 19, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  The firm became ''Altman, Stoller, Weiss'' in the mid 1970s after Melvin D. Weiss joined the firm.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; The firm then diversified out of fashion advertising winning accounts with the Spanish tourist board, Ezo denture adhesive, and Lanson champagne, and handled the introduction of [[Newsweek]]'s [[Inside Sports]] magazine.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; In 1978, he published an editorial in the New York Times that he was sickened by what television advertising had done to election campaigns which often promoted mediocre candidates stating "'A candidate is not a can of soup."

Altman, Stoller, Weiss was later purchased by Nadler &amp; Larimer Advertising where it was maintained as a subsidiary before being fully absorbed and the name retired in 1983.&lt;ref name=NYTNadler&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/04/business/advertising-nadler-larimer-absorbing-subsidiaries.html New York Times: "ADVERTISING; Nadler &amp; Larimer Absorbing Subsidiaries" By Philip H. Dougherty] August 4, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Altman became an executive vice president at Nadler &amp; Larimer.&lt;ref name=NYTNadler /&gt;

==Personal life==
He was married to Floria V. Lasky; they had two daughters, Emily Altman Heaps and Dara Altman Lennon.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/17/style/emily-m-altman-marries-alan-heaps.html New York Times: "Emily M. Altman Marries Alan Heaps"] June 17, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/24/style/dara-f-altman-is-married.html New York Times: "Dara F.

[[Image:Albuquerque aerial.jpg|thumb|Downtown Albuquerque aerial]]

'''Downtown Albuquerque''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. It is where a large number of the city's [[highrise]] buildings are located, as well as being the center of government and business for the region.

Downtown is roughly defined as the area between Marble Avenue, Coal Avenue, Sixth Street, and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]] railroad tracks. The area on the east side of the railroad tracks is known as '''East Downtown''' or '''EDo'''.

==Street grid==
Downtown Albuquerque is laid out in a standard grid pattern, with numbered north-south ''streets'' and named east-west ''avenues''. [[Central Avenue (Albuquerque)|Central Avenue]] (originally known as Railroad Avenue) is the main east-west thoroughfare through the center of Downtown, while Lomas Boulevard (originally New York Avenue) is a major east-west arterial through the north part of downtown.

The streets start with First Street just west of the railroad tracks and increase in number moving westward. Fourth Street was originally the main north-south thoroughfare through Downtown but today it is discontinuous, interrupted by Civic Plaza. The two block stretch between Central and Civic Plaza was once converted into a pedestrian mall, but was reverted to a vehicular roadway in late 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cabq.gov/council/find-your-councilor/district-2/projects-planning-efforts-district-2/4th-street-mall-conversion 4th Street Mall Conversion - City Of Albuquerque&lt;/ref&gt; Since these developments took place Second Street has been the main north-south street through downtown.

Fourth Street through downtown Albuquerque was part of [[U.S. Route 66]] prior to the route's 1937 realignment. Afterwards, Route 66 ran along Central Avenue until its decommissioning.

==Districts==
Downtown Albuquerque is divided into six official '''districts''', which are identified by a unified system of signage and icons.

===Courthouse District===
Located on the north side of downtown, this district is bounded by Marble Avenue, Roma Avenue, Second Street, and Seventh Street. It is named for the three major courthouses located at the intersection of Fourth and Lomas: [[Pete V. Domenici United States Courthouse]], Bernalillo County Courthouse, and the Bernalillo County [[Metropolitan Courthouse]].

===Warehouse District===
[[File:Santa Fe Freight House, Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|Old [[Santa Fe Railroad]] Freight House in 2007, Transportation Center District.]]
On the north side of downtown along the railroad tracks, the Warehouse District includes the area between Second and the railroad tracks, north of the Convention Center to Slate Avenue. As its name implies, this area contains mostly warehouses from the railroad era.

===Plaza District===
The Plaza District is the central area of downtown, bounded by Roma, Copper, Seventh, and the railroad tracks. It is centered on Civic Plaza and includes many of Albuquerque's large office and government buildings including the Albuquerque City-County Building, the Convention Center, [[Albuquerque Plaza]], the [[Compass Bank Building (Albuquerque)|Compass Bank Building]], and the [[Albuquerque Petroleum Building]]. The Main Library of the [[Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Library System]] is also located in this district.

===Arts and Entertainment District===
This district is centered along Central Avenue and Gold Avenue east of First Street. It contains most of downtown Albuquerque's historic buildings as well as most of its shopping, dining, and nightlife destinations. Notable landmarks in this district include the [[KiMo Theater]], [[Occidental Life Building]], [[First National Bank Building (Albuquerque)|First National Bank Building]], and [[Sunshine Building]]. There is a small concentration of government and office buildings on Gold Avenue which includes the [[Dennis Chavez Federal Building]], [[Gold Building]], and [[Simms Building]]. [[Amy Biehl High School]] is also located in this district.

===Transportation Center District===
This is the smallest district, encompassing the area south of Central Avenue and east of First Street. Most of the district is occupied by [[Alvarado Transportation Center]].

===Casa District===
The southernmost part of downtown, the Casa District includes the area between Gold and Coal Avenue, extending all the way west to Tenth Street. This is a primarily residential district, with a large number of [[loft apartment]] buildings. Alvarado Square, the location of the [[PNM Building]] and the headquarters of [[Bernalillo County]], is also located in the Casa District.

[[Image:Old Albuquerque High School Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|right|Old Albuquerque High School]]

==EDo==
Not one of the official downtown districts, EDo (East Downtown) is a small but expanding neighborhood centered on Central and Broadway on the east side of the railroad tracks, bounded roughly by the railroad tracks on the west, [[I-25]] on the east, Coal on the south, and Martin Luther King Avenue on the north. EDo is a trendy area containing several loft apartment buildings and a number of small shops and restaurants. The focal point of EDo is the renovated [[Old Albuquerque High School]] campus, which is now a residential complex. The name "EDo" was coined in imitation of the [[LoDo]] area of [[Denver]] which in turn was an imitation of [[SoHo]] and [[TriBeCa]] in [[New York City]] .

==Buildings==

===Tallest buildings===
Downtown Albuquerque contains most of the city's highrise buildings, including the four tallest. The tallest downtown buildings are listed below:

'''Charles Gyude Bryant''' (17 January 1949 – 16 April 2014) was a [[Liberia]]n politician and businessman. He served as the Chairman of the Transitional Government of Liberia from 14 October 2003 to 16 January 2006. The installation of the transitional government was part of the peace agreement to end the country's [[Second Liberian Civil War|second civil war]], which had raged since the [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD) rebelled against President [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]] in 1999. Bryant was previously a businessman and was chosen as chairman because he was seen as politically neutral and therefore acceptable to each of the warring factions, which included LURD, the [[Movement for Democracy in Liberia]] (MODEL), and loyalists of former President Taylor. He is a prominent member of the [[Episcopal Church of Liberia]], and was critical of the governments of [[Samuel Doe]] (1980–90) and Taylor (1997–2003).

[[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] won the [[Liberian general election, 2005|2005 elections]] and took office in January 2006, succeeding Bryant.

He died on 16 April 2014 at the [[John F. Kennedy Medical Center (Liberia)|John F. Kennedy Medical Center]] in [[Monrovia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charles Gyude Bryant, Former Liberia Interim President is Dead|url=http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/news/1362-charles-gyude-bryant-former-liberia-interim-president-is-dead|newspaper=[[FrontPage Africa]]|date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Butty|first=James|title=Gyude Bryant, Liberia’s Sixth Transitional Leader, Dies at 65|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/liberia-transitional-leader-gyude-bryant-dies-at-age-65/1895183.html|newspaper=[[Voice of America]]|date=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embezzlement==
In January 2007, Bryant was questioned by police regarding allegations of corruption during his time in office.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Paye-Layleh, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6278909.stm "Liberia ex-leader probed on graft"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 19 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2007, Bryant was charged with [[embezzlement]]. His government is alleged to have embezzled more than [[United States dollar|US$]]1 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6403923.stm "Liberia's ex-leader 'stole $1m'"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 28 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was not immediately arrested because he was said to be absent from [[Monrovia]] and in [[Lofa County]] instead,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?sf=86&amp;set_id=1&amp;click_id=86&amp;art_id=nw20070313123746707C920485 "Liberia to arrest ex-interim president"], [[Agence France Press|AFP]] (''Independent Online''), 13 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but on 13 March he was arrested and released on bond shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Schwarz, [http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-03/2007-03-13-voa51.cfm "Former Liberian Transitional President Arrested for Corruption"], ''[[Voice of America]] News'', 13 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In court on 25 April, the defense argued that Bryant constitutionally enjoyed immunity for actions taken as head of state, while the prosecution argued that he did not because his appointment resulted from the Accra Accords in August 2003 and occurred outside the constitutional framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/fluxafp/fil_info.asp?reg_id=0&amp;art_cle=36468 "Liberia: le parquet général dénie toute immunité à l'ex-président Bryant"], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] (''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeuneafrique.com]]''), 25 April 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the prosecution's argument, enabling Bryant's trial to continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/fluxafp/fil_info.asp?art_cle=38841 "Liberia: la Cour suprême donne son feu vert pour juger l'ex-président Bryant"], [[Agence France Press|AFP]] (''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeuneafrique.com]]''), 24 August 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the reward we get for restoring peace and democracy to our country."&lt;ref name=Ex/&gt; He was released from the central prison in Monrovia on 8 December after he signed a commitment to appear in court on 10 December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/08/africa/AF-GEN-Liberia-Ex-President.php "Ex-Liberian president released from jail"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), December 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 2009, Bryant, along with four others, was acquitted of embezzling US$1 million from the state oil refinery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=86&amp;art_id=nw20090501151133549C215305 "Ex-Liberian president acquitted of theft"], Sapa-Associated Press (''IOL''), 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional charges regarding the alleged theft of US$1.3 million from the state were dropped on 24 September 2010 as the government failed to provide any proof of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontpageafrica.com/newsmanager/anmviewer.asp?a=11530&amp;z=37 "Reconciliatory Gesture Or Political Compromise?

==Personal==
Born in Monrovia during the early years of the [[William Tubman|Tubman era]], Bryant's mother was a descendant of settlers and his father was a member of the [[Grebo people]].  He matriculated at [[Cuttington University]] in 1972, and in 1974 he married the former Rosilee Williams; together they had two children, Cheryl and Charles.  Bryant also had a son named Charles Mleh.  Before becoming the chairman of the interim government, he was a successful businessman operating a company that supplied machinery for the [[Freeport of Monrovia]], and he was the chairman of the [[Liberian Action Party]],&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Tim.

'''Harold Pupkewitz''' (14 July 1915 – 27 April 2012) was a Namibian entrepreneur and member of the President's Economic Advisory Council. He was the Executive Chairman of Pupkewitz Holdings, a group of builders' merchants, car sale businesses, and a host of other enterprises, from its foundation in 1946 until his death. Pupkewitz directed the boards of several important Namibian companies, among them [[NamPost]], [[NamPower]], [[Telecom Namibia]], and [[MTC Namibia]], and served as president of a number of high-profile political and economical institutions.

==Early life and education==
Harold Pupkewitz was born in [[Vilno]] Russian Empire, on 14 July 1915. He moved to [[South West Africa]] in 1925 together with his mother Anna and his two brothers, Morris and Julius. After completing secondary school at [[Windhoek High School]] in 1932 he went to [[Cape Town]] for further studies. He graduated from [[University of Cape Town]] in 1935 with a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] and stayed to work in Cape Town for two more years. While on a holiday in [[Windhoek]] in 1937 he decided to join the management of the family business, which at that time had developed from an [[ox wagon]] manufacturing enterprise to that of a [[general dealer]], selling household wares and groceries.&lt;ref name="Eco90"&gt;{{cite news

==Development of the family business==
The Pupkewitz family business was founded by Harold's father Max in 1902 as an ox wagon building and repair enterprise. In 1904 at the onset of the [[Herero Wars|Herero and Namaqua War]] he opened shop in [[Okahandja]], strategically situated between [[Windhoek]] and the coastal towns of [[Walvis Bay]] and [[Swakopmund]]. Max Pupkewitz travelled to Europe in 1912, was jailed for his support of the German colonialists, and only returned in 1920. At that time, railways had been constructed and the era of ox wagon transportation in South West Africa was over. Max Pupkewitz opened a general dealer business in Windhoek in 1925, the year the rest of the family resettled here.&lt;ref name="Eco90"/&gt;

In July 1946, Harold Pupkewitz co-founded ''M Pupkewitz and Sons''. The portfolio at first mainly consisted of building material and farm supplies but was expanded in 1954 with the addition of a furniture shop and a motor car sale business.&lt;ref name="Eco90"/&gt;

When [[Volvo]] suspended their engagement in Southern Africa because of concerns about the [[apartheid]] system, Pupkewitz bought the local [[Toyota]] business in 1975.&lt;ref name="Eco90"/&gt; Later [[Hino Motors|Hino]] trucks and the [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]] franchise were added. In 2002 the car sales branch had grown to be the largest in Namibia. Apart from Windhoek, the Pupkewitz group has outlets in many other places in Namibia, among them Walvis Bay, [[Keetmanshoop]], [[Grootfontein]], [[Otjiwarongo]], [[Gobabis]], and [[Aranos]]. In 1981, ''Pupkewitz Holdings'' was founded as umbrella organisation for the different companies.&lt;ref name="Rep87"&gt;{{cite news

Before [[Namibian War of Independence|Namibian independence]] he was member of the Foreign Exchange Liaison Committee (1948–1954), the Administrator-General's Advisory Council (1979–1990), president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of South West Africa (1981/82), the Institute of Economic Affairs of South West Africa, the South African Institute of International Affairs (1982–1990), and director of Namib Air and Namib Airlines (the predecessor of [[Air Namibia]]).&lt;ref name="Rep87"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AZ94&gt;{{cite news

He was a member of the President's Economic Advisory Council since 1997.&lt;ref name="NID"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rep87"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AZ94/&gt;

{{Labour|sp=Oxford|expanded=academic}}
'''Industrial relations''' or '''employment relations''' is the multidisciplinary academic field that studies the employment relationship;{{sfnm |1a1=Ackers |1y=2002 |2a1=Kaufman |2y=2004 |2p=94}} that is, the complex interrelations between [[employer]]s and [[employee]]s, [[labor union|labor/trade union]]s, [[employer organization]]s and [[the state]]. 

The newer name, "employment relations" is increasingly taking precedence because "industrial relations" is often seen to have relatively narrow connotations.{{sfn|Lewis|Thornhill|Saunders|2003|p=3}} Nevertheless, industrial relations has frequently been concerned with employment relationships in the broadest sense, including "non-industrial" employment relationships. This is sometimes seen as paralleling a trend in the separate but related  disciple of [[human resource management]].{{sfn|Banfield|Kay|2008|p=114}}

While some scholars regard or treat industrial/employment relations as synonymous with '''employee relations''' and [[labour relations]], this is controversial, because of the narrower focus of employee/labour relations, i.e. on employees or labour, from the perspective of employers, managers and/or officials. In addition, employee relations is often perceived as dealing only with non-unionized workers, whereas labour relations is seen as dealing with [[Portal:Organized_Labour|organized labour]], i.e unionized workers.&lt;ref name="OgilvieCooper2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ogilvie |first=John R. |year=2006 |title=CLEP Principles of Management |location=Piscataway, New Jersey |publisher=Research &amp; Education Association |isbn=978-0-7386-0125-0 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=July 2018}} Some academics, universities and other institutions regard human resource management as synonymous with one or more of the above disciplines,{{sfn|Rose|2008}} although this too is controversial.

== Overview ==
Industrial relations examines various employment situations, not just ones with a unionized workforce. However, according to Bruce E. Kaufman, "To a large degree, most scholars regard [[trade union|trade unionism]], [[collective bargaining]] and labour–[[management]] relations, and the national labour policy and [[labour law]] within which they are embedded, as the core subjects of the field."{{sfn|Kaufman|2008|p=31}}

Initiated in the United States at end of the 19th century, it took off as a field in conjunction with the [[New Deal]]. However, it is generally regarded as a separate field of study only in English-speaking countries, having no direct equivalent in continental Europe.{{sfn|Ackers|2002}} In recent times, industrial relations has been in decline as a field, in correlation with the decline in importance of trade unions{{sfn|Kaufman|2008|p=31}} and also with the increasing preference of [[business school]]s for the human resource management paradigm.{{sfn|Taras|2008|p=124}}

[[File:Ir rally img 3870.jpg|thumb|Protest against industrial relations legislation in Melbourne in 2005.]]

Industrial relations has three faces: science building, problem solving, and ethical.{{sfn|Kaufman|2004|p=94}} In the science building phase, industrial relations is part of the [[social science]]s, and it seeks to understand the [[employment]] relationship and its institutions through high-quality, rigorous research. In this vein, industrial relations scholarship intersects with scholarship in [[labour economics]], [[industrial sociology]], [[labour history (discipline)|labour]] and [[social history]], [[human resource management]], [[political science]], [[law]], and other areas.

Industrial relations scholarship assumes that labour markets are not perfectly competitive and thus, in contrast to mainstream [[economic theory]], employers typically have greater bargaining power than employees. Industrial relations scholarship also assumes that there are at least some inherent conflicts of interest between employers and employees (for example, higher wages versus higher profits) and thus, in contrast to scholarship in human resource management and [[organizational behaviour]], conflict is seen as a natural part of the employment relationship. Industrial relations scholars therefore frequently study the diverse institutional arrangements that characterize and shape the employment relationship—from norms and power structures on the shop floor, to employee voice mechanisms in the workplace, to [[collective bargaining]] arrangements at company, regional, or national level, to various levels of public policy and [[labour law]] regimes,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} to varieties of [[capitalism]]{{sfn|Hamann|Kelly|2008|p=129}} (such as [[corporatism]], [[social democracy]], and [[neoliberalism]]).

When labour markets are seen as imperfect, and when the employment relationship includes conflicts of interest, then one cannot rely on markets or [[manager]]s to always serve workers' interests, and in extreme cases to prevent worker exploitation. Industrial relations scholars and practitioners, therefore, support institutional interventions to improve the workings of the employment relationship and to protect workers' rights. The nature of these institutional interventions, however, differ between two camps within industrial relations.{{sfn|Budd|Bhave|2008}} The pluralist camp sees the employment relationship as a mixture of shared interests and conflicts of interests{{sfn|Budd|Bhave|2008|p=104}} that are largely limited to the employment relationship. In the workplace, pluralists, therefore, champion [[grievance (labour)|grievance]] procedures, [[employee voice]] mechanisms such as [[works council]]s and [[trade union]]s, collective bargaining, and labour–management partnerships. In the policy arena, pluralists advocate for [[minimum wage]] laws, [[occupational health and safety]] standards, [[international labour standards]], and other employment and labour laws and public policies.{{sfn|Befort|Budd|2009}} These institutional interventions are all seen as methods for balancing the employment relationship to generate not only economic efficiency but also employee equity and  voice.{{sfn|Budd|2004}} In contrast, the [[Marxism|Marxist]]-inspired critical camp sees employer–employee conflicts of interest as sharply antagonistic and deeply embedded in the socio-political-economic system. From this perspective, the pursuit of a balanced employment relationship gives too much weight to employers' interests, and instead deep-seated structural reforms are needed to change the sharply antagonistic employment relationship that is inherent within capitalism. Militant trade unions are thus frequently supported.

== History ==
Industrial relations has its roots in the [[industrial revolution]] which created the modern employment relationship by spawning free labour markets and large-scale industrial organizations with thousands of wage workers.{{sfn|Kaufman|2004|pp=15–16}} As society wrestled with these massive economic and social changes, labour problems arose. Low wages, long working hours, monotonous and dangerous work, and abusive supervisory practices led to high employee turnover, violent [[strike action|strikes]], and the threat of social instability. Intellectually, industrial relations was formed at the end of the 19th century as a middle ground between classical economics and [[Marxian economics|Marxism]],{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} with [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]]'s ''[[Industrial Democracy]]'' (1897) being a key intellectual work.{{sfn|Farnham|2008}} Industrial relations thus rejected the classical econ.

Institutionally, industrial relations was founded by [[John R. Commons]] when he created the first academic industrial relations program at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1920.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Another scholarly pioneer in industrial relations and labour research was [[Robert F. Hoxie]].{{sfn|Kuhn|Lewin|McNulty|1983|p=157}} Early financial support for the field came from [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] who supported progressive labour–management relations in the aftermath of the [[Ludlow Massacre|bloody strike at a Rockefeller-owned coal mine in Colorado]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In Britain, another progressive industrialist, [[Montague Burton]], endowed chairs in industrial relations at the universities of [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], [[Cardiff University|Cardiff]], and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1929–1930.{{sfn|Sigsworth|1990|p=124}}

Beginning in the early 1930s there was a rapid increase in membership of [[labor unions in the United States|trade unions in the United States]], and with that came frequent and sometimes violent labour–management conflict.{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|pp=61–62}} During the [[Second World War]] these were suppressed by the arbitration powers of the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|National War Labor Board]].{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|p=62}}

However, as the Second World War drew to a close and in anticipation of a renewal of labour–management conflict after the war, there was a wave of creations of new academic institutes and degree programs that sought to analyse such conflicts and the role of collective bargaining.{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|pp=61–67, 80–81}} The most known of these was the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]], founded in 1945.{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|p=63}}&lt;ref name="nyt-1947"/&gt;  But counting various forms, there were over seventy-five others.&lt;ref name="nyt-1947"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fine |first=Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin Fine |date=9 February 1947 |title=Growth and Variety of University Programs in Labor Studies Shown in a Survey |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1947/02/09/archives/growth-and-variety-of-university-programs-in-labor-studies-shown-in.html |url-access=subscription |newspaper=The New York Times |page=E9 |access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included the [[Yale Labor and Management Center]], directed by [[E. Wight Bakke]], which began in 1945.&lt;ref name="nyt-1946"&gt;{{cite news |last=Porter |first=Russell |date=15 July 1946 |title=Behavior Studied for Labor Peace |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1946/07/15/archives/behavior-studied-for-labor-peace-research-by-new-unit-at-yale-seeks.html |url-access=subscription |newspaper=The New York Times |page=23 |access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An influential industrial relations scholar in the 1940s and 1950s was [[Neil W. Chamberlain]] at [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] universities.{{sfn|Kuhn|Lewin|McNulty|1983}} 

In the 1950s, industrial relations was formalized as a distinct academic discipline with the emergence in the UK of the so-called "Oxford school", including {{ill|Allan Flanders|de}}, [[Hugh Clegg (industrial relations)|Hugh Clegg]],{{sfn|Ackers|Wilkinson|2005|p=446}} and [[Alan Fox (sociologist)|Alan Fox]], Lord [[William McCarthy, Baron McCarthy|William McCarthy]], Sir [[George Bain (academic)|George Bain]] (all of whom taught at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]]), as well as [[Otto Kahn-Freund]] ([[Brasenose College, Oxford]]).

Industrial relations was formed with a strong problem-solving orientation{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|p=187}} that rejected both the classical economists' ''[[laissez-faire]]'' solutions to labour problems and the Marxist solution of [[class revolution]]. It is this approach that underlies the [[New Deal]] legislation in the United States, such as the [[National Labor Relations Act]] and the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]].

By the early 21st century, the academic field of industrial relations was often described as being in crisis.{{sfnm |1a1=Ackers |1y=2002 |2a1=Kaufman |2y=2004 |3a1=Whalen |3y=2008}} In academia, its traditional positions are threatened on one side by the dominance of mainstream economics and organizational behaviour, and on the other by [[postmodernism]]. 

In policy-making circles, the industrial relations emphasis on institutional intervention is trumped by a neoliberal emphasis on the ''laissez-faire'' promotion of [[free market]]s. In practice, trade unions are declining and fewer companies have industrial relations functions.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The number of academic programs in industrial relations is therefore shrinking, while fields such as human resource management and organizational behaviour grow.{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|pp=189, 192}} The importance of this work, however, is stronger than ever, and the lessons of industrial relations remain vital. The challenge for industrial relations is to re-establish these connections with the broader academic, policy, and business worlds.

== Theoretical perspectives ==
Industrial relations scholars such as Alan Fox have described three major theoretical perspectives or frameworks, that contrast in their understanding and analysis of workplace relations. The three views are generally known as unitarism, pluralism, and the radical or critical school. Each offers a particular perception of workplace relations and will, therefore, interpret such events as workplace conflict, the role of unions and job regulation differently. The perspective of the critical school is sometimes referred to as the ''[[conflict theories|conflict]] model'', although this is somewhat ambiguous, as pluralism also tends to see conflict as inherent in workplaces. Radical theories are strongly identified with [[Marxist theory|Marxist theories]], although they are not limited to these.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Pluralist perspective ===
In pluralism, the organization is perceived as being made up of {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=powerful and}} divergent sub-groups, each with its own legitimate interests{{sfn|Calveley|Allsop|Rocha Lawton|Huesmann|2017|p=290}} and loyalties and with their own set of objectives and leaders. In particular, the two predominant sub-groups in the pluralist perspective are the management and trade unions. The pluralist perspective also supports that conflict is inherent in dealing with industrial relations since different sub-groups have different opinions in the day-to-day operations.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Consequently, the role of management would lean less towards enforcing and controlling and more toward persuasion and coordination.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Trade unions are deemed as legitimate representatives of employees,{{sfn|Calveley|Allsop|Rocha Lawton|Huesmann|2017|p=290}} conflict is dealt by collective bargaining and is viewed not necessarily as a bad thing and, if managed, could, in fact, be channeled towards evolution and positive change. It is the opposite of the unitary approach, there are different the group within the environment. Hence, the interest of employers and employee are divergent.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The employers want to maximize profit {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=at the expenses of employees}} and employees want to enjoy social benefits in the form of increased wages,{{sfn|Calveley|Allsop|Rocha Lawton|Huesmann|2017|p=290}} conducive environment. Therefore, conflict is inevitable and the need for the trade union to protect the interest of both parties. Also, there is dual authority/loyalty in this approach. Therefore, employees are loyal to the management as well as their labour leaders.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Unitarist perspective ===
In unitarism, the organization is perceived as an integrated and harmonious whole with the idea of "one happy family" in which management and other members of the staff all share a common purpose by emphasizing mutual co-operation.{{sfn|Zhang|2014|p=228}}&lt;!-- NOTE: This sentence appears to have been lifted by Zhang from Wikipedia rather than the other way around. --&gt; Furthermore, unitarism has a paternalistic approach: it demands loyalty of all employees{{sfn|Zhang|2014|p=228}} and is managerial in its emphasis and application.{{sfn|Barchiesi|2014|p=243}} Consequently, trade unions are deemed as unnecessary{{sfn|Budd|Bhave|2008|pp=92–93, 103}} since the loyalty between employees and organizations are considered mutually exclusive, and there cannot be two sides of industry.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Conflict is perceived as {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=destructive and}} the result of poor management.{{sfn|Budd|Bhave|2008|p=103}}

=== Radical or critical perspective ===
This view of industrial relations looks at the nature of the capitalist society, where there is a fundamental division of interest between capital and labour, and sees workplace relations against this background. This perspective sees inequalities of power and economic wealth as having their roots in the nature of the capitalist economic system.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Conflict is therefore seen as a natural outcome of capitalism, thus it is inevitable and trade unions are a natural response of workers{{sfn|Zhang|2014|p=228}} to their exploitation by capital. Whilst there may be periods of acquiescence, the Marxist view would be that institutions of joint regulation would enhance rather than limit management's position as they presume the continuation of capitalism rather than challenge it.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The '''International Building Code''' ('''IBC''') is a [[model building code]] developed by the [[International Code Council]] (ICC). It has been adopted for use as a base code standard by most jurisdictions in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floridabuilding.org/fbc/q-a/florida_building_code_q-a.doc|title=Florida Building Code Q&amp;A|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=Oct 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iccsafe.org/wp-content/uploads/stateadoptions.pdf|title=International Codes – Adoption by State (October 2016)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be used in [[Abu Dhabi]], the [[Caribbean Community]], [[Colombia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Honduras]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The IBC addresses both health and safety concerns for buildings based upon prescriptive and performance related requirements. The IBC is fully compatible with all other published ICC codes. The code provisions are intended to protect public health and safety while avoiding both unnecessary costs and preferential treatment of specific materials or methods of construction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://codes.iccsafe.org/app/book/content/2015%20San%20Antonio/2015%20IBC%20HTML/Preface.html|title=2015 International Building Code|last=|first=|date=|website=codes.iccsafe.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the early twentieth century, the system of building regulations in the [[United States]] has been based on model [[building code]]s developed by three ''regional'' model code groups. The codes developed by the Building Officials Code Administrators International (BOCA) were used on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and throughout the [[Midwest]] of the United States. The codes from the Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI) were used in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]]. The codes published by the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) were used primarily throughout the West Coast and across a large swath of the middle of the country to most of the Midwest.

Although regional code development had been effective and responsive to the regulatory needs of local U.S. [[jurisdictions]], by the early 1990s it had become obvious that the country needed a single coordinated set of national model building codes.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Therefore, the nation’s three model code groups decided to combine their efforts, and in 1994 formed the [[International Code Council]] (ICC) to develop codes that would have no regional limitations.

After three years of extensive research and development, the first edition of the International Building Code was published in 1997. A new code edition has since been '''released every three years''' thereafter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The code was patterned on three legacy codes previously developed by the organizations that constitute ICC. By the year 2000, ICC had completed the International Codes series and ceased development of the legacy codes in favor of their national successor. The word "International" in the names of the ICC and all three of its predecessors, as well as the IBC and other ICC products, despite all 18 of the company's board members being residents of The U.S. reflects the fact that a number of other countries in the Caribbean and Latin America had already begun to rely on model building codes developed in the United States rather than developing their own from scratch.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Thus, ICC from its inception was well aware that it was writing model codes for an international audience. 

===Legacy codes===
* ''BOCA National Building Code (BOCA/NBC)'' by the Building Officials Code Administrators International (BOCA)
* [[Uniform Building Code|''Uniform Building Code (UBC)'']] by the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO)
* ''Standard Building Code (SBC)'' by the Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI)

===Competing codes and final adoption===
The [[National Fire Protection Association]], initially joined ICC in a collective effort to develop the International Fire Code (IFC). This effort however fell apart at the completion of the first draft of the document. Subsequent efforts by ICC and NFPA to reach agreement on this and other documents were unsuccessful, resulting in a series of disputes between the two organizations. After several failed attempts to find common ground with the ICC, NFPA withdrew from participation in development of the International Codes and joined with the [[International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials]] (IAPMO), the [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]] (ASHRAE) and the [[Western Fire Chiefs Association]] to create an alternative set of codes. First published in 2002, the code set named the '''Comprehensive Consensus Codes''', or '''C3''', includes the ''[[NFPA 5000]]'' building code as its centerpiece and several companion codes such as the [[National Electrical Code]], [[NFPA 101]] Life Safety Code, [[Uniform Plumbing Code]], [[Uniform Mechanical Code]], and [[NFPA 1]]. Unlike the IBC, the NFPA 5000 conformed to [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]-established policies and procedures for the development of voluntary consensus standards.

The NFPA's move to introduce a competing building standard received strong opposition from powerful trade groups such as the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA), [[BOMA International]] and the [[National Association of Home Builders]] (NAHB). After several unsuccessful attempts to encourage peaceful cooperation between NFPA and ICC and resolution of their disputes over code development, a number of organizations, including [[American Institute of Architects|AIA]], [[BOMA International|BOMA]] and two dozen commercial real estate associations, founded the ''Get It Together'' coalition, which repeatedly urged NFPA to abandon code development related to NFPA 5000 and to work with ICC to integrate the other NFPA codes and standards into the ICC family of codes.

Initially, under Governor [[Gray Davis]], [[California]] had adopted the NFPA 5000 codes as a baseline for the future California Building Code, but in 2003, [[California gubernatorial recall election|Davis was recalled from office]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was elected to replace him. Upon taking office, Schwarzenegger rescinded Davis's directive, and the state adopted the IBC instead.  Adopting NFPA 5000 would have caused a disparity between California and the majority of other states which had adopted the IBC. With IBC's adoption, the legacy ICBO had started in California and which was headquartered in Whittier, California, continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=LeClaire |date=April 24, 2005 |title=Builders win latest tiff over building codes |work=Sacramento Business Journal |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2005/04/25/focus5.html?page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A large portion of the International Building Code deals with [[fire prevention]].  It differs from the related [[International Fire Code]] in that the IBC addresses fire prevention in regard to ''construction and design'' and the fire code addresses fire prevention in regard to the operation of a completed and occupied building.  For example, the building code sets criteria for the number, size and location of exits in the design of a building while the fire code requires the exits of a completed and occupied building to be unblocked.  The building code also deals with access for the disabled and structural stability (including [[earthquakes]]).  The International Building Code applies to all structures in areas where it is adopted, except for one and two family dwellings (see [[International Residential Code]]).

Parts of the code reference other codes including the [[International Plumbing Code]], the [[International Mechanical Code]], the [[National Electric Code]], and various [[National Fire Protection Association]] standards.  Therefore, if a municipality adopts the International Building Code, it also adopts those parts of other codes referenced by the IBC.  Often, the plumbing, mechanical, and electric codes are adopted along with the building code.

The code book itself (2000 edition) totals over 700 pages and chapters include:
* [[Building occupancy classifications]]
* Building heights and areas
* Interior finishes
* Foundation, wall, and roof construction
* Fire protection systems (sprinkler system requirements and design)
* Materials used in construction
* Elevators and escalators
* Already existing structures
* Means of egress (see below)

Use of the term '''International''': "Calling it 'international' keeps it from being called the 'U.S. Building Code.' explains Bill Tangye, SBCCI Chief Executive Officer. "Some U.S. Model codes are already used outside the United States. Bermuda uses BOCA, and Western Somoa uses ICBO."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=August 15, 2001 |title=The Architect's Handbook of Professional Practice |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780471419693 |edition=13th |url=http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/aia/documents/pdf/aiab089219.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means of egress==
The phrase "means of egress" refers to the ability to exit the structure, primarily in the event of an emergency, such as a fire.  Specifically, a means of egress is broken into three parts:  the path of travel to an exit, the exit itself, and the exit discharge (the path to a safe area outside).  The code also address the number of exits required for a structure based on its intended occupancy use and the number of people who could be in the place at one time as well as their relative locations.  It also deals with special needs, such as hospitals, nursing homes, and prisons where evacuating people may have special requirements.  In some instances, requirements are made based on possible hazards (such as in industries) where flammable or toxic chemicals will be in use.

==Accessibility==
"Accessibility" refers to the accommodation of physically challenged people in structures.  This includes maneuvering from public transportation, building entry, parking spaces, elevators, and restrooms.  This term replaces the term "handicapped" (handicapped parking, handicapped restroom) which is generally found to be derogatory.

Accessibility can include [[domotics]] rules.

==Existing structures==
Building code requirements generally apply to the construction of new buildings and alterations or additions to existing buildings, changes in the use of buildings, and the demolition of buildings or portions of buildings at the ends of their useful or economic lives.  As such, building codes obtain their effect from the voluntary decisions of property owners to erect, alter, add to, or demolish a building in a jurisdiction where a building code applies, because these circumstances routinely require a permit. The plans are subject to review for compliance with current building codes as part of the permit application process. Generally, building codes are not otherwise retroactive except to correct an imminent hazard. However, accessibility standards – similar to those referenced in the model building codes – may be retroactive subject to the applicability of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) which is a federal civil rights requirement.

Alterations and additions to an existing building must usually comply with all new requirements applicable to their scope as related to the intended use of the building as defined by the adopted code (e.g., Section 101.2 Scope, International Building Code, any version). Some changes in the use of a building often expose the entire building to the requirement to comply fully with provisions of the code applicable to the new use because the applicability of the code is use-specific. A change in use usually changes the applicability of code requirements and as such, will subject the building to review for compliance with the currently applicable codes (refer to Section 3408, Change of Occupancy, International Building Code – 2009).

Existing buildings are not exempt from new requirements, with the IBC publishing a Building Code for existing buildings. Existing Building Codes are intended to provide alternative approaches to repair, alteration, and additions to existing buildings. At minimum, this ensures that any new construction maintains the current level of compliance or are improved to meet basic safety levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://codes.iccsafe.org/app/book/content/2015%20San%20Antonio/2015%20IEBC%20HTML/EFFECTIVE%20USE%20OF%20THE%20INTERNATIONAL.html|title=2015 International Existing Building Code|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although such remedial enactments address existing conditions, they do not violate the United States Constitution's ban on the adoption of [[ex post facto law]], as they do not criminalize or seek to punish past conduct.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}  Such requirements merely prohibit the maintenance or continuance of conditions that would prove injurious to a member of the public or the broader public interest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Many jurisdictions have found the application of new requirements to old, particularly historic buildings, challenging.  New Jersey, for example, has adopted specific state amendments (see [http://www.state.nj.us/dca/codes/rehab/ New Jersey's Rehabilitation Subcode])to provide a means of code compliance to existing structures without forcing the owner to comply with rigid requirements of the currently adopted Building Codes where it may be technically infeasible to do so.  California has also enacted a specific historic building code (see [http://www.dsa.dgs.ca.gov/StateHistoricalBuildingSafetyBoard/2001chbc.htm 2001 California Historic Building Code]).  Other states{{Which|date=March 2010}} require compliance with building and fire codes, subject to reservations, limitations, or jurisdictional discretion to protect historic building stock as a condition of nominating or listing a building for preservation or landmark status, especially where such status attracts tax credits, investment of public money, or other incentives.

The listing of a building on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] does not exempt it from compliance with state or local building code requirements.  {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Updating cycle==
Updated editions of the IBC are published on a three-year cycle (2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, 2021…). This fixed schedule has led other organizations, which produce referenced standards, to align their publishing schedule with that of the IBC, such as the NEC and California Building Code (2005, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2017...). {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Referenced standards==
Model building codes rely heavily on referenced standards as published and promulgated by other standards organizations such as [[ASTM International|ASTM]] (ASTM International), [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] (American National Standards Institute), and NFPA (National Fire Protection Association). The structural provisions rely heavily on referenced standards, such as the Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Structures published by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE-7) and the Specification for Structural Steel Buildings by the [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] (ANSI/AISC 360).

Changes in parts of the reference standard can result in disconnection between the corresponding editions of the reference standards.

==Copyright controversy==
Many states or municipalities in the United States of America adopt the ICC family of codes.

In the wake of the Federal copyright case ''[[Veeck v. Southern Building Code Congress Int'l]], Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/293_F3d_791.htm#foreign ''293 F.3d 791 (5th Cir. 2002''])&lt;/ref&gt; the organization [[Public.Resource.Org|Public Resource]] has published a substantial portion of the enacted building codes on-line, and they are available as [[PDF]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulk.resource.org/codes.gov/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015074713/http://bulk.resource.org/codes.gov/ |archivedate=2008-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Baptiste August Kessler''' (15 December 1853 – 14 December 1900) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] entrepreneur and oil explorer who was largely responsible for the growth and development of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., now known as [[Royal Dutch Shell]].

==Early life and career==

Kessler, who was known by his middle name August, was born in a family of 12 children, four of whom died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Clercq|2010|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became managing director of the Royal Dutch nearly from its inception. [[Aeilko Jans Zijlker]] acquired the original oil concession in Indonesia and the "Royal" imprimatur but died suddenly of a tropical disease in 1890. The board of directors turned to Kessler, who was a son-in-law of Geldolph Adriaan De Lange, one of the directors, to head a committee of inquiry into whether the faltering enterprise was still viable. He took the post with the understanding he would be made managing director and run the company. Kessler had vast experience in the Dutch East Indies, having abandoned his studies at the [[Delft University]] at the age of 23 to seek his fortune there. He had become partner in Tiedeman &amp; Van Kerchem, an important business firm, but after financial difficulties in 1888 "returned broken and shattered in health to Europe, where he sought and found recovery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerretson|1953|p=127, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Builder of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company==

Kessler literally built the Royal Dutch almost from scratch, under very difficult circumstances: "an inclement climate, a hostile jungle and ineradicable lalang (sharp, tough grass), local crews difficult to manage, equipment that did not fit, tropical diseases, operational set-backs such as fires, and absence of adequate geological know-how", wrote J. Ph. Poley in ''Eroica: The Quest for Oil in Indonesia (1850-1898)''. "There were also financial, regulatory and procedual hurdles to overcome...The Company survived mainly thanks to the turn-around effected by Jean Baptiste August Kessler."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Poley|2000|p=93.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Anthony Sampson put it, the company's origins belonged "to the world of [[Joseph Conrad]] rather than [[Anthony Trollope]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sampson|1975|p=46.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kessler arrived in [[Sumatra]] in October 1891, after a two-month sea voyage, he found that the works manager had disappeared in a huff. He discovered that the drilling site was in terrible shape, with essential supplies disappearing or strewn about in the constantly approaching jungle. But he plunged into his work with enormous energy. Due to his ability to quickly solve all kinds of technical problems and his incredible energy, he was accepted by his subordinates as "Toean Besor"—the Big Boss—not withstanding what many would describe as a difficult, high-strung personality.

[[Daniel Yergin]], in his history of oil [[The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power]] wrote that "more than any other man", Kessler was responsible for the survival of the Royal Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yergin|1991|p=103.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that "Kessler was a born leader, with an iron will, and with the ability to concentrate all his own energy and that of those around him on a single objective."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yergin|1991|p=58.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quoting from Kessler's letters to his wife, Yergin illustrates the obstacles faced by the daring oil explorer: "Half-heartedness, ignorance, indifference, dilapidation, disorder, and vexation are everywhere apparent," Kessler reported. "If things go wrong, my job and my name are gone and perhaps my sacrifices and my extraordinary exertions will be repaid with censure in the bargain. Heaven preserve me from all that misery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yergin|1991|pp=74–75.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In constant rain, Kessler attempted to connect the drilling site and refinery with a pipeline. Steamkettles were transported through a jungle path on rails, which were removed after the kettles had been pulled up in order to be used for the next stretch. A storm interrupted the supply of rice, resulting in severe food shortages. The drilling produced barely any oil.

Kessler, suffering from a fever, worked day and night and was everywhere with improvisations, giving instructions and managing the overall operation. With the greatest difficulty, Kessler and his team were able to get the supplies for a second tower. This one was a "spouter" and on Feb. 28, 1892, the first oil flowed through the new pipe to the refinery. The Dutch flag was raised.

Kessler returned to the Netherlands, nearly nine months after his "inspection trip" began, and focused on trying to secure the necessary capital for the still shaky enterprise. But within two years, oil production had dramatically declined, the new on-site works manager had quit and the company was nearly bankrupt. Kessler again returned to Sumatra to save the infant company. With a small group of workers--"I demand the nearly impossible but there is no choice; everything rests on my shoulders"—Kessler again managed to turn things around and tripled oil production within a year. He stayed in Indonesia until 1895, before returning to the Netherlands to focus on the commercial end of the business.

Under Kessler, the company relaunched its principal product under the brand name "Crown Oil," expanded refining capacity, built a fleet of tankers and constructed several tank farms. In 1897, Royal Dutch increased its capital to 5 million guilders (in 1890, the nominal capital had been 1.3 million guilders) and paid a dividend of 52 percent.  He also started nascent joint venture talks with [[Marcus Samuel, 1st Viscount Bearsted|Marcus Samuel]], an important trader in oil products based in London under the "Shell" name, but a merger did not take place until 1907, with Royal Dutch taking a dominant role by owning 60 percent of the new holding company. Even mighty [[Standard Oil]] began to get concerned about the new rival in the business.

Dr. F.C. Gerretson, in his four-volume ''History of the Royal Dutch'', heaped praise on Kessler, describing his leadership as necessary for the building of one of the world's major companies: "He was high-strung and passionate, forceful and impervious, a man of strong prepossessions and often difficult to get along with. He was a born leader of men. Few knew so well how to concentrate all available resources upon a single purpose; how to inspire their fellow workers with their own enthusiasm and energy. Few were capable of such absolute devotion to the task once it has been undertaken".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerretson|1953|pp=127–128, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another book, Joost Jonker's and Jan Luiten van Zanden's ''A History of Royal Dutch Shell'', lauds Kessler's "unbelievable capacity for hard work...Kessler's sometimes strained behavior emanated from the inner tension between his formal training as a gentleman and his leadership drive, from the necessity to sustain polite discussion whilst craving to go into action". Kessler was a novice at oil and did not have much technical training, but "quickly developed a remarkable, intuitive grasp of the industry in all its aspects, founded on his keen sense for figures".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=29, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unexpected death==

The hard work amid difficult surroundings led to Kessler's death one day shy of his 47th birthday. In 1898, oil production in the overworked oil field dropped precipitously. Kessler managed to get a concession for a new oil field from the local Sumatran king and in 1900 he went back to Dutch East Indies one last time. When he arrived he was sick and after only a few days he telegraphed the head office in The Hague that he needed to recuperate and would take the next boat back. He died from a heart attack when his ship made port in Naples, the first stop after the Suez Canal.

Kessler, according to Jonker and van Zanten, was "really Royal Dutch's founding father, the man who created the business and sustained it against the odds, perhaps even against economic common sense. His absolute firmness of purpose had built solid foundations" before his untimely death from exhaustion in the effort to create the nascent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=54, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerretson summed up: "It was Kessler's audacity, Kessler's faith, and Kessler's indomitable pertinacity in the hour of trial which brought the Company to where it stood when it lost him".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerretson|1953|p=172, Vol. 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

After his death, he was succeeded by a man he had hired as his deputy, [[Henri Deterding]], in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutch Biographical Dictionary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deterding would later declare, "As a pioneer in oil, the part played by J.B. August Kessler stands second to none."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1938|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

August and his wife Margo had four sons and two daughters. One of their sons, [[Jean Baptiste August "Guus" Kessler Jr.]], eventually became director-general of Royal Dutch Shell after Deterding resigned in 1936; he also played tennis for the Netherlands in the [[1906 Olympics]] in Athens. Their oldest son, [[Geldolph Adriaan Kessler]], also worked for the Royal Dutch before he left to help form and run the [[Koninklijke Hoogovens|Hoogovens]], the Dutch steel company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=357, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolf Kessler and his brother [[Boelie Kessler]] played football for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national side]].

'''Joseph E. Grosberg'''  (December 27, 1883 – July 25, 1970) was a pioneer in the American [[supermarket]] and [[wholesale]] foods industries. He was a founder and the president of Central Markets,  a chain of grocery stores in [[upstate New York]] that established some of the first supermarkets in the United States, and is now known as [[Price Chopper Supermarkets|Price Chopper]]. He was also a noted philanthropist, especially known for his support of [[Jewish]] causes as well as charitable activities in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] and the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Joseph E. Grosberg and delivery truck.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph E. Grosberg (left) with business partner Sam Cramer standing on "Grosberg Grocery Co., Inc. Wholesale Grocers, Amsterdam, NY." delivery truck]]

===Early life===
Grosberg was born in 1883 in [[Russia]]. His father, Jacob Grosberg, immigrated to the United States through [[Germany]] to avoid being drafted into the [[Russian Army]] and in doing so, changed his surname from Gans to the more-German-sounding Grosberg. After Jacob established himself in the US, he sent a cabin class ticket for his wife (and presumably his oldest child, Joseph) to join him, but as was common those days when women traveled without a male accompanying them, Anna was put into the lower-class steerage section on the ship and her cabin class accommodations given to someone else. Jacob Grosberg later hired an attorney to write a letter to the shipping company complaining about the injustice, and the cost of his wife's passage was eventually reimbursed to him.

The oldest of eight children, Joseph sold newspapers on a street corner as a young boy to help support his family. Grosberg started in the grocery business in 1903 when he and his father, Jacob Grosberg, opened a retail grocery store, J. Grosberg &amp; Son. A year later, the younger Grosberg entered the wholesale business, bringing wholesale groceries to the [[Schenectady, New York]] area.

===Central Markets===
In 1930, Joseph Grosberg merged his wholesale business with that of Lewis Golub.&lt;ref name="combine"&gt;
[http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%208/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201930%20Grayscale/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201930%20Grayscale%20-%200903.pdf "Wholesale Grocery Houses of Grosberg and Golub Combine"], ''[[The Daily Gazette|Schenectady Gazette]]'', February 12, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he maintained the Grosberg Grocery Company of Amsterdam and headed Municipal Grocery Stores, Inc., a cooperative organization of independent grocers &lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Amsterdam%20NY%20Daily%20Democrat%20and%20Recorder/Amsterdam%20NY%20Daily%20Democrat%20and%20Recorder%201930%20Feb-1931%20May%20Grayscale/Amsterdam%20NY%20Daily%20Democrat%20and%20Recorder%201930%20Feb-1931%20May%20Grayscale%20-%200383.pdf "Municipal Grocery Stores Is Organized In Amsterdam"], ''Amsterdam Evening Recorder'', March 20, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; operating more than 400 stores throughout the New York state.

The Grosberg-Golub wholesale grocers opened their first [[supermarket]] in 1932 in [[Green Island, New York]]. It was one of the first self-service supermarkets in the country and its emphasis on low prices was very successful in the Depression-era economy. The following year Grosberg-Golub opened a second store: the first supermarket in Schenectady. With the opening of their third store, they changed the name to Central Market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-157449260.html "Price Chopper Continues to Market Itself"], ''[[Albany Times-Union]]'', March 5, 2000 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually the chain of Central Markets stores in New York included three large supermarkets in [[Schenectady]], two in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], and one each in [[Glens Falls]], [[Saratoga Springs]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Mechanicville]], [[Green Island, New York|Green Island]], and [[Watervliet, New York|Watervliet]]. In addition, the concern operated the DeForest Department Store in [[Cohoes, New York]] and the Clark Department Store in [[Ballston Spa, New York]]. The policy of his supermarkets according to Grosberg was to provide food to the public at the lowest possible cost. This was accomplished through low overhead in the operation of the big supermarket and the company's tremendous buying power.

In addition to heading the Grosberg-Golub corporation, Grosberg was an officer in several national super market organizations including the New York Wholesale Grocers Association, president of the Seaboard Food Corporation, a national wholesale buying organization, and national secretary of the Super Market Institute.

Grosberg retired from the grocery business in 1943.&lt;ref name="retires"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19431023&amp;id=H4ouAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GYYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=973,5322144 "Grosberg, Executive of Grocery Firm Retires"], ''Schenectady Gazette'', Oct 23, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bernard and William Golub, the sons of his original partner Lewis Golub and partners in the Grosberg-Golub Corporation, bought Grosberg's share of the company and formed the Golub Corporation. In 1973, the Golubs changed the name of Central Markets to [[Price Chopper Supermarkets|Price Chopper]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Wechsler, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-171104314.html "A Family Affair; As Price Chopper turns 75, the Golub clan celebrates four generations of success."] ''[[Albany Times-Union]]'', November 11, 2007 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy and civic activities===
Grosberg was active in numerous civic affairs in the Schenectady area. He was one of the founders of Schenectady's first [[Zionist]] organization in 1903. He was a charter member and served as president of the Schenectady [[Kiwanis club]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%208/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201940%20Grayscale/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201940%20Grayscale%20-%200464.pdf "City club marks founding of Kiwanis International], ''Schenectady Gazette'', January 25, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a 32nd degree [[Free mason|Mason]], a member of the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Club]], and was involved in the Schenectady [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]], an organization first established in 1923 to coordinate the work and funding of charity and social-service organizations.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

Grosberg was also active in [[Jewish]] affairs and an advocate for [[Israel]]. He was one of the founders of the [[Young Men's Hebrew Association]] (YMHA) in Schenectady in 1916, which went on to become the Schenectady [[Jewish Community Center]] (JCC). He devoted over 47 years of service to the YMHA and JCC, serving as president from 1916-1930 and also serving as Chairman of the Board of Trustees. He eventually donated the Joseph E. Grosberg Building to the Schenectady Jewish Community Center for their use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LkUhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3n4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=672,632781&amp;dq=joseph-e-grosberg&amp;hl=en "Joseph E. Grosberg Releases Deed to Jewish Community Center"], ''Schenectady Gazette'', November 5, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was chairman of the [[United Jewish Appeal]] (aka Jewish National Appeal) which were held shortly before the outbreak of WWII in Europe to aid Jews who were being oppressed and driven from their homes by Hitler. He was the regional chairman of the United Synagogues of America, President of the United Hebrew Committee, and President of the Agudat Achim (then referred to as Nott Terrace) Synagogue in Schenectady.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2422">A '''labor market area''' is a geographic area or region defined for purposes of compiling, reporting, and evaluating [[employment]], [[unemployment]], [[workforce]] availability, and related topics. It can be defined as an economically integrated region within which residents can find jobs within a reasonable commuting distance or can change their employment without changing their place of residence.&lt;ref name=LMAsBLS2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/lau/lmadir.pdf |title=Labor Market Areas, 2013 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=March 2013 |page=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Commuting]] flows are a primary consideration in defining and delineating labor market areas. The extent to which workers are willing and able to commute between two places indicates the degree of economic integration between those places.&lt;ref name=SmallCriteriaBLS2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/lau/lmadir.pdf |title=Appendix II. Criteria for Designating Small Labor Market Areas |work=Labor Market Areas, 2013 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=March 2013 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS) maintains standard definitions of labor market areas for the purpose of standardization and to promote comparability of the labor force information used by various government programs. Definitions are updated annually, and the entire system of definitions is reevaluated once each decade based on decennial census data.&lt;ref name=LMAsBLS2013/&gt; BLS uses [[metropolitan statistical area|metropolitan]] and [[micropolitan statistical area]]s, including metropolitan divisions, as its principal basis for defining labor market areas. In [[New England]], labor market area definitions are based on [[New England city and town area]]s rather than the [[county (United States)|county]]-based [[statistical area (United States)|statistical areas]] used in other parts of the country. For geographic areas outside of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, the BLS identifies labor market areas based primarily on commuting data, with a requirement that all components of a labor market area be contiguous.&lt;ref name=SmallCriteriaBLS2013/&gt;

'''Lee Byung-chul''' (12 February 1910 &amp;ndash; 19 November 1987) was the founder of the [[Samsung|Samsung Group]] and one of South Korea's most successful [[Businessperson|businessmen]]. With the breakup of the [[Hyundai]] [[chaebol]], Samsung is now South Korea's largest business group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/7223/hail-father-business-lee-byung-chul|title=Hail the Father of Business, Lee Byung-chul|last=Jung-hyun|first=Bang|date=11 February 2010|website=Korea IT Times|access-date=5 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515094230/http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/7223/hail-father-business-lee-byung-chul|archivedate=15 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Byung-chul was the son of a wealthy landowning family (a branch of the [[Lee (Korean name)#Gyeongju clan|Gyeongju Lee]] clan). He attended college at [[Waseda University]] in [[Tokyo]] but did not complete his degree.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

==Career==

=== Beginning ===
Byung-chul established a trucking business in [[Daegu]] on 1 March 1938, which he named Samsung Trading Co, the forerunner to Samsung.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woo|first1=Jaeyeon|title=Memorializing the Company Founder, With Ads, 3-D and Holograms|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2011/07/22/memorializing-the-company-founder-with-ads-3-d-and-holograms/|website=WSJ|language=English|date=22 July 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084636/http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2011/07/22/memorializing-the-company-founder-with-ads-3-d-and-holograms/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung means "Three Stars" which explains the initial corporate logos.

By 1945 Samsung was transporting goods throughout Korea and to other countries. The company was based in Seoul by 1947. It was one of the ten largest "trading companies" when the [[Korean War]] started in 1950.&lt;ref name="watkins"&gt;Watkins, Thaer, "The Chaebol of South Korea", Website, downloaded July 22, 2011, [http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/chaebol.htm#SAMSUNG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827070846/http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/chaebol.htm|date=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the conquest of Seoul by the North Korean army, Lee was forced to relocate his business to [[Busan]]. The massive influx of U.S. troops and equipment into Busan over the next year and a half of the war proved to be highly beneficial to Lee's trucking company.&lt;ref name="watkins" /&gt;

[[File:Lee Byung-chul.jpg|thumb|right|Lee in 1950]]

In 1961 when [[Park Chung-hee|General Park]] seized [[May Coup (South Korea)|power]], Lee was in Japan and for some time he did not return to South Korea. Eventually, a deal was struck and Lee returned but Samsung had to give up control over the banks it acquired and follow economic directives from Park's government.&lt;ref name="watkins" /&gt;

=== Federation of Korean Industries ===
The first step of the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) was established in August 1961. The association was founded by Samsung Group Chairman Lee Byung-chul. He was a noble leader to every employee that walked through the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=2837041&amp;cid=50867&amp;categoryId=50867|title=the Federation of Korean Industries by Naver|last=|first=|date=|website=Naver|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, Byung-chul served as chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries and was known as the richest man in Korea.&lt;ref name="KTimes2"&gt;"Samsung's development in chronological order"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Korean art collection ==
After his death, Byung-chul's estate (Ho-Am) was opened to the public for tours. His collection of [[Korean art]] is considered one of the largest private collections in the country and it features a number of art objects that have been designated "National Treasures" by the Korean government.&lt;ref name="Everland"&gt;[http://hoam.samsungfoundation.org/eng/info/main.html Ho Am Art Museum, "Official Web Site"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821021933/http://hoam.samsungfoundation.org/eng/info/main.html |date=2011-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho-Am is located a short distance from the [[Everland]] park, South Korea's most popular amusement park (Everland is also owned by the Samsung Group).

A '''[[mental health]] counselor''' ('''MHC'''), or '''counselor,''' is a person who works with individuals and groups to promote optimum mental and emotional health. They may help individuals deal with issues associated with addictions and substance abuse; family, parenting, and marital problems; stress management; self-esteem; and aging.  This title excludes "Social Workers", "Psychiatrists", and "Psychologists".&lt;ref name="Occupational Employment Statistics"&gt;{{cite web |date=1 April 2014 |title=21-1014 Mental Health Counselors |website=Occupational Employment Statistics |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes211014.htm |accessdate=18 November 2014 |dead-url=no |archive-date=31 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031091615/http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes211014.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duties==
The legal definition of a counselor, and hence the legal scope of practice, varies with jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions across the United States, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and psychologists have virtually identical definitions: evaluating and treating mental and behavioral disorders.&lt;ref&gt;http://unlicensed-practitioner.com/whats-difference-counselor-psychologist/&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of such definitions, many mental health professionals reject the [[medical model]] (which assumes that clients are "disordered") in favor of broader viewpoints, such as those that emerged from [[systems psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academyanalyticarts.org/LEAP.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203044410/http://academyanalyticarts.org/LEAP.htm |archivedate=2015-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service users==
MHCs work with [[Human|individuals]], couples, families, and [[group therapy|groups]] to address and treat emotional and [[mental disorder]]s and to promote mental health. Most mental health counselors in the U.S. work in outpatient and residential care centers, individual and family services, and local governments.&lt;ref name="Occupational Employment Statistics"/&gt; They are trained in a variety of [[therapy|therapeutic]] techniques used to address issues, including [[Depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and [[substance abuse]], [[Suicide|suicidal impulses]], [[stress (biological)|stress]], problems with [[self-esteem]], and [[grief]]. They also help with job and [[career]] concerns, [[education]]al decisions, issues related to mental and emotional health, and family, [[parenting]], [[marriage|marital]], or other [[interpersonal relationship|relationship]] problems. MHCs also continue to play a growing role in the [[military]] mental health crisis, helping military personnel and their families deal with issues such as [[PTSD]].&lt;ref name="Mental Health Counselor Career Facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health Counselor Career Facts|url=http://online.antioch.edu/ma-clinical-mental-health-counseling/careers|publisher=Antioch University|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; MHCs often work closely with other mental health specialists, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, [[psychiatric nurses]], and [[school counselors]].  Many mental health counselors look to help their clients have a concise whole body treatment plan that addresses all the needs of the client. In the United States, MHCs diagnose as well as treat mental illness,&lt;ref name=bls&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos067.htm Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition], [[United States Bureau of Labor Statistics]]&lt;/ref&gt; though the scope of practice for mental health practitioners varies from state to state.&lt;ref name=therapistnyc&gt;http://www.therapistnyc.us/2012/06/01/nyc-therapist-news-reviewing-psychotherapy-licensure-laws-york/ {{dead link|date=October 2017|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==

===United States===
Licensing requirements can vary depending on which state a mental health counselor practices in. Across the United States, mental health counseling licensure is required to independently practice, but can be practiced without a license if under close supervision of a licensed practitioner. Licensing titles for mental health counselors vary from state to state: Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor (LPCC), and various forms of these titles may list differently per state statues. The title "Mental Health Counselor" (or variation thereof) is often a protected title and thus it may be a violation of state law for persons to hold themselves as such without a proper credential.

A licensed mental health counselor holds a minimum of a master's degree in counseling or another closely related field in mental health care. After obtaining a master's degree, mental health counselors complete two to three years (depending on various state statutes) of clinical work under the supervision of a licensed or certified mental health professional. The qualifications for licensure are similar to those for marriage and family therapists and for clinical social workers.&lt;ref name="Facts About Clinical Mental Health Counselors"&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts About Clinical Mental Health Counselors |url=http://www.amhca.org/about/facts.aspx |publisher=American Mental Health Counselors Association |access-date=18 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103224537/http://www.amhca.org/about/facts.aspx |archive-date=2014-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming a counselor and using it in daily life to help others to learn more about themselves is not a reason for someone to pursue a degree within this field. Ethics within this profession require the counselor to remain professional to be able to adequately treat patients. Remaining detached as the witness to a client's thought, feelings, and emotions can be a hard thing to do, but will ultimately reassure a patient that there are no judgement to what they will share.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics in Psychology and the Mental Health Professions: Standards and Cases''&lt;/ref&gt; Guiding a patient to understand themselves and their choices is also another aspect of this profession.

Fadil – ANOR &amp; INMPI; retrieved 3/23/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family and background ==
M. Fadil's biological parents are both from the North Region of Cameroon, birthplace of Cameroon's first President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]. His father, El Hadj Fadil Abdoulaye Hassoumi (1924–1993), and mother, Adja Ahoua Doudou are members of the [http://www.webpulaaku.net Fulani (Fulbe)], a dynamic tribe whose main economic activities are based on livestock and trade.  In 1999, Mohamadou Bayero Fadil married [[Fatima Gumsu Abacha]] from Nigeria. She is the daughter of the former Nigerian president, [[Sani Abacha]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saniabacha.com Website – Nigerian President Abacha; accessed 3/23/2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple has been blessed with five children: three boys and two girls. Having an exceptionally creative mind, M. Fadil's father, as founder of Group Fadil, judiciously exploited the strategic, economic and commercial potentials of Cameroon Chemical Complex (CCC), the backbone of the Group Fadil's chain of companies. When he left the company in 1993, he bequeathed an immeasurably vast legacy to Mohamadou Bayero Fadil, who kept the CCC flame burning.

== Academic profile ==
M. Fadil has a sound academic background thanks to the rigour of reputable American schools and universities. His managerial prowess is eloquent testimony of training received there. A computer enthusiast, he graduated from Bates Collège In Lewiston Maine, and the [[Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn]] in New York City and attended Georgetown University, In Washington DC.
In 1984, though he was being solicited by top U.S companies including [[IBM]], NT &amp; T and [[American Express]], he set his preferences at returning to Cameroon and contributing to its economic development.

== Company track record ==
M. Fadil held responsible posts at Complex Chemique Camerounais (CCC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starwoodhotels.com/lemeridien/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1804 Hotel Le Meridien]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Douala]], and at Selcam, a salt producing unit, prior to his appointment as Director General of CCC. While he was in that position, Group Fadil experienced considerable growth, with increased diversification of products, redeployment of personnel, and modernisation of its product manufacturing processes.

When promoted to head Group Fadil in 1994, M. Fadil created new filial sub-division entities, each with independent activities:
*SOGEDEL (cattle) 
*CAIC (agriculture)
*SIFI (estates)
*SELCAM (salt)
*SNC Cocotiers
*LAGOON BLUE (tourism and hotels)
*TIKO SOAP (soap) 
In addition, he established Equatorial Media Group (EMG), publisher of ''Dikalo'', a news journal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journaldikalo.info/ DIKALO]&lt;/ref&gt; and operator of Camnews24 television&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camnews24.net/fr/ CAMNEWS24 television]&lt;/ref&gt; and Hit Radio Camronais&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitfmradio.net/ HitFmRadio].&lt;/ref&gt;

The land assets of the CCC doubled in 2008, making it the largest company in the industrial Bassa zone.

== Political activities ==
Besides being a renowned industrialist for more than two decades now, M. Fadil maintains an image of being a seasoned and respected politician, and has been active within the ruling CPDM since its creation, in 1985, by President [[Paul Biya]].

[[File:Fadil biya.jpeg|thumb|Bayero Fadil et le Président Paul Biya]]
[[File:Mr et Mme Bayero Fadil et le Président du Sénégal Abdoulaye Wade.jpg|thumb|Mr et Mme Bayero Fadil avec le Président Wade]]

He has, also, had a part in debate over Constitutional reform for Cameroon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cameroon-one.com/site/news/index.php?op=view&amp;id=40549 Interview April 2008 – Modification Constitution; article in French; accessed 2/1/2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and been a member of CPDM's Central Committee since 1996.  Since 1997, M. Fadil has served as assistant coordinator of that party's activity in [[Douala]], Cameroon's economic capital and an opposition stronghold. It is thanks to his dynamism and commitment that the CPDM regained political control of this strategic city, which had fallen to the opposition during protest years.

[[File:Fadil john fru ndi.jpeg|thumb|Bayero Fadil et John Fru Ndi]]

M. Fadil is a master of difficult situations within the party, and has successfully led reconciliation missions for the party. In 1997 he was the provincial coordinator for the renewal of party organisation in the [[West Region, Cameroon|West Region]], and in 2002 supervised party primaries held prior to the 2002 general and municipal elections.  Based on those experiences and successes, he is often solicited for resolution of problems and conflicts within the party, throughout the country.  In the town of Abong Mbang in the [[East Region (Cameroon)|East Region]] in 2007, and in Yagoua Mindif in the [[Far North Region (Cameroon)|Far North Region]] in 2008 and 2009.  M. Fadil declares having an increasing interest in politics.  On a number of occasions he has been called upon to be part of the President's entourage during official trips abroad. During the last France-Africa summit, held in Nice, France in 2010, M. Fadil presented an important discourse on corporate social responsibility.

== Group Fadil head office ==
[[File:Siege groupe fadil2.jpg|thumb|Siege groupe fadil2]]
To undertake all the activities mentioned above, and to improve the working conditions for Group Fadil employees, M. Fadil understood that by 2010, the group would need headquarters in Cameroon which would reflect his vision for it.  The futuristic seat of Group Fadil, majestically imposing on a total area of 1250 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, was completed in 2004. At five storeys tall, with office occupancy space covering an area of 1035 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it is the tallest building in the Bassa industrial complex.

== Corporate social responsibility ==
[[File:MosquéeFadil.jpg|thumb|MosquéeFadil]]
Engaged in seeking solutions to global development and conscious of his ethical values, as member and consultant to the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Forum for Investment &amp; Finance in Africa (EMRC), and as Chairman of the board of directors of the Standards &amp; Quality Agency (ANOR), M. Fadil led Fadil Group to subscribe freely and simply to the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unglobalcompact.org/search?keyword=Complexe+Chimique+Camerounais Anti-corruption &amp; CSR; retrieved 2/1/2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

He observed ''[[inter alia]]'', that the [[Bassa (Cameroon)|Bassa]] industrial zone of [[Douala]] and its surrounding areas were home to a large Muslim community, but lacking a place of worship dedicated to prayer on Friday. Group Fadil decided then to build a mosque within the precincts of Bassa.
The mosque, built on an area of 443 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, has a courtyard of approximately 1500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is equipped with standard facilities. Its structure consists of columns, beams and some masonry bearing, all covered by a deck with reinforced concrete. The coatings are of glazed stoneware, enamel, and ceiling staff (for the prayer hall and gallery). It was inaugurated on 13 August 2010, by the main Imam of the city of Douala before an audience of important personalities.

Within context of CSR, and aware of the fact that access to clean water for the underprivileged was still a worry in Cameroon, M. Fadil also decided to invest in this sector through a department of CSR, a new department in Group Fadil. The department's objective is to promote the dynamics of community development. With that, a borehole equipped with modern water points was donated by CCC to residents of the Ndogsimbi neighbourhood in Douala, and inaugurated on 25 February 2011.

17 March 2011 is a date that Bayero Fadil will live to remember:  it was a day a milestone was marked by the naming of an avenue to bear his family's name.  Under the chairmanship of the Governor of the [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral Region]], and in the presence of a curious audience and top local and administrative officials, Avenue El Hadj Abdoulaye Fadil was inaugurated. On behalf of his family and himself, Mohamadou Bayero Fadil, stated that the naming not only represented recognition of a city but that of the entire nation, to a man who respects human values and Republican principles. As he proudly loves to emphasise, "...I now live at 90 and work at 278 Avenue El Hadj Abdoulaye Fadil!"

[[File:Lancement Camnews24 par Mr Fadil et le ministre Mr Tchiroma.JPG|thumb|Lancement Camnews24]]

== Camnews24 ==
On 18 February 2012 Mr. Bayero Fadil launched a new TV channel, CAMNEWS24, the latest product of Equateur Medi Group –EMG that he founded in 1996. The Group already owns a newspaper DIKALO and a radio; hitfmradio (www.hitfmradio.net). Camnews24 according to the promoter is an epitome of the Group that he heads; the firm believed that the foundations of sustainable development lies in the control and efficient management of information throughout the world that was becoming a global village. CAMNEWS24 he insists is a general news channel. Through reports, magazines and documentaries, it will allow viewers to live and see Africa from Cameroon and the rest of the world from Africa. The launching of CAMNEWS24 was chaired by Cameroon's Minister of Communication, Issa Tchiroma Bakary.

'''Nopporn Suppipat''' (born March 30, 1971) is a Thai businessman living in [[Paris]]. He is largest investor in French tech start-up, Blade Group&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iot-now.com/2017/06/16/63168-french-start-blade-raises-e51m-ramp-deployment-shadow-reinvented-pc/#more-63168&lt;/ref&gt;. Suppipat became known in Thailand as founder and CEO of Wind Energy Holding (WEH) which became South East Asia’s largest wind power business in 2014 with a valuation of $1.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/foreign-policy/341719-opinion-the-case-for-reasserting-us-influence-in-southeast&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[2014 Thai coup d'état|2014 coup d'etat]] in Thailand he was forced to flee the country after being accused of [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|lese majeste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Add Thailand To The Wave Of Nationalist Regimes Sweeping The World|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/melikkaylan/2016/12/16/add-thailand-to-the-wave-of-nationalist-regimes-sweeping-the-world/#34d28d08466d|publisher=forbes|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted political asylum by the French authorities and has now settled in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nopporn Suppipat|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nopporn-suppipat-501464138/|website=Linkedin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Nopporn Suppipat was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand. He is the eldest son of two dentists. He moved to the US to attend high school and then undertook coursework for a BA at the [[University of Miami]] before eventually settling in Thailand.&lt;ref name="Nopporn Suppipat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nopporn Suppipat|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/nopporn-suppipat/|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mda.co.th/news112014/18Going%20with%20the%20Wind.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Suppipat first entered the business investing in the stock market as a freshman. With seed money of $2,850, he became a dollar millionaire at the age of 20. Within two years however, he lost most of his fortune.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mda.co.th/news112014/18Going%20with%20the%20Wind.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He later invested in a 100MW conventional power plant, but his investment ended after Thailand's [[1997 Asian financial crisis|economic bubble burst]] and his partner decided to sell in 1998. After this, he set up a small magazine business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mda.co.th/news112014/18Going%20with%20the%20Wind.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Suppipat turned his attention to renewable energy. He hired a research company to carry out a feasibility study about Thailand’s wind resources and in 2006 he launched Renewable Energy Corporation (REC).

In 2009, Suppipat launched Wind Energy Holding (WEH) with REC as the holding company and Pradej Kitti-itsaranon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pradej Kitti-itsaranon|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/pradej-kitti-itsaranon/|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the head of the SET-listed engineering group Demco Plc as a minority shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mda.co.th/news112014/18Going%20with%20the%20Wind.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He launched two sites in the northeastern province of Isan with a capacity to produce 207 megawatts of power, and with more projects in the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind Energy Holding to start operations at Thailand wind farm|url=http://www.power-technology.com/news/newswind-energy-holding-thailand|website=Power Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; WEH grew to become Southeast Asia’s largest wind energy company valued at $1.2 billion with preparations for an initial public offering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mda.co.th/news112014/18Going%20with%20the%20Wind.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj Suppipat"&gt;{{cite web|title=One of Thailand’s Rising Energy Stars Implicated in Corruption Probe|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/thailands-wind-energy-ceo-steps-down-amid-probe-1418716840|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Suppipat was listed number 31 on [[Forbes]] Asia’s ranking of Thailand’s 50 Richest with a net worth of $800 million.&lt;ref name="Nopporn Suppipat" /&gt;

==Controversy and exile==

In the aftermath of the 2014 military coup, Suppipat was charged with violating Thailand’s strict [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|lese majeste laws]] in connection with the graft investigation that implicated relatives of former [[Srirasmi Suwadee|Thai Princess Srirasmi]].&lt;ref name="New CEO Nopporn Suppipat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand's Wind Energy appoints new CEO after graft scandal|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-2875610/Thailands-Wind-Energy-appoints-new-CEO-graft-scandal.html|website=Daily Mail|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand crown prince strips wife's family of royal name|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-30258759|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After discovering he would be charged under lese majeste law, which carries a sentence of up to 15 years on each count, Suppipat travelled to Cambodia on November 30, 2014, stating: “I knew '112' (lese majeste charge) would mean I wouldn't get bail... I couldn't take that risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fugitive Thai millionaire protests his innocence|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2864117/Fugitive-Thai-millionaire-protests-innocence.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suppipat has protested his innocence and claims the charges against him were politically motivated because authorities perceived him to be close to former Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fugitive Thai millionaire protests his innocence|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/447909/|publisher=Bangkok Post|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppipat is known among prominent Thai academics for being pro-democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump’s Rise Is Making the Old Soviet Playbook Relevant Again|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-rise-is-making-the-old-soviet-playbook-relevant_us_58c07446e4b070e55af9eb12|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppipat has been granted political asylum by the French authorities and is currently living in Paris.

==Sale of WEH to KPN Group==

Almost immediately after leaving Thailand, Suppipat stood down as the CEO of WEH&lt;ref name="wsj Suppipat" /&gt; and was replaced by former co-chief executive Emma Collins.&lt;ref name="New CEO Nopporn Suppipat" /&gt; On June 25, 2015, Suppipat sold his 75% majority stake to KPN Group with the management team of WEH becoming the minority shareholders in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KPN acquires 75% stake in Renewable Energy Corp from former majority shareholder|url=http://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/kpn-acquires-75-stake-in-renewable-energy-corp-from-former-majority-shareholder-8364/|website=Dealstreetasia|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, KPN had been accused of mishandling WEH funds, which surfaced after a former company accountant Asama Thanyaphan claimed to have been forced to falsify the accounts to conceal the withdrawals from shareholders. KPMG, the external auditor for WEH, resigned shortly afterwards, refusing to endorse the 2015 accounts. Grant Thornton was appointed as WEH's auditor and were made aware of all of the allegations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scandal at Thai Wind Concern Threatens US$2 billion IPO|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/econ-business/thailand-wind-cscandal-threatens-ipo/|website=asiasentinel|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations were flatly denied by KPN and Wind Energy Holding as they stated that all business activities have always been carried out in a lawful manner. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/Wind-Energy-defends-its-executives-30284758.html&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Grant Thornton has issued unqualified accounts for WEH for 2015 and 2016. WEH has continued to thrive since the sale to KPN having recently raised US$1.14 billion of financing for its five windfarm projects in one of the single largest onshore wind farm financings globally. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wind-energy-holdings-financing/thailands-wind-energy-holdings-gets-1-14-billion-financing-idUSKBN1DT0FJ&lt;/ref&gt; WEH has also signed 450 MW of turbine supply agreements with Vestas and GE for its five wind farms which will host the tallest turbines in Southeast Asia to date. Once complete, the five projects will make WEH the single largest wind farm operator in Southeast Asia. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/breakingnews/30332771&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investment in Blade Group==

Since moving to France, Suppipat has invested in French startup [http://www.blade-group.com/ Blade Group] which is developing a new type of Cloud computer called [[Shadow (service)]] and which is being marketed as “The PC of the Future.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blade Group|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10839595/|publisher=linkedin}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 14 2017 Blade announced a €51 million capital increase with Suppipat, the largest investor, joining the company's Strategic Committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/2017/06/14/32001-20170614ARTFIG00182-blade-leve-51-millions-d-euros-pour-construire-l-ordinateur-du-futur.php&lt;/ref&gt; On November 21 Blade announced it expects to launch the service to U.S. customers at the beginning of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/21/frances-blade-prepares-to-launch-its-virtual-pc-subscription-service-shadow-in-the-u-s/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parkdale''' is a neighbourhood and former village in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, west of [[downtown]]. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by [[Roncesvalles Avenue]], on the north by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP Rail]] line where it crosses [[Queen Street West|Queen Street]] and [[Dundas Street]]. It is bounded on the east by [[Dufferin Street]] from Queen Street south, and on the south by [[Lake Ontario]]. The original village incorporated an area north of Queen Street, east of Roncesvalles from Fermanagh east to the main rail lines, today known as part of the Roncesvalles neighbourhood. The village area was roughly one square kilometer in area. The [[Municipal government of Toronto|City of Toronto]] extends the neighbourhood boundaries to the east, south of the CP Rail lines, east to Atlantic Avenue, as far south as the CN Rail lines north of [[Exhibition Place]], the part south of King Street commonly known as the western half of [[Liberty Village]] neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=City of Toronto |url=http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=2aa2ed1ea61e1410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=1e68f40f9aae0410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD |title=South Parkdale |accessdate=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009143925/https://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=2aa2ed1ea61e1410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=1e68f40f9aae0410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD |archive-date=October 9, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkdale was founded as an independent settlement within [[York County, Ontario|York County]] in the 1850s. It was incorporated as a village in 1879 and amalgamated with Toronto in 1889. It was an upper-income residential area for the first half of the 20th century, with several notable mansions. The area changed dramatically with the building of the [[Gardiner Expressway]] in 1955, which resulted in the demolition of the southern section of the neighbourhood and the [[Sunnyside Amusement Park]], and the creation of a barrier between the neighbourhood and the north shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. A boom in apartment building construction followed, replacing whole [[City block|blocks]] of homes with blocks of apartment buildings. Some of the older large residential buildings remain though many were converted into rooming houses. The demographic composition changed considerably, including a higher proportion of lower income and newcomer families. Today, it is a working-class neighbourhood, with a large percentage of low-income households concentrated in South Parkdale,&lt;ref name=2011_NHS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.toronto.ca/City%20Of%20Toronto/Social%20Development,%20Finance%20&amp;%20Administration/Neighbourhood%20Profiles/pdf/2011/pdf4/cpa85.pdf |title=85.

The area has a vibrant storefront commercial strip along Queen Street West that has seen an increase in restaurants and bars in the 2010s, increasing to the point that planning controls were put in place on the opening of new restaurants and bars from 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/4633839-parkdale-s-ban-on-new-restaurants-repealed-by-toronto-council/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
Parkdale is primarily a residential area of the city, with semi-detached homes predominating on most side streets. Many of the homes date from the 19th Century and early 20th Century. Around 1900, the area was a well-to-do suburb and many older mansions from around 1900 still exist, often converted to multi-unit buildings. Many of the residential streets have mature trees. Good examples of Victorian housing can still be found on Cowan Avenue and Dunn Avenue, south of King Street. Victorian-era row homes of Georgian Revival style with original gaslights can also be seen on Melbourne Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=TOBuilt |url=http://www.tobuilt.ca/php/tobuildings_more.php?search_fd3=5364 |title=TOBuilt: Detailed Structure Information |accessdate=October 7, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Melbourne Place,Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Victorian architecture|Victorian-era]] [[Terraced house|row homes]] may be found at Melbourne Place in Parkdale.]]
Parkdale has a higher than average amount of rental housing. Several streets, notably Jameson Avenue and Tyndall Avenue have been converted to zones of apartment buildings. The apartment buildings mostly date from the 1950s through the 1970s, and have remained rental buildings while no large condominium projects have been built west of Dufferin Street.
[[File:Entrance to a music venue in neon light (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|Parkdale's commercial districts are located on [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]] and [[Queen Street West]].]]
Parkdale's commercial districts are along Queen Street West from Roncesvalles in the west to Dufferin Avenue in the east, and King Street West around Dufferin Street. Queen Street West has a large proportion of restaurants and bars, as well as local shops and art galleries. Commercial space is mostly storefronts oriented toward local customers.

The area has a lower amount of park land per resident compared to other parts of Toronto. Several streets have ''parkettes'' built since the 1960s in an initiative to increase the amount of park land in the area.

Demographically, Parkdale is mixed in income and ethnicity. The neighbourhood has an above average percentage of renters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.toronto.ca/city_of_toronto/social_development_finance__administration/files/pdf/housing_rental.pdf|title=Rental Housing Supply and Demand Indicators|last=|first=|date=December 2006|website=City Of Toronto|publisher=City Of Toronto|access-date=April 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130063534/http://www1.toronto.ca/city_of_toronto/social_development_finance__administration/files/pdf/housing_rental.pdf|archive-date=January 30, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that number has increased since 2006 to 2011. The area contains some of the lowest-income persons in the city. Between 2006 and 2011, there was a decrease in the median income of Parkdale by 2.9%.&lt;ref name="Census Data 2006"&gt;Census Data (2006, 2011). Statistics Canada&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2011, there was an increase in the number of people earning within the range of $30,000 to $60,000.&lt;ref name="Census Data 2006"/&gt; The large amount of rental stock is an entry point for immigrants to Toronto. The area has a significant group of musicians and visual artists, who often perform and exhibit locally.

To the south of Parkdale, the area is bordered by transportation uses, including the railway, [[Gardiner Expressway]] and [[Lake Shore Boulevard]]. South of the transportation corridor, the shoreline is mostly park land, with recreational clubs such as the [[Argonaut Rowing Club]] and Boulevard Club (formerly the Parkdale Canoe Club) on the water.

==History==
The '''Village of Parkdale''' was founded in 1879, but settlement of the area predated its foundation. In 1812, the {{convert|240|acre|ha}} of land bounded from Lot Street (today's Queen Street) on the north, and Jameson on the west and Dufferin Avenue was granted to James Brock, the cousin of Sir Isaac Brock, in lieu of salary. Brock did not occupy or improve the land during his lifetime. After Brock's death in 1830, his widow Lucy Brock sold the lands which became the major part of Parkdale to [[John Henry Dunn]] and [[John Wellington Gwynne|William Gwynne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Fife &amp; Drum |title=Brockton’s Name Recalls Isaac Brock’s Cousin James |issue=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area north of Queen Street was subdivided from the [[Walter O'Hara|O'Hara]] Estate, given to Walter O'Hara for military service. Another parcel of land north of Queen was given to James Brock, east of the O'Hara estate, was developed along Brock Avenue and became Brockton Village.
[[File:North Parkdale CPR station, Toronto, 1898 -- A20578.jpg|left|thumb|[[Parkdale railway station (Toronto)|Parkdale railway station]] in 1898. The railway station opened in 1856.]]
The [[Parkdale railway station (Toronto)|Parkdale railway station]] was opened at Queen and Dufferin streets in 1856. In the 1870s, the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] built a railway station at Jameson Avenue, on its east-west line. It was named [[South Parkdale railway station|South Parkdale]], and the Queen Street station was given the name of North Parkdale station.

A census of residents prior to the founding showed 783 residents of the area, more than enough for the legal requirement of 750 at the time. A local legend is that [[Romani people|Gypsies]] were signed up as local residents to provide enough numbers. Parkdale's status as an independent village was controversial at the time and was opposed by the [[Toronto City Council|City of Toronto]] and the York County councils.
[[File:QueenStSubwayAtDufferin1899.jpg|thumb|View of Parkdale in 1898. Parkdale was annexed by the [[Old Toronto|City of Toronto]] a decade earlier, in 1888.]]
It was purely a residential suburb, home to large Victorian mansions and views of [[Lake Ontario]]. The first house of worship in Parkdale, the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Epiphany and St. Mark, Parkdale|Church of St. Mark]], was completed on January 20, 1881, on Cowan Ave just south of Queen Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Anglican |title=Serving in Parkdale for Ninety years|issue=April 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1884, the Village council passed a bylaw to join Toronto, to be ''annexed'' by the City of Toronto, as the village was in fact surrounded by the city of Toronto. The act did not take place immediately as the Village's finances were not in order. Liabilities of the village were not clearly stated in the village's financial statements. On October 27, 1888, another vote was held and the annexation was upheld. The village was annexed by the City of Toronto in March 1889. It became "St. Alban's Ward.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Toronto Daily Mail |title=Laying The Stone |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1DEJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XjcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6453%2C3339150 |date=November 23, 1891 |p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s, the South Parkdale station was closed and replaced with [[Sunnyside railway station (Toronto)|Sunnyside railway station]]. At the time, a cut was made between Dowling and Atlantic streets and the rail lines of the Grand Trunk were moved below street level. The North Parkdale stations were given new signage of "Parkdale", returning to the original name.

==='Sunnyside years'===
Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Parkdale's desirability stemmed from its proximity to the lake, the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] to the south-east and the popular Sunnyside Beach at the foot of Roncesvalles to the west. From 1911 to 1922, the Toronto Harbour Commission improved the lakefront extending the shoreline from the rail line {{convert|100|m|ft}} south, with a breakwater and boardwalk. As an example, in 1905, the Parkdale Canoe Club (today it is known as the Boulevard Club) opened. When built, it was on a pier extending out into the lake. As part of the infill project, it became situated inland. To the east of the current building were baseball and lacrosse fields. It was the site of a popular women's softball league for many years.

[[Sunnyside Amusement Park]] was opened in 1922, providing a popular day vacation for Torontonians. Movie theatres were opened, such as the Brighton on Roncesvalles and the Odeon on Queen Street to the east of Roncesvalles. Hotels like the Edgewater at Queen and Roncesvalles were established.
[[File:Palais Royale.jpg|thumb|Opened in 1922, [[Palais Royale]] is located along Lake Shore Boulevard. The facility situated near the edge of [[Sunnyside, Toronto|Sunnyside Beach]].]]
The [[Palais Royale]] at the eastern edge of Sunnyside Beach opened in 1922 as a canoe factory and dance hall. Many important [[big band]]s played there in the 1930s and the 1940s, and this attracted a large youth patronage. Many war generation Torontonians courted their future partners in this building.  The Palais Royale operates today as a special occasion hall and is a favourite venue for bands, including [[The Rolling Stones]], who played a 2002 concert there, and has been the location for live recordings by [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]] and [[Downchild Blues Band]].

===1950s-1970s: Gardiner Expressway and urban changes===
In 1955, the city began work on the [[Gardiner Expressway]], a [[freeway|limited access highway]] alongside the railway cut. The Sunnyside Amusement Park was demolished, except for the Bathing Pavilion and the Palais Royale hall. The southern section of Parkdale to the west of Dufferin, south of the railway was also demolished. Parkdale was now separated from Lake Ontario and Sunnyside Beach and the expressway effectively halved the amount of usable lakeside parkland. A reorganization of the area's residential streets was also done. Patronage of the beach declined rapidly. Both the [[Parkdale railway station (Toronto)|Parkdale]] and [[Sunnyside railway station (Toronto)|Sunnyside]] train stations closed during the 1970s.
[[File:Westbound Gardiner from Dufferin.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Gardiner Expressway]] is a [[controlled-access highway]] that runs east-west through Parkdale. The neighbourhood changed greatly with the completion of the highway.]]
The neighbourhood changed greatly after the highway was completed and the park closed. Population density increased with the building of numerous apartment buildings. Jameson Avenue, which became the conduit to the highway changed from single family homes to a street of apartment buildings, many cheaply built. Nearby, many of the mansions and large houses became makeshift low-rise 'bachelorette' apartment buildings and rooming houses. Several had operated as tourist hotels for visitors to Sunnyside and the CNE. Industrial activity declined along the railways. One former industrial site on West Lodge Avenue became a two-tower apartment complex that has repeatedly been cited by the City for various by-law infractions. Businesses suffered during the transition, with leisure-type businesses compatible with the Park, such as the Brighton and Odeon theatres closing. Along Queen Street, which saw traffic decline substantially, many businesses closed or changed hands.

===1970s: Absorption of out-patients===
In the mid-1970s, the [[Government of Ontario]] decided to release many long-term care mental illness patients from its Queen Street and Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital facilities to integrate them into the community.&lt;ref name="slater-web"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbancentre.utoronto.ca/pdfs/researchbulletins/CUCS-RB-28-Slater-Parkd.pdf |title=Toronto’s South Parkdale Neighbourhood: A Brief History of Development, Disinvestment, and Gentrification |publisher=University of Toronto |author=Slater, Tom |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the remaining mansions of South Parkdale had already been converted to boarding houses, and were only a short distance away from the Queen Street hospital. Many illegal 'bachelorette' units were also being created and the inexpensive rental stock of South Parkdale soon became home to many of the released patients. The area developed a reputation as a neighbourhood rife with poverty, crime, drugs, homelessness, and large numbers of people living with mental illness.&lt;ref name="slater-web"/&gt;

In 1977, the Parkdale Activity-Recreation Centre (PARC) was founded to operate a drop-in centre in Parkdale for survivors of mental health ailments, the homeless, the disabled and those with few resources. Community volunteers observed that there were a large number of adults living in rooming houses and boarding homes throughout the Parkdale community after local mental health facilities began to de-institutionalize psychiatric patients. Most of these adults possessed little income, had few or no family contacts, did not have a place to go during the day and had been ostracized. In 1980 PARC found funding, staff and a venue and opened its doors to provide support, meals, employment opportunities and various programs to people with serious mental health and addiction issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parc.on.ca/ |title= PARC Parkdale Activity-Recreation Centre |publisher=Parkdale Activity-Recreation Centre |accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parkdale Village [[Business improvement district|Business Improvement Area]] (BIA) was established in 1978, and represents the commercial strip on Queen Street West from Dufferin Street to Roncesvalles Avenue.  The BIA has highlighted the uniqueness of this commercial district, including its restaurants, antique stores, cafés and shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=21abbb2729afa310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=8e3032d0b6d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD|title=Parkdale Village BIA|last=|first=|date=|website=City of Toronto - BIA Listings|publisher=City of Toronto|access-date=July 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827225904/http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=21abbb2729afa310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=8e3032d0b6d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD|archive-date=August 27, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent===
Owing to the many affordable rental apartments and its proximity to the downtown core, Parkdale has evolved into a transient neighbourhood for many newcomers to Canada. Waves of Caribbean, Indian, Vietnamese, Filipino, Tamil, Chinese, Tibetan, Hungarian and Roma immigrants have marked Parkdale in different times between 1980 till present. Parkdale has, since the late 1990s, hosted a large number of Tibetan settlers, with the area known as [[Little Tibet, Toronto|Little Tibet]] becoming home to one of the largest Tibetan diaspora outside of India and Nepal. Parkdale has a number of settlement and immigration agencies that deal with the needs of the newcomers and provide them with the necessary support as they explore the opportunities provided in Canada. Some of the agencies are Parkdale Community Information Centre (PCIC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcic.ca |title=Parkdale Community Information Centre |publisher=Parkdale Community Information Centre |accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parkdale Community Legal Services, PIA, and Culture Link. Parkdale is a mixed income neighborhood,

Some of the recent developments in Parkdale include the Healthy Organic Parkdale Edibles (HOPE) garden in the Masaryk Park, south of Queen and on the west side of Cowan Avenue. This community garden was founded by Shannon Thompson of Greenest City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenestcity.ca/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=Greenest City |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124143021/http://www.greenestcity.ca/about-us |archivedate=January 24, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with many community members to allow residents who don't have growing space to grow food and build a more inclusive community area. The environmental and community organization based in Parkdale since 2006 works with food sovereignty, youth employment, environmental awareness and community building. Greenest City has also initiated the Youth Garden in Dunn Parkette. The volunteers of the two gardens also host festivals, workshops, field trips along with other activities and projects in the area.

The area has seen an influx of artists working in the relatively inexpensive spaces, close to the exhibit spaces on Queen Street within Parkdale and along Queen Street to the east.&lt;ref name="slater-web"/&gt; The opening of the Parkdale Arts and Cultural Centre, along with efforts to promote businesses in the area, such as the Parkdale-Liberty Economic Development Centre, has spurred the growth of a vibrant creative area along Queen Street, which puts on a large display during Toronto's annual 'Nuit Blanche.'

The housing stock has seen some gentrification, especially in the area north of Queen Street identified with the "Roncesvalles Village" area, again due to the relatively inexpensive property values.  In recent years housing prices in Parkdale have caught up with much of the rest of Toronto.&lt;ref name="slater-web"/&gt; Still, sub-standard housing in the units within the older buildings remains a concern of local city councillors and local community members. Numerous conversions into bachelorettes were done illegally and conditions did not conform to building or fire codes. An initiative, known as the "Parkdale Pilot Project" was formed to address the illegal conversions, seeking to bring the buildings into line. One location on King Street was the location of the famous "Pope Squat" where poverty activists squatted in a vacant converted apartment building during a visit of [[Pope John Paul II]]. After being vacant for over ten years (most of which it was owned by the [[Government of Ontario]]), the building eventually re-opened as apartments, after its redevelopment was approved by the Pilot Project's housing committee.. An apartment building on the corner of Queen Street and Dowling Avenue also lay vacant for some time before being expropriated by the city for an affordable housing re-development underway in 2009. It will be known as Edmond Place and is a partnership of the City with PARC.

==Education==
[[File:Parkdale Colleiate Institute.JPG|thumb|[[Parkdale Collegiate Institute]] is a [[public education|public]] [[secondary school]] operated by the [[Toronto District School Board]].]]
There are four Toronto-based [[school board]]s that provides [[public education]] for the city, including the neighbourhood of Parkdale. Two of the four Toronto-based school boards teach primarily in [[English language|English]], the [[secular education|secular]] [[Toronto District School Board]] (TDSB), and the [[separate school|separate]] [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]] (TCDSB). The institutions operated by the other two Toronto-based school boards, the secular [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]], and separate [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]], teach primarily in [[French language|French]]. However, neither French-language school board operates a school in Parkdale. 

The following [[elementary education|elementary]] and [[secondary schools]] are located in Parkdale:

* [[Parkdale Collegiate Institute]], a TDSB secondary school on Jameson Avenue south of Queen Street. It was founded in the 1880s.
* Queen Victoria Public School, is a TDSB elementary school on Close Avenue at King Street.
* Parkdale Public School is a TDSB elementary school which includes preschool to grade 8. It is on Seaforth avenue.
* Holy Family Catholic School, a TCDSB elementary school, a part of [[Holy Family Roman Catholic Church, Parkdale|Holy Family Parish]] on Close Avenue. Founded in 1900, two years before the parish church and present school opened at their current location, Holy Family School was created out of Toronto's original west end parish and school of St. Helen's and was first in Parkdale's Masonic Hall on the south side of Queen Street near Dowling Ave.  The school was served for many years by the [[Sisters of Loreto]] who commuted from their convent in Toronto's downtown.  As population increased in the Parkdale area, the school was enlarged many times such that the standing remains of the original building are now obscured. In 2004 a community centre opened in the school newly built additional building, also at that time, Toronto's archbishop invited fathers of the [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri]] in Montreal to come to Toronto to serve Holy Family Church and school.  When the original Holy Family Church burned in 1997, the congregation worshipped in the school while funds were raised to build a new church.&lt;ref&gt;Fifty Golden Years : Holy Family Parish TORONTO, ONTARIO 1902 - 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
[[File:Queen West 2010.jpg|thumb|The [[504 King]] [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar]] in Parkdale, one of several public transportation services operated by the [[Toronto Transportation Commission|TTC]].]]
There are several routes serving Parkdale. Along Queen and King Streets, [[streetcar]]s provide service. Along Lansdowne Avenue and Dufferin Street, bus service is provided, connecting to the [[Line 2 Bloor–Danforth|Bloor-Danforth subway]] to the north. The [[504 King]] streetcar route along King Street connects to [[Dundas West (TTC)|Dundas West station]] via Roncesvalles Avenue.

===Main streets===
[[File:Bank of BNA King and Dufferin.jpg|thumb|A former [[Bank of British North America]] branch on King Street, a major road in the neighbourhood.]]
'''[[Queen Street West]]''' running east-west is the primary commercial street of the neighbourhood. It is four lanes and the buildings are predominantly 2-3 storey buildings, often with apartments on the upper floors. It ends at Roncesvalles, meeting [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]] and the Queensway at the 'Sunnyside' intersection. It continues to the east to downtown. The business along Queen have formed a Business Improvement Association under the name of "Parkdale Village." The street has numerous art galleries, restaurants, cafes and convenience stores. The Parkdale branch of the [[Toronto Public Library]] is at Cowan Avenue.

'''King Street West''', running east-west is a major street continuing to the east to Toronto's downtown, ending to the west at Sunnyside. From Roncesvalles east, it curves along the original shoreline, which is about {{convert|30|ft|m}} above and {{convert|100|yard|m}} inland from the shoreline. The south side in that area is open, with views of the Lake. It is predominantly residential, with a commercial section around the intersection with Dufferin Street.

'''[[Dufferin Street]]''', running north-south is a major street starting from the [[Canadian National Exhibition|CNE]] to the south, north to Queen Street, where it intersects the railway. The street continues one block to the north and continues north to north of Toronto. It is mixed commercial and residential. South of King along the east side is an old industrial area with loft-type industrial buildings.  Construction has been completed to eliminate the Dufferin Street jog at Queen and the railway tracks.  Dufferin Street now runs directly north to Wilson Avenue.

'''[[Lansdowne Avenue]]''', running north-south from Queen Street north to St. Clair Avenue. It is predominantly a residential street. The former [[West Toronto Collegiate]], now a francophone high school is at [[College Street (Toronto)|College Street]] and Lansdowne. The former [[National Cash Register]] factory at [[Dundas Street (Toronto)|Dundas Street]] has been a grocery store since the 1980s.

'''[[Jameson Avenue]]''', running north-south from Queen Street south to Lake Shore Boulevard. It is predominantly a residential street of apartment buildings. There are two schools on Jameson, [[Parkdale Collegiate Institute|Parkdale Collegiate]], near Queen, and Queen Victoria Public, just south of King Street.

'''''Poorly Made in China: An Insider's Account of the Tactics Behind China's Production Game''''' is a book by Paul Midler, which chronicles his years spent working with American businessmen whose companies' products are manufactured in [[China]].&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Muhammad|title=Outplaying your partner Poorly Made in China|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/KG18Ad02.html|accessdate=23 November 2013|newspaper=Asia Times|date=18 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poorly Made in China alleges the practice of quality fade—the deliberate and secret effort of Chinese manufacturers to widen profit margins through the reduction of quality inputs.

[[File:Office Building and Pride Park Stadium - geograph.org.uk - 1058487.jpg|Office building on Pride Park, with [[Pride Park Stadium]] in the background|thumbnail]]'''Pride Park''' is a [[business park]] on the outskirts of the city centre of [[Derby]], England. Developed in the 1990s, It covers 80 hectares of former industrial land between the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] and railway lines. [[Pride Park Stadium]] and [[Derby Arena]] are both located in Pride Park.

==History==
The site was formerly part of the railway yards, and was derelict for many years. It was the original site of Derby's railway manufacturing industry, but land here had also been used for gas and coke works, gravel abstraction and landfill. These uses left behind a cocktail of contaminants, including tars, phenols, heavy metals, ammonia and boron. Extensive redevelopment took place over 10 years to reclaim the site, including the building of a new access road to open the area up. Part of the site has been transformed into a nature reserve called [[The Sanctuary (Derby)|The Sanctuary]], in conjunction with [[Derby City Council]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prideparksanctuary.com/background.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occupants==
[[File:Pride Park.jpg|thumb|Pride Park Stadium]]
[[File:Frontage of Derby Velodrome at Pride Park, Derby, England.JPG|thumb|Derby Arena]]
* It has been home of [[Derby County F.C.]]'s [[Pride Park Stadium]] since 1997 when they relocated from the [[Baseball Ground]] in the [[Normanton, Derbyshire|Normanton]] district.
* [[Derby Arena]] is a multi-purpose sports and events venue adjacent to Pride Park Stadium, which opened in 2015.
* A Park &amp; Ride car park for access to Derby city centre is located next to the stadium.
* Internet bank [[Egg plc]] had its headquarters and call centre in the business park until 2011 when it was taken over by Barclaycard, and closed. The building was subsequently occupied by HEROtsc, retaining its function as a [[call centre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Derby-held-HERO-ve-end-line-year/story-18099872-detail/story.html retrieved 6/8/2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* The business park also houses a [[Holiday Inn Express]] hotel and several car dealerships.
* The sports goods retailer [[JJB Sports]] has offices on the Park.
* [[Derby Manufacturing UTC]], a [[university technical college]] opened in September 2015.

==Expansion Plan==
Derby County Football Club are proposing to expand facilities on offer around the football stadium with a £20 million development plan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.derbycounty-mad.co.uk/news/loadnews.asp?cid=TMNW&amp;id=336236&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite the club being unsuccessful in their bid to include the stadium as a venue in England's bid to host the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/8414235.stm | work=BBC News | title=Milton Keynes picked for 2018 bid | date=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 2011, Derby County Football Club announced that they had submitted plans to [[Derby City Council]] for a £7 million development of land outside Pride Park Stadium, which the club named "The Plaza @ Pride Park".&lt;ref name="Plaza 2 statement"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2468631,00.html| publisher = dcfc.co,uk| title = Press Release: The Plaza @ Pride Park| date = 3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These plans include five [[Coffeehouse|cafes]]/restaurants, two convenience stores and 2,000 square metres of [[Office|office space]]. These plans have been scaled down from the planned £20 million pound development proposed in 2007.&lt;ref name="Plaza 2"&gt;{{cite news| url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-15147480| publisher = BBC News| title = Derby County submits plans for new Pride Park plaza| date = 3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derby County CEO Tom Glick, said that these plans would help the club deal with the new Financial Fair Play regulations which will be introduced in the [[The Football League|Football League]] from 2012, as revenue from the Plaza will be reinvested back into the club.&lt;ref name="Plaza 2 statement"/&gt;

This planned development also coincides with a plan from the City Council to build a multi-use sports arena on the same site as the proposed Plaza.&lt;ref name="Plaza 2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6518">'''Rapid Results''' is a structured process that mobilizes teams to achieve tangible results over a rapid time frame and accelerate organizational learning. [http://www.schafferresults.com Schaffer Consulting], a [[management consulting]] firm headquartered in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], developed the Rapid Results approach based on their experience working with clients across industries to achieve breakthrough levels of performance. The approach and its practitioners have since been recognized in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', and ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', among other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Tina|title=Making Change Happen, on a Deadline|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/making-change-happen-on-a-deadline/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaffer|first1=Robert|title=Demand Better Results - And Get Them|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=1 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foreign Policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers 2012|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,24#thinker25|publisher=Foreign Policy Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Schaffer Consulting founded the [[Rapid Results Institute]] (RRI) to refine the methodology to support non-profit work and development projects across Sub-Saharan Africa, South America, the United States, and the Middle East.

== Methodology ==

The objective of Rapid Results initiatives is to achieve dramatic results, formed under the pressure of short time frames and ambitious targets.&lt;ref name="Global Health 101"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skolnik|first=Richard|title=Global Health 101|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=0763797510|pages=174–175|url=https://books.google.com.lb/books?id=sBQRpj4uWmYC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=(Rapid+Results+Institute+and+Micronutrient+Initiative+2008&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VVnQliS5--&amp;sig=BETcx2RH6JJeZYfP53x_EG6_1Ag&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4-QkUfiZMIm70QXqp4CgDw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=rapid%20results%20institute&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid Results initiatives begin with a call to action for significant performance improvement delivered by a single leader or group of leaders to cross-functional teams of 8-10 people. Team members then set and commit to "seemingly unreasonable" short-term goals — often in 100 days or less — tied to the strategic imperatives outlined by their leaders. Teams then experiment with new ways of working, capturing learnings along the way, and persisting until they achieve desired outcomes. Rapid Results aims to stimulate innovation, collaboration, and more effective execution in and across organizations and stakeholder groups. Leaders leverage initial results to create longer-term and wider-scale impact in subsequent waves of Rapid Results projects.&lt;ref name="Managing Human Resources"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson|author2=Ones|author3=Dilchert|title=Managing Human Resources for Environmental Sustainability|year=2012|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=319–340|url=https://books.google.com.lb/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UBBeYc1rCu0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=%22Rapid+Results+Institute%22&amp;ots=pQjY2tyTeS&amp;sig=W1Pq8GqOGTk3ntqQjeKeF8H7H2c&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rapid%20Results%20Institute%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business impact ==

Leaders in many industries leverage Rapid Results to achieve performance goals, including accelerating growth, increasing productivity, and realizing cost savings.

Lynn Chambers, group head of Talent at the London Stock Exchange Group, says, “This approach can be taken to accelerate progress on almost any goal.” Dean Scarborough, president and chief executive officer of Avery Dennison describes Rapid Results “driving an incredible amount of creativity” among team members. Martha Marsh, former president and CEO of Stanford Hospital and Clinics, observes that Rapid Results “provide an intense focus on getting results, while helping build the capacity of our organization to drive transformational change.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaffer|first1=Robert|last2=Ashkenas|first2=Ron|title=Rapid Results! How 100-Day Projects Build the Capacity for Large-Scale Change|date=2005|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rapid Results Institute ==

Formed in 2007, the Rapid Results Institute works with a broad range of partners — including government agencies, not-for-profit organizations, and international development agencies — across a wide spectrum of development initiatives. Past and ongoing projects include H.I.V. prevention in [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]], public sector reform in [[Kenya]], waste management in [[Brazil]], and housing [[homeless veterans in the United States]].

The Rapid Results Institute is partnering with the 100,000 Homes Campaign and the [[US Department of Veterans Affairs]] to house homeless veterans across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Tina|title=Teaming Up to End Homelessness|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/whe-one-fix-leads-to-another/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development impact ==

Following a project on [[HIV/AIDS]] awareness among youth, Eritrean Minister of Education Osman Saleh called the Rapid Results approach "a new movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valerio|first1=Alexandria|title=Education and HIV/AIDS: A Sourcebook of HIV/AIDS Prevention Programs|date=2008|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780821374405|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kenya]], an independent evaluation by the AIDS Research and Treatment journal reported that “significant improvement in PMTCT [prevention of mother-to-child-transmission] services can be achieved through introduction of an RRI [Rapid Results Initiative], which appears to lead to sustained benefits for pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants.”

Due to its success in a variety of contexts, the Rapid Results approach has been adopted by the [[World Bank]], as well as by many Kenyan government ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers 2012|journal=Foreign Policy Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Reminiscences of a Stock Operator''''' is a 1923 [[roman à clef]] by American author [[Edwin Lefèvre]] which is the thinly disguised biography of [[Jesse Lauriston Livermore]]. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' described the book as a "classic", it was ranked #15 on 'Fortune's 75 The Smartest Books We Know', and [[Alan Greenspan]] said it is "a font of investing wisdom."

== The Art of Speculation ==
First published in 1923, ''Reminiscences'' is a fictionalized account of the life of the [[Trader (finance)|securities trader]]  [[Jesse Livermore]]. Despite the book's age, it continues to offer insights into the art of [[Trader (finance)|trading]] and [[speculation]]. In [[Jack D. Schwager|Jack Schwager's]] ''[[Market Wizards]]'', ''Reminiscences'' was quoted as a major source of stock trading learning material for experienced and new traders by many of the traders who Schwager interviewed.

=== Plot ===
The book tells the story of Livermore's progression from [[day trading]] in the then so-called "New England [[bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shop]]s," to market speculator, market maker, and market manipulator, and finally to [[Wall Street]] where he made and lost his fortune several times over. Along the way, Livermore learns many lessons, which he happily shares with the reader.

===In print===
The book remains in print as of 2008, ({{ISBN|0471770884}}). In December 2009, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] published an annotated edition in [[hardcover]], {{ISBN|0-470-48159-5}}, that bridges the gap between Lefèvre's fictionalized account and the actual exploits, personalities, and locations that populate the book. Page margins in the 2009 edition explain the historical setting and the real companies, individuals, and news events to which Lefèvre alludes.

== Quotes ==
{{cquote|It took me five years to learn to play the game intelligently enough to make big money when I was right. }}

{{cquote|It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight! It is no trick at all to be right on the market. You always find lots of early bulls in bull markets and early bears in bear markets. I've known many men who were right at exactly the right time, and began buying or selling stocks when prices were at the very level which should show the greatest profit. And their experience invariably matched mine--that is, they made no real money out of it. Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon. }}

{{cquote|Old man Partridge's insistence on the vital importance of being continuously bullish in a bull market doubtless made my mind dwell on the need above all other things of determining the kind of market a man is trading in. I began to realize that the big money must necessarily be in the big swing. Whatever might seem to give a big swing, initial impulse, the fact is that its continuance is not the result of manipulation by pools or artifice by financiers, but depends upon basic conditions. And no matter who opposes it, the swing must inevitably run as far and as fast and as long as the impelling forces determine. }}

{{cquote|To learn that a man can make foolish plays for no reason whatever was a valuable lesson. It cost me millions to learn that another dangerous enemy to a trader is his susceptibility to the urgings of a magnetic personality when plausibly expressed by a brilliant mind. It has always seemed to me, however, that I might have learned my lesson quite as well if the cost had been only one million. But Fate does not always let you fix the tuition fee. She delivers the educational wallop and presents her own bill, knowing you have to pay it, no matter what the amount may be. Having learned what folly I was capable of, I closed that particular incident. }}

{{cquote|There is nothing new in Wall Street. There can't be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again. }}

{{cquote|Of course there is always a reason for fluctuations, but what the tape does not concern itself with the why and wherefore. It doesn't go into explanations. The reason for what a certain stock does today may not be known for two or three days, or weeks, or months. But what the dickens does that matter? Your business with the tape is now - not tomorrow. The reason can wait. But you must act instantly or be left. }}

{{cquote|There is a time for all things, but I didn't know it. And that is precisely what beats so many men on Wall Street who are very far from being in the main sucker class. There is the plain fool, who does the wrong thing at all times everywhere, but there is the Wall Street fool, who thinks he must trade all the time. No man can always have adequate reasons for buying and selling stocks daily - or sufficient knowledge to make his play an intelligent play.}}

{{cquote|The desire for constant action irrespective of underlying conditions is responsible for many losses on Wall Street even among the professionals, who feel that they must take home some money every day, as though they were working for regular wages. }}

{{cquote|A stock operator has to fight a lot expensive enemies within himself. }}

{{cquote|I never argue with the tape. Getting sore at the market doesn't get you anywhere. }}

{{cquote|Much more to the game of speculation than to play for fluctuations for a few points. }}

{{cquote|There is one side to the stock market; and it is not the bull side or bear side, but the right side. }}

{{cquote|A man must believe in himself and his judgement if he expects to make a living at this game. }}

{{cquote|Speculation is a hard and trying business, and a speculator must be on the job all the time or he'll soon have no job to be on. }}

{{cquote|It seems so obvious now that tape reading is not enough, irrespective of broker execution, that I wonder why I didn't then see both my trouble and the remedy for it. }}

{{cquote|I can't tell you how it came to take me so many years to learn that instead of placing piking bets on what the next few quotations were going to be, my game was to anticipate what was going to happen in a big way. }}

{{cquote|Since suckers always lose money when they gamble on stocks - they never really speculate. }}

{{cquote|There is nothing like losing all you have in the world for teaching you what not to do. And when you know what not to do in order to lose money, you begin to learn what to do in order to win. Did you get that? You begin to learn! }}

{{cquote|The game of speculation isn't all mathematics or set rules, however rigid the main laws may be. }}

{{cquote|If a stock doesn't act right don't touch it; because being unable to tell precisely what is wrong; you cannot tell which way it is going. }}

{{cquote|I should say that a chart helps those who can read it or rather who can assimilate what they read. The average chart reader, however, is apt to become obsessed with the notion that the dips and peaks and primary and secondary movements are all there is to stock speculation. If he pushes his confidence to its logical limit he is bound to go broke. }}

{{cquote|I can see now that my main trouble was my failure to grasp the fundamental difference between stock gambling and stock speculation. }}

{{cquote|The game of beating the market exclusively interested me from ten until three every day, and after three, the game of living my life. }}

{{cquote|I had to study what was going to happen; to anticipate stock movements. }}

{{cquote|It was the change in my own attitude that was of supreme importance to me. It taught me little by little, the essential difference between betting on fluctuations and anticipating inevitable advances and declines, between gambling and speculating. }}

{{cquote|I made up my mind to be wise and play carefully, conservatively. Everybody knew that the way to do that was to take profits and buy back your stocks on reactions. And that is precisely what I did, or rather what I tried to do.....They say you never grow broke taking profits. No, you don't. But neither do you grow rich taking a four point profit in a bull market. }}

{{cquote|"Well this is a bull market,you know!"

He really meant to tell them that the big money was not in individual fluctuations but in the main movements - that is not in reading the tape but in sizing up the entire market and its trend. }}

{{cquote|It seems incredible that knowing the game as well as I did and with an experience of twelve or fourteen years of speculating in stocks and commodities I did precisely the wrong thing. The cotton showed me a loss and I kept it. The wheat showed me a profit and I sold it out. It was an utterly foolish play, but all I can say in extenuation is that it wasn't really my deal, but Thomas'. Of all speculative blunders there are few greater than trying to average a losing game. My cotton deal proved it to the hilt a little later. Always sell what shows you a loss and keep what shows you a profit. That was so obviously the wise thing to do and was so well known to me that even now I marvel at myself for doing the reverse. }}

{{cquote|Broke again and incapable of assuming the offensive vigorously. In debt and wrong! After all those long years of successes, tempered by mistakes that really served to pave the way for greater successes, I was now worse off than when I began in the bucket shops. I had learned a great deal about the game of stock speculation, but I had not learned quite so much about the play of human weaknesses. There is no mind so machinelike that you can depend upon it to function with equal efficiency at all times. I now learned that I could not trust myself to remain equally unaffected by men and misfortunes at all times. }}

{{cquote|Observation, experience, memory and mathematics these are what the successful trader must depend on. He must not only observe accurately but remember at all times what he has observed. He cannot bet on the unreasonable or on the unexpected, however strong his personal convictions may be about man's unreasonableness or however certain he may feel that the unexpected happens very frequently. He must bet always on probabilities that is, try to anticipate them. Years of practice at the game, of constant study, of always remembering, enable the trader to act on the instant when the unexpected happens as well as when the expected comes to pass. 
A man can have great mathematical ability and an unusual power of accurate observation and yet fail in speculation unless he also possesses the experience and the memory. And then, like the physician who keeps up with the advances of science, the wise trader never ceases to study general conditions, to keep track of developments everywhere that are likely to affect or influence the course of the various markets. After years at the game it becomes a habit to keep posted. He acts almost automatically. He acquires the invaluable professional attitude and that enables him to beat the game at times! This difference between the professional and the amateur or occasional trader cannot be overemphasised. I find, for instance, that memory and mathematics help me very much. Wall Street makes its money on a mathematical basis. I mean, it makes its money by dealing with facts and figures. }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3459">'''[[Ratu]] Sakiusa Tuisolia''' (born 15 June 1967)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tuisolia|first1=Saki|title=SakiTuisolia|url=https://www.facebook.com/sakiusa.tuisolia?fref=ts|website=Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Fiji]]an [[Ratu|chief]] from the province of [[Naitasiri Province|Naitasiri]], an economist and businessman, and a former civil servant who served for seven years as an economist with the Ministry of Finance and National Planning, then another seven years as Chief Policy Adviser to three successive Fijian Prime Ministers and was also Deputy CEO in the Office of the Prime Minister.

From 2003 to 2006, Tuisolia served as [[Chief Executive Officer]] of the government-owned [[Airports Fiji Limited]]. He was dismissed by the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|military administration]] a few days after [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|seizing power]] on 5 December.  He resisted his dismissal: ''"If they (the Military) are planning to terminate me from my post, they dont have the power to do so, they have no legitimacy since they have illegally removed the elected Qarase Government.  Only the AFL Board has the powers to remove me subject to my performance or a serious breach of the terms of my contract but the Board is very happy with my good performance and intends to renew my contract'' he said. When the Military accused him of "financial discrepancies", however, he reacted angrily, saying that was ''"a total and blatant lie". They are making these wild and falsified allegations to justify the coup.'' He accused the Military of conducting a witch hunt against him because he was known to be anti-coup and anti-military.
  
Tuisolia turned around AFL from a loss making state enterprise into a very profitable one.

In 2009, Tuisolia was appointed [[Pacific Ocean 2020]] Coordinator by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Pacific Ocean 2020 Coordinator|url=http://www.iucn.org/news_homepage/news_by_date/2009_news/may_2009/?3125/New-Pacific-Ocean-2020-Coordinator|website=IUCN|publisher=IUCN|accessdate=19 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426035826/http://iucn.org/news_homepage/news_by_date/2009_news/may_2009/?3125%2FNew-Pacific-Ocean-2020-Coordinator|archivedate=26 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is now a consultant with the [[Asian Development Bank]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tuisolia|first1=Saki|title=SakiTuisolia|url=https://www.facebook.com/sakiusa.tuisolia?fref=ts|website=Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuisolia has been married since 2003 to [[Imrana Jalal]], a lawyer of [[Indians in Fiji|Indian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Rory|title=Australian tourists turn a blind eye as Fiji's best people persecuted|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/australian-tourists-turn-a-blind-eye-as-fijis-best-people-persecuted/story-fn5hj8hz-1225908505761|website=The Courier Mail|publisher=The Courier Mail|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She, too, was dismissed from civil service positions by the Military-backed interim government.

[[File:Tony Granger.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Tony Granger''' is the global chief creative officer of the New York-based global advertising agency [[Young &amp; Rubicam]].

==Career==
Tony Granger is Global Chief Creative Officer of [http://www.yr.com Young &amp; Rubicam] (a part of [http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-news/stocks/prices-search/stock-prices-search.html?nameCode=WPP WPP]) and architect of the company's global creative community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YR.com: Tony Granger|url=http://www.yr.com/about/people#grid=112|accessdate=7 January 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=shots.com: Tony Granger|url=http://www.shots.net/news/article/82457/creative-monitor-tony-granger|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since arriving at Young &amp; Rubicam in 2008, Granger has attracted some of the industry’s best creative talent and fully integrated digital into the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Association of Advertising Agencies|url=https://ams.aaaa.org/eWeb/content.aspx?WebCode=ViewStaff&amp;AgencyKey=1780e2c5-ca98-421e-bfb4-0b0dcd840327|accessdate=7 January 2015|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also built a global creative community in both spirit and practice. As a result, all of Y&amp;R's clients — anywhere in the world — get access to precisely the right creative talent they need to create the most appropriate and powerful work.

Creating a collaborative creative culture has resulted in great work and results for clients such as [[Land Rover]], [[Dell]], [[Wendy’s]], [[Gatorade]], and [[Vodafone]].

It’s also earned great industry recognition. At this past [[Cannes Lions]] in June 2015, Y&amp;R won 89 Lions across 15 categories, holding its rank as the fourth most winning agency network of the year for the fourth consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=businesswire.com: Cannes|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150701006552/en/YR-Achieves-Performance-2015-Cannes-Lions-Winning#.Vcj1n3FViko|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Y&amp;R had more offices winning Lions than any other network. In addition, Y&amp;R Team Red Istanbul won the Grand Prix in Media for its [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXxRZSHc2z4 Red Light App] to protect women from domestic abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=adweek.com: Y&amp;R|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/yr-wins-media-grand-prix-app-lets-women-call-help-shaking-their-phones-165538|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=fortune.com: Red Light App|url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/14/domestic-violence-app-turkey/|ref=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining Y&amp;R, Granger spent five years at [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]], where he took Saatchi New York to the number one agency at Cannes.&lt;ref name="Cannes Lions Award Winners"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cannes Lions Award Winners|url=http://www.adforum.com/award/showcase/6650183/2007|publisher=Adforum|accessdate=7 January 2015|ref=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, too, he led the agency’s creative transformation. He led a similar renaissance at [[Bozell]] New York, where he took the agency to number three in the world. Granger began his career in his native South Africa, where he led [[TBWA/Hunt Lascaris]], a shop of proud heritage and creative pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paoletta|first1=Michael|title=The Billboard Q&amp;A Tony Granger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0A0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=tony+granger+bozell+billion+dollar+revenue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QD3vE769Dj&amp;sig=9--tXb6-gUNwbFvfA6HWBqt_cWc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oBffS-zkIoK78gbAtLmjBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tony%20granger%20bozell%20billion%20dollar%20revenue&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 January 2015|ref=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Granger and his agencies have won many awards, and he’s been fortunate to serve as president of several international juries, most recently serving as the Outdoor Jury President at Cannes in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=adage.com: Cannes Jury|url=http://adage.com/article/global-news/cannes-lions-announces-16-jury-presidents/239786/|ref=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he’s most proud to have shaped top creative agencies, and worked with the world’s most sought-after clients on some of the most recognized and influential global brands. He is excited about the future of the business and this industry.

In a series of emails quoted in Business Insider in 2013, Mark Mackay, Executive Chairman of Australian agency The Campaign Palace, described Granger as “an arrogant leader in New York”, as well as lacking “commercial savvy” and as a “bully”. He said, "One needs to humour bullies and the way that one does it is as I have outlined in these emails."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/brutal-emails-reveal-yr-boss-regarded-his-creative-director-as-arrogant-and-a-bully-2013-5?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Brutal Emails Reveal Y&amp;amp;R Boss Regarded His Creative Director As 'Arrogant' And A 'Bully'|last=Edwards|first=Jim|date=2013-05-11|work=Business Insider Australia|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Fishlock, then Executive Creative Director of Campaign Palace, later dismissed, brought a case against the agency and won. In a long article, Australian trade publication Mumbrella reports of the case that "Fishlock is entirely vindicated in his claims that he was unfairly axed as national creative chief of the now defunct Campaign Palace," and that "The reputation of Young &amp; Rubicam’s global creative director Tony Granger certainly takes a battering in my view. The word “bully” is a hard one to come back from."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/the-vindication-of-paul-fishlock-155006|title=The vindication of Paul Fishlock - Mumbrella|date=2013-05-10|work=Mumbrella|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross exchange rate discrepancies==
Triangular arbitrage opportunities may only exist when a [[bank]]'s quoted exchange rate is not equal to the market's implicit cross exchange rate. The following equation represents the calculation of an implicit cross exchange rate, the exchange rate one would expect in the market as implied from the ratio of two currencies other than the base currency.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Macroeconomics | author = Feenstra, Robert C. | author2 = Taylor, Alan M. | year = 2008 | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4292-0691-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levi 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 4th Edition | author = Levi, Maurice D. | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-30900-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{a/\$} = S_{a/b} S_{b/\$}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;S_{a/\$}&lt;/math&gt; is the implicit cross exchange rate for dollars in terms of currency ''a''
:&lt;math&gt;S_{a/b}&lt;/math&gt; is the quoted market cross exchange rate for b in terms of currency ''a''
:&lt;math&gt;S_{b/\$}&lt;/math&gt; is the quoted market cross exchange rate for dollars in terms of currency ''b''

If the market cross exchange rate quoted by a bank is equal to the implicit cross exchange rate as implied from the exchange rates of other currencies, then a no-arbitrage condition is sustained.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt; However, if an inequality exists between the market cross exchange rate, &lt;math&gt;S_{a/\$}&lt;/math&gt;, and the implicit cross exchange rate, &lt;math&gt;S_{a/b} S_{b/\$}&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists an opportunity for arbitrage profits on the difference between the two exchange rates.&lt;ref name="Madura 2007" /&gt;

==Mechanics of triangular arbitrage==
[[File:Triangular-arbitrage.svg|thumb|right|A visual representation of a realistic triangular arbitrage scenario, using sample bid and ask prices quoted by international banks.]]
Some international banks serve as [[market maker]]s between currencies by narrowing their [[bid-offer spread|bid-ask spread]] more than the bid-ask spread of the implicit cross exchange rate. However, the bid and ask prices of the implicit cross exchange rate naturally discipline market makers. When banks' quoted exchange rates move out of alignment with cross exchange rates, any banks or traders who detect the discrepancy have an opportunity to earn arbitrage profits via a triangular arbitrage strategy.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt; To execute a triangular arbitrage trading strategy, a bank would calculate cross exchange rates and compare them with exchange rates quoted by other banks to identify a pricing discrepancy.

For example, [[Citibank]] detects that [[Deutsche Bank]] is quoting dollars at a [[bid price]] of 0.8171 €/$, and that [[Barclays]] is quoting pounds at a bid price of 1.4650 $/£ (Deutsche Bank and Barclays are in other words willing to buy those currencies at those prices). Citibank itself is quoting the same prices for these two exchange rates. A trader at Citibank then sees that [[Crédit Agricole]] is quoting pounds at an [[ask price]] of 1.1910 €/£ (in other words it is willing to sell pounds at that price). While the quoted market cross exchange rate is 1.1910 €/£, Citibank's trader realizes that the implicit cross exchange rate is 1.1971 €/£ (by calculating 1.4650 × 0.8171 = 1.1971), meaning that Crédit Agricole has narrowed its bid-ask spread to serve as a market maker between the euro and the pound. Although the market suggests the implicit cross exchange rate should be 1.1971 euros per pound, Crédit Agricole is selling pounds at a lower price of 1.1910 euros. Citibank's trader can hastily exercise triangular arbitrage by exchanging dollars for euros with Deutsche Bank, then exchanging euros for pounds with Crédit Agricole, and finally exchanging pounds for dollars with Barclays. The following steps illustrate the triangular arbitrage transaction.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;

#Citibank sells $5,000,000 to Deutsche Bank for euros, receiving €4,085,500. ($5,000,000 × 0.8171 €/$ = €4,085,500)
#Citibank sells €4,085,500 to Crédit Agricole for pounds, receiving £3,430,311. (€4,085,500 ÷ 1.1910 €/£ = £3,430,311)
#Citibank sells £3,430,311 to Barclays for dollars, receiving $5,025,406. (£3,430,311 × 1.4650 $/£ = $5,025,406)
#Citibank ultimately earns an arbitrage profit of $25,406 on the $5,000,000 of capital it used to execute the strategy.

The reason for dividing the euro amount by the euro/pound exchange rate in this example is that the exchange rate is quoted in euro terms, as is the amount being traded. One could multiply the euro amount by the reciprocal pound/euro exchange rate and still calculate the ending amount of pounds.

==Evidence for triangular arbitrage==
Research examining high-frequency exchange rate data has found that [[mispricing]]s do occur in the foreign exchange market such that executable triangular arbitrage opportunities appear possible.&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Mirage of Triangular Arbitrage in the Spot Foreign Exchange Market | journal = International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | year = 2009 | pages = 1105–1123 | author = Fenn, Daniel J. | author2 = Howison, Sam D. | author3 = McDonald, Mark | author4 = Williams, Stacy | author5 = Johnson, Neil F. | url = http://www.worldscinet.com/ijtaf/12/1208/S0219024909005609.html | accessdate = 2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In observations of triangular arbitrage, the constituent exchange rates have exhibited strong [[correlation]].&lt;ref name="Aiba et al. 2002" /&gt; A study examining exchange rate data provided by [[HSBC Bank (Europe)|HSBC Bank]] for the [[Japanese yen]] (JPY) and the [[Swiss franc]] (CHF) found that although a limited number of arbitrage opportunities appeared to exist for as many as 100 seconds, 95% of them lasted for 5 seconds or less, and 60% lasted for 1 second or less. Further, most arbitrage opportunities were found to have small magnitudes, with 94% of JPY and CHF opportunities existing at a difference of 1 [[basis point]], which translates into a potential arbitrage profit of $100 USD per $1 million USD transacted.&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009" /&gt;

Tests for [[seasonality]] in the amount and duration of triangular arbitrage opportunities have shown that incidence of arbitrage opportunities and mean duration is consistent from day to day. However, significant variations have been identified during different times of day. Transactions involving the JPY and CHF have demonstrated a smaller number of opportunities and long average duration around 01:00 and 10:00 [[UTC]], contrasted with a greater number of opportunities and short average duration around 13:00 and 16:00 UTC. Such variations in incidence and duration of arbitrage opportunities can be explained by variations in [[market liquidity]] during the trading day. For example, the foreign exchange market is found to be most liquid for Asia around 00:00 and 10:00 UTC, for Europe around 07:00 and 17:00 UTC, and for America around 13:00 and 23:00 UTC. The overall foreign exchange market is most liquid around 08:00 and 16:00 UTC, and the least liquid around 22:00 and 01:00 UTC. The periods of highest liquidity correspond with the periods of greatest incidence of opportunities for triangular arbitrage. This correspondence is substantiated by the observation of narrower bid-ask spreads during periods of high liquidity, resulting in a greater potential for mispricings and therefore arbitrage opportunities. However, market forces are driven to correct for mispricings due to a high frequency of trades that will trade away fleeting arbitrage opportunities.&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009" /&gt;

Researchers have shown a decrease in the incidence of triangular arbitrage opportunities from 2003 to 2005 for the Japanese yen and Swiss franc and have attributed the decrease to broader adoption of [[electronic trading platform]]s and [[algorithmic trading|trading algorithms]] during the same period. Such electronic systems have enabled traders to trade and react rapidly to price changes. The speed gained from these technologies improved trading efficiency and the correction of mispricings, allowing for less incidence of triangular arbitrage opportunities.&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009" /&gt;

==Profitability==
Mere existence of triangular arbitrage opportunities does not necessarily imply that a trading strategy seeking to exploit currency mispricings is consistently profitable. [[Electronic trading]] systems allow the three constituent trades in a triangular arbitrage transaction to be submitted very rapidly. However, there exists a delay between the identification of such an opportunity, the initiation of trades, and the arrival of trades to the party quoting the mispricing. Even though such delays are only milliseconds in duration, they are deemed significant. For example, if a trader places each trade as a [[limit order]] to be filled only at the arbitrage price and a price moves due to market activity or new price is quoted by the third party, then the triangular transaction will not be completed. In such a case, the arbitrageur will face a cost to close out the position that is equal to the change in price that eliminated the arbitrage condition.&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009" /&gt;

In the foreign exchange market there are many market participants competing for each arbitrage opportunity; for arbitrage to be profitable a trader would need to identify and execute each arbitrage opportunity faster than competitors. Competing arbitrageurs are expected to persist in striving to increase their execution speed of trades by engaging in what some researchers describe as an "electronic trading 'arms race'."&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009" /&gt; The costs involved in keeping ahead in such a competition present difficulty in consistently beating other arbitrageurs over the long term. Other factors such as [[transaction costs]], [[brokerage]] fees, network access fees, and sophisticated electronic trading platforms further challenge the feasibility of significant arbitrage profits over prolonged periods.&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009" /&gt;

'''''Up in the Air''''' is a 2009 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Jason Reitman]] and written by Reitman and [[Sheldon Turner]], based on the [[Up in the Air (novel)|2001 novel of the same name]], written by [[Walter Kirn]]. The story is centered on corporate "[[downsize]]r" Ryan Bingham ([[George Clooney]]) and his travels. [[Vera Farmiga]], [[Anna Kendrick]] and [[Danny McBride]] also star. Filming was primarily in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], which substituted for a number of other cities. Several scenes were filmed in [[Detroit]], [[Omaha]], [[Las Vegas]] and [[Miami]].

Reitman promoted ''Up in the Air'' with personal appearances at film festivals and other showings, starting with the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 5, 2009. The Los Angeles premiere was at the [[Fox Theater, Westwood Village|Mann Village Theater]] on November 30, 2009. [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] scheduled a limited North American release on December 4, 2009, broadening the release on December 11, 2009, with a wide release on December 23, 2009.

The [[National Board of Review]] and the [[Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association]] named ''Up in the Air'' the Best Picture of 2009. It received eight [[Broadcast Film Critics Association|Critics' Choice Movie Awards]] nominations and garnered a win for Adapted Screenplay, six [[67th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nominations, earning a win for Best Screenplay, and three [[16th Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild]] nominations. It received six [[82nd Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations and recognition from numerous critics' associations.

==Plot==
Ryan Bingham works for a [[human resources]] consultancy firm which specializes in [[termination of employment|termination]] assistance, and makes his living traveling to workplaces across the United States, conducting company layoffs and firings on behalf of employers. He also gives motivational speeches, using the analogy "What's in Your Backpack?" to extol the virtues of a life free of burdensome relationships with people as well as things. A frequent flyer, Ryan has no fixed abode, relishes his travels, and aspires to become the seventh and youngest person to earn ten million [[frequent-flyer program|frequent flyer]] miles with [[American Airlines]]. During his travels, he meets another frequent flyer named Alex, and they begin a [[casual relationship]].

Ryan is called back to his company's offices in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Natalie Keener, a young and ambitious new hire, promotes a program designed to cut costs by conducting layoffs via [[video conference|videoconferencing]]. Ryan raises concerns that the program could be seen as detached and apathetic, arguing that Natalie knows nothing about the reality of the firing process or how to handle upset people. He then plays the role of a fired employee to demonstrate her inexperience. Ryan's boss assigns him to bring Natalie on his next round of terminations to show her the ropes.

As they travel together, Natalie questions Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is adamant that he is more than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by [[text message]], and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. On the test run, the earlier concerns Ryan raised prove valid; one laid-off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and Natalie is unable to comfort him. Another threatens to commit suicide. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex in spite of their obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program. 

Instead of returning immediately to Omaha, Ryan convinces Alex to accompany him to his younger sister's wedding. He learns that the reason the couple had him take photos of a cutout picture of them in various places was because they cannot afford a [[honeymoon]]. When the groom gets [[cold feet]], Ryan's older sister talks Ryan into using his motivational skills to persuade the groom to go through with the wedding. Although this runs counter to Ryan's personal philosophy, he successfully argues that the important moments in life are rarely unshared. The wedding proceeds without any further hitches.

Ryan begins having second thoughts about his life and philosophies. As he starts delivering his "What's in Your Backpack?" speech at a convention in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], he realizes he no longer believes it, and walks off the stage. On an impulse, he flies to Alex's home in Chicago. When she opens the door, Ryan is stunned to discover she is married and has children, and leaves before her husband can suspect anything. She later tells him over the phone that her family is her real life and he is an escape.

On Ryan's flight home, the crew announces that he has just crossed the ten million mile mark, and a small celebration is thrown. The airline's chief pilot comes out of the cockpit to meet Ryan. He notes that Ryan is the youngest person to reach the milestone. When asked where he is from, a disheartened Ryan can only respond, "here."

Ryan calls the airline to transfer five hundred thousand miles each to his sister and brother-in-law, enough for them to fly around the world for their honeymoon. His boss tells Ryan that a woman he and Natalie fired during their travels has killed herself, and that an upset Natalie has quit via text message. The company also puts the remote-layoff program on hold.

Natalie applies for a job in San Francisco, where she was offered a job before following her now ex-boyfriend to Omaha. The interviewer is impressed by her qualifications and a glowing recommendation from Ryan, and hires her. The film concludes with Ryan standing in front of a vast destination board, looking up, and letting go of his luggage.

[[Canadian-American]] filmmaker [[Jason Reitman]] later came upon the novel (initially attracted by the [[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]] [[blurb]] on the cover) while browsing in the [[Los Angeles]] bookstore [[Book Soup]].&lt;ref name="VR1118012459"&gt;{{cite web|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|title=Reitman on origins of 'Air'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 9, 2009|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118012459.html|accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wrap012510"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pond|first=Steve|title='Up in the Air' Holds a Damage-Control Screening|work=[[The Wrap]]|date=January 25, 2010|url=http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/air-holds-damage-control-screening-13493|accessdate=January 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129040421/http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/air-holds-damage-control-screening-13493|archive-date=2010-01-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reitman persuaded his father, Canadian-American filmmaker [[Ivan Reitman]], to purchase the book's film rights, and the elder Reitman commissioned a screenplay from [[Ted Griffin]] and Nicholas Griffin, who used some elements from Turner's script in their work. Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the original script that was (unbeknownst to Reitman) written by Turner. Some Turner inventions that were used in the film include Ryan's boilerplate termination speech ("Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you're sitting right now..."), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryan's partner (written by Turner as male).&lt;ref name="wrap012510"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LAT 2010-01-15"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeitchik|first=Steven|title=Screenwriting credits, floating up in the air|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 15, 2010|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/01/james-cameron-jason-reitman-anthony-minghella-avatar.html|accessdate=January 16, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119021056/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/01/james-cameron-jason-reitman-anthony-minghella-avatar.html|archive-date=2010-01-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reitman initially attempted to claim sole credit for writing the film, then later admitted to confusion when the [[Writers Guild of America]] ruled that he should share credit with Turner, whose script Reitman claimed to have never read.

While filming in St. Louis and Detroit, Reitman placed an ad in the paper asking if people who recently lost their job wanted to be in a documentary about job loss. He specified "documentary" in the ad so that actors would not respond. Reitman was amazed by how many people of different age, race, and gender were willing to speak frankly about what happened and what a cathartic experience it had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCollum|first=Charlie|title=Jason Reitman flies high with 'Up In the Air'|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=December 3, 2009|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainment/ci_13903281?source=rss&amp;nclick_check=1|accessdate=December 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629111843/http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainment/ci_13903281?source=rss&amp;nclick_check=1|archive-date=2011-06-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film crew received a startling 100 responses, including 60 people filmed (30 in Detroit and 30 in St. Louis).&lt;ref name="MOL 2009-11-27"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Sheila|title=Jason Reitman Interview, Up in the Air|work=Movies on Line|date=November 27, 2009|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17517.html|accessdate=November 29, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129014355/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_17517.html|archive-date=2009-11-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-two are seen in the film.&lt;ref name="Final Credits"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Up in the Air'' End Title Credits|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]|url=http://www.paramount.com/webmaster/assets/synopsis/30/UITA%20Final%20End%20Credits.pdf|accessdate=December 11, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215142439/http://www.paramount.com/webmaster/assets/synopsis/30/UITA%20Final%20End%20Credits.pdf|archivedate=February 15, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interviews ran for about ten minutes on what it is like to lose their job in this poor economy, and after that they would "fire" them on camera and ask them to either respond the way they did the day they lost their job or, if they preferred, the way they wished they had responded.&lt;ref name="CB 2009-11-05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HR 2009-09-12"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeitchik|first=Steven|title='Up in the Air's' recession-themed flight plan|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 12, 2009|url=http://riskybusiness.blogs.thr.com/2009/09/12/jason-reitman-toronto-up-in-the-air/|accessdate=September 13, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130105021434/http://riskybusiness.blogs.thr.com/2009/09/12/jason-reitman-toronto-up-in-the-air/#|archive-date=2013-01-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ 2009-09-13"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Anthony|title=Toronto Film Festival: George Clooney's "Up In the Air" Spotlights Economic Trouble|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=September 13, 2009|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/09/13/toronto-film-festival-george-clooneys-up-in-the-air-spotlights-economic-trouble/|accessdate=September 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915181723/http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/09/13/toronto-film-festival-george-clooneys-up-in-the-air-spotlights-economic-trouble/|archive-date=2009-09-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reitman needed fifty days to film ''Up in the Air'', eight of which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots turned out to be more difficult than expected. He was unable to use three days of the aerial filming. Many aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are seen in the Paramount trailer, but are not used in the film. The pilot who flies the Boeing 747 that carried the [[space shuttle]] flew the aircraft for the aerial shots.&lt;ref name="SFilm 2009-09-16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FS 2009-09-16" /&gt;

===Editing===
The post-production schedule for ''Up in the Air'' was shorter than [[Jason Reitman]]'s previous two films. The editing team had only 16 to 17 weeks post-schedule, whereas an editing deadline is usually from 22 to 26 weeks. Reitman was involved in post-production while shooting. The film was shot entirely on location and Glauberman stayed in Los Angeles to cut. She would send him scenes every day or every other day as she finished them, and he would view them. He flew home every weekend to work with her for a few hours on Saturday or Sunday in order to stay on schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vanairsdale|first=S.T.|title=Meet Dana E. Glauberman, Jason Reitman's Editor Extraordinaire|work=Movieline|date=November 4, 2009|url=http://www.movieline.com/2009/11/meet-dana-e-glauberman-jason-reitmans-editor-extraordinaire.php?page=all|accessdate=November 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311023611/http://www.movieline.com/2009/11/meet-dana-e-glauberman-jason-reitmans-editor-extraordinaire.php?page=all#|archive-date=2010-03-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editing helped determine how nonverbal moments shape the first meeting between Ryan and Alex, who become lovers. "In a scene like that, there is a sort of playfulness that goes on," editor, [[Dana E. Glauberman]] said. "There were little looks that they gave each other. Sometimes I stayed a beat longer on a take to get that little sparkle in their eyes... You can see a lot of playfulness in the quick cuts back and forth when they are teasing each other, but then there are also certain moments that Vera would give a little raise of an eyebrow, or George would give the same thing. Those tiny nuances are really helpful to show their character and show what they are after."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Giardina|first=Carolyn|title=Hidden key to thesps' success: editors|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 10, 2009|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118012549.html|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Up in the Air (soundtrack)}}
''Up in the Air: Music from the Motion Picture''  is the official soundtrack to the film, released by [[Warner Music]] on November 9, 2009,&lt;ref name="itunes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/up-in-air-music-from-motion/id340220551|title=Up In the Air (Music from the Motion Picture)|publisher=[[iTunes]]|accessdate=August 2, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827203709/http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/up-in-air-music-from-motion/id340220551|archive-date=2010-08-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and composed by [[Rolfe Kent]], who recorded his score with a 55-piece ensemble of the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]] at the Sony Scoring Stage. It was orchestrated by [[Tony Blondal]].&lt;ref name="scoring"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldwasser|first=Dan|url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/201/|title=Rolfe Kent scores ''Up in the Air''|publisher=ScoringSessions.com|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate=October 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401233919/http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/201/|archive-date=2010-04-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Renick wrote the song "Up in the Air" two years prior to knowing that Reitman was working on a film adaptation to the book.&lt;ref name="SLPD 2009-11-13"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Joe|title='Up in the Air' gives St. Louis musician a big break|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=November 13, 2009|url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/entertainment/stories.nsf/0/DBC742F56E55E1338625766B006F041C|accessdate=November 14, 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=Balon Greyjoy |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been laid off at the time, and was an unrecorded, unemployed St. Louis musician. When Renick researched the film he discovered that the theme of the film was much the same as the song he had written. "The song is about uncertainty, disconnection and loneliness, while alluding to career transition," Renick explained. "It's a melancholy song, and a narrative about finding out where your life's going to go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wichern|first=Amanda|title="Up In The Air": A dream came true for Kirkwood High grad Kevin Renick when his song was featured in new George Clooney movie|work=Webster-Kirkwood Times|date=December 4, 2009|url=http://www.websterkirkwoodtimes.com/Articles-i-2009-12-04-167861.113118_Up_In_The_Air.html|accessdate=December 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225012521/http://www.websterkirkwoodtimes.com/Articles-i-2009-12-04-167861.113118_Up_In_The_Air.html|archive-date=2014-12-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He handed a cassette to Reitman after the director did an interview at [[Webster University]]. Renick included a spoken-word introduction about the song on the cassette so that Reitman would know why he was given the song. Reitman found a tape deck, listened, liked the song and placed the original introduction and song from the cassette midway through the credits. Reitman stated that the song has a do-it-yourself authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pond|first=Steve|title='Up in the Air' Sounds Great, Too|work=The Wrap|date=October 7, 2009|url=http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/air-it-sounds-great-too-8359|accessdate=October 30, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011104029/http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/air-it-sounds-great-too-8359|archive-date=2009-10-11|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitlock|first=Cordell|author2=Bush, Mike|title=St. Louisan pens title track for locally filmed "Up In The Air"|work=[[KSDK]]|date=November 9, 2009|url=http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=189284|accessdate=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Held|first=Kevin|title=Kevin Renick delighted to hear his song in "Up In The Air" credits|work=[[KSDK]]|date=December 11, 2009|url=http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=191662&amp;catid=3|accessdate=December 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reitman heavily promoted ''Up in the Air'' with personal appearances at film festivals and other showings. He stated that he could relate to and enjoys the idea of Ryan Bingham's lifestyle. "Yesterday &lt;nowiki&gt;[October 28, 2009]&lt;/nowiki&gt; I took my 10th flight in 10 days so I live that life myself and I kinda enjoy it," Reitman said, "I think when you're in an airplane it's the last refuge for the people who enjoy being alone and reading a book."&lt;ref name="News 8 Austin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Diaz|first=Victor|title=Clooney's newest movie closes Austin Film Festival|work=[[News 8 Austin]]|date=October 29, 2009|url=http://www.news8austin.com/content/your_news/default.asp?ArID=257091|accessdate=October 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reitman documented his experiences promoting the film. He took photos of everyone who interviewed him and recorded videos in every city he visited.

Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' praised the film's sense of timeliness, writing, "It's tough to capture an era while it's still happening, yet ''Up in the Air'' does so brilliantly, with wit and humanity...

''Shave Magazine''{{'s}} Jake Tomlinson gave the film four out of five stars and wrote, "There is a very strong sense of humor as well as emotional depth, yet the scope of the film sometimes limits these sentiments.

The '''Washington Redskins trademark dispute''' was a legal effort by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who consider the term "[[redskin (slang)|redskin]]" to be an offensive and disparaging racial slur to prevent the owners of the [[Washington Redskins]] football team from being able to maintain federal [[trademark]] protection for this name. These efforts have primarily been carried forward in two cases brought before the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO). While prevailing in the most recent case in which the trademarks were cancelled, petitioners have withdrawn for further litigation now that the legal issue has become moot due to a decision in another case which found the relevant portion of the trademark law to be an unconstitutional infringement on [[freedom of speech]].

==''Harjo'' case==
The first action in the dispute occurred in 1992, when [[Suzan Shown Harjo]], President of the Morning Star Institute, with six other prominent Native Americans represented by the [[Dorsey &amp; Whitney]] law firm of Minneapolis, petitioned the USPTO to cancel the trademark registrations owned by the Redskins' corporate entity of Pro-Football, Inc.  They based their lawsuit on the claim that federal trademark law states that certain trademark registrations are not legal if they are "disparaging, scandalous, contemptuous, or disreputable." The legal battle went on for seven years. In 1999 the PTO judges canceled the federal registration of the mark REDSKINS "on the grounds that the subject marks may disparage Native Americans and may bring them into contempt or disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davin L Seamon|title=Trademark Sensitivity: Learning from the Washington Redskins|journal=The [[National Law Review]]|date=8 July 2014|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/trademark-sensitivity-learning-washington-redskins|accessdate=31 July 2014|publisher=Steptoe &amp; Johnson PLLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners appealed the decision to a district court in the District of Columbia in ''[[Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo]]''. The court reversed the USPTO's decision on the grounds of insufficient evidence of disparagement. Subsequent appeals have been rejected on the basis of ''[[Laches (equity)|laches]],'' which means that the specific Native American plaintiffs had pursued their rights in an untimely and delayed manner. In 2009 the Supreme Court declined to take up the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Washington Redskins can keep team name; Supreme Court refuses native Americans' suit| accessdate = November 15, 2015| url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2009/1116/p02s07-usju.html| author=Warren Richey| publisher=The Christian Science Monitor| date=November 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related trademark actions==
Since 1992, the USPTO has rejected eleven applications for other trademarks that included the word redskins, based on the same reason of disparagement. Some of the applications were made by Pro-Football, Inc., including "Washington Redskins Cheerleaders",&lt;ref name="Theresa Vargas"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/local/wp/2014/01/28/from-pork-rinds-to-cheerleaders-the-trademark-office-rejects-the-word-redskins/|title=

==''Blackhorse'' case==
A second case was filed, ''Blackhorse v. Pro-Football, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qt=adv&amp;pno=92046185|title=United States Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with younger plaintiffs whose standing might not be hindered by laches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2013/05/09/native-americans-washington-mascot-fight/2148877/|title=New generation of Native Americans challenges Redskins|newspaper=USA Today|author=Erik Brady|date=May 10, 2013|accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 18, 2014, the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] (TTAB) of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) voted to cancel the six trademarks held by the team in a two-to-one decision that held that the term "redskins" is disparaging to a "substantial composite of Native Americans", and this is demonstrated "by the near complete drop-off in usage of 'redskins' as a reference to Native Americans beginning in the 1960s." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/19/sports/football/us-patent-office-cancels-redskins-trademark-registration.html?_r=0|title=U.S. Patent Office Cancels Redskins Trademark Registration|author1=KEN BELSON|author2=EDWARD WYATT|date=June 18, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92046185&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=199|title=USPTO TTABVUE. Proceeding Number 92046185|publisher=''United States Patent and Trademark Office|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trademark board asked two questions in determining disparagement:  1)  what is the meaning of the mark as it appears in connection with the goods and services in the registrations and 2) is the meaning of the marks one that may be disparaging.  The questions are to be answered in the context of the respective dates of registration of each mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeMarte|first1=Luke W.|title=Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Cancels Six REDSKINS Trademark Registrations|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/trademark-trial-and-appeal-board-cancels-six-redskins-trademark-registrations|accessdate=31 July 2014|work=The National Law Review|publisher=Michael Best &amp; Friedrich LLP|date=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of disparagement submitted by the petitioners in the case include the frequent references to "scalping" made by sportswriters for sixty years when reporting the Redskins loss of a game,&lt;ref name="words"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lindseyadler/redskins-puns-in-sports-headlines|title=60 Years Of Shocking Redskins Headlines:A sampling of violent wordplay.|date=June 18, 2014|author=Lindsey Adler|publisher=BuzzFeed}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passages from movies made from the 1940s to the 1960s using "redskin" to refer to Native Americans as a savage enemy.&lt;ref name="movies"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dc-sports-bog/wp/2014/06/18/here-are-some-of-the-movie-clips-cited-in-the-redskins-trademark-case/|title=Here are some of the movie clips cited in the Redskins trademark case|author=Dan Steinberg|date=June 18, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; A linguistics expert for the team unsuccessfully argued that the name is merely a descriptive term no different than other uses of color to differentiate people by race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/06/dan-snyder-and-the-redskins-take-a-loss.html|date=June 18, 2014|title=Dan Snyder and the Redskins Take a Loss|author=Jay Caspian Kang|publisher=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TTAB also found that the term "redskin" refers to Native Americans (rather than having an "independent meaning" as the team sometimes claimed) as shown by the costumes worn by both the cheerleaders and marching band from the 1960s until the 1980s, and the native imagery used on the press guides for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thinkprogress.org/sports/2014/06/18/3450434/7-things-that-convinced-the-us-patent-office-to-cancel-the-redskins-trademark/|title=7 Things That Convinced The U.S. Patent Office To Cancel The Redskins Trademark|author=Judd Legum|date=June 18, 2014|publisher=ThinkProgress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release the trademark attorney for the team stated that they were confident that they would once again prevail on appeal, and that today's decision will make no difference in the continued use of the Redskins name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.redskins.com/pdf/Statement-by-Bob-Raskopf-Trademark-Attorney-for-the-Washington-Redskins.pdf|title=STATEMENT BY BOB RASKOPF, TRADEMARK ATTORNEY FOR THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS|date=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaintiff [[Amanda Blackhorse]], a social worker and member of the Navajo Nation, said in an interview, "We’ve been through this process for eight years now. We will continue to fight. And, you know, this is not the end for us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The political columnist [[George Will]] portrayed the case as an example of  overreach by government regulatory agencies, arguing that there was an "absence of general or Native American revulsion" toward the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.washingtonpost.com/opinions/george-f-will-the-government-decided-that-redskins-bothers-you/2014/06/27/669558a6-fd54-11e3-932c-0a55b81f48ce_story.html|title=The government decided that ‘Redskins’ bothers you|author=George F.

However, in the opinion of one [[intellectual property]] law firm, the team "may be hesitant to sue another for infringing its marks because of the risk that a court could possibly determine that the team has no protectable interest in the name because of its disparaging nature".&lt;ref name="wcsr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsr.com/Insights/Articles/2014/June/US-Trademark-Trial-and-Appeal-Board-Finds-REDSKINS-Trademark-Disparaging|date=June 18, 2014|title=U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Finds REDSKINS Trademark Disparaging… Again: Five Things to Know About This Decision|publisher=Womble Carlyle Sandridge &amp; Rice, LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Appeal of Blackhorse decision===
The Washington Redskins filed its appeal in the Blackhorse case on August 14, 2014, stating their belief "that the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) ignored both federal case law and the weight of the evidence". They also cite infringement of their First Amendment right to free expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2014/08/14/washington-redskins-appeal-federal-trademark-registrations/14066527/|title=Washington Redskins appeal decision to cancel trademark|author1=Erik Brady|author2=Megan Finnerty|publisher=USA TODAY Sports|date=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, 2014 the Native Americans asked that the team's appeal be dismissed because it names them as individuals, which is contrary to federal law, and because the appeal was filed with the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, VA, stating that the Redskins should have filed its case against the patent office in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/native-americans-seek-dismissal-of-redskins-lawsuit-in-trademark-case/2014/09/22/fc9fc362-418e-11e4-b437-1a7368204804_story.html|title=Native Americans seek dismissal of Redskins lawsuit against them in trademark case|author=Ian Shapira|date=September 22, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Oct, 2014 Judge Gerald B. Lee rejected the Native American plaintiffs' attempts to have the team's appeal dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20141031/ap/310319835/1588&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice]] entered the case in a limited way by stating that it will defend the constitutionality of the trademark law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/justice-department-intervenes-in-redskins-trademark-protection-lawsuit/2015/01/09/5840c07c-9815-11e4-8005-1924ede3e54a_story.html| title=Justice Department intervenes in Redskins trademark protection lawsuit| author=Ian Shapira| date=January 9, 2015| newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU filed an Amicus brief&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.aclu.org/free-speech/pro-football-inc-v-blackhorse-aclu-amicus-brief| title=Pro-Football, Inc. v. Blackhorse - ACLU Amicus Brief | accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that while it found the name Redskins repellant, the government should not be able to decide what types of speech are forbidden, and that the provision of the Lanham Act barring the trademark of disparaging terms is unconstitutionally vague in its wording and has not been applied with consistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/415115/aclu-begrudgingly-comes-redskins-defense-andrew-johnson| title=ACLU Begrudgingly Comes to the Redskins’ Defense| author=Andrew Johnson| date=March 9, 2015| publisher=The National Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23, 2015, the Attorney General's Office filed a brief addressing the Constitutional issues, stating that as commercial speech, the team name and logo are not protected by the First Amendment, and that there is a large number of cases supporting the cancellation of the trademarks. The brief also stated that the court should also reject the claim that the cancellation of trademarks constitutes an illegal taking of valuable property which is barred by the Fifth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.richmond.com/pdf_463aa741-050a-51c4-bf3d-2a0a6914a2d5.html| title= Brief supporting cancellation of Redskins trademarks| date=March 24, 2015| newspaper=Richmond Times-Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; By opening up an inquiry into constitutional issues regarding limits on disparaging speech in order to protect "the unique cultural heritage" of the American Indian population, the case may go well beyond what a football team calls itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2015/01/constitution-check-is-the-first-amendment-on-the-side-of-a-pro-football-teams-name/| title=Constitution Check: Is the First Amendment on the side of a pro football team’s name?| date=January 13, 2015| author=Lyle Denniston| publisher=National Constitution Center| accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Navajo Nation]] filed an [[amicus curiae]] brief in support of the decision to cancel the trademarks, due to Pro-Football, Inc. stating in its appeal that individual members of the Navajo Nation such as former chairman Peter McDonald do not find the name disparaging. The brief states that these individuals speak only for themselves, while the tribe’s elected, appointed and traditional leaders speak for the Navajo people and present “unified opposition” to the team name because it is disparaging and has a negative psychological effect on tribal members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.abqjournal.com/728673/news/navajo-attorneys-file-brief-against-redskins-trademark.html| title=Navajo attorneys file brief against Redskins trademark| author=Noel Lyn Smith| date=February 23, 2016| work=Albuquerque Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2015, Judge Lee affirmed the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/ProFootball%20Blackhorse%20opinion.pdf| title=Memorandum Opinion and Order, Pro-Football, Inc. v. Blackhorse, et al. | accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Lee denied the team's summary judgment motions challenging the constitutionality of the Lanham Act and granted the Blackhorse Defendants' summary judgment motions, finding that "the evidence before the Court supports the legal conclusion that...the Redskin Marks consisted of matter that 'may disparage' a substantial composite of Native Americans." The decision does not bar the team from using the marks going forward, and the order itself is subject to further appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13220885/federal-judge-upholds-washington-redskins-trademark-ruling| title=Judge upholds ruling against Redskins trademark; team can appeal| date=July 8, 2015| author=Associated Press| publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team president Bruce Allen expressed surprise at the decision, and that a summary judgement was made by the judge based upon the evidence submitted rather than proceeding to a trial. While the team continues to have certain rights to its trademarks, it must take action to protect those rights individually. The cancellation of federal registration of the trademarks means that the government will no longer take any action against anyone else using the name or logo, such as blocking counterfeit goods from being imported into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/07/08/bruce-allen-surprised-by-ruling-to-uphold-redskins-trademark-cancellation/| title=Bruce Allen ‘Surprised’ by Ruling to Uphold ‘Redskins’ Trademark Cancellation| author=Chris Lingebach| date=July 8, 2015| publisher=CBS DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2015 Pro-Football, Inc. filed its appeal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/Pro-Football%20opening%20brief.pdf| title=No. 15-1874| date=October 30, 2015| accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In addition to maintaining the validity of all the arguments rejected by both the TTAB and the first appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202741520572/Seeking-to-Salvage-Trademark-Redskins-Big-Firm-Lawyers-Get-Dirty?mcode=1202617075486&amp;curindex=0&amp;slreturn=20151004202545| title=Seeking to Salvage Trademark, Redskins’ Lawyers Get Dirty| author=Scott Flaherty| publisher=The Am Law Daily| date=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team has added a list of offensive names that have been given trademarks, thus claiming unequal treatment.

These cases prompted a range of opinions from law professors.
*Megan M. Carpenter, a professor and co-director of the Center for Law and Intellectual Property at the [[Texas A&amp;M University School of Law]]: Trademark law should not be used to make moral decisions, which change over time, and notes that the law has been applied unevenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/04/redskins-and-other-troubling-trademarks/trademark-law-promotes-fair-competition-not-morality| title=Trademark Law Promotes Fair Competition, Not Morality| author=Megan M. Carpenter| date=May 4, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Christine Haight Farley, a professor at [[American University Washington College of Law]]: A distinction should be made between trademarks and government registration. Protection of free speech may allow any trademark to be used, but registration places a seal of approval which should not be given to racist trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/04/redskins-and-other-troubling-trademarks/trademark-restrictions-permit-free-speech-without-approving-offensive-speech| title=Trademark Restrictions Permit Free Speech Without Approving Offensive Speech| author=Christine Haight Farley| date=May 4, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Sonia Katyal, professor of law and faculty co-director of the [[UC Berkeley School of Law#Centers at Berkeley Law|Berkeley Center for Law and Technology]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]: A distinction should be made between a racially sensitive trademark being used ironically by the targets of racism in order to reclaim it, and one used offensively. In addition, denying registration is not limiting speech, since the trademark may be used without government protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/04/redskins-and-other-troubling-trademarks/trademark-officials-must-distinguish-between-irony-and-offense| title=Trademark Law Promotes Fair Competition, Not Morality| author=Sonia Katyal| date=May 4, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ashutosh Bhagwat, professor of constitutional law at the [[University of California, Davis]], School of Law: Banning any trademark is an unconstitutional violation of free speech protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/04/redskins-and-other-troubling-trademarks/banning-trademarks-called-offensive-violates-free-speech| title=Trademark Law Promotes Fair Competition, Not Morality| author=Ashutosh Bhagwat| date=May 4, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court review==
Both the USPTO and Pro-Football, Inc. requested a review by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] (SCOTUS) of the same legal issue, the constitutionality of banning a disparaging trademark. The USPTO appealed the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which found in December 2015 that part of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional. That case ([[Matal v. Tam]]) involved the denial of a trademark for an Asian-American rock band, "The Slants". The National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA) filed an amicus brief supporting the constitutionality of the Lanham Act, NAPABA President Cyndie Chang stating “Racial slurs should not be recognized as commercial speech through federally-protected trademarks. “Freedom of speech does not require that the government allow racially derogatory terms to be trademarked so that a trademark owner can have exclusive rights to use and monetize such terms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://aapress.com/editorial/napaba-disagrees-with-band-in-trademark-case/| title=NAPABA disagrees with band in trademark case| date=January 21, 2017| publisher=Asian American Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, 2017 the court ruled unanimously in favor of Tam, the majority opinion stating "The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. Contrary to the Government’s contention, trademarks are private, not government speech."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=15-1293 Martal V. Tam|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1293_1o13.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Native American petitioners and the Justice Department have withdrawn from any further litigation now that the Supreme Court has rendered the legal issue moot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington Redskins win trademark fight over the team’s name|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/2017/06/29/a26f52f0-5cf6-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html|accessdate=30 June 2017| author1=Ian Shapira| author2=Ann E.

[[File:Police and Fire Hockey (19275390946).jpg|thumb|[[Ice Hockey]] at the 2015 games in Fairfax, Virginia]]
The '''World Police and Fire Games''' (WPFG) is a biennial athletic event, open to active and retired law enforcement and fire service personnel throughout the world. The WPFG Federation is an arm of the California Police Athletic Federation (CPAF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Police &amp; Fire Games At A Glance|url=http://www.cpaf.org/wpfg|publisher=CPAF|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American non-profit organization.

The Games attract approximately 10,000 entrants, slightly fewer than the Summer [[Olympic Games]], and exceeding the third position holder, the [[Commonwealth Games]]. In the early 2010s, [[The United Kingdom]] hosted all three events consecutively; the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]], [[England]], followed by the 2013 World Police and Fire Games in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], and ending with [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], hosting the 2014 [[Commonwealth Games]] - the first time all three events have been hosted by the same nation consecutively.

The host city of the 2015 World Police and Fire Game was [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], in the United States, with venues located around the [[Washington metropolitan area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Police &amp; Fire Games, Fairfax 2015|url=http://fairfax2015.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pier 95 Irene France WPFG jeh.jpg|thumb|French team in New York on a day [[Hurricane Irene|a hurricane]] cancelled competition in 2011]]
The California Police Olympics were first held in 1967. The concept evolved over the years and led to the creation of the World Police &amp; Fire Games Federation—a non-profit organization, run by the Californian Police Athletics Federation—in 1983. Two years later, in 1985, the first World Police &amp; Fire Games were held in [[San Jose, California]], USA, with nearly 5,000 competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2011wpfg.org/WPFGHistory/tabid/56/Default.aspx History of the World Police &amp; Fire Games]. 2011 World Police &amp; Fire Games. Retrieved 2011-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest WPFG games to date was held in New York, New York, USA with over 16,000 athletes in attendance, from 59 nations.&lt;ref name=2015Fairfax/&gt;

The most successful and best organised was in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23589848 BBC News - In pictures: World Police and Fire Games 2013]. Bbc.co.uk (2013-08-08). Retrieved on 2014-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; It was described, by the President of the World Police and Fire Games Federation, Mike Graham, as "the friendliest and best Games ever".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23649271 BBC News - WPFG 'best and friendliest ever', says president of games].

The Montreal Firefighters Association has called for a boycott of the 2017 Games, which are to be held in their own city, in protest against forced changes to their collective agreements and pension funds by the City of Montreal and the Quebec provincial government. Labor unions representing over 100,000 firefighters and civil servants have joined Montreal's firefighters in this boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/firefighters-boycotting-2017-world-firefighters-games-in-montreal-1.3149582 | title=Firefighters boycotting 2017 World Firefighters Games in Montreal | publisher=CBC News | work=Kate McKenna | date=15 July 2015 | accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wpfg2017.com/ | title=Montreal World Police and Fire Games Boycott | publisher=Montreal World Police and Fire Games | accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
