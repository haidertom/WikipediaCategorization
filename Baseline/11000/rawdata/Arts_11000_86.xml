Aerial modern dance is a [[genre|subgenre]] of [[modern dance]] first recognized in the [[United States]] in the 1970s. The [[choreography]] incorporates an apparatus that is often attached to the ceiling, allowing performers to explore space in three dimensions. The ability to incorporate vertical, as well as horizontal movement paths, allows for [[innovation]]s in choreography and movement.

==Overview==
There are two types of aerial dance. In vertical dance a dancer is suspended in a harness from a rope or cable and explores the difference in gravity, weightlessness and varied movement possibilities offered by the suspended state. In the second type a dancer or acrobat intertwines the use of the floor or a wall with their aerial apparatus. The first utilizes the strength and expression of dance with an altered state to communicate contemporary ideas. In the second, the dancer uses dance as a way to indicate that their work is less trick-based than circus arts, and in some cases hopes that disassociating with the circus makes their work appear more contemporary and artistic.

One of the first choreographers to utilize what we now think of as aerial dance was Trisha Brown. She called her dances (1968–1971) "equipment pieces". Please see the video of a reproduction of one of her early pieces. They are not “dancey” pieces, but by placing the pedestrians on the side wall, Brown illustrates the choreography of everyday movement. She was notably the first choreographer to pull dancers up into the air. She choreographed multiple pieces off the ground, some involving projection and multimedia, using air and wall surfaces in novel ways.

In the late '90s an Argentinian aerial dance troupe named De La Guarda gained notoriety in London for their show combining performance art with aerial dance. The troupe is no longer touring, but some previous members have started a new company called Cuerda Producciones that continues to create aerial dance theater pieces.

Wanda Moretti of Italy is creating a vertical dance network aimed at collecting knowledge for artists and professionals in the field. Moretti says, “From its beginning 30 years ago, vertical dance evolved from the multiple practices and influences of its initial instigators. It was born from the desire to explore space, environment and become a place where everything was possible.”

Aerial modern pieces, whether [[Solo (dance)|solo]] or ensemble, often involve partnering. The apparatus used has its own motion, which changes the way a dancer must move in response. The introduction of a new element changes the dancer’s balance, center, and orientation in space. Aerial modern dancers gather annually for workshops in [[Boulder, Colorado]], [[County Donegal]] in [[Ireland]], [[Brittany]], in [[France]], and [[Italy]].

In Boulder, Frequent Flyers Productions produces the Aerial Dance Festival which been held every year since its inception in July 1999. Here workshops, performances, and discussions bring together dancers, [[Gymnastics|gymnasts,]] [[circus]] artists, and other aerial enthusiasts to showcase their own works and learn about new developments in technique and technology.

In Brittany, in northern France, the festival is called ''Les Rencontres Danse Aeriennes'' (LRDA, or "Aerial Dance Encounters") and was founded in 2008 by Fred Deb.

The Irish Aerial Dance Festival is organised by Fidget Feet, an aerial dance theatre company based in Ireland, run by artistic directors Chantal McCormick and Jym Daly.  It is held every year in Letterkenny, County Donegal, Ireland.

Lindsey Butcher of Gravity &amp; Levity, based in Brighton, England, runs the European Aerial Dance Festival in Brighton, England every summer.

Fred Deb was one of the forerunners of aerial dance using fabric in France. Deb started her company Drapés Aériens in 2001. She has choreographed and conceived many works in collaboration with Jacques Bertrand.  Originally a dancer by training, Bertrand is her assistant, partner, and technical director.

Another early influence on aerial modern dance, Terry Sendgraff, is credited with inventing the "motivity" trapeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.terrysendgraff.com/about.html|title=Terry Sendgraff - About Terry|website=www.terrysendgraff.com|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sendgraff actively performed, choreographed and taught in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] from the early 1970s, until announcing her retirement in 2005 at the age of 70, when she handed over her aerial dance business to Cherie Carson. The motivity trapeze came about as a result of an exploration on a low-hung circus trapeze. The ropes twisted together, causing the apparatus to spin. By formalizing this, hooking both ropes to a single point of attachment, Ms. Sendgraff used the apparatus to spin, twist, as well as fly in a straight line and in a circle.

In Italy, an emerging aerial dance company, brought the contemporary dance discipline to a vertical stage. The performance of the Company is distinguished from others by the details of the choreography and the harmony of the movement, typical elements of classic dance. Aerial dance is an art form that is incredibly demanding and requires a high degree of strength, power, flexibility, courage, and grace to practice.

The first and only book detailing the history of aerial dance was ''Aerial Dance'' by Jayne C. Bernasconi and Nancy E. Smith, published in 1988 by Human Kinetics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humankinetics.com/products/all-products/aerial-dance&lt;/ref&gt;

Aerial dance mixes strength and beauty. The practice of Acrobatic Tissue brings a lot of benefits to the practitioner:
* Strength
* Flexibility
* Agility
* Resistance
* Musculature
* Overcoming fear of height and drops
* Works artistic expression
* Breathing
* Determination
* Self-confidence
* Memory (to memorize the sequences of movements)
* Group work (it is necessary to trust your partner or teacher)

==Site dance==
Other examples of aerial modern dance are the site-specific works of Joanna Haigood of the Zaccho Dance Theatre, Amelia Rudolph of "[[Project Bandaloop]]," [[Sally Jacques]]' Blue Lapis Light  and Karen A. Fuhrman of Grounded Aerial. Haigood’s work is based on careful research of the [[history]], [[architecture]] and [[Society|societal]] impact of found spaces, and the translation of these memories into the movements performed in that space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaccho.org/director.html Zaccho Dance Theatre web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115071741/http://www.zaccho.org/director.html |date=January 15, 2011 }} - Artistic Directory Joanna Haigood&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Lapis Light|url=http://bluelapislight.org|website=Blue Lapis Light: Site-Specific Aerial Dance|accessdate=27 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219223133/http://bluelapislight.org/|archivedate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Project Bandaloop combines rock-[[climbing]] with dance in performances that scale and/or descend [[canyon]]s, rock walls, and tall buildings across the world. Video of their outdoor work is sometimes integrated into indoor performances, projected onto screens or [[trampoline]]s behind the dancers on stage. Blue Lapis Light uses multiple apparatuses, such as aerial silks, harnesses, and bungees to create dances on bridges, office buildings, hotels, and other outdoor spaces.

|}
The '''''Four Allegories''''' is a series of four small [[panel painting]]s in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], [[Venice]], Italy by the Italian Renaissance master [[Giovanni Bellini]], whose date has been variously argued as different points in the range 1490–1504.  They all measure 34 (''Perseverance'') or 32 × 22&amp;nbsp;cm in size.

==History==

Originally, the four panels probably decorated a small bathroom cabinet in [[walnut]] wood, provided with a mirror and rack, owned by the painter Vincenzo Catena. In his will, he left the cabinet to Antonio Marsili. At the time, these cabinets were rather widespread, and a decree issued by the Venetian Senate in 1489 had attempted to limit their construction. They were often decorated by symbolic figures with moral symbolism.

==Description==
The panels constitute a rare item in Bellini's production, though they have been usually compared to his ''[[Holy Allegory (Bellini)|Holy Allegory]]'' in the [[Uffizi]], and the Accademia has another such panel by Bellini or possibly [[Andrea Previtali]], an allegory of ''Fortune'' (27 × 19&amp;nbsp;cm) from a different origin. 

[[Courage|''Perseverance'']] shows a virtuous warrior to whom [[Bacchus]] is offering fruit from a wagon pulled by [[putto]]es. It has been described also as an allegory of [[lust]]. The ''Fortune'', or ''Inconstancy'', shows a woman on an unstable boat, surrounded by puttoes, holding a sphere. The ''Prudence'' depicts a naked woman pointing out a mirror; it has been differently interpreted as ''Vanity'' also.

''Falsehood'' shows a man (different from the usual representation as a woman) exiting a shell, symbol of crookedness of lies. Armed with a snake (symbol of [[:wiktionary:calumny|calumny]]), he is assailing what resembles a hermit, who is setting for the wisdom path from a pedestal, where is also the artist's signature. This figure has been also interpreted as the ''Virtus Sapientia'' ("virtue of the wisdom"), the shell being a positive symbol of generation.

[[File:Amarakosha.jpg|thumb|Cover of a modern copy of Amara kosha]]
{{italic title}}
The '''Amarakosha''' ([[Devanagari]]: अमरकोशः, [[IAST]]: Amarakośa) is the popular name for ''Namalinganushasanam'' ([[Devanagari]]: नामलिङ्गानुशासनम्,  [[IAST]]: Nāmaliṅgānuśāsanam) a [[thesaurus]] in [[Sanskrit]] written by the ancient Indian scholar [[Amarasimha]]. It is the oldest extant kosha.{{cn|date=July 2016}} The author himself mentions 18 prior works, but they have all been lost. There have been more than 40 commentaries on the ''Amarakosha''.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Etymology==
The word "Amarakosha" derives from the Sanskrit words ''amara'' ("immortal") and ''kosha'' ("treasure, casket, pail, collection, dictionary").
The actual name of the book "Namalinganushasanam" means "instruction concerning nouns and gender".{{cn|date=July 2016}}

== Author ==
{{main article|Amara Sinha}}
Amarasimha is said to have been one of the [[Navaratnas]] ("nine gems") at the court of [[Chandragupta II]], a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] king who reigned around AD 400. Some sources indicate that he belonged to the period of [[Vikramaditya]] of 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Amarakosha'' compiled by [[Benjamin L. Rice|B.L.Rice]], edited by N.Balasubramanya, 1970, page X&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirashi examines the question of the date of composition of ''Amarakosha''. He finds the first reliable mention in Amoghavritti of Shakatayana composed during the reign of [[Amoghavarsha]](814-867CE)&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=X0JUwf2BXVAC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=amarakosha+date&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zeylMxatYp&amp;sig=3uYsj8UjCcHDA_KTzRGYGX7HU7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUwJHki4fKAhXKKyYKHYScB1EQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=amarakosha%20date&amp;f=false   Literary and Historical Studies in Indology, Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi, , Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1975, p. 50-51]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual organisation==
The ''Amarakosha'' consists of verses that can be easily memorized. It is divided into three {{IAST|khāṇḍa}}s or chapters. The first, ''{{IAST|svargādi-khāṇḍa}}'' ("heaven and others") has words pertaining to gods and heavens. The second, ''{{IAST|bhūvargādi-khāṇḍa}}'' ("earth and others") deals with words about earth, towns, animals and humans. The third, ''{{IAST|sāmānyādi-khāṇḍa}}'' ("common") has words related to grammar and other miscellaneous words.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

''Svargadhikanda'', the first Kanda of the ''Amarakosha'' begins with the verse 'Svaravyam swarganakathridivatrishalaya..' describing various names of Heaven viz. Sva, Avya, swarga, Naka, Tridiva, Tridasalaya etc. The second verse 'Amara, nirjara, deva,’ describes various words that are equivalent to word God. The fifth and sixth verses give various names of [[Gautama Buddha]]. The following verses give the different names of Brahma, Vishnu, Vasudeva, Balarama, etc. All these names are treated with great reverence which makes it difficult to ascertain Amara Sinha's theological bent.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

The second Kanda, ''Bhuvargadhikanda'', of the ''Amarakosha'' is divided into ten Vargas or parts. The ten Vargas are ''Bhuvarga'' ([[Earth]]), ''Puravarga'' (Towns or Cities), ''Shailavarga'' (Mountains), ''Vanoshadivarga'' (Forests and medicines), ''Simhadivarga'' (Lions and other animals), ''Manushyavarga'' (Mankind), ''Bramhavarga'' ([[Brahmin]]), ''Kshatriyavarga'' ([[Kshatriya]]s), ''Vysyavarga'' ([[Vysya]]s) and ''Sudravarga'' ([[Shudra|Sudra]]s).{{cn|date=July 2016}}

The Third Kanda, ''Samanyadhikanda'' contains Adjectives, Verbs, words related to prayer and business etc. The first verse ''Kshemankaroristatathi Shivathathi Shivamkara'' gives the Nanarthas of the word Shubakara or propitious as Kshemankara, Aristathathi, Shivathathi and Shivamkara.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

An '''anachronism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνά}} {{lang|grc-Latn|ana}}, "against" and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}} {{lang|grc-Latn|khronos}}, "time") is a [[chronology|chronological]] inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of persons, events, objects, or customs from different periods of time. The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a plant or animal, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period in time that is placed outside its proper temporal domain.

An anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period. Anachronism can also be used for purposes of rhetoric, comedy, or shock. Unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer, artist, or performer is unaware of differences in technology, language, customs, attitudes, or fashions between different historical eras.

==Types== 
[[Image:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493) shows [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] in scholar's clothing of the book's time, 1,800 years too modern for Aristotle]]

=== Parachronism &lt;!-- 'Parachronism' redirects here--&gt;===
A '''parachronism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|παρά}}, "on the side", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found (though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible).

This may be an object, idiomatic expression, technology, philosophical idea, musical style, material, custom, or anything else so closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era.  They may be objects or ideas that were once common but are now considered rare or inappropriate.  They can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion.

Examples of parachronisms could include a suburban housewife in the United States around 1960 using a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]] for laundry (well after [[washing machine]]s had become the norm); or a teenager from that time period being an avid fan of [[ragtime]] music. Often, a parachronism is identified when a work based on a particular era's state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era—with a different state of knowledge.  Many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings, and works of [[speculative fiction]] often find their speculations outstripped by real-world technological developments or scientific discoveries.

=== Prochronism &lt;!-- 'Prochronism' redirects here--&gt;===
A '''prochronism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πρό}}, "before", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is an impossible anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time (e.g. ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] at the top of the article). A prochronism may be an object not yet developed, a verbal expression that had not yet been coined, a philosophy not yet formulated, a breed of animal not yet evolved (or perhaps engineered), or use of a technology that had not yet been created.

===Behavioral and cultural anachronism===
The intentional use of older, often obsolete cultural artifacts may be regarded as anachronistic. For example, it could be considered anachronistic for a modern-day person to wear a [[top hat]], write with a [[quill]], or carry on a conversation in Latin. Such choices may reflect an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] or an [[aesthetic]] preference.

== Politically motivated anachronism ==
Some writings and works of art promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is. For example, the 19th-century Romanian painter [[Constantin Lecca]] depicts the peace agreement between [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Ioan Bogdan Voievod]] and [[Radu cel Mare|Radu Voievod]]—two leaders in Romania's 16th-century history—with the flags of [[Moldavia]] (blue-red) and of [[Wallachia]] (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags date only from the 1830s. Here anachronism promotes legitimacy for the unification of Moldavia and  Wallachia into the [[Kingdom of Romania]] at the time the painting was made.

== Art and literature ==
[[File:Lucas van Leyden - Lot and his Daughters - WGA12932.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucas van Leyden]]'s 1520 painting ''Lot and His Daughters'' shows Biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] as a typical Dutch city of the painter's time.]]
Anachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis. Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. It is only since the close of the 18th century that this kind of deviation from historical reality has jarred on a general audience.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Sir [[Walter Scott]] justified the use of anachronism in historical literature: "It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Scott |authorlink=Walter Scott |title=Ivanhoe; a Romance |place=Edinburgh |year=1820 |volume=1 |page=xvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzQJAAAAQAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as fashions move on, such attempts to use anachronisms to engage an audience may have quite the reverse effect, as the details in question are increasingly recognized as belonging neither to the historical era being represented, nor to the present, but to the intervening period in which the artwork was created. "Nothing becomes obsolete like a period vision of an older period", writes [[Anthony Grafton]]; "Hearing a mother in a historical movie of the 1940s call out 'Ludwig! [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]! Come in and practice your piano now!' we are jerked from our suspension of disbelief by what was intended as a means of reinforcing it, and plunged directly into the American bourgeois world of the filmmaker."&lt;ref&gt;Grafton 1990, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anachronism can also be an aesthetic choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174817-for-infidelity-reconsidering-aesthetic-anachronism/|title=For Infidelity: Reconsidering Aesthetic Anachronism|last=Potthast|first=Jane|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-18|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anachronisms abound in the works of [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Raphael Santi: His Life and His Works|last=von Wolzogen|first=Alfred Freiherr|publisher=[[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]]|year=1866|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZhAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shakespeare and the Uses of Antiquity: An Introductory Essay|last=Martindale |first=Michelle |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2005 |isbn=9781134848508 |pages=121–125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDwrK5FNnN0C&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in those of less celebrated painters and playwrights of earlier times. Anachronisms can exist in ancient texts. [[Carol Meyers]] says that these anachronisms can be used to better understand the stories by asking what the anachronism represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/02/14/276782474/the-genesis-of-camels |title=Archaeology Find: Camels In 'Bible' Are Literary Anachronisms|last=Montagne|first=Renee |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2014-02-14|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated anachronisms and historical errors can become an accepted part of popular culture, such as Roman legionaries that wear leather armor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-03-31/time-meddlers-anachronisms-in-print-and-on-film|title=Time meddlers: anachronisms in print and on film|last=Cole|first=Tom|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=2011-03-31|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumb|[[Dinosaurs]] co-existing with [[hominid]]s, as here in ''[[The Flintstones]]'', is a relatively common anachronistic depiction in comics and animated cartoons.]]
=== Comical anachronism ===
[[Comedy]] fiction set in the past may use anachronism for humorous effect. Comedic anachronism can be used to make serious points about both historical and modern society, such as drawing parallels to political or social conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174969-hollywood-history-and-the-art-of-the-big-anachronism/|title=Hollywood, History, and the Art of the Big Anachronism|last=van Riper|first=A. Bowdoin|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-26|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future anachronism === &lt;!-- Section is linked from the redirected [Future anachronism] article; use caution. --&gt;
{{see also|Retrofuturism}}
[[File:Amazing_stories_193107.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In the future envisioned on this 1931 cover of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', [[Propeller (aeronautics) |propeller airplanes]] would coexist with [[space technology]] advanced enough for a large-scale [[colonization of Mars]].]]

Even with careful research, [[science fiction]] writers risk anachronism as their works age because they cannot predict all political and technological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction|last1=Athans|first1=Philip|authorlink1=Philip Athans|last2=Salvatore|first2=R. A.|authorlink2=R. A. Salvatore|publisher=[[Adams Media]]|year=2010|isbn=9781440507298|pages=167–170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9l5JO_FM6cC&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, many books and films nominally set in the mid-21st century or later refer to the [[Soviet Union]], to [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia as [[Leningrad]], to [[Cold War|the continuing struggle between the Eastern and Western Blocs]] and to [[History of Germany (1945–90)|divided Germany and divided Berlin]]. ''[[Star Trek]]'' has suffered from future anachronisms; instead of "[[Retroactive continuity|retconning]]" these errors, the [[Star Trek (film)|2009 film]] retained them for consistency with older franchises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/living-the-star-trek-life/|title=Living the Star Trek life|last=Glaskowsky|first=Peter|work=[[CNET]]|date=2009-05-08|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Buildings or natural features, such as the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], can become out of place once they disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/12/06/AR2005033116653.html|title='Empire': Gangster Tale Sleeps With the Fishes|last=Hornaday|first=Ann|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2002-12-06|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language anachronism ===
[[Language]] anachronisms in novels and films are quite common, both intentional and unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/26/172955182/historical-vocab-when-we-get-it-wrong-does-it-matter|title=Historical Vocab: When We Get It Wrong, Does It Matter?|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|work=[[NPR]]|date=2013-02-26|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentional anachronisms inform the audience more readily about a film set in the past. In this regard, language and pronunciation change so fast that most modern people (even many scholars) would find it difficult, or even impossible, to understand a film with dialogue in 15th-century English; thus, we [[Suspension of disbelief|willingly accept]] characters speaking an updated language, and modern [[slang]] and figures of speech are often used in these films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-3-26-00-on-language-anachronism.html|title=The Way We Live Now: 3-26-00: On Language; Anachronism |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2000-03-26|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subconscious anachronism==
[[File:RR5011-0017R.gif|thumbnail|right|A Russian commemorative coin depicting the meeting of Soviet and American troops at [[Torgau]] in 1945 shows the 50-star [[flag of the United States of America]], a flag not in use until 1960. The US flag used during the Second World War had 48 stars.]]

Unintentional anachronisms may occur even in what are intended as wholly objective and accurate records or representations of historic artifacts and artworks, because the recorder's perspective is conditioned by the assumptions and practices of his or her own times (a form of [[cultural bias]]). One example is the attribution of historically inaccurate beards to various [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Effigy|tomb effigies]] and figures in [[Medieval stained glass|stained glass]] in records made by English [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]] of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Working in an age in which beards were in fashion and widespread, the antiquaries seem to have subconsciously projected the fashion back into an era in which it was rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Oliver D. |title=Beards: true and false |journal=Church Monuments |volume=28 |year=2013 |pages=124–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time travel==
The extensive science fiction subgenre depicting [[Time travel in fiction| time travel]] in effect consists of deliberate, consciously created anachronisms, letting people of one time meet and interact with those of another time. Covers of time-travel books often depict deliberate anachronisms of this kind. For example, the cover of [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' (1992) features a portrait of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] holding an [[AK-47]] rifle.

== In academia ==
In historical writing, the most common type of anachronism is the adoption of the political, social or cultural concerns and assumptions of one era to interpret or evaluate the events and actions of another. The anachronistic application of present-day perspectives to comment on the historical past is sometimes described as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]]. [[Empiricism|Empiricist]] [[historian]]s, working in the traditions established by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in the 19th century, regard this as a great error, and a trap to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Davies |title=Empiricism and History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=Basingstoke |year=2003 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that "a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that "anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |authorlink=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-96447-0 |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anachronism in academic writing is considered at best embarrassing, as in early-20th-century scholarship's use of [[Translatio imperii]], first formulated in the 12th century, to interpret 10th-century literature.

The use of anachronism in a rhetorical or hyperbolic sense is more complex. To refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the First [[Reich]], for example, is technically inaccurate but may be a useful comparative exercise; the application of theory to works which predate [[Marxist]], [[Feminist]] or [[Freudian]] subjectivities is considered an essential part of theoretical practice. In most cases, however, the practitioner will acknowledge or justify the use or context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Detection of anachronism==

The ability to identify anachronisms may be employed as a critical and forensic tool to demonstrate the fraudulence of a document or artifact purporting to be from an earlier time. [[Anthony Grafton]] discusses, for example, the work of the 3rd-century philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], of [[Isaac Casaubon]] (1559–1614), and of [[Richard August Reitzenstein|Richard Reitzenstein]] (1861–1931), all of whom succeeded in exposing literary forgeries and plagiarisms, such as those included in the "[[Hermetica|Hermetic Corpus]]", through – among other techniques – the recognition of anachronisms.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton 1990, pp. 75–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of anachronisms is an important element within the scholarly discipline of [[diplomatics]], the critical analysis of the forms of documents, developed by the [[Maurist]] scholar [[Jean Mabillon]] (1632–1707) and his successors [[René-Prosper Tassin]] (1697–1777) and [[Charles-François Toustain]] (1700–1754). The philosopher and reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote at the beginning of the 19th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The falsehood of a writing will often be detected, by its making direct mention of, or allusions more or less indirect to, some fact posterior to the date which it bears. ... ''The mention of posterior facts;'' – first indication of forgery.&lt;br&gt;

In a living language there are always variations in words, in the meaning of words, in the construction of phrases, in the manner of spelling, which may detect the age of a writing, and lead to legitimate suspicions of forgery. ... ''The use of words not used till after the date of the writing;'' – second indication of forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeremy |last=Bentham |authorlink=Jeremy Bentham |title=A Treatise on Judicial Evidence |editor-first=Étienne |editor-last=Dumont |editor-link=Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont |place=London |publisher=Baldwin, Cradock and Joy |year=1825 |page=140 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tMsDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exposure by [[Lorenzo Valla]] in 1440 of the so-called [[Donation of Constantine]], a decree purportedly issued by the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] in either 315 or 317 AD, as a later forgery, depended to a considerable degree on the identification of anachronisms, such as references to the city of [[Constantinople]] (a name not in fact bestowed until 330 AD). A large number of apparent [[anachronisms in the Book of Mormon]] have served to convince critics that the book was written in the 19th century, and not, as its adherents claim, in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. The use of 19th- and 20th-century [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] terminology demonstrates that the purported "[[Franklin Prophecy]]" (attributed to [[Benjamin Franklin]], who died in 1790) is a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/franklin_prophecy/print.asp |title=Anti-Semitic Myth: The Franklin "Prophecy" |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ""[[William Lynch speech]]", an address, supposedly delivered in 1712, on the control of slaves in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], is now considered to be a 20th-century forgery, partly on account of its use of anachronistic terms such as "program" and "refueling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/question/may04.htm |title=Is Willie Lynch's Letter Real? |last=Cobb |first=W.

[[File:Halloween-card-mirror-2.jpg|thumb|[[Divination]] rituals such as the one depicted on this early 20th century [[Halloween]] [[greeting card]], where a woman stares into a mirror in a darkened room to catch a glimpse of the face of her future husband, while a witch lurks in the shadows, may be one origin of the Bloody Mary legend.]]
'''Bloody Mary''' is a [[folklore]] legend consisting of a [[ghost]], phantom, or spirit [[Conjuration|conjured]] to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is chanted repeatedly. The Bloody Mary [[Apparitional experience|apparition]] may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend.  Bloody Mary appearances are mostly "witnessed" in group participation play.

==Ritual==
Historically, the [[Necromancy|ritual]] encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backward holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink= | first=Bill| last=Ellis| title=Lucifer Ascending: The Occult in Folklore and Popular Culture| publisher=[[University of Kentucky]] Press| year=2004| isbn=978-0-8131-2289-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, a chance that they would see a [[Human skull symbolism|skull]] (or the face of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]) instead, indicating that they were going to die before they would have the chance to marry.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ronald Hutton| first=Ronald| last=Hutton| title=Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| year=2001| isbn=978-0-19-285448-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ritual of today, Bloody Mary allegedly appears to individuals or groups who ritualistically invoke her name in an act of [[catoptromancy]]. This is done by repeatedly chanting her name into a mirror placed in a dimly-lit or candle-lit room. In some traditions the name must be repeated thirteen times (or some other specified number of times).&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; The Bloody Mary apparition allegedly appears as a corpse, witch or ghost, can be friendly or evil, and is sometimes "seen" covered in blood. The lore surrounding the ritual states that participants may endure the apparition screaming at them, cursing them, strangling them, stealing their soul, drinking their blood,&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/bloody_mary.htm Bloody Mary at Urban Legends]&lt;/ref&gt; or scratching their eyes out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halloween-website.com/bloody_mary.htm ''Bloody Mary'']; www.Halloween–Website.com; retrieved November 15, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Some variations of the ritual call Bloody Mary by a different name—"Hell Mary" and "Mary Worth" are popular examples.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; The [[Urban legend|modern legend]] of [[Hanako-san]] in Japan strongly parallels the Bloody Mary mythology.&lt;ref&gt;de Vos, Gail (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6HJwCRAlpioC&amp;pg=PA155 What Happens Next? Contemporary Urban Legends and Popular Culture]''. ABC-CLIO. p. 155. {{ISBN|1598846345}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern addition of taunting Bloody Mary regarding her baby indicates the legendary figure's conflation with the historic figure [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], also known as "Bloody Mary", whose life was marked by a number of [[miscarriage]]s or [[False pregnancy|false pregnancies]]&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/bloodymary.asp|title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Bloody Mary|publisher=[[Snopes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is remembered for her [[Mary I of England#Religious policy|violent religious reforms]].&lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp. 207–208; Waller, p. 65; Whitelock, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phenomenon explained==
Staring into a mirror in a dimly-lit room for a prolonged period can cause one to hallucinate.&lt;ref name="Caputo"/&gt; Facial features may appear to "melt", distort, disappear, and rotate, while other hallucinatory elements, such as animal or strange faces, may appear. Giovanni Caputo of the University of Urbino, writes that this phenomenon, which he calls the "strange-face illusion", is believed to be a consequence of a "dissociative identity effect", which causes the brain's facial-recognition system to misfire in a currently unidentified way.&lt;ref name="Caputo"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Caputo| first1=Giovanni B| year=2010| title=Strange-face-in-the-mirror illusion| journal=[[Perception Magazine]]| volume=39| issue=7| pages=1007–1008| doi=10.1068/p6466| url=http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6466| accessdate=October 18, 2012| pmid=20842976| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025085513/http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6466#| archive-date=2012-10-25| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible explanations for the phenomenon include illusions attributed, at least partially, to the perceptual effects of ''[[Troxler's fading]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5906432/an-optical-illusion-that-explains-the-origins-of-imaginary-monsters ''An Optical Illusion that Explains the Origins of Imaginary Monsters'']; accessed December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caputo"/&gt; and possibly [[Hypnosis|self-hypnosis]].

The ''' Boyacá International Cultural Festival&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spanishincolombia.gov.co/pagina/vida-urbana_tunja_-vida-cultural&lt;/ref&gt;''' (Spanish: '''''Festival Internacional de la Cultura de Boyacá''''' or just '''''FIC''''') is one of the major international cultural events held annually in [[Colombia]]. The festival presents works in various arts such as music, theater, dance, literature, Academy, Visual Arts, Cinema - Audiovisual, Cultural Heritage cultural exchanges and meetings at various stages in the city of [[Tunja]] since 1973. Artists from different corners of the world intertwine their knowledge and their cultures into one universal feeling, through the medium of art, the best mechanism to achieve peace and brotherhood of people. The FIC gathers thousands of artists and has more than 300,000 visits to about 500 events per version. The festival is considered to be one of the most representative of music, dance, the arts, theater, cultural heritage, literature, cinema and expressions of human sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://colombiareports.com/colombia-celebrates-40th-international-culture-festival-video/&lt;/ref&gt;

The 44th version of the Boyacá International Cultural Festival will take place from 27 October – 5 November 2016.

==History==

The Festival was created in 1973 under the name of "International Culture Week". In 1981, name as the Boyacá International Cultural Festival, it became one of the most important cultural events in Latin America. The FIC gathers thousands of artists and has more than 300,000 visits to about 500 events per version. The Festival was conceived to meet different cultural and artistic events of international order.
In the 1990s the event was held during two weeks with concerts of symphony and chamber orchestras, choirs, soloists and equally folk and classical ballet, traditional groups and street theater and puppet shows, conferences and cinema, art exhibitions, folk art, book fair and conferences.
Over four decades, the biggest cultural event of the department has developed and grown into a design which educates and shares diverse and exciting cultures from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://colombiareports.com/colombia-celebrates-40th-international-culture-festival-video/&lt;/ref&gt;

The great receptivity of the city has been essential in the success of the event, and no doubt the cultural level that old tradition has identified the local population, year after year, increased their attendance and participation at all levels.

{{History of China}}
'''Chinese art''' is [[visual art]] that, whether ancient or modern, originated in or is practiced in China or by Chinese artists. The Chinese art in the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and that of [[overseas Chinese]] can also be considered part of Chinese art where it is based in or draws on Chinese heritage and [[Chinese culture]]. Early "[[stone age]] art" dates back to 10,000 BC, mostly consisting of simple [[pottery]] and sculptures. After this early period Chinese art, like Chinese history, is typically classified by the succession of ruling [[Dynasty|dynasties]] of [[Chinese emperors]], most of which lasted several hundred years.

Chinese art has arguably the oldest continuous tradition in the world, and is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and consciousness of, that tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western collapse and gradual recovery of classical styles. The media that have usually been classified in the West since the [[Renaissance]] as the [[decorative arts]] are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially unknown artists, especially in [[Chinese ceramics]].

Much of the best work in ceramics, textiles, [[carved lacquer]], and other techniques was produced over a long period by the various Imperial factories or workshops, which as well as being used by the court was distributed internally and abroad on a huge scale to demonstrate the wealth and power of the Emperors. In contrast, the tradition of [[ink wash painting]], practiced mainly by [[scholar-official]]s and court painters especially of [[landscape painting|landscapes]], flowers, and birds, developed [[aesthetic]] values depending on the individual imagination of and objective observation by the artist that are similar to those of the West, but long pre-dated their development there. After contacts with Western art became increasingly important from the 19th century onwards, in recent decades China has participated with increasing success in worldwide [[contemporary art]].

{{main|Chinese painting}}

Traditional Chinese painting involves essentially the same techniques as [[Chinese calligraphy]] and is done with a
[[Ink and wash painting|brush dipped in black or colored ink]]; oils are not used. As with calligraphy, the most popular materials on which paintings are made of paper and silk. The finished work can be mounted on scrolls, such as [[hanging scroll]]s or [[handscroll]]s. Traditional painting can also be done on album sheets, walls, [[lacquerware]], [[folding screen]]s, and other media.

The two main techniques in Chinese painting are:
* [[Gongbi|Gong-bi]] (工筆), meaning "meticulous", uses highly detailed brushstrokes that delimits details very precisely. It is often highly coloured and usually depicts figural or narrative subjects.  It is often practised by artists working for the royal court or in independent workshops. [[Bird-and-flower painting]]s were often in this style.
* [[Ink and wash painting]], in Chinese ''Shui-mo'' or (水墨&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese character "mo" means ink and "shui" means water&lt;/ref&gt;) also loosely termed watercolour or brush painting, and also known as "literati painting", as it was one of the "[[Four Arts]]" of the Chinese [[Scholar-official]] class.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman, 222&lt;/ref&gt; In theory this was an art practised by gentlemen, a distinction that begins to be made in writings on art from the [[Song dynasty]], though in fact the careers of leading exponents could benefit considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 114–119; Sickman, Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; This style is also referred to as "xie yi" (寫意) or freehand style.

Artists from the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] (202 BC) to the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] (618–906) dynasties mainly painted the human figure. Much of what is known of early Chinese figure painting comes from burial sites, where paintings were preserved on silk banners, lacquered objects, and tomb walls. Many early tomb paintings were meant to protect the dead or help their souls get to paradise. Others illustrated the teachings of the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]], or showed scenes of daily life.  Most Chinese portraits showed a formal full-length frontal view, and were used in the family in [[ancestor veneration]]. Imperial portraits were more flexible, but were generally not seen outside the court, and portraiture formed no part of Imperial propaganda, as in other cultures.

Many critics consider landscape to be the highest form of Chinese painting. The time from the Five Dynasties period to the Northern Song period (907–1127) is known as the "Great age of Chinese landscape". In the north, artists such as [[Jing Hao]], [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]], [[Fan Kuan]], and [[Guo Xi]] painted pictures of towering mountains, using strong black lines, ink wash, and sharp, dotted brushstrokes to suggest rough rocks.  In the south, [[Dong Yuan]], [[Juran (painter)|Juran]], and other artists painted the rolling hills and rivers of their native countryside in peaceful scenes done with softer, rubbed brushwork. These two kinds of scenes and techniques became the classical styles of Chinese landscape painting.

[[Chinese ritual bronzes]] from the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Western Zhou dynasties]] come from a period of over a thousand years from c. 1500, and have exerted a continuing influence over Chinese art. They are cast with complex patterned and [[zoomorphic]] decoration, but avoid the human figure, unlike the huge figures only recently discovered at [[Sanxingdui]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, Chapter 1, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacular [[Terracotta Army]] was assembled for the tomb of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first [[emperor]] of a unified China from 221–210 BC, as a grand imperial version of the figures long placed in tombs to enable the deceased to enjoy the same lifestyle in the afterlife as when alive, replacing actual sacrifices of very early periods. Smaller figures in pottery or wood were placed in tombs for many centuries afterwards, reaching a peak of quality in the [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 138-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Chinese religions do not usually use cult images of deities, or even represent them, and large religious sculpture is nearly all Buddhist, dating mostly from the 4th to the 14th century, and initially using [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist]] models arriving via the [[Silk Road]]. Buddhism is also the context of all large portrait sculpture; in total contrast to some other areas in medieval China even painted images of the emperor were regarded as private. Imperial tombs have spectacular avenues of approach lined with real and mythological animals on a scale matching Egypt, and smaller versions decorate temples and palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 135–145; 145–163&lt;/ref&gt;  Small Buddhist figures and groups were produced to a very high quality in a range of media,&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 163–165&lt;/ref&gt; as was relief decoration of all sorts of objects, especially in metalwork and [[Chinese jade|jade]].&lt;ref name="Rawson, Chapters 4 and 6"&gt;Rawson, Chapters 4 and 6&lt;/ref&gt; Sculptors of all sorts were regarded as artisans and very few names are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pottery==
{{main|Chinese ceramics}}
{{see also|Chinese influences on Islamic pottery}}
Chinese ceramic ware shows a continuous development since the pre-dynastic periods, and is one of the most significant forms of Chinese art. China is richly endowed with the raw materials needed for making ceramics. The first types of ceramics were made during the [[List of Palaeolithic sites in China|Palaeolithic]] era, and in later periods range from construction materials such as bricks and tiles, to hand-built pottery vessels fired in bonfires or kilns, to the sophisticated Chinese porcelain wares made for the imperial court. Most later Chinese ceramics, even of the finest quality, were made on an industrial scale, thus very few individual potters or painters are known. Many of the most renowned workshops were owned by or reserved for the Emperor, and large quantities of ceramics were exported as diplomatic gifts or for trade from an early date.

As well as porcelain, a wide range of materials that were more valuable were worked and decorated with great skill for a range of uses or just for display.&lt;ref name="Rawson, Chapters 4 and 6"/&gt; [[Chinese jade]] was attributed with magical powers, and was used in the Stone and Bronze Ages for large and impractical versions of everyday weapons and tools, as well as the [[Bi (jade)|''bi'' disks]] and [[Cong (jade)|''cong'' vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 50–54&lt;/ref&gt;  Later a range of objects and small sculptures were carved in jade, a difficult and time-consuming technique. [[Bronze]], gold and silver, [[rhinoceros horn]], [[Chinese silk]], ivory, [[Chinese lacquerware|lacquer]] and [[carved lacquer]], [[cloisonne enamel]] and many other materials had specialist artists working in them.

[[Folding screen]]s ({{zh|c=屏風|p=píngfēng}}) are often decorated with beautiful art; major themes include mythology, scenes of palace life, and nature. Materials such as wood panel, paper and silk are used in making folding screens. They were considered ideal ornaments for many painters to display their [[Chinese painting|paintings]] and [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]].&lt;ref name="mazurkewich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mazurkewich|first1=Karen|first2=A.

==Historical development to 221 BC==
[[File:Changshadragon.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Silk painting depicting a man riding a dragon]]'', painting on [[silk]], dated to 5th–3rd century BC, [[Warring States]] period, from Zidanku Tomb no. 1 in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]] Province]]

===Neolithic pottery===
{{main|Yangshao culture|Peiligang culture}}

Early forms of art in China are found in the [[Neolithic]] [[Yangshao culture]], which dates back to the 6th millennium BC. Archeological findings such as those at the [[Banpo]] have revealed that the Yangshao made pottery; early [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]] were unpainted and most often cord-marked. The first decorations were fish and human faces, but these eventually evolved into [[Symmetry|symmetrical]]-[[Geometry|geometric]] abstract designs, some painted.

The most distinctive feature of Yangshao culture was the extensive use of painted pottery, especially human facial, animal, and geometric designs. Unlike the later [[Longshan culture]], the Yangshao culture did not use [[pottery wheel]]s in pottery making. Excavations have found that children were buried in painted pottery jars.

===Jade culture===
{{main|Liangzhu culture}}

The Liangzhu culture was the last Neolithic Jade culture in the [[Yangtze River Delta]] and was spaced over a period of about 1,300 years.  The Jade from this culture is characterized by finely worked, large ritual jades such as [[Cong (jade)|Cong]] cylinders, [[Bi (jade)|Bi]] discs, Yue axes and also pendants and decorations in the form of chiseled open-work plaques, plates and representations of small birds, turtles and fish. The Liangzhu Jade has a white, milky bone-like aspect due to its [[Tremolite]] rock origin and influence of water-based fluids at the burial sites.

=== Bronze casting ===
[[File:Ritual cooking vessel.jpg|thumb|left|Shang dynasty bronze ritual [[ding (vessel)|ding]]]]
{{main|Chinese ritual bronzes}}
{{further|Bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng}}
The [[Bronze Age]] in China began with the [[Xia dynasty]]. Examples from this period have been recovered from ruins of the [[Erlitou culture]], in Shanxi, and include complex but unadorned utilitarian objects.  In the following [[Shang dynasty]] more elaborate objects, including many ritual vessels, were crafted.  The Shang are remembered for their [[bronze]] casting, noted for its clarity of detail. Shang bronzesmiths usually worked in [[Foundry|foundries]] outside the cities to make ritual vessels, and sometimes weapons and chariot fittings as well. The bronze vessels were receptacles for storing or serving various solids and liquids used in the performance of sacred ceremonies. Some forms such as the ''ku'' and ''jue'' can be very graceful, but the most powerful pieces are the ''[[ding (vessel)|ding]]'', sometimes described as having an "air of ferocious majesty".

It is typical of the developed Shang style that all available space is decorated, most often with stylized forms of real and imaginary animals. The most common motif is the ''[[taotie]]'', which shows a mythological being presented frontally as though squashed onto a horizontal plane to form a symmetrical design. The early significance of ''taotie'' is not clear, but myths about it existed around the late [[Zhou dynasty]]. It was considered to be variously a covetous man banished to guard a corner of heaven against evil monsters; or a monster equipped with only a head which tries to devour men but hurts only itself.

The function and appearance of bronzes changed gradually from the Shang to the Zhou. They shifted from been used in religious rites to more practical purposes. By the [[Warring States period]], bronze vessels had become objects of aesthetic enjoyment. Some were decorated with social scenes, such as from a banquet or hunt; whilst others displayed abstract patterns inlaid with gold, silver, or precious and semiprecious stones.

Bronze artifacts also have significant meaning and roles in Han Dynasty as well. People used them for funerary purposes which reflect the aesthetic and artistic qualities of Han Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zebin|first=Li|date=September 2013|title=FASHION AND RITUALS OF THE HAN DYNASTY: Cultural Relics of the Royal Houses of Jiangsu.|url=|journal=Orientations|volume=44|pages=5–7|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many bronze vessels excavated from tombs in Jiangsu Province, China have various shapes like Ding, Hu, and Xun which represent traditional Chinese aesthete.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other than the vessels, bronze weapons, daily items, and musical instruments are also found in royal Han families' tomb in Jiangsu. The excavation of Bianzhong, a typical and royal instrument found in ancient China, emphasizes the development of complex music systems in Han Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Shang bronzes became appreciated as works of art from the [[Song dynasty]], when they were collected and prized not only for their shape and design but also for the various green, blue green, and even reddish patinas created by chemical action as they lay buried in the ground. The study of early Chinese bronze casting is a specialized field of art history.

=== Chu and Southern culture ===
A rich source of art in early China was the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]], which developed in the Yangtze River valley. Excavations of Chu tombs have found painted wooden sculptures, jade disks, glass beads, musical instruments, and an assortment of [[lacquerware]]. Many of the lacquer objects are finely painted, red on black or black on red. A site in [[Changsha]], Hunan province, has revealed some of the oldest paintings on silk discovered to date.

The figures were painted before being placed into the vault. The original colors were visible when the pieces were first unearthed. However, exposure to air caused the pigments to fade, so today the unearthed figures appear [[terracotta]] in color. The figures are in several poses including standing infantry and kneeling archers, as well as charioteers with horses. Each figure's head appears to be unique, showing a variety of facial features and expressions as well as hair styles.

=== Han art ===
The [[Han dynasty]] was known for [[jade burial suit]]s. One of the earliest known depictions of a landscape in Chinese art comes from a pair of hollow-tile door panels from a Western Han dynasty tomb near [[Zhengzhou]], dated 60 BC.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 plate"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China'': Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 3: Civil Engineering and Nautics. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. Plate CCCXII&lt;/ref&gt; A scene of continuous depth recession is conveyed by the zigzag of lines representing roads and garden walls, giving the impression that one is looking down from the top of a hill.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 plate"/&gt; This artistic landscape scene was made by the repeated impression of standard stamps on the clay while it was still soft and not yet fired.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 plate"/&gt; However, the oldest known landscape art scene tradition in the classical sense of painting is a work by [[Zhan Ziqian]] of the [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618).

Other than jade artifacts, bronze is another favorite medium for artists since it is hard and durable. Bronze mirrors have been mass produced in Han Dynasty(206 BC-220 AD), and almost every tomb excavated that has been dated as Han Dynasty has mirror in the burial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reflective side is usually made by a composition of bronze, copper, tin, and lead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yuejin|date=September 1994|title=Mirror, Death, and Rhetoric: Reading Late Han Chinese Bronze Artifacts|journal=Art Bulletin|volume=LXXVI|pages=511|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "mirror" means "to reflect" or "to look into" in Chinese, so bronze mirrors have been used as a trope for reflecting the reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ancient Chinese believe that mirror can act as a representation of the reality, which could make them more aware of the current situation; also, mirrors are used as a media to convey or present a reflection of the past events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The bronze mirrors made in Han Dynasty always have complex decorations on their non-reflective side; some of them consist narratives that tell stories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Influence of Buddhism ===
{{main|Buddhist art#China|l1=Buddhist art}}
[[Buddhism]] arrived in China around the 1st century AD (although there are some traditions about a monk visiting China during [[Asoka]]'s reign), and through to the 8th century it became very active and creative in the development of Buddhist art, particularly in the area of statuary. Receiving this distant religion, China soon incorporated strong Chinese traits in its artistic expression.

In the fifth to sixth century the [[Northern dynasties]], rather removed from the original sources of inspiration, tended to develop rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible, realistic manner, progressively led to a research towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.

=== Calligraphy ===
In ancient China, painting and [[calligraphy]] were the most highly appreciated arts in court circles and were produced almost exclusively by amateurs, aristocrats and scholar-officials who alone had the leisure to perfect the technique and sensibility necessary for great brushwork. Calligraphy was thought to be the highest and purest form of painting. The implements were the brush, made of animal hair, and black [[ink]] made from pine soot and animal glue. Writing as well as painting was done on silk. But after the invention of paper in the 1st century, silk was gradually replaced by the new and cheaper material. Original writings by famous calligraphers have been greatly valued throughout China's history and are mounted on scrolls and hung on walls in the same way that paintings are.

[[Wang Xizhi]] was a famous Chinese calligrapher who lived in the 4th century AD. His most famous work is the ''[[Lanting Xu]]'', the preface to a collection of poems. The script was often celebrated as the high point of the [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] "Running Style" in the history of Chinese calligraphy.

[[Wei Shuo]] was a well-known calligrapher of the [[Eastern Jin dynasty]] who established consequential rules about the [[Regular Script]].  Her well-known works include ''Famous Concubine Inscription'' (名姬帖 Ming Ji Tie) and ''The Inscription of Wei-shi He'nan'' (衛氏和南帖 Wei-shi He'nan Tie).

[[Gu Kaizhi]] is a celebrated painter of ancient China born in [[Wuxi]]. He wrote three books about painting theory: ''On Painting'' (畫論), ''Introduction of Famous Paintings of Wei and Jin Dynasties'' (魏晉名畫記) and ''Painting Yuntai Mountain'' (畫雲臺山記). He wrote, "In figure paintings the clothes and the appearances were not very important. The eyes were the spirit and the decisive factor."
Three of Gu's paintings still survive today: ''[[Admonitions Scroll|Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies]]'', ''Nymph of the Luo River'' (洛神賦), and ''Wise and Benevolent Women''.

There are other examples of Jin dynasty painting from tombs. This includes the ''Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove,'' painted on a brick wall of a tomb located near modern Nanjing and now found in the Shaanxi Provincial Museum. Each of the figures are labeled and shown either drinking, writing, or playing a musical instrument. Other tomb paintings also depict scenes of daily life, such as men plowing fields with teams of oxen.

=== Buddhist architecture and sculpture ===
Following a transition under the [[Sui dynasty]], Buddhist sculpture of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] evolved towards a markedly lifelike expression. As a consequence of the dynasty's openness to foreign trade and influences through the [[Silk Road]], Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Greco-Buddhist art of Central Asia.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Wu-Tsung]] outlawed all "foreign" religions (including Christian [[Nestorianism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) in order to support the indigenous [[Taoism]]. He confiscated Buddhist possessions and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the ulterior development of the religion and its arts in China.

Glazed or painted [[earthenware]] [[Tang dynasty tomb figures]] are famous, and well-represented in museums around the world. Most wooden Tang sculptures have not survived, though representations of the Tang international style can still be seen in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], Japan. The longevity of stone sculpture has proved much greater. Some of the finest examples can be seen at [[Longmen Grottoes|Longmen]], near [[Luoyang]] ([[Henan]]), [[Yungang]] near [[Datong]] ([[Shanxi]]), and [[Bingling Temple]] in [[Gansu]].
One of the most famous Buddhist [[Chinese pagoda]]s is the [[Giant Wild Goose Pagoda]], built in 652 AD.

=== Painting ===
[[File:Dong Yuan Mountain Hall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Painting by [[Dong Yuan]] (c. 934–962).]]
Beginning in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), the primary subject matter of painting was the landscape, known as [[shanshui]] (mountain water) painting. In these landscapes, usually monochromatic and sparse, the purpose was not to reproduce exactly the appearance of nature but rather to grasp an emotion or atmosphere so as to catch the "rhythm" of nature.

Painting in the traditional style involved essentially the same techniques as calligraphy and was done with a brush dipped in black or colored ink; oils were not used. As with calligraphy, the most popular materials on which paintings were made were paper and silk. The finished works were then mounted on scrolls, which could be hung or rolled up. Traditional painting was also done in albums, on walls, [[lacquer]] work, and in other media.

[[Dong Yuan]] was an active painter in the Southern Tang Kingdom. He was known for both figure and landscape paintings, and exemplified the elegant style which would become the standard for brush painting in China over the next 900 years. As with many artists in China, his profession was as an official where he studied the existing styles of Li Sixun and Wang Wei. However, he added to the number of techniques, including more sophisticated perspective, use of pointillism and crosshatching to build up vivid effect.

[[Zhan Ziqian]] was a painter during the Sui dynasty. His only painting in existence is ''Strolling About In Spring'' arranged mountains perspectively. Because pure [[landscape paintings]] are hardly seen in Europe until the 17th century, ''Strolling About In Spring'' may well be the world's first landscape painting.

== The Song and Yuan dynasties (960–1368) ==
{{main|Culture of the Song Dynasty}}
[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279 AD)]]

=== Song painting ===
During the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), landscapes of more subtle expression appeared; immeasurable distances were conveyed through the use of blurred outlines, mountain contours disappearing into the mist, and impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. Emphasis was placed on the spiritual qualities of the painting and on the ability of the artist to reveal the inner harmony of man and nature, as perceived according to [[Taoist art|Taoist]] and [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] concepts.

[[Liang Kai]] was a Chinese painter who lived in the 13th century (Song dynasty). He called himself "Madman Liang", and he spent his life drinking and painting. Eventually, he retired and became a [[Zen]] monk. Liang is credited with inventing the Zen school of Chinese art. [[Wen Tong]] was a painter who lived in the 11th century. He was famous for [[ink paintings of bamboo]].  He could hold two brushes in one hand and paint two different distanced bamboos simultaneously. He did not need to see the bamboo while he painted them because he had seen a lot of them.

[[Zhang Zeduan]] was a notable painter for his horizontal ''[[Along the River During Qingming Festival]]'' landscape and cityscape painting. It has been quoted as "China's [[Mona Lisa]]" and has had many well-known remakes throughout Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradsher |first=Keith |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/03/arts/design/03pain.html?_r=2 |title=‘China's Mona Lisa’ Makes a Rare Appearance in Hong Kong |location=China;Hong Kong;Great Britain |work=The New York Times  |date=July 3, 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous paintings include ''[[Gu Hongzhong|The Night Revels of Han Xizai]]'', originally painted by the [[Southern Tang]] artist [[Gu Hongzhong]] in the 10th century, while the well-known version of his painting is a 12th-century remake of the Song dynasty. This is a large horizontal handscroll of a domestic scene showing men of the [[Gentry (China)|gentry class]] being entertained by musicians and dancers while enjoying food, beverage, and wash basins provided by maidservants. In 2000, the modern artist Wang Qingsong created a parody of this painting with a long, horizontal photograph of people in modern clothing making similar facial expressions, poses, and hand gestures as the original painting.

=== Yuan painting ===
[[File:Emperor Taizu play Cuju.jpg|thumb|250px|A painting depicting [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] playing ''[[cuju]]'' (i.e. Chinese football) with his prime minister [[Zhao Pu]] (趙普) and other ministers, by the [[Yuan dynasty]] artist [[Qian Xuan]] (1235–1305)]]

With the fall of the Song dynasty in 1279, and the subsequent dislocation caused by the establishment of the [[Yuan dynasty]] by the [[Mongol]] conquerors, many court and literary artists retreated from social life, and returned to nature, through landscape paintings, and by renewing the "blue and green" style of the Tang era.&lt;ref name="Capon and Pang, pg. 12"&gt;Capon and Pang, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wang Meng (artist)|Wang Meng]] was one such painter, and one of his most famous works is the ''Forest Grotto''. [[Zhao Mengfu]] was a Chinese scholar, painter and [[calligrapher]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. His rejection of the refined, gentle brushwork of his era in favor of the cruder style of the 8th century is considered to have brought about a revolution that created the modern Chinese landscape painting. There was also the vivid and detailed works of art by [[Qian Xuan]] (1235–1305), who had served the Song court, and out of patriotism refused to serve the Mongols, instead turning to painting. He was also famous for reviving and reproducing a more Tang dynasty style of painting.

The later Yuan dynasty is characterized by the work of the so-called "Four Great Masters". The most notable of these was [[Huang Gongwang]] (1269–1354) whose cool and restrained landscapes were admired by contemporaries, and by the Chinese literati painters of later centuries. Another of great influence was [[Ni Zan]] (1301–1374), who frequently arranged his compositions with a strong and distinct foreground and background, but left the middle-ground as an empty expanse. This scheme was frequently to be adopted by later [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing]] dynasty painters.&lt;ref name="Capon and Pang, pg. 12"/&gt;

===Pottery===
[[Chinese porcelain]] is made from a hard paste made of the [[clay]] [[kaolin]] and a [[feldspar]] called [[petuntse]], which cements the vessel and seals any [[Wiktionary:pore|pores]]. ''China'' has become synonymous with high-quality porcelain. Most china pots comes from the city of [[Jingdezhen]] in China's [[Jiangxi]] province. [[Jingdezhen porcelain]], under a variety of names, has been central to porcelain production in China since at least the [[Yuan dynasty]].

==Late imperial China (1368–1911)==

=== Ming painting ===
{{main|Ming dynasty painting}}
Under the [[Ming dynasty]], Chinese culture bloomed. Narrative painting, with a wider color range and a much busier composition than the Song paintings, was immensely popular during the time.

[[Wen Zhengming]] (1470–1559) developed the style of the Wu school in [[Suzhou]], which dominated Chinese painting during the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Capon and Pang, pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

European culture began to make an impact on Chinese art during this period. The Jesuit priest [[Matteo Ricci]] visited [[Nanjing]] with many Western artworks, which were influential in showing different techniques of perspective and shading.&lt;ref&gt;Capon and Pang, pg. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Early Qing painting ===
The early Qing dynasty developed in two main strands: the Orthodox school, and the Individualist painters, both of which followed the theories of Dong Qichang, but emphasizing very different aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Capon and Pang, pg. 90, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Four Wangs]]", including [[Wang Jian (17th-century painter)|Wang Jian]] (1598–1677) and [[Wang Shimin]] (1592–1680), were particularly renowned in the [[Six Masters of the early Qing period|Orthodox school]], and sought inspiration in recreating the past styles, especially the technical skills in brushstrokes and calligraphy of ancient masters. The younger [[Wang Yuanqi]] (1642–1715) ritualized the approach of engaging with and drawing inspiration from a work of an ancient master. His own works were often annotated with his theories of how his painting relates to the master's model.&lt;ref&gt;Capon and Pang, pg. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The Individualist painters included [[Bada Shanren]] (1626–1705) and [[Shitao]] (1641–1707). They drew more from the revolutionary ideas of transcending the tradition to achieve an original individualistic styles; in this way they were more faithfully following the way of Dong Qichang than the Orthodox school (who were his official direct followers.)&lt;ref&gt;Capon and Pang, pg. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Painters outside of the literati-scholar and aristocratic traditions also gained renown, with some artists creating paintings to sell for money. These included [[Ma Quan]] (late 17th–18th century), who depicted common flowers, birds, and insects that were not typical subject matter among scholars. Such painters were, however, not separated from formal schools of painting, but were usually well-versed in artistic styles and techniques. Ma Quan, for example, modelled her brushwork on Song dynasty examples.&lt;ref name=zhao&gt;{{cite|last=Zhao |first=Yanqing 赵燕青|title=浅议马荃的花鸟画风 |trans-title=Discussion of Ma Quan's bird and flower paintings style|language=Chinese|journal=Dazhong Wenyi (Lilun)|date=2009 | issue=3|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the boneless technique ({{zh|c=沒骨畫}}), thought to have originated as a preparatory step when painting gold-line images during the Tang, was continued by painters like [[Yun Shouping]] (1633–1690) and his descendent [[Yun Bing]].&lt;ref name=briessen&gt;{{cite |title=The Way of the Brush: Painting Techniques of China and Japan|last=van Briessen|first=Fritz|place=Vermont|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|date=1998|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the techniques of color printing were perfected, illustrated manuals on the art of painting began to be published. ''[[Jieziyuan Huazhuan]]'' (Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden), a five-volume work first published in 1679, has been in use as a technical textbook for artists and students ever since.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Late Qing Art ===
[[Nianhua]] were a form of [[colored]] woodblock prints in China, depicting images for decoration during the [[Chinese New Year]]. In the 19th century Nianhua were used as news mediums.

=== Shanghai School ===
The [[Shanghai School]] is a very important Chinese school of traditional arts during the [[Qing dynasty]] and the 20th century. Under efforts of masters from this school, traditional Chinese art reached another climax and continued to the present in forms of "[[Chinese painting]]" (中國畫), or ''guohua'' (國畫) for short.  The Shanghai School challenged and broke the literati tradition of Chinese art, while also paying technical homage to the ancient masters and improving on existing traditional techniques. Members of this school were themselves educated literati who had come to question their very status and the purpose of art, and had anticipated the impending modernization of Chinese society. In an era of rapid social change, works from the Shanghai School were widely innovative and diverse, and often contained thoughtful yet subtle social commentary. The best known figures from this school are [[Ren Xiong]], [[Ren Bonian]], [[Zhao Zhiqian]], [[Wu Changshuo]], [[Sha Menghai]], [[Pan Tianshou]], [[Fu Baoshi]], [[He Tianjian]], and [[Xie Zhiliu]].  Other well-known painters include [[Wang Zhen (painter)|Wang Zhen]], [[XuGu]], [[Zhang Xiong (painter)|Zhang Xiong]], [[Hu Yuan]], and [[Yang Borun]].

== New China art (1912–1949) ==
[[File:Sanmaonewspaper1948.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sanmao (comic book character)|Sanmao]], one of the most well-known comic book characters in China]]

===Transformation===
With the end of the last dynasty in China, the [[New Culture Movement]] began and defied all facets of traditionalism. A new breed of 20th-century cultural philosophers like [[Xiao Youmei]], [[Cai Yuanpei]], [[Feng Zikai]] and [[Wang Guangqi]] wanted Chinese culture to modernise and reflect the New China. The [[Chinese Civil War]] would cause a drastic split between the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Communist Party of China]]. Following was the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in particular. The [[Battle of Shanghai]] would leave the major cultural art center borderline to a humanitarian crisis.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Painting===
[[Ong Schan Tchow]] ({{zh|c=[[:zh:翁占秋|翁占秋]]}}) (1900–1945), artist and friend of [[Cai Yuanpei]] accomplished the subtle integration of Western art techniques and perspectives into traditional Chinese painting. Ong was one of the first few batches of Chinese scholars and artists who studied in France in the early 20th century.

Western style oil painting was introduced to China by painters such as [[Xiao Tao Sheng]]. Another important influential artist in the 1940s was [[Tai Ping Meijing]] who incorporated nature in all his art and mixed traditional Asian art with realism.

==Communist and socialist art (1950–1980s)==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:HavocinHeaven1964.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Havoc in Heaven]]'', made in 1964 and considered as a noted example of [[Chinese animation]]]] --&gt;

===Selective art decline===
The Communist Party of China gained full control of the government with [[Mao Zedong]] heading the People's Republic of China. Artists were heavily promoted if their art was presented in a manner that favored the government. Vice versa, any clash with communist party beliefs would force artists to become farmers via "re-education" processes under the regime. The peak era of governmental control came during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The most notable event was the [[Four Olds|Destruction of the Four Olds]], which had major consequences for pottery, painting, literary art, architecture, and more.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Painting===
Artists were encouraged to employ [[socialist realism]]. Some Soviet Union socialist realism was imported without modification, and painters were assigned subjects and expected to mass-produce paintings. This regimen was considerably relaxed in 1953 and, after the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]] of 1956–57, traditional Chinese painting experienced a significant revival. Along with these developments in professional art circles, there was a proliferation of peasant art depicting everyday life in the rural areas on wall murals and in open-air painting exhibitions. Notable modern Chinese painters include [[Huang Binhong]], [[Qi Baishi]], [[Xu Beihong]], [[Cai Jin]], [[Chang Ta Chien]], [[Pan Tianshou]], [[Wu Changshi]], [[Fu Baoshi]], [[Wang Kangle]], and [[Zhang Chongren]].

==Redevelopment (Mid-1980s – 1990s)==

===Contemporary art===
Contemporary Chinese art ({{lang|zh|中國當代藝術}}, Zhongguo Dangdai Yishu) often referred to as Chinese avant-garde art, continued to develop since the 1980s as an outgrowth of modern art developments post-Cultural Revolution. 
[[File:Chinese-han-yajuan-FashionEnsemble.jpg|450px|thumb|left|[[Han Yajuan]]: Fashion Ensemble. Oil on Canvas, 2010 (180 cm x 360 cm).]]
Contemporary Chinese art fully incorporates painting, film, video, photography, and performance. Until recently, art exhibitions deemed controversial have been routinely shut down by police, and performance artists in particular faced the threat of arrest in the early 1990s. More recently there has been greater tolerance by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]], though many internationally acclaimed artists are still restricted from media exposure at home or have exhibitions ordered closed. Leading contemporary visual artists include [[Ai Weiwei]], [[Cai Guoqiang]], [[Cai Jin]], [[Chan Shengyao]], [[Fang Lijun]], [[Fu Wenjun]], [[He Xiangyu]], [[Huang Yan (artist)|Huang Yan]], [[Huang Yong Ping]], [[Han Yajuan]], [[Kong Bai Ji]], [[Li Hongbo]], [[Li Hui (artist)|Li Hui]], [[Liu Bolin]], [[Lu Shengzhong]], [[Ma Liuming]], [[Qiu Shihua]], [[Shen Shaomin]], [[Shi Jinsong]], [[Song Dong]], [[Li Wei (artist)|Li Wei]], [[Wang Guangyi]], [[Wenda Gu]], [[Xu Bing]], [[Yang Zhichao]], [[Zhan Wang]], [[Zheng Lianjie]], [[Zhang Dali]], [[Zhang Xiaogang]], [[Zhang Huan]], [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]], [[Ma Kelu]], [[Ding Fang]], [[Shang Yang (artist)|Shang Yang]], [[Gao Minglu]] and [[Guo Jian]].

===Visual art===
Beginning in the late 1980s there was unprecedented exposure for younger Chinese visual artists in the west to some degree through the agency of curators based outside the country such as [[Hou Hanru]]. Local curators within the country such as [[Gao Minglu]] and critics such as [[Li Xianting]] (栗憲庭) reinforced this promotion of particular brands of painting that had recently emerged, while also spreading the idea of art as a strong social force within Chinese culture. There was some controversy as critics identified these imprecise representations of contemporary Chinese art as having been constructed out of personal preferences, a kind of programmatized artist-curator relationship that only further alienated the majority of the avant-garde from Chinese officialdom and western art market patronage.

==Art market==
[[File:AllTheMountainsBlanketedinred.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''All The Mountains Blanketed in Red'' by Li Keran]]

For centuries largely made-up of European and American buyers, the international buying market for Chinese art has also begun to be dominated by Chinese dealers and collectors in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/arts/03iht-melik3.html "Chinese Bidders Conquer Market"] article by Souren Melikian in ''[[The New York Times]]'' April 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported in 2011, China has become the world's second biggest market for art and antiques, accounting for 23 percent of the world's total art market, behind the United States (which accounts for 34 percent of the world's art market).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=AFP |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/china-overtakes-britain-as-second-biggest-art-market-2245587.html |title=China overtakes Britain as second biggest art market |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=March 18, 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another transformation driving the growth of the Chinese art market is the rise of a clientele no longer mostly European or American.

[[File:Escher Circle Limit III.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Circle Limit III'', 1959]]
'''''Circle Limit III''''' is a [[woodcut]] made in 1959 by Dutch artist [[M. C. Escher]], in which "strings of fish shoot up like rockets from infinitely far away" and then "fall back again whence they came".&lt;ref name="eq"&gt;Escher, as quoted by {{harvtxt|Coxeter|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of a series of four woodcuts by Escher depicting ideas from [[hyperbolic geometry]]. Dutch physicist and mathematician Bruno Ernst called it "the best of the four".&lt;ref name="cox79"&gt;{{citation|first=H. S. M.|last=Coxeter|authorlink=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|title=The non-Euclidean symmetry of Escher's picture 'Circle Limit III'|journal=Leonardo|volume=12|pages=19–25|year=1979|jstor=1574078}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
[[File:Hyperbolic domains 642.png|left|thumb|upright=0.8|The (6,4,2) triangular hyperbolic tiling that inspired Escher]]
Escher became interested in [[tessellation|tessellations of the plane]] after a 1936 visit to the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], Spain,&lt;ref name="emmer"&gt;{{citation

and from the time of his 1937 artwork ''[[Metamorphosis I]]'' he had begun incorporating tessellated human and animal figures into his artworks.&lt;ref name="mside"/&gt;

In a 1958 letter from Escher to [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]], Escher wrote that he was inspired to make his ''Circle Limit'' series by a figure in Coxeter's article "Crystal 
Symmetry and its Generalizations".&lt;ref name="cox79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emmer"/&gt; Coxeter's figure depicts a [[tessellation]] of the [[hyperbolic plane]] by [[right triangle]]s with angles of 30°, 45°, and 90°; triangles with these angles are possible in hyperbolic geometry but not in Euclidean geometry. This tessellation may be interpreted as depicting the lines of reflection and fundamental domains of the [[Truncated tetrahexagonal tiling|(6,4,2)]] [[triangle group]].&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter expanded on the mathematics of triangle group tessellations, including this one in {{citation

==Geometry==
[[File:Circle limits III with overlay.png|thumb|The [[alternated octagonal tiling]], a [[uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic tiling]] of squares and equilateral triangles, overlaid on Escher's image]]
Escher seems to have believed that the white curves of his woodcut, which bisect the fish, represent hyperbolic lines in the [[Poincaré disk model]] of the hyperbolic plane, in which the whole hyperbolic plane is modeled as a disk in the Euclidean plane, and hyperbolic lines are modeled as circular arcs perpendicular to the disk boundary. Indeed, Escher wrote that the fish move "perpendicularly to the boundary".&lt;ref name="eq"/&gt; However, as Coxeter demonstrated, there is no hyperbolic [[arrangement of lines]] whose faces are alternately squares and equilateral triangles, as the figure depicts. Rather, the white curves are [[Hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycles]] that meet the boundary circle at angles of {{nowrap|cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{sfrac|2&lt;sup&gt;{{1/4}}&lt;/sup&gt; − 2&lt;sup&gt;−{{1/4}}&lt;/sup&gt;|2}},}} approximately&amp;nbsp;80°.&lt;ref name="cox79"/&gt;

The symmetry axes of the triangles and squares that lie between the white lines are true hyperbolic lines. The squares and triangles of the woodcut closely resemble the [[tritetragonal tiling]] of the hyperbolic plane, which also features squares and triangles meeting in the same incidence pattern.
However, the precise geometry of these shapes is not the same. In the tritetragonal tiling, the sides of the squares and triangles are hyperbolically straight line segments, which do not link up in smooth curves; instead they form [[polygonal chain]]s with corners. In Escher's woodcut, the sides of the squares and triangles are formed by arcs of hypercycles, which are not straight in hyperbolic geometry, but which connect smoothly to each other without corners.

The points at the centers of the squares, where four fish meet at their fins, form the vertices of an [[order-8 triangular tiling]], while the points where three fish fins meet and the points where three white lines cross together form the vertices of its [[Dual polyhedron|dual]], the [[octagonal tiling]].&lt;ref name="cox79"/&gt; Similar tessellations by lines of fish may be constructed for other hyperbolic tilings formed by [[polygon]]s other than triangles and squares, or with more than three white curves at each crossing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Douglas|last=Dunham|contribution=More “Circle Limit III” patterns|url=https://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/dunbrid06.pdf|title=The Bridges Conference: Mathematical Connections in Art, Music, and Science, London, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symmetry==
Viewed as a pattern, ignoring the colors of the fish, in the hyperbolic plane, the woodcut has three-fold and four-fold [[rotational symmetry]] at the centers of its triangles and squares, respectively, and order-three [[dihedral symmetry]] (the symmetry of an equilateral triangle) at the points where the white curves cross. In [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s [[orbifold notation]], this set of symmetries is denoted 433. Each fish provides a fundamental region for this symmetry group. Contrary to appearances, the fish do not have [[bilateral symmetry]]: the white curves of the drawing are not axes of reflection symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Conway wrote that "The work ''Circle Limit III'' is equally intriguing" (in comparison to ''Circle Limit IV'', which has a different symmetry group), and uses is it as an example of this symmetry group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Herford|title=The geometry of M.

For example, the angle at the back of the right fin is 90° (where four fins meet), but at the back of the much smaller left fin it is 120° (where three fins meet).

==Printing details==
The fish in ''Circle Limit III'' are depicted in four colors, allowing each string of fish to have a single color and each two adjacent fish to have different colors. Together with the black ink used to outline the fish, the overall woodcut has five colors. It is printed from five wood blocks, each of which provides one of the colors within a quarter of the disk, for a total of 20 impressions. The diameter of the outer circle, as printed, is {{cvt|41.5|cm|frac=8}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=M. C.

[[image:sch_ewf_6.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Example of a color wash in multiple hues]]
A '''color wash''' is a popular technique in [[faux painting]] using [[paint]] thinned out with [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] to create a subtle wash of color over walls or other surfaces.  

Color washing is an easy and forgiving form of faux finishing often used by beginners, but perfected by professional finishers.  It was historically created with oil-based products because of the long drying time, but today's environmental and health conscious companies are producing user-friendly water based glazes.  Color washing can be done in any color of paint and is generally applied with brushes over a solid paint color, using long sweeping strokes to meld the glaze colors together.

'''Dematerialization of the art object''' is an idea in [[conceptual art]].  In "Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object" [[Lucy Lippard]] characterizes the period of 1966 to 1972 as one in which the [[art object]] was dematerialised through the new artistic practices of [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Blocker]] ''What the Body Cost''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fictional locations''' are places that exist only in [[fiction]] and not in reality, such as the [[Dark Kingdom|Negaverse]] or [[Planet X]]. Writers may create and describe such places to serve as backdrop for their fictional works. Fictional locations are also created for use as settings in [[role-playing games]] such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]''.  They may also be used for technical reasons in actual reality for use in the development of specifications, such as the fictional country of [[Bookland]], which is used to allow [[European Article Number|EAN]] "country" codes 978 and 979 to be used for [[ISBN]] numbers assigned to books, and code 977 to be assigned for use for [[ISSN]] numbers on magazines and other [[periodical]]s.

Fictional locations vary greatly in their size. Very small places like a single room are kept out of the umbrella of fictional locations by convention, as are most single buildings. A fictional location can be the size of a university ([[Howard Phillips Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Miskatonic University]]), a town ([[Stephen King]]'s [[Salem's Lot]]), a county ([[William Faulkner|William Faulkner's]] [[Yoknapatawpha County]]), a state ([[Winnemac (fictional U.S. state)|Winnemac]] in various [[Sinclair Lewis]] stories), a large section of continent (as in north-western [[Middle-earth]], which supposedly represents Europe), a whole planet ([[Anne McCaffrey]]'s [[Pern]]), a whole galaxy ([[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[The Foundation Series|''Foundation'']] books), even a [[multiverse]] (''[[His Dark Materials]]''). In a larger scale, occasionally the term [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] is used, but only if it is considered a variant of Earth rather than an original world. [[Austin Tappan Wright]]'s ''[[Islandia (novel)|Islandia]]'' has an invented continent, Karain, on our world. However in [[fanfiction]], along with [[pastiche]] and/or [[parody]], it is not considered canon unless they get [[authorization|authorized]].

==Locating a story==
Within narrative prose, providing a believable location can be greatly enhanced by the provision of maps and other illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mapping a fictional location | author=Elsa Neal | work= Fiction Writing Site | url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art9382.asp | accessdate=2007-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often considered particularly true for [[fantasy novel]]s and [[historical novel]]s which often make great use of the map, but applies equally to [[science fiction]] and [[Mystery fiction|mysteries]]: earlier, in mainstream novels by [[Anthony Trollope]], [[William Faulkner]], etc. Fantasy and science fiction novels often also provide sections which provide documentation of various aspects of the environment of the fiction, including languages, character lists, cultures and, of course, locations.

In an online article on writing Dawn Arkin writes about the importance of location to the author's art:

{{quote|text=
Setting has become a very important part of most novels.

Creating a fictional location has many advantages for the writer. You get to name the town, streets, businesses, schools, etc. Everything inside your town is under your control.
|sign=Dawn Arkin
|source={{Citation |title=What Should Your Story's Setting Be? |publisher=[[EzineArticles]]&lt;!--black listed |url=http://ezinearticles.com/?What-Should-Your-Storys-Setting-Be?&amp;id=293268 --&gt; |date=7 September 2006}}}}

Maps are an immediate necessity for some works, as they do not take place on our Earth. Writers need working maps to keep straight at a glance whether the castle is north or south of the river, and how long it takes to get between valleys. This can be very helpful in preventing snags when dealing directly with fictional geography.

{{quote|text=
Authors are as forgetful and absent-minded as the lesser breeds of humankind, and a simple precaution like taking a moment to sketch out a map helps prevent such errors and inconsistencies (upon which eagle-eyed readers are bound to swoop with gleeful cries, thereafter sitting down to write nasty letters to the poor author).

|source={{Citation |chapter=Of World-Making: Some Problems of the Invented Milieu |title=[[Imaginary Worlds – the Art of Fantasy|Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |year=1973}}}}

Sometimes an actual geographic corner is used as a model for "getting it right", and identifying these can become a game for readers. Authors may turn an island into a continent or vice versa, rotate orientation, or combine two similar locales to get the best (for the story) of both.

'''''Foster Child''''' is a 1987 documentary film by [[Gil Cardinal]], exploring the filmmaker's search, at age thirty-five, for [[biological family]].

'''Centre for Theatre Practices "Gardzienice"''' was founded in 1977 by [[Włodzimierz Staniewski]], and formally registered in 1978. The name comes from the village where the theatre is located. The group gained international critical acclaim, and is classified as an [[alternative theatre|experimental]] anthropological theater.  In 1997 the association established the Academy for Theatre Practices. This carries out numerous projects: research, arts, music, and cultural investigation into the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodge|first=Alison|title=Twentieth Century Actor Training|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-19452-5|pages=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8TcVOG-pWYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Włodzimierz Staniewski was a former collaborator of [[Jerzy Grotowski]], and in his choice of just such an isolated environment, Staniewski may have been inspired by his work with Grotwoski in Brzezinka,&lt;ref name="Hodge2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodge|first=Alison|title=Hidden Territories|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;   but with an important difference: rather than emphasising an isolating escape from urban existence, Gardzienice represented for him a pursuit of integrative existence within a community, albeit of a different sort.  From the outset, Gardzienice sought to work with the local people, taking interaction with them as both inspiration for a way of life, and for a way of developing performance.  It was in this environment that the whole basis for the group's early work, the 'expedition', was born.  Staniewski describes the expedition as  having "the character of a permanent journey through a chosen territory, with the possibility of not only touching on the culture of people, but also the "culture of the earth" .  This may not constitute a strict anthropological exercise in the purely academic sense, and Staniewski may insist on a less clinical term, but at its heart is arguably an interest in the study of people.  According to [[Richard Schechner]], Gardzienice constitutes "the very heart and essence of Polish experimental and anthropological performance."&lt;ref name="Hodge2004" /&gt;

== Constellation ==
Staniewski uses the term "constellation" to describe a particular arrangement of actors/collaborators who come together to create a performance.[48] This is to emphasize the individuality of each actor, who personality contributes to the creation of a work. Each performance is matched to the predisposition of the actor, rather than the other way around. The director builds a constellation for each performance from scratch, inviting actors to cooperate with the Centre. Despite this practice, many artists remain in "Gardzienice" for many years. Staniewski does not look for professional theatre actors (he himself studied Polish language), but what matters is the personality of the candidate. Since the founding of the Academy for Theatre Practices, new actors are recruited mainly from among its graduates. The first constellation in 1977 was created by Staniewski with Henryk Andruszka, Jan Bernad, Tomasz Rodowicz, Waldemar Sidor, Jan Tabaka oraz Wanda Wróbel. Since then, "Gardzienice" has included of over 50 actors, with none but Staniewski remaining from the original group. The longest-standing collaborator is Mariusz Gołaj, who joined the team in 1979.

'''Baron Guy Édouard Alphonse Paul de Rothschild''' ({{IPA-fr|baʁɔ̃ ɡi edwaːʁt‿alfɔ̃s pɔl də ʁɔt.ʃild|pron}}; 21 May 1909 – 12 June 2007) was a French banker and member of the [[Rothschild family]]. He owned the  bank [[Rothschild banking family of France|Rothschild Frères]] from 1967 to 1979, when it was nationalized by the French government, and maintained possessions in other French and foreign companies including [[Imerys]]. He was named to the [[International Best Dressed List]] Hall of Fame in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/bestdressed/bestdressed_men ''Vanity Fair''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601052941/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/bestdressed/bestdressed_men |date=2012-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Baron Guy de Rothschild was born in Paris, the  son of Baron [[Édouard Alphonse James de Rothschild|Édouard de Rothschild]] (1868–1949) and his wife, the former Germaine Alice Halphen (1884–1975). He has three siblings. Guy's elder brother, Édouard Alphonse Émile Lionel (1906–1911), died at the age of four of appendicitis;&lt;ref&gt;The Whims of Fortune:  The Memoirs of Guy de Rothschild&lt;/ref&gt; he also had two younger sisters, [[Jacqueline Piatigorsky|Jacqueline]] and [[Bethsabée de Rothschild|Bethsabée]].  Half of his great-grandparents were Rothschilds.  He was a great-great grandson of the German patriarch of the Rothschild family [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] (1743–1812), who founded the family's banking in the 18th century in Frankfurt, Germany.

He grew up at his parents' townhouse on the corner of the [[rue de Rivoli]] and the [[Place de la Concorde]] in Paris (a property once occupied by [[Talleyrand]] and now the [[Embassy of the United States, Paris|United States Embassy]]) and their country estate at [[Château de Ferrières]], 25 miles north-east of Paris. Château de Ferrières is a massive house built to a design by [[Joseph Paxton]] in the 1850s, based on Paxton's earlier design of [[Mentmore Towers]] for [[Baron Mayer de Rothschild]] of the English branch of the Rothschild family.

He was educated at the [[Lycée Condorcet]] and [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris, and by private tutors. He undertook military service with the cavalry at [[Saumur]], and played [[golf]] for France. He won the [[Grand Prix de Sud-Ouest]] in 1948.

==Personal life==
Guy de Rothschild married twice:
*In 1937, he married a distant cousin, Baroness Alix Hermine Jeanette Schey de Koromla (1911–1982). Alix was the former wife of Kurt Krahmer and the younger daughter of Baron [[Philipp Schey von Koromla]], the first Hungarian Jew to be made an [[Austrian nobility|Austrian noble]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13262-schey-philipp-baron-von-koromla Jewish Encyclopedia: SCHEY, PHILIPP, BARON VON KOROMLA] retrieved March 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They had one child, [[David René de Rothschild]] (born 1942).  Rothschild also raised his wife's daughters from her prior marriage to Krahmer, Lili and Bettina. They divorced in 1956.
*In 1957, he married [[Marie-Hélène de Rothschild|Baroness Marie-Hélène van Zuylen van Nyevelt]] (1927–1996). Marie-Hélène's first marriage to Count [[François de Nicolay]]—with whom she had one son, Philippe de Nicolay—had been dissolved in 1956. Like his first wife, she was a distant cousin, though in this case, a [[Roman Catholic]].  They had one child, Baron [[Édouard de Rothschild]] (born 1957).

After his second marriage, Guy de Rothschild renovated the Château de Ferrières, using it to put on lavish balls in the early 1970s, before donating it to the [[University of Paris]] in 1975.  The same year, he bought the [[Hôtel Lambert]] on the [[Île Saint-Louis]] in Paris, the top floors of which became his Paris residence.

==Service in World War II==
In 1940, as a result of the [[German occupation of France in World War II]], Guy de Rothschild's parents and sister [[Bethsabée de Rothschild|Bethsabée]] fled France and made their way to safety in [[New York City]]. Guy de Rothschild had enlisted in the [[French Army]] and was a company commander in the 3rd Light Mechanised Division during the [[Battle of France]] in early 1940. After fighting the Nazis at [[Carvin]], he was part of the French Army that was forced to retreat to [[Dunkirk]]. He was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de Guerre]] for his actions on the beaches at Dunkirk, from where he was evacuated to England.  He immediately returned to France, landing at [[Brest, France|Brest]], and taking charge of the family's office at [[La Bourboule]], near [[Clermont-Ferrand]].

Under the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]], his father and uncles were stripped of their French nationality, removed from the register of the [[Légion d'honneur]], and the family was forced to sell its possessions.  Rothschild managed to persuade the buyers to grant options under which he would later be able to buy the family's interests back.  He left France again, via Spain and Portugal, to join his parents in [[New York City]].  He joined the [[Free French Forces]] and boarded the cargo ship, ''Pacific Grove'', to travel back to Europe.  His ship was torpedoed and sunk in March 1943, and he was rescued after spending 12 hours in the waters of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In England, he joined the staff of General Koenig at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] near Portsmouth.

==Banking and business==
Guy de Rothschild studied law at university then joined [[de Rothschild Frères]] in 1931 when it was being run by his father and a cousin, [[Robert de Rothschild]], who died in 1946. As part of his learning to manage the family's businesses, in 1933 he joined the executive board of their [[Compagnie des chemins de fer du Nord|Northern Railway Company]].

At the end of World War II, Guy de Rothschild returned to the bank's offices at [[rue Laffitte]] in Paris in 1944. On his father's death in 1949, Guy de Rothschild took formal control of the business. Years later, Rothschild was on the cover of the 20 December 1963 issue of [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] magazine in a story that said he took "over the family's French bank during the disorder of war and defeat, changed its character from stewardship of the family fortune to expansive modern banking."

Following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, Guy de Rothschild served as a director of the [[Banque de France]]. On his father's death, he also inherited part of [[Château Lafite-Rothschild]] but did not run it.

[[Georges Pompidou]], who would later become [[President of France|President]] and [[Prime Minister of France]], was recruited by Guy de Rothschild from a job as a teacher, and worked for him from 1953 to 1962, during which time he became the general manager of the Rothschild bank.  The bank diversified, from investment management under De Rothschild Frères to the deposit-taking Banque de Rothschild, with branches throughout France.  Guy was its president from 1968 to 1978.  In 1968 Guy de Rothschild became a partner at [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons]], [[London]], while cousin [[Evelyn Robert de Rothschild|Sir Evelyn de Rothschild]] was appointed a director of [[de Rothschild Frères|Banque Rothschild]], Paris.

===Imetal S.A.===
In France, Rothschild developed the country's largest private [[uranium mining]] company, the Compagnie Française des Minerais d'Uranium.
In 1961, Guy de Rothschild took over as Chairman of [[Imerys|Imetal S.A.]] in which the family had a substantial stake. His involvement marked the first time any Rothschild had personally participated in the management of the business. Among its holdings, the international mining conglomerate owned [[Société Le Nickel]] (SLN) in [[New Caledonia]]. In 1969, SLN acquired [[Pennaroya Mining|Peñarroya]], a [[Chile]]an based company which mined and processed [[lead]], [[zinc]] and [[copper]]. Two years later SLN took over La Compagnie de Mokta, which specialized in [[iron]], [[manganese]], [[sand]], [[gravel]] and [[uranium]]. Rothschild restructured the family's various mining interests, including Peñarroya which became part of SLN.

===Nationalization===
In the early 1970s the government of France began [[Nationalization|nationalizing]] a number of industries and after declaring nickel to be a vital market commodity, SLN's assets were nationalized in 1974 and placed under a new company, Société Metallurgique. The result left the Rothschild's SLN as a holding company with a fifty percent interest in Société Metallurgique.

When the Rothschild's bank was nationalized in 1981 by the socialist government of [[François Mitterrand]], a discouraged Guy de Rothschild left France and moved temporarily to New York City. "A Jew under [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]], a [[:wikt:pariah|pariah]] under Mitterrand, that's enough!" ({{lang-fr|Juif sous Pétain, paria sous Mitterrand, cela suffit!}}) he wrote in a frontpage op-ed in ''[[Le Monde]]'' in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/les-rothschild-rois-des-banquiers_474046.html |title=Les Rothschild, rois des banquiers |date=December 19, 2007 |newspaper=L'Express }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following another change in government policy, in 1987 a new banking business was established by his son [[David René de Rothschild|David]] and nephew [[Éric de Rothschild|Éric]], who founded [[Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque]].

==Thoroughbred racing==
Guy de Rothschild was a renowned breeder of [[Thoroughbred]]s as the family owns [[Haras de Meautry]] in [[Normandy]]. He inherited [[Château de Reux]] in the [[horse breeding]] area in [[Lower Normandy]] about 125 miles north of Paris. He produced prominent [[race horse]]s, the most famous perhaps was [[Exbury (horse)|Exbury]].

Guy de Rothschild chaired the association of racehorse breeders in France from 1975 to 1982.

Among the major races Guy de Rothschild's horses won were:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france-galop.com/All-the-races.233+M52087573ab0.0.html?&amp;course_id=3153&amp;no_cache=1&amp;numero_id=99&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How to Read Literature Like a Professor''''' is a [[New York Times bestseller|''New York Times'' bestseller]] by Thomas C. Foster that was published in 2003. The author suggests interpretations of themes, concepts, and possible symbols commonly found in literature. The book brands itself as "A Lively and Entertaining Guide to Reading Between the Lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How to Read Literature Like a Professor |last=Foster |first=Thomas|year=2003 |publisher=Harper |location=New York |isbn=0-06-000942-X |pages=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also includes sample interpretations of [[Katherine Mansfield]]'s short story, "The Garden Party". 

The author's simple, methodical take on literary interpretation has fallen under the scrutiny of literary experts, such as the English professor and biographer Alan Jacobs, who questions the value of the book's premise and criticizes the idea that "reading is best done by highly trained, professionally accredited experts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/09/136857010/easy-reading-just-take-it-one-page-at-a-time|date=June 9, 2011|title=Easy Reading: Just Take It One Page At a Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hunter's Home''''' (Dutch: ''Jagerswoning'') is an 1826 oil painting by the Belgian artist [[Henry Voordecker]]. The painting depicts a [[hunter]] at home, surrounded by animals and members of his family; a typical [[genre painting]].  It is in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam.  

It is in a typical [[Biedermeier]] style and its themes are characterized by the reinforced feelings of security, ''[[gemütlichkeit]]'', traditional simplicity, portraying a [[Sentimentality|sentimental]] view of the world.&lt;ref name="belvedere.at"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.belvedere.at/en/sammlungen/belvedere/klassizismus-romantik-biedermeier/biedermeier|title=klassizismus-romantik-biedermeier|publisher=www.belvedere.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts a family at the doorway of their home.  The dwelling is brick-built, with a vine scrambling around the arched stone doorway.  A mother with a child sit in front of a young man in hunting clothes with a dog (perhaps a [[Drentse Patrijshond|Dutch Partridge Dog]]) and a hunting gun. Chickens and doves are on the steps in front of the doorway; a magpie is in a cage beside the door, and more doves around a [[dovecote]] to the left.&lt;ref name=rijksmuseum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-1157|title=Jagerswoning|publisher=www.rijksmuseum.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To the left of the steps stands another child, and a young woman doing laundry, with a horned white cow in a stable to the far left. To the right of the door is a second dog on a chain, various domestic pots and pans on the roof of a wooden kennel or henhouse, and a potted plant with small red flowers (perhaps a [[pelargonium]]) on a window ledge.  

It is signed and dated "H. Voordecker fecit 1826", and measures {{convert|62|x|78|cm}}.  It was acquired by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam in 1828.&lt;ref name=rijksmuseum/&gt;

'''INID''' is an [[acronym]] for '''Internationally agreed Numbers for the Identification of (bibliographic) Data'''.&lt;ref name="st9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/standards/en/pdf/03-09-01.pdf|title=WIPO standard ST.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; INID codes are used by [[patent office]]s worldwide for indicating specific bibliographic data items on the title pages of [[patent]]s and patent application publications.  INID codes use Arabic numerals, and so are language-independent. For example, number ''(30)'' indicates priority data, and ''(51)'' technical area according to the [[International Patent Classification]] (IPC).&lt;ref&gt;Example for INID codes on the [http://v3.espacenet.com/origdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;F=0&amp;IDX=EP0123456&amp;QPN=EP0123456 front page] of {{Patent|EP|0123456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indian People’s Theatre Association''' ('''IPTA''') is the oldest association of theatre-artists in [[India]]. IPTA was formed in 1943 [[British Raj|pre independence India]], during which it promoted themes related to the [[Indian freedom struggle]]. Its goal was to bring cultural awakening among the people of India.&lt;ref&gt;Bengali Theatre and Performing Arts. Article in [http://www.bangla-online.info/BanglaLanguage/BengaliTheatrePerformanceArts.htm Bangla-online.info]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the cultural wing of the [[Communist Party of India]].&lt;ref name="LoweLloyd1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lisa Lowe|author2=David Lloyd|title=The Politics of Culture in the Shadow of Capital|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKzABvKz-gAC&amp;pg=PA454|accessdate=16 December 2012|date=27 October 1997|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-2046-3|pages=454–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning==
Banglore unit of IPTA was formed in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198601746.001.0001/acref-9780198601746-e-1898|title=Indian People's Theatre Association - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198601746.001.0001/acref-9780198601746-e-1898|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPTA was formed on 25 May 1943 at the National conference of theater artists held at the Marwari school, [[Bombay]] in response to the need for theater artists to become part of the Indian freedom struggle. Its origins lay in the first Progressive Writer’s Association Conference that was held in 1936, the establishment of the Youth Cultural Institute at Calcutta in 1940, and the setting up of the People’s Theatre in Bangalore by Anil De’ Silva in 1941. Its initial members consisted of various progressive cultural troupes, theatre groups and other progressive cultural activists. The name People’s Theatre was suggested by the renowned scientist Homi Jahangir Bhabha who was in turn inspired by Romain Rolland’s book on the concepts of People’s Theatre.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |title=About IPTA and its history |url=http://www.iptaindia.in/about/ | publisher=IPTA |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its initial activities included street plays organized by Binoy Roy of the Bengal Cultural Squad to inform people of the 1942 manmade famine in Bengal. Their ski included a choir ‘Bhookha Hai Bengal’ created by Vamik Jaunpuri and other songs and plays. The squad included musician Prem Dhawan , drum player Dashrath Lal, singer Reva Roy and actress Usha Dutt. Motivated by this squad, several other cultural groups were formed including the Agra Cultural Squad. IPTA was subsequently formed to organize these local groups at the national level.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; 

Ideologically these groups were inspired by the left movement and the then General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, P.C. Joshi and the General Secrtetary of the Progressive Writers’ Association Sajjad Zaheer.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==initial Members==
Some of the initial members of the group were [[Prithviraj Kapoor]], [[Bijon Bhattacharya]], [[Balraj Sahni]], [[Ritwik Ghatak]], [[Utpal Dutt]], [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]], [[Salil Chowdhury]], Pandit [[Ravi Shankar]], Jyotirindra Moitra, [[Niranjan Singh Maan]], [[S. Tera Singh Chan]], [[Jagdish Faryadi]], [[Khalili Faryadi]], [[Rajendra Raghuvanshi]] Safdar Mir, Hasan Premani,Amiya Bose etc. The group was formed in 1942, in the background of the [[Second World War]], with [[Bengal famine of 1943]] and starvation deaths in India on the one hand and repression by the colonial masters in the wake of the [[Quit India Movement]] and the aggression by the fascist powers on the [[Soviet Union]] on the other. An All India People's Theatre Conference was held in [[Mumbai]] in 1943 where the group presented its idea and objective of representing the crisis of the time through the medium of theatre and to help people understand their rights and duties. This conference led to the formation of committees of IPTA across India. The movement hit not only theatres, but also cinema and music in Indian languages.Now it is the cultural wing of Communist Party of India (CPI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution of IPTA |url=http://www.iptaindia.in/about/constitution-of-ipta/ | publisher=IPTA |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Nabanna''==
{{Main|Nabanna (play)}}
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Shobha sen in nabanna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shobha Sen]] in ''[[Nabanna]]'', 1944]] --&gt;
The most important of the dramas were ''[[Nabanna (play)|Nabanna]]'' (Harvest). ''Nabanna'' is a folk-cultural festival of [[Bengal]] to celebrate the harvest. This [[Bengali language|Bengali]] drama, written by Bijon Bhattacharya and directed by [[Sombhu Mitra]], portrayed the evils of the [[Bengal famine of 1943]]

==Other dramas and films==
''Nava Jiboner Gaan'' (Song of New  Life) by [[Jyotirindra Moitra]] and the film ''[[Dharti Ke Lal]]'' (Children of the Earth) by [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]] followed ''Nabanna'' in addressing the needs of the people. These performances were characteristic for their vivid, stark portrayal of the suffering of the masses. Similar productions were carried out all over India, like ''Deshasathi'' in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] which was about the attack on the Soviet Union by [[Nazi]] [[Germany]]; ''Prarambham'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]; and ''Zubeida'' directed by [[Balraj Sahni]] and based on the story of a Muslim girl from [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]]. [[Manikuntala Sen]], the fire band woman of left politics acted in this play along with [[Gopal Halder]], who later became an educationist.

==Break up and legacy==
Though the group was temporarily dispersed by the [[Indian National Congress]] government using police violence and repressive measures in 1947, its main members continued to carry the legacy of IPTA by forming several groups with similar ideology. Ahindra Chowdhuri, [[Sombhu Mitra]] and [[Tripti Mitra]] were the leading members of the group ''Bohurupee''. ''Raktakarabi'', ''Tahar Nam Ti Ranjana'', ''Char Adhyay'' (written by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]) were some of the earlier productions of Bohurupee. Utpal Dutt led another faction of artists and went to create classics like ''Tiner Talowar'' and ''Kallol''. '''IPTA Mumbai''' was another offshoot that has existed over the last six decades and continue to produce dramas till date.&lt;ref&gt;Indian People's Theatre Association. [http://www.mumbaitheatreguide.com/dramas/groups/ipta.asp Article in mumbaitheatreguide.com]&lt;/ref&gt; IPTA offshoots exist in other parts of India as well.&lt;ref&gt;Suhrid Sankar Chattopadhyay. [http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2213/stories/20050701001708800.htm A stage for social commitment]. Frontline. Volume 22, Issue 13, June18 - July01, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Group theaters like ''[[Nandikar]]'', ''Spandan'' of Kolkata still produce their dramas often in the line of the IPTA movement, and recently there has been effort to start a similar movement inspired by the IPTA.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Peoples Theatre Association revival by [http://www.spandanipta.com/about.html Spandan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Delhi-based theatre company [[Jana Natya Manch]], best known for its street theatre, also emerged from the IPTA in 1973. Noted film director, [[Ritwik Ghatak]] made a Bengali film, ''[[Komal Gandhar]]'' (1961) set around IPTA theatre group.

There are many groups which were regionally floated and still continue the legacy of IPTA both Pre and Post independence. Some of the groups which have grown to be biggest of theater groups in India.

In 1994, when the Golden Jubilee of IPTA was celebrated nationwide, this unit decided to celebrate the Golden Jubilee by organizing a five-day theatre festival during the month of December. Although meant to be a one-off event, it was very well received and later on, it was decided to continue this as an annual event. This is how the National Theatre Festival was born and conceived.

The same year IPTA was reorganized and it spread its activities, started imparting training and updating artists by means of organizing theatre workshops every year for youth as well as for children. Since 1995, theatre stalwarts like [[Arun Pandey]], [[Sanjay Upadhyay]], [[Suman Kumar]], [[Gautam Mazumdar]], [[Devendra Raj Ankur]], [[Ranjeet Kapoor]], [[Akhilesh Khanna]], [[Neeraj Wahal]], [[Praveen Gunjan]] &amp; [[Anjana Puri]] have conducted workshops and trained our artists.

In 2001, IPTA Raigarh registered itself as ‘IPTA Center for Cultural Resources and Training’ with the Registrar of firms &amp; societies, Government of India.

Then in 2003 it launched ‘RITU SUKHE BIBARNO KAVITA’ conflict between libido crisis and continuous transformation of the conjugal life. On 2003 another short play ‘MAA’, inspired from ‘Mother’ by Maxim Gorky was staged. In 2004 it has launched its first bi-lingual production ‘Chitrangada’, a mythological journey of metamorphosis, inspired from Tagore’s dance drama ‘Chitrangada’. For the first time from the drawing room pattern, the director tried to explore a new form. Live music, Folk Elements, Martial Art, Chhou (known folk form) and songs of Tagore was used to design the drama. The novelty and musical format earn the invitation in two consecutive “National Youth Festival” of 2005 and 2006. The production won ‘gold’ in 2005. Now it is working in its new production “Sacrifice”, premiered at Rabindra Sadan on 6th March 2007. --&gt;

She painted landscapes, still lifes, genre scenes, sketches from the life. Most famous for her sensual still lifes with wildlife flowers and fruits in interior and exterior.

At the beginning of 1990 her works were at expositions of some exhibitions abroad with other Leningrad artists[&lt;ref&gt;''ECOLE DE SAINT-PETERSBOURG : catalogue / ARCOLE / Etude Gros-Delettrez. — Paris : Drouot Richelieu, 27 Janvier, 1992. — INDEX 164 à 166''.&lt;/ref&gt;][&lt;ref&gt;''ECOLE DE SAINT-PETERSBOURG : catalogue / ARCOLE / Etude Gros-Delettrez. — Paris : Drouot Richelieu, 13 Mars, 1992. — INDEX 195 à 198.''&lt;/ref&gt;][&lt;ref&gt;''Peintures Russes — РУССКИЕ ХУДОЖНИКИ : catalogue / s.a.

'''Linda Aronson''' (born 20 March 1950) is a British-born Australian [[screenwriter]], educator and author. She wrote the [[Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts|AACTA]]-nominated drama ''[[Kostas (film)|Kostas]]'' and several television series, such as ''[[Something in the Air]]'' and ''[[G.P.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aacta.org/winners-nominees/1970-1979/1979.aspx AACTA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/A157?mainTabTemplate=agentWorksBy Austlit]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[London]], Aronson moved out to [[Essex]] at a young age. She studied at [[Ulster University]], then did late nineteenth century fiction at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], but abandoned it to pursue a career as a writer. Her first paid writing job was a 1973 radio adaptation of her own [[Play (theatre)|stage play]], ''Closing Down'' for ABC. This was followed by ''Cafe in a Side Street'' in 1975, and ''The Fall Guy'' in 1976. The latter success lead to her writing ''Kostas''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adelaidescreenwriter.blogspot.com/2013/01/an-interview-with-linda-aronson.html Adelaide Screenwriter Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The 21st Century Screenplay'' ==
Aronson is also a prolific author, having written several books including the screenwriting guide ''The 21st Century Screenplay.'' The book was written as a response to standard screenwriting teaching that focused on linear, single protagonist stories. Aronsson, instead, discusses how to write for non-linear stories with multiple characters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lindaaronson.com/21st-century-screenplay.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://scriptangel.com/writing-non-linear-flashback-and-ensemble-scripts-by-linda-aronson/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.livingspiritgroup.com/podcasts/vodcasts/linda-aronson/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.networkisa.org/modules/curious/view/writing-non-linear-and-ensembles-for-film-and-tv-with-linda-aronson&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35759">'''List of Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros publications''' is a collection of exhibition catalogs, scholarly works, and ebooks focused on Latin American art published by [[Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros]] (CPPC), a privately held Latin American art collection organization founded by [[Patricia Phelps de Cisneros]] and [[Gustavo Cisneros]] based in [[Venezuela]] and [[New York City]].

== History ==
Since the 1990s, the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros was created with a goal of bringing visibility and impact to the way Latin American art history is viewed and appreciated both on a regional and international level. As part of its four-pronged approach, CPPC lends artworks often in traveling exhibitions held at major institutional partners with accompanying exhibition catalogs that include essays, manifestos, and bibliographic profiles.&lt;ref name=LATimes-NomadicPhaseEnding-2009&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kraul|first1=Chris|title=Cisneros art trove ends its nomadic phase|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/01/cisneros-art-tr.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPPC works with scholars and academics to learn more about the artists and their works, and has established a prolific publications program to provide supporting information about the artists and their work, in addition to building an online forum for the artwork.&lt;ref name=ColeccionCisneros-Ch1-Video-2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 1: Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, A Passion for Latin America|url=http://www.coleccioncisneros.org/content/chapter-1-patricia-phelps-de-cisneros-passion-latin-america|website=Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros|format=Video|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The publication program of Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros that is represented here is unique in its international and pan-regional scope. Works are typically published in multiple languages, often within the same publication. The publications are oftentimes the first time the collection and curation of information about certain artists and regional and national art movements are published. Contributors are established art historians, curators, and often the artists who are working within or are part of the art movements themselves. Art movement manifestos are published in their entirety, often with full translations, in accessible and/or digital format, sometimes for the first time.&lt;ref name=FinancialTimes-RadicalGeometry-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Gareth|title=Patricia Phelps de Cisneros: an art patron on a mission|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e06f9776-719a-11e4-b178-00144feabdc0|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-MoMADonation-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogrebin|first1=Robin|title=102 Latin American Artworks, and a New Institute, Will Go to MoMA|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/arts/design/102-latin-american-artworks-and-a-new-institute-will-go-to-moma.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucretia Breazeale Hamilton''' (1908-1986) was an American [[botanical illustrator]], who was considered an expert on southwestern United States [[flora]]. She illustrated numerous technical papers for the University of Arizona and 16 books. She was posthumously recognized with a [[Chilopsis|Desert Willow]] [[cultivar]] named in her honor and induction into the [[Arizona Women's Hall of Fame]].

==Biography==
Lucretia Breazeale was born on March 27, 1908, in East Falls Church, [[Arlington County, Virginia]]. Her father accepted a posting at the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) Experiment Station on the [[Pima people|Pima]]'s [[Gila River Indian Community|Gila River Reservation]] near [[Sacaton, Arizona]] in 1920 and the family moved to Arizona. Two years later, they relocated again to [[Tucson]], where Breazeale completed her schooling,&lt;ref name="Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucretia Breazeale Hamilton|url=https://www.azwhf.org/inductions/inducted-women/lucretia-breazeale-hamilton-1908-1986/|publisher=Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|accessdate=23 December 2015|location=Phoenix, Arizona|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating from [[Tucson High School]] in 1928. She furthered her schooling minoring in art and majoring in botany at the [[University of Arizona]], earning her BS in 1932.&lt;ref name=Mitich&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitich|first1=Larry W.|title=Lucretia Breazeale Hamilton botanical illustrator extraordinaire|journal=Cactus and Succulent Journal|date=2006|volume=78|issue=1|pages=22–25|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2985/0007-9367%282006%2978%5B22%3ALBHBIE%5D2.0.CO%3B2?journalCode=casu|accessdate=23 December 2015|publisher=The Cactus and Succulent Society of America|location=Claremont, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at university, she met Louis Pennock Hamilton, whom she married in 1935.&lt;ref name="husband's obit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Horace|title={{sic|In Memo|rium|hide=y|expected=In Memoriam}}|journal=The Plant Press|date=Fall 1990|volume=14|issue=2|page=12|url=http://www.aznps.com/documents/14_2.Jul90.pdf|accessdate=23 December 2015|publisher=The Arizona Native Plant Society|location=Tucson, Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a horticulturist and employed by the Soil Conservation Service, which sent them soon after their marriage to [[Shiprock, New Mexico]].

Hamilton, who had trained as a botanist, became an illustrator, because she was asked to provide drawings for some of her college professor's scientific articles, due to her detailed renderings.&lt;ref name="Tucson Cactus and Succulent Society"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucretia Breazeale Hamilton (1908-1986)|url=http://art-botanical.org/BioHamilton.html|website=The Sonoran Desert Florilegium Program|publisher=Tucson Cactus and Succulent Society|accessdate=23 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429082611/http://art-botanical.org/BioHamilton.html|archivedate=29 April 2015|location=Tucson, Arizona|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mangaung African Cultural Festival''' ('''MACUFE''') is an annual showcase of African arts, culture and various sports disciplines that takes place in [[Bloemfontein]], [[South Africa]]. It is one of the largest emerging festivals in Africa; it grew from having an audience of 30 000 in 1997 to 140 000 in 2015.&lt;ref name="drum.co.za"&gt;http://www.drum.co.za/entertainment/15-years-of-macufe-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival runs for 10 days beginning on the first week of October each year in the [[Free State]] province of South Africa.

MACUFE consists of a main musical festival, an arts and crafts exhibition, theatre productions, a beauty pageant, the Sparta Macufe Cup which is a soccer league at the Free State stadium and performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sa-venues.com/events/freestate/macufe-festival/|title=Macufe Festival|author=|date=|website=www.sa-venues.com|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also hosts an official corporate village where there are brand specific lounges, each with their own client service personnel.

==History==
Even though the unfolding of an arts festival platform after 1994 in the New South Africa was a key development in SA professional theatre, numerous festivals did relatively little to explore and celebrate black South African culture, theatre or productions. Every festival had a small number of black artists taking part in productions, and audiences included a few black theatre-goers, but the participation of the white and Western-oriented producers, as well as audiences, outweighed the contribution from black African and historically put artists and festival-goers at a disadvantage. Apart from some exceptional cases, [[English language|English]] and [[Afrikaans]] were used almost exclusively on the festival stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esat.sun.ac.za/index.php/Mangaung_African_Cultural_Festival#Origins|title=Mangaung African Cultural Festival - ESAT|author=|date=|website=esat.sun.ac.za|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival was launched in 1997 by the Free State Provincial Government to celebrate the best local and international African artists in various disciplines.&lt;ref name="drum.co.za"/&gt; At the announcement of the festival in 1997 the general manager of SABC2, Thaninga Msimango, declared that “the concept was initiated because there was no cultural festival that expressed the rich culture of indigenous South Africans.” The Free State MEC for sports, arts and culture, M.W. Molefe, added that “most popular and successful festivals in South Africa are focused on Eurocentric culture, paying scant regard to indigenous African culture". Officially dubbed an “African cultural festival”, rather than an “arts festival”, the intention was clear: to stage an event that would recognise and celebrate indigenous African cultural heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sleeping-out.co.za/events/macufe-festival-bloemfontein|title=The Macufe Festival 2016|author=|date=|website=Sleeping-OUT|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically as a balance to the other arts festivals which were perceived to do little in that regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esat.sun.ac.za/index.php/Mangaung_African_Cultural_Festival#Aims|title=Mangaung African Cultural Festival - ESAT|author=|date=|website=esat.sun.ac.za|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of present-day [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Germany]], up to 5,000 [[megalith]] tombs were erected as [[burial sites]] by people of the [[Neolithic]] [[Funnelbeaker culture|Funnelbeaker (TRB) culture]]. More than 1,000 of them are preserved today and protected by law. Though varying in style and age, megalith structures are common in [[Western Europe]], with those in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern belonging to the youngest and easternmost&amp;mdash;further east, in the modern [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship]] of [[Poland]], monuments erected by the TRB people did not include [[Lithic technology|lithic structures]], while they do in the south ([[Brandenburg]]), west ([[Lower Saxony]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]) and north ([[Denmark]]).

Though megaliths are distributed throughout the state, their structure differs between regions. Most megaliths are [[dolmens]], often located within a circular or trapezoid frame of singular standing stones. Locally, the dolmens are known as ''Hünengräber'' ("giants' tombs") or ''Großsteingräber'' ("large stone tombs"), their framework is known as ''Hünenbett'' ("giants' bed") if trapezoid or ''Bannkreis'' ("spellbind circle") if circular. 

The materials used for their construction are [[glacial erratic]]s and red [[sandstone]]s. 144 tombs have been excavated since 1945. The megaliths were used not only by the bearers of the TRB culture, but also by their successors, and have entered local folklore.

The [[megalith]]s in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] were erected as burial sites in the [[Neolithic]], by the bearers of the [[Funnelbeaker culture|Funnelbeaker (TRB) culture]],&lt;ref name=holtorf11&gt;Holtorf (2000-2008), [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/1.1.html 1.1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kehnscherper127&gt;Kehnscherper (1983), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; between 3,500 and 3,200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Schirren (2009), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the TRB people buried their dead in pits, often covered with mounds of clay.&lt;ref name=kehnscherper127/&gt; Later, they erected [[dolmen]]s for this purpose,&lt;ref name=kehnscherper127/&gt; but also continued the use of flat graves.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt; All megaliths were erected during a relatively short time period, spanning about 200 years or about seven generations, with the oldest ones dating to phase C of the Early Neolithic, while most were built in the beginning of the Middle Neolithic.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt;

The dolmens were built from [[glacial erratic]]s, with the gaps filled with red [[sandstone]].&lt;ref name=LAKD&gt;[http://www.kulturwerte-mv.de/cms2/LAKD_prod/LAKD/content/de/Archaeologie_und_Denkmalpflege/Archaeologie_entdecken/_aus_der_Luft%2c_in_der_Landschaft_und_unter_Wasser/Bodendenkmale_praegende_Bestandteile_unserer_Kulturlandschaft/Grosssteingraeber_Meisterwerke_steinzeitlicher_Architektur/index.jsp LAKD MV: Großsteingräber.]&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, standing stones were transported to the site using rollers, slides, levers and ropes, and the interior of the unfinished dolmens was filled with clay to form a ramp to enable the movement of the cover stones into their final position.&lt;ref name=LAKD/&gt; After removing the clay from the interior, a barrow ([[tumulus]]) was then raised on top of the dolmen, which remained accessible through a passage made from smaller stones.&lt;ref name=LAKD/&gt; In addition, single standing stones were sometimes placed around the dolmen, forming either a rectangular or trapezoidal shape (''Hünenbett''),&lt;ref name=LAKD/&gt; or a [[stone circle]] (''Bannkreis'').&lt;ref name=kehnscherper130&gt;Kehnscherper (1983), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, large singular "guardian stones" (''Wächterstein, Bautastein'') were placed adjacent to these shapes.&lt;ref name=kehnscherper130/&gt; The interior of the dolmen was usually divided into small compartments by slabs of red sandstone, standing upright.&lt;ref name=LAKD/&gt;

==Numbers and types==
{{main|Types of megalithic monuments in northeastern Germany}}
The various types of megalithic monuments in northeastern Germany were last compiled by [[Ewald Schuldt]] in the course of a project to excavate megalithic tombs from the [[Neolithic Era]], which was conducted between 1964 and 1972 in the area of the [[Administrative divisions of East Germany|northern districts]] of [[East Germany]]. His aim was to provide a ''"classification and naming of the objects present in this field of research"''.&lt;ref&gt;Schuldt 1972, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so it utilised a classification by [[Ernst Sprockhoff]], which in turn was based on an older Danish model.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Sprockhoff]]: ''Die nordische Megalithkultur, 1938, cited in Schuldt 1972, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Megawal18.jpg|thumb|Dolmen and passage grave (with quarters)]]

=== Naming scheme ===
Schuldt listed six types:

#the [[simple dolmen]] (''Urdolmen'')
#the [[rectangular dolmen|extended dolmen]] (''erweiterte Dolmen'')
#the [[great dolmen]] (''Großdolmen'')
#the [[passage grave]] (''Ganggrab'')
#the [[long barrow]] without a [[burial chamber|chamber]] (''Hünenbett ohne Kammer'')
#the [[stone cist]] (''Steinkiste'')

=== Sites ===
Schuldt (1972) described 1048 megalithic sites in the area of present-day Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt; Holtorf (2000/08) counted 1,193 in the same area.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt; Both Schuldt's and Holtorf's counts include 31 long mounds without chambers and 44 stone cists, which lack the large stones typical of the rest of the megalithic sites.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt; Holtorf estimated that in the Neolithic, up to 5,000 megalithic monuments were built in present-day Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt; 144 megaliths have been excavated since 1945.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt; 106 of these were excavated and afterwards restored by archaeologist [[Ewald Schuldt]] and his team between 1964 and 1972.&lt;ref name=holtorf131&gt;Holtorf (2000-2008), [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/1.3.1.html 1.3.1.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though megalithic sites can be found in nearly all areas of Mecklenburg-Vorpomern, Schuldt (1972) defined nine high-density areas: near [[Grevesmühlen]] (''Forst Everstorf''), near [[Rerik]], along the middle and upper [[Warnow]] river, around the lakes of [[Krakower See]] and [[Plauer See (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern)|Plauer See]], along the [[Recknitz]] river, along the [[Schwinge (Peene)|Schwinge]] stream, and the southeastern part of the island of [[Rügen]].&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt; 

The type of megalithic structures varies between different, overlapping regions.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt; Schuldt classified those regions as follows: He found [[long mound]]s without chambers in the southwestern part of [[Mecklenburg]], [[passage grave]]s in the northern and central part of Mecklenburg, [[extended dolmen]]s in southern Mecklenburg, [[great dolmen]]s with 'draught excluders' (''Windfang'') in northern [[Vorpommern]], great dolmens with ante-chambers (''Vorraum'') in central Vorpommern, and [[stone cist]]s in southern Vorpommern and eastern Mecklenburg.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kehnscherper (1983), pp. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt;

While the orientation of the megaliths varies, many have entrances facing southwards.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt; Of 99 dolmens studied by Schuldt, 46 are oriented toward the midsummer apex of the sun (south to north), 26 toward the spring equinox (east to west), 14 toward the midsummer sunrise (northeast to southwest), and 13 toward the midwinter sunrise (southeast to northwest).&lt;ref&gt;Kehnscherper (1983), pp. 167-168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary and secondary uses==

Disarticulated bones from up to twenty individuals have been discovered in excavated dolmens.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt; Presumably, the dead were first laid down in the open, and their bones were buried in the dolmens once the body was [[Skeletonization|skeletonized]].&lt;ref name=LAKD/&gt; Few dolmens contain only TRB finds, as most were also used by the contemporary and subsequent [[Globular Amphora culture|Globular Amphora]] and [[Single Grave culture|Single Grave]] cultures,&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt; and some remained in use until the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAKD/&gt; The bearers of the Globular Amphora culture removed and demolished skeletons and items from previous burials before reusing the tombs for their own dead.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt; When the tombs ceased to function as burial sites for the TRB and Globular Amphora cultures, they were filled with earth, with the exception of some tombs on [[Rügen]] where items from Bronze Age burials were found on the ground of the Neolithic chamber, or within the fill.&lt;ref name=holtorf511&gt;Holtorf (2000-2008), [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/5.1.1.html 5.1.1.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Often, the earth-filled megaliths and the mounds raised to cover them were used for secondary burials.&lt;ref name=holtorf511/&gt; The bearers of the Neolithic Single Grave culture buried their dead in the earth-filled chamber by removing cover or wall stones.&lt;ref name=holtorf11/&gt;&lt;ref name=holtorf511/&gt; Of documented later secondary burials, 27% are from the late Bronze Age, 29% from the [[pre-Roman Iron Age]], 10% from the [[Roman Iron Age]] and 27% from the [[Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages|Slavic period]].&lt;ref name=holtorf511/&gt; Another 7% are of uncertain origin, and no secondary burials from the [[Ostsiedlung|early German period]] are recorded.&lt;ref name=holtorf511/&gt; According to Holtorf, the barrows erected for burials in the Bronze Age, Iron Age and Slavic period were imitations of the mounds elevated above filled megalith tombs.&lt;ref name=holtorf516&gt;Holtorf (2000-2008), [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/5.1.6.html 5.1.6.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Neolithic mounds containing secondary burials are found next to similar burial mounds from the respective later period.&lt;ref name=holtorf516/&gt;

In addition to secondary burials, other items were found in 41 of the 144 excavated megalith mounds.&lt;ref name=holtorf512&gt;Holtorf (2000-2008), [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/5.1.2.html 5.1.2.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, items from later periods were found outside of 75 of those megaliths, within a radius of no more than {{convert|500|m|yd}}.&lt;ref name=holtorf513&gt;Holtorf (2000-2008), [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/5.1.3.html 5.1.3.]&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of all documented finds to their respective periods of origin is shown in the table below.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Some megaliths have cup-marks (''Näpfchen'') on them, which Holtorf describes as "simple, roughly hemispherical depressions of about 2–10 cm diameter and up to 3 cm depth."&lt;ref name=holtorf517&gt;Holtorf (2000-2008), [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/5.1.7.html 5.1.7.]&lt;/ref&gt; The origin and purpose of the cup-marks is uncertain.&lt;ref name=holtorf517/&gt; Their distribution corresponds with the distribution of the dolmens, and they are found on undisturbed dolmens as well as stones derived from destroyed megalith sites.&lt;ref name=holtorf517/&gt;

==Preservation==
{{multiple image|direction=vertical|width=250|image1=Ganggrab 8 bei Liepen 21-08-2008 105.jpg|caption1=[[Passage grave]] with ''Hünenbett'' near [[Thelkow|Liepen]]|image2=Steinkiste bei Gielow 2.JPG|caption2=[[Stone cist]] near [[Gielow]]}}

Many megaliths were used as quarries in the past, e.g. for the construction of 13th- and 14th-century churches, medieval and early modern stone walls, 18th-century manor houses, as well as for 19th-century dikes, roads, bridges and milestones.&lt;ref name=holtorf525&gt;Holtorf (2000-2008), [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/5.2.5.html 5.2.5.]&lt;/ref&gt; Others were destroyed in the course of clearing farmland, which occurred from the 18th through 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=holtorf526&gt;Holtorf (2000-2008), [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/5.2.6.html 5.2.6.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 13 April 1804, [[Frederick Francis I, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg]] issued a decree protecting "heathen grave sites" and called on his officials to compile lists of the megaliths in their districts.&lt;ref name=holtorf132&gt;Holtorf (2000-2008), [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/1.3.2.html 1.3.2.]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the earliest such decree in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=holtorf132/&gt; In the following centuries, this decree was renewed and amended by Friedrich Franz's successors.&lt;ref name=holtorf132/&gt; In [[Vorpommern]], despite the authorities not issuing similar decrees, the [[University of Greifswald]] did decree preservation of megaliths on its property.&lt;ref name=holtorf132/&gt; In 1946, all megalithic sites became the property of the [[East Germany|East German]] state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]].&lt;ref name=holtorf132/&gt; In 1954, the East German regime passed a preservation law which also applied to megaliths.&lt;ref name=holtorf132/&gt; 

On 30 November 1993, the currently binding preservation law was enacted by the re-constituted state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] (''Gesetz zum Schutz und zur Pflege der Denkmale im Lande Mecklenburg–Vorpommern'', "Law for the Protection and the Care of Monuments in the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern").&lt;ref name=holtorf132/&gt;

==Lore==

Megaliths in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are the subject of an abundance of lore, dealing primarily with giants, fairies, dwarfs, subterraneans and hidden treasures.&lt;ref name=holtorf527&gt;Holtorf (2000-2008), [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/5.2.7.html 5.2.7.]&lt;/ref&gt; The giant tales relate primarily to the megaliths' creation, which was assumed to be the result of stones lost or thrown by giants, or of giants building houses, ovens or tombs.&lt;ref name=holtorf527/&gt; Thus, the population refers to dolmens as ''Hünengräber'' ("giants' tombs", Sg. ''Hünengrab'').&lt;ref name=holtorf527/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmidt10&gt;Schmidt (2001), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Another frequent theme of megalith-related folklore is that of hidden treasures, guarded by fairies, dwarfs or subterraneans.&lt;ref name=holtorf527/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmidt10/&gt; In these tales, humans who try to retrieve the treasure are usually hindered or punished by the magic beings.&lt;ref name=holtorf527/&gt; The treasure tales have contributed both to long-time preservation of megaliths and to tomb raiding, depending on the degree of superstition of the audience.&lt;ref name=holtorf527/&gt;

The '''Ministry for Culture and Heritage''' ('''MCH''') ([[Māori language|Māori]]: ''Manatū Taonga'') is the public service department of New Zealand charged with advising the [[Government of New Zealand|government]] on policies and issues involving the [[Creative New Zealand|arts]], [[Culture of New Zealand|culture]], [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust|heritage]], [[Sport New Zealand|sport and recreation]], and [[Public broadcasting in New Zealand|broadcasting]] sectors, and participating in functions that advance or promote those sectors.

==History==
The Ministry was founded in 1999 with the merger of the former Ministry of Cultural Affairs and the history and heritage functions of the [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]], as well as some functions from the [[Department of Conservation]] and [[Ministry of Commerce (New Zealand)|Ministry of Commerce]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/about-ministry/overview/history-government-involvement-culture|title=History of Government involvement in culture|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;{{cite press release|author=Marie Hasler|date=28 July 1999|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/cultural-and-heritage-sector-some-relevant-questions-and-answers|title=Cultural and Heritage sector – some relevant questions and answers|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the merger of functions and departments was to create a coherent, non-fragmented overview of the cultural and heritage sector, rather than spreading services and functions across several departments.&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt;

Minister for Cultural Affairs [[Marie Hasler]] oversaw the transition of functions into the new agency.&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt; Opposition Labour MP [[Judith Tizard]], who would later serve as an Associate Minister for the ministry in the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand]], accused the restructure of being "all hype, no substance," lacking the funding and human resource necessary to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author=Judith Tizard|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA9907/S00546/all-hype-no-substance.htm|title=All hype, no substance|date=28 July 1999|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Cultural Affairs had been created in 1991; prior to this, the Department of Internal Affairs had provided oversight and support for arts and culture functions.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

At the time of its establishment, the responsible minister for the ministry was the Minister for Culture and Heritage. This position is now titled the [[Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage]].

== Functions ==
The ministry advises the government on policies and issues relating to the arts, culture, heritage, sport and recreation, and broadcasting sectors. It funds 17 other agencies which also support these sectors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/funding-nz-culture/agencies-we-fund|title=Agencies we fund|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; looks after monuments and war graves throughout New Zealand and is involved in a number of projects promoting and documenting New Zealand history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/what-we-do/our-projects|title=Our projects|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TVNZ Archive collection contains over 600,000 hours of television spanning almost 55 years of New Zealand's public television history.&lt;ref name="craig-foss-transfer-speech"&gt;{{cite speech|title=Draft speech|first=Craig|last=Foss|event=Function to mark the transfer of responsibility for the TVNZ Archives to the New Zealand Film Archive|location=Wellington, New Zealand|date=July 31, 2014|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/6578/response/22258/attach/4/Joss%20J%20OIA%20documents%20for%20release.pdf|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes iconic New Zealand content such as documentaries, dramas, sports programmes&lt;ref name="mch-briefing-2014-36"&gt;{{cite report|author=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=February 14, 2013|title=TVNZ Archive - Update on IP issues (briefing 2014/36)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/6578/response/22258/attach/4/Joss%20J%20OIA%20documents%20for%20release.pdf|page=11|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and every TVNZ news broadcast from December 1986 to 2014.&lt;ref name="ntsv-tvnz-collection-video"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video: Preserving the TVNZ Collection|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/preservation/our-preservation-work/video-preserving-the-tvnz-collection|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oia-5402-fyi-release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Information Act request (5402)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/5402-avalon-archive-facility-follow-up-information-requested|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 briefing to Minister [[Craig Foss]], the ministry noted that the long-term preservation of the TVNZ Archive collection did not align with the broadcaster's business needs and that transferring the collection to the crown would allow for the proper preservation of the collection.&lt;ref name="mch-briefing-2014-017"&gt;{{cite report|author=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=March 21, 2014|title=TVNZ Archive transfer - update (briefing 2014/107)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/6578/response/22258/attach/4/Joss%20J%20OIA%20documents%20for%20release.pdf|page=16|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the ministry and TVNZ explicitly wanted to ensure the archive was preserved and that it was made increasingly available for re-use through online streaming and other means.&lt;ref name="mou-access-to-tvnz-archive-collection"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/4927/response/17172/attach/4/MOU%20Access%20to%20TVNZ%20Archive%20Collection%20new%20scan.pdf|title=Memorandum of Understanding - Access to TVNZ Archive Collection, between the Ministry for Culture and Heritage and the Department of Internal Affairs|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and heritage===
The ministry supports research into and promotion of [[New Zealand history]]. This includes publication of New Zealand history books and e-books, and a number of websites. The ministry's managed sites include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/what-we-do/websites-we-run|title=Websites we run|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''New Zealand History Online'''
* [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]
* [[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]]
* '''[https://ngatapuwae.govt.nz/ Ngā Tapuwae trails]'''
* '''WW100'''
* '''Landmarks Whenua Tohunga'''
David Green, a historian working for the ministry, discovered that significantly more New Zealand personnel were engaged in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] than had been recorded in [[Fred Waite (politician)|Fred Waite]]'s official history, ''The New Zealanders at Gallipoli''. Waite's number of some 8,500 men was corrected to approximately 13,000 in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New research: How many New Zealanders served on Gallipoli? |url= http://www.gallipoli2015.govt.nz/new-research-how-many-new-zealanders-served-on-gallipoli |publisher=[[New Zealand Defence Force]] |date=3 September 2013|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landmarks Whenua Tohunga is a partnership between the Ministry, the [[Department of Conservation Te Papa Atawhai]], [[Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga]] and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. The programme promotes and encourages people to visit New Zealand’s historically and culturally important places.  Landmarks has been launched so far in Northland and Otago.

[[File:Plot v. story en.png|right|thumb|300px|Plot and Story.  Plot is the cause‐and‐effect sequence of events in a story.&lt;ref name="dibell" /&gt;]]

'''Plot''' refers to the sequence of events inside a [[narrative|story]] which affect other events through the principle of [[Causality|cause and effect]]. The causal events of a plot can be thought of as a series of sentences linked by "and so". Plots can vary from simple structures such as in a traditional [[ballad]] to complex interwoven structures sometimes referred to as an ''imbroglio''. The term ''plot'' can serve as a verb and refer to a character planning future actions in the story.

In the narrative sense, the term highlights the important points which have important consequences within the story, according to Ansen Dibell.&lt;ref name="dibell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ansen Dibell, Ph.D.|title=Plot|date=1999-07-15|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|series=Elements of Fiction Writing|pages=5 f.|isbn=978-0-89879-946-0|quote=Plot is built of significant events in a given story – significant because they have important consequences. Taking a shower isn't necessarily plot... Let's call them incidents ... Plot is the things characters do, feel, think or say, that make a difference to what comes afterward.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is similar in meaning to the term ''storyline''.&lt;ref&gt;''Random House Dictionary.'' "[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plot?s=t plot]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionaries.'' "[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/storyline?q=storyline storyline]."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
English novelist [[E. M. Forster]] described plot as the cause-and-effect relationship between events in a story. According to Forster, "''The king died, and then the queen died,'' is a story, while ''The king died, and then the queen died of grief,'' is a plot."&lt;ref name="prince"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prince|first=Gerald|title=A Dictionary of Narratology|publisher=University of Nebraska Press.|edition=Revised|date=2003-12-01|page=73|isbn=978-0-8032-8776-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wales|first=Katie|title=A Dictionary of Stylistics|series=Longman Linguistics|publisher=Routledge|edition=3|date=2011-05-19|page=320|isbn=978-1-4082-3115-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E.M. Aspects of the Novel. Mariner Books. (1956) {{ISBN|978-0156091800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider the following:

::#The prince searches for Cinderella with the glass shoe
::#Cinderella's sisters tried the shoe on but it does not fit
::#The shoe fits Cinderella's foot so the prince finds her

The first event is causally related to the third event, while the second event, though descriptive, does not directly impact the outcome. As a result, according to Dibell, the plot can be described numerically as 1→3 while the story can be described as 1→2→3. A story orders events from beginning to end in a time sequence.&lt;ref name="dibell" /&gt; Teri Shaffer Yamada agrees that a plot does not include memorable [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] within a story which do not relate directly to other events but only "major events that move the action in a narrative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Teri Shaffer Yamada, Ph.D.|title=ELEMENTS OF FICTION|publisher=[[California State University, Long Beach]]|url=http://www.csulb.edu/~yamadaty/EleFic.html|accessdate=2014-12-20|archivedate=2014-12-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220115428/http://www.csulb.edu/~yamadaty/EleFic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', when Rose climbs on the railing at the front of the ship and spreads her hands as if she's flying, this scene is memorable but does not directly influence other events, so it may not be considered as part of the plot. Another example of a memorable scene which is not part of the plot occurs in the 1980 film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', when Han Solo is frozen in carbonite.&lt;ref name="dibell" /&gt; Steve Alcorn, a fiction-writing coach, said the main plot elements of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' could be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name="alcorn"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Alcorn|title=Know the Difference Between Plot and Story|publisher=Tejix|url=http://www.tejix.com/en/PaperPlot.html|accessdate=2014-08-24|archivedate= 2014-08-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823193203/http://www.tejix.com/en/PaperPlot.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fabula and syuzhet ===
{{Main|Fabula and syuzhet}}
The literary theory of Russian Formalism in the early 20th century divided a narrative into two elements: the ''fabula'' (фа́була) and the ''syuzhet'' (сюже́т). A fabula is the events in the fictional world, whereas a syuzhet is a perspective of those events. Formalist followers eventually translated the fabula/syuzhet to the concept of story/plot. This definition is usually used in narratology, in parallel with Forster's definition. The ''fabula'' (story) is what happened in chronological order. In contrast, the ''syuzhet'' (plot) means a unique sequence of discourse that was sorted out by the (implied) author. That is, the syuzhet can consist of picking up the fabula events in non-chronological order; for example, fabula is &lt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, …, a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, syuzhet is &lt;a&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;.

== Structure ==
{{See also|Dramatic structure|Three-act structure}}
Today screenwriters generally combine plot with plot structure into what is called a [[Film treatment|treatment]], sometimes referred to as the three-act structure, in which a film is divided into three acts: the ''set-up'', the ''confrontation'' and the ''resolution''. Acts are connected by two [[plot point]]s or turning points, with the first turning point connecting Act I to Act II, and the second connecting Act II to Act III. The conception of the three-act structure has been attributed to American screenwriter [[Syd Field]] who described plot structure in this tripartite way for film analysis.

==Aristotle==
The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]], writing in the fourth century BC in his classic book ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|The Poetics]]'', considered plot or ''mythos'' as the most important element of drama, even more important than character.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mack et al.|1985|pp=843–844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle wrote that a [[tragedy]], a type of plot, could be divided into three parts: a beginning, a middle, and an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mack et al.|1985|p=844}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that the events of the plot must causally relate to one another as being either necessary or probable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mack et al.|1985|pp=846–847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the utmost importance is the plot's ability to arouse emotion in the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] of the audience, he thought. In [[tragedy]], the appropriate emotions are [[fear]] and [[pity]], emotions which he considers in his [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]. (Aristotle's work on comedy has not survived.)

Aristotle goes on to consider whether the tragic character [[pathos|suffers (pathos)]], and whether the tragic character commits the error with knowledge of what he is doing. He illustrates this with the question of a tragic character who is about to kill someone in his family.

::The worst situation [artistically] is when the personage is with full knowledge on the point of doing the deed, and leaves it undone. It is odious and also (through the absence of suffering) untragic; hence it is that no one is made to act thus except in some few instances, e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Haemon]] and [[Creon]] in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''. Next after this comes the actual perpetration of the deed meditated. A better situation than that, however, is for the deed to be done in ignorance, and the relationship discovered afterwards, since there is nothing odious in it, and the discovery will serve to astound us. But the best of all is the last; what we have in [[Cresphontes]], for example, where [[Merope (wife of Cresphontes)|Merope]], on the point of slaying her son, recognizes him in time; in [[Iphigenia]], where sister and brother are in a like position; and in [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], where the son recognizes his mother, when on the point of giving her up to her enemy.([http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-15.html Poetics book 14])

== Freytag ==
[[File:Freytags pyramid.svg|right|thumbnail|265px|Freytag's pyramid]]
{{Main|Dramatic structure}}
In 1863, Gustav Freytag, a German writer, advocated a model based upon Aristotle's theory of tragedy. This is now called "Freytag's pyramid," which divides a drama into five parts, and
provides function to each part.  These parts are: exposition (originally called introduction), rising action (rise), climax, falling action (return or fall), and denouement (catastrophe).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exposition ===
The first phase in Freytag's pyramid is the exposition, which introduces the characters, especially the main character, also known as the protagonist. It shows how the characters relate to one another, their goals and motivations, as well as their moral character. During the exposition, the protagonist learns their main goal and what is at stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=115-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rising action ===
Rising action is the second phase in Freytag's five-phase structure. It starts with a conflict, for example, the death of a character. The inciting incident is the point of the plot that begins the conflict. It is the event that catalyzes the protagonist to go into motion and to take action. Rising action involves the buildup of events until the climax.

In this phase, the protagonist understands his or her goal and begins to work toward it. Smaller problems thwart their initial success and their progress is directed primarily against these secondary obstacles. This phase demonstrates how the protagonist overcomes these obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=125-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climax ===
The climax is the turning point or highest point of the story. The protagonist makes the single big decision that defines not only the outcome of the story, but also who they are as a person. Freytag defines the climax as the third of the five dramatic phases which occupies the middle of the story.

At the beginning of this phase, the protagonist finally clears away the preliminary barriers and engages with the adversary. Usually, both the protagonist and the antagonist have a plan to win against the other as they enter this phase. For the first time, the audience sees the pair going against one another in direct or nearly direct conflict.

This struggle usually results in neither character completely winning or losing. In most cases, each character's plan is both partially successful and partially foiled by their adversary. The central struggle between the two characters is unique in that the protagonist makes a decision which shows their moral quality, and ultimately decides their fate. In a tragedy, the protagonist here makes a poor decision or a miscalculation that demonstrates their tragic flaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=128-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Falling action ===
According to Freytag, the falling action phase consists of events that lead to the ending. Character's actions resolve the problem. In the beginning of this phase, the antagonist often has the upper hand. The protagonist has never been further from accomplishing their goal. The outcome depends on which side the protagonist has put themselves on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=133-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denouement===
In this phase the protagonist and antagonist have solved their problems and either the protagonist or antagonist wins the conflict. The conflict officially ends. Some stories show what happens to the characters after the conflict ends and/or they show what happens to the characters in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=137-140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot devices ==

{{Main|Plot device}}

A plot device is a means of advancing the plot in a story. It is often used to motivate characters, create urgency, or resolve a difficulty. This can be contrasted with moving a story forward with dramatic technique; that is, by making things happen because characters take action for well-developed reasons. An example of a plot device would be when the cavalry shows up at the last moment and saves the day in a battle. In contrast, an adversarial character who has been struggling with himself and saves the day due to a change of heart would be considered dramatic technique.

Familiar types of plot devices include the ''[[deus ex machina]]'', the [[MacGuffin]], the [[red herring]], and [[Chekhov's gun]].

== Plot outline ==
A plot outline is a prose telling of a story which can be turned into a screenplay. Sometimes it is called a "one page" because of its length. It is generally longer and more detailed than a standard synopsis, which is usually only one or two paragraphs, but shorter and less detailed than a treatment or a step outline. In comics, the roughs refer to a stage in the development where the story has been broken down very loosely in a style similar to storyboarding in film development. This stage is also referred to as storyboarding or layouts. In Japanese manga, this stage is called the ''nemu'' (pronounced like the English word "name"). The roughs are quick sketches arranged within a suggested page layout. The main goals of roughs are:

* to lay out the flow of panels across a page
* to ensure the story successfully builds suspense
* to work out points of view, camera angles, and character positions within panels
* to serve as a basis for the next stage of development, the "pencil" stage, which are detailed drawings in a more polished layout which will, in turn, serve as the basis for the inked drawings.

In fiction writing, a plot outline is a laundry list of scenes with each line being a separate plot point, and the outline helps give a story a "solid backbone and structure".

==A-Plot==
An ''A-Plot'' is a [[film|cinema]] and [[television]] term referring to the plotline that drives the story. This does not necessarily mean it is the most important, but rather the one that forces most of the action.

==Plot summary==
A plot summary is a brief description of a piece of literature that explains what happens. In a plot summary, the author and title of the book should be referred to. Also, it is no more than a paragraph long while summarizing the main points of the story. {{needs citation|date=December 2017}}

In [[television]] and [[film]], a '''plot point''' is a significant event within a plot that spins the action around in another direction. 

Noted screenwriting teacher [[Syd Field]] discusses plot points in his [[paradigm]], popularized in his book ''[[Screenplay (book)|Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting]].''  There he proposes that a well-structured movie has two plot points within a three-act structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yardley|first1=William|title=Syd Field, Author of the Definitive Work On Writing Screenplays, Is Dead at 77|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/arts/syd-field-author-of-the-definitive-work-on-writing-screenplays-is-dead-at-77.html|accessdate=January 13, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first plot point occurs 20 to 30 minutes into the film (assuming a standard 120-minute running time), and the second one occurs 80 to 90 minutes into the film. The first plot point ends Act I and propels the story into Act II; likewise, the second plot point ends Act II and propels the story into Act III.

'''''Saint Candidus'''''  is a painting by [[Ayne Bru]] conserved at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The knight, standing, is dressed in dark armour with a shield, halberd and sword, a fur-lined green tabard, a purple stole and a red cap with a medal featuring the bust of Christ. This is [[Saint Candidus]], a warrior in the [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] legion who was martyred along with Saint Maurice. Like the panel of the ''[[Martyrdom of Saint Cucuphas]]'', this painting was part of the old high altarpiece in the [[monastery of Sant Cugat del Vallès]]. [[Ayne Bru]], one of the most important names from the Catalan [[Cinquecento]], was a painter of Central-European origin and training whose work speaks for the influence of Flemish culture and of the art produced in [[Venice]] in the period straddling the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=47ebcd8e6d370c6926ffc938f57f3dd871295ffedac166160908977bcfde952b?inventoryNumber=064049-000  The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monet, Claude - The Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''San Giorgio Maggiore'' in the collection of [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], The Lockton Collection, 70.76, discovernewfields.org]]
[[Claude Monet]] painted a series of paintings of the island-monastery of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]] in [[Venice]]. They were begun in 1908 during the artist's only visit to the city. One of the best known is ''[[San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk]]'', which exists in two versions.

Monet completed his paintings of Venice at home in France,&lt;ref name="IMA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://collection.imamuseum.org/artwork/56280/ |title=The Church of San Giorgio Maggiore |access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1912 showed them in Paris. Buyers included the Welsh collector [[Gwendoline Davies]], who bought three paintings.

A painting by Monet, described as being of San Giorgio Maggiore, was seized in July 2016 by Swiss officials on behalf of U.S. authorities. The owner, [[Jho Low]], [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|embezzled funds]] from [[1Malaysia Development BHD.]], a government investment fund.  He had purchased the painting for $35 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-the-1mdb-net-an-art-world-whale-1469091601|title=In the 1MDB Net, an Art-World Whale|last=Crow|first=Kelly|date=2016-07-21|last2=Letzing|first2=John|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[National Gallery]] in London held an exhibition "Monet and Architecture" which reunited nine of the Venice paintings.&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/08/monet-and-architecture-review-exhibition-national-gallery |title=Monet and Architecture review |last=Cumming |first=Laura |work=The Observer |access-date=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included three paintings of San Giorgio Maggiore apparently painted from Monet's hotel on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]]. They came from galleries in [[Cardiff]] ([[National Museum Cardiff]]) and [[Indianapolis]] ([[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]) and one from a private collection.

Monet also used San Giorgio Maggiore as a view-point for [[The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore (Claude Monet)|''The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore'']].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2854">The '''Symphony No. 3''' of [[Douglas Lilburn]] was completed in 1961, in response to a [[sabbatical]] from [[Victoria University of Wellington]].  It was given its [[premiere]] the following year, and published by [[Faber Music]] (and co-published by [[G. Schirmer Inc.|Schirmer]]) around 1968.&lt;ref&gt;It was reprinted in 1976 by Price Milburn of [[Wellington]], and again in 1997, by [[Wai-te-ata Music Press]] (also of Wellington) (as part of a substantial Lilburn edition, publishing many of his works, including his as yet unpublished works, and continuing posthumously). See for some information e.g. {{OCLC|2406388}} (Schirmer/Faber), {{OCLC|152392072}} (Milburn reprint), and {{OCLC|57582720}} for the 1997 reprint.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[symphony]] was described by Lilburn as "a harsh, didactic personalised piece of searching rhetoric", and, indeed, of all his compositions, this is the one with the greatest [[twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]] influence. It is a one-movement work in five sections, marked ''[[Tempo|Moderato]]-[[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Vivace]]-[[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]]-[[Andante (tempo)|Andante]]-Allegro'', and is shorter than his other symphonies, typically lasting some fifteen minutes in performance.

Unlike with his other symphonies, Lilburn provided a synopsis for this work:&lt;blockquote&gt;The first [episode], introductory, develops an idea heard from a solo [[bassoon]].  The second is an Allegro set going by solo [[trumpet]].  This reverts to the mood of the introduction until the [[Snare drum|side drum]] decides on another Allegro.  The fourth section is a slower one, again launched by trumpet and concerned with some dialogue for [[brass instruments|brass]].  This also returns briefly to the introduction, and the final section is in the nature of a fragmented [[coda (music)|coda]].&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in the liner notes to the Naxos edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The opening statement of the symphony contains a three-note rising figure which directly recalls ''[[Sings Harry]]'', Lilburn's [[song cycle]] to words of [[Denis Glover]], and some critics have identified Harry, and Lilburn's identification with the character, as the true subject of the symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hoskins, writing in the liner notes to the Naxos edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Third Symphony'' was among Lilburn's last purely [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] compositions; soon after its completion he turned his attention to [[electronic music]], in which field he spent the remainder of his career.

Several recordings of the symphony exist.

'''''The Bohemian''''' is a [[painting]] by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] completed in 1890. It depicts a barefooted young woman sitting on a [[concrete]] bench on the south bank of the [[Seine]] across from [[Notre Dame de Paris]] resting a [[violin]] in her lap. Her right arm is resting on her thigh while the palm of her left hand is pressed down on her left knee so that she does not lean on the violin. Her hands are clasped with the fingers pointing forward while her shoulders are wrapped in a [[shawl]] dyed [[maroon (color)|maroon]] and light [[green]], and she is wearing a [[gray]] [[dress]] that extends to her ankles. The bow of the violin has been stuck through diagonally under the fingerboard. To her right is a [[maple]] tree.

The subject is a [[model (art)|model]] employed by Bouguereau for this and other paintings, including ''[[The Shepherdess (1889)|The Shepherdess]]''.

It was owned by the [[Minneapolis Institute of Art]] until 2004 when it was auctioned by [[Christie's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christies.com/Lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4264007 |title=Lot 133/Sale 1364 |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to benefit the acquisition fund.

'''The Crow''' is a [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] fairy tale. [[Andrew Lang]] included it in [[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books|''The Yellow Fairy Book'']].&lt;ref name="mythfolklore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/035.htm|title=THE CROW from Andrew Lang's Fairy Books|publisher=mythfolklore.net|accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
A king has three beautiful daughters, although the youngest of them is the most admired. While walking in a garden near the ruins of a castle, the youngest princess comes upon a crow that has been badly wounded. Noticing that the princess pities it, the crow reveals to her that he is a prince enchanted into taking the form of a crow for seven years. However, should the princess agree to live in the one remaining room of the castle and sleep on the golden bed each night without making a sound, she might free him. He warns her that if she does not obey this, his suffering will be doubled. 

The princess agrees and moves into the ruined castle. Every night at midnight, wicked ghosts appear and threaten her until dawn, yet in spite of her terror she makes no sound. One of her visiting sisters attempts to sleep in the golden bed herself, yet is so terrified by the apparitions she screams; the youngest princess insists on being alone after this incident. The princess continues on with her silence, and notices that each day the grateful crow looks and claims to be doing better than before.

After two years of this, the crow informs her that, to complete her task, the princess must find work as a servant for one year. She succeeds, but is treated poorly by her new master. As the year comes to an end, the prince regains his human form and marries the princess. They return to live in the ruined castle, which has now been fully restored.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4265">"'''The Visitor'''" is a 1965 short story  by British writer [[Roald Dahl]], centered on the fictional [[Uncle Oswald]] and the lurid adventures he describes in his elaborate diaries. In this story, set in 1946, Oswald has amorous designs on his [[Demographics of Syria|Syrian]] host's wife and teenage daughter, with unfortunate and unexpected consequences.

==Plot==
Oswald becomes stranded for a night near [[Cairo]] at the mansion of a wealthy businessman, Abdul Aziz, whose wife and daughter are both very beautiful. Oswald plots to seduce either the wife or daughter, and believes he has succeeded after a woman slips into his bedroom under cover of darkness and spends several passionate hours with him, although he cannot see her face and she refuses to converse with him. The next day, Oswald leaves the house none the wiser as to which of the two women he has slept with.  The story ends with a dark twist as Mr. Aziz reveals to Oswald that he has a ''second'' daughter who lives in seclusion in another part of the house – because she has incurable [[leprosy]].

==Publication history==
"The Visitor" was first published in the May 1965 issue of ''[[Playboy]]''.&lt;ref name=moses&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moses|first1=Norton H.|title=The Source of Roald Dahl's “The Visitor”|journal=ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews|url=http://literature.proquestlearning.com/quick/displayItemById.do?origin=toc&amp;PubID=12161&amp;QueryType=criticism&amp;ItemID=41099775%20pqllit_crit_lib|date=1999|volume=12|issue=2|pages=34–36|doi=10.1080/08957699909598055|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118124052/http://literature.proquestlearning.com/quick/displayItemById.do?origin=toc&amp;PubID=12161&amp;QueryType=criticism&amp;ItemID=41099775%20pqllit_crit_lib|archivedate=2015-01-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later included in the 1974 collection ''[[Switch Bitch]]''.

Norton H. Moses states that Dahl's story was expanded from an anecdote found in [[George "Dod" Orsborne]]'s ''Master of the Girl Pat'', published in 1949.&lt;ref name="moses"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Orsborne|first= George "Dod"|authorlink=George "Dod" Orsborne|title=Master of the Girl Pat|url= https://archive.org/details/masterofthegirlp009424mbp#page/n71|publisher= Doubleday|location= New York|pages=58-60|year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===

In his later years, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] occasionally told this story as a black joke during his appearances on American talk shows, most notably during an appearance on ''[[The Tomorrow Show]]'' on 29 May 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tomorrow Show (hosted by Tom Snyder)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QioPMnR9HM&amp;t=36m49s|website=YouTube|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skerry|first1=Philip J.|title=Dark Energy: Hitchcock's Absolute Camera and the Physics of Cinematic Spacetime|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781623568696|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=snjHAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22alfred+hitchcock%22+%22tomorrow+show%22&amp;q=tomorrow#v=onepage&amp;q=tomorrow%20show&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Akhbar's Daughter'', a 1987 [[television pilot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Night Rose: Akhbar's Daughter (1987)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095732|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Robert|title=Tales from the Darkside: The Final Season|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/Film/article/tales_from_darkside_final_season|website=Exclaim!|date=11 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118114019/http://www.exclaim.ca/Film/article/tales_from_darkside_final_season|archive-date = 18 January 2015|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; bears many similarities to the Dahl and Orsborne stories.

'''TuneSat''' is an online audio recognition service launched in 2009 which enables music copyright holders to detect where their work is being used. Rights owners upload their audio files, and TuneSat begins to search and track results of matches.

Founders Chris Woods and [[Scott Schreer]] began by pitching their services to US television networks as an alternative to the cue sheet tracking which has been standard for many years from [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruno |first=Antony |title=Name that Tune – Music Recognition Technology Could Improve Accounting of Broadcast Royalties |url=https://tunesat.com/tunesatportal/static/pdf/Billboard_Name_that_Tunesat_Article.pdf |publisher=Billboard |accessdate=2 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151132/https://tunesat.com/tunesatportal/static/pdf/Billboard_Name_that_Tunesat_Article.pdf |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''White Fungus''''' is an art magazine and project based in [[Taichung]] City, [[Taiwan]]. Founded by brothers Ron and Mark Hanson in [[Wellington]], New Zealand in 2004, as a quasi political manifesto, copies of the first issue were produced on a photocopier, wrapped in Christmas paper and hurled anonymously through the entrances of businesses throughout the city. Now a magazine featuring interviews, writing on art, new music, history and politics, ''White Fungus'' takes a dialogical approach to the work it covers. The name of the publication comes from a can of “white fungus” the Hansons found in their local supermarket in the industrial zone of Taichung City. Each cover of ''White Fungus'' is derived from a scan of the can.

''White Fungus'' has held interdisciplinary art events at galleries and venues including P.P.O.W. (New York), Kadist Art Foundation (San Francisco), N.K. (Berlin), The Lab (San Francisco), [[Taipei Contemporary Art Center]], the Cube (Taipei), Treasure Hill (Taipei),
[[VT Artsalon]] (Taipei), ARTSPACE (Auckland), Waikato Museum (Hamilton), [[Adam Art Gallery]] (Wellington), Enjoy Public Gallery(Wellington), and The Physics Room(Christchurch). The publication is held in library collections including The Museum of Modern Art (New York), The New York Public Library (Art &amp; Architecture Collection), The Southbank Centre (London), Museu d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona, Taipei Fine Art Museum, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, National Library of Australia and [[Te Papa Tongarewa]] (National Museum of New Zealand). The magazine has included articles by notable New Zealand art writers and artists, including [[Tao Wells]].

''White Fungus'' was part of the exhibition ''Millennium Magazines'' at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012. The exhibition was a survey of magazines made by contemporary artists since 2000. In November, 2012, White Fungus founders Ron Hanson and Mark Hanson gave a talk about the history of ''White Fungus'' at Times Museum in Guangzhou, China. In 2013 ''White Fungus'' was the magazine in residence at [[Kadist Art Foundation]] in San Francisco. While in the Bay Area, ''White Fungus'' released its 13th issue with events at Kadist and the Lab. The issue includes an article entitled 'The First Woman on Mars', written by American writer and independent scholar [[Ron Drummond]]. In late 2013 White Fungus signed a worldwide distribution deal with WhiteCirc in London.

'''Women on Walls''' ([[Arabic]]: ست الحيطة ''Sitt el-Heita'') is a public art project in [[Egypt]] aimed at empowering women through the use of street art, by encouraging the portrayal of strong Egyptian female figures in street art and empowering female street artists themselves to participate in the political space of graffiti. Building on the popularity of street art as a form of political expression during the January 25 revolution, the aim of this project is to increase awareness of women's issues by introducing women into public space.&lt;ref name = "Women on Walls"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barakat|first=Nada|title=Women on walls|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/5610/30/Women-on-walls.aspx|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=Al-Ahram|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project was co-founded by Mia Gröndahl, a Swedish street art documentarian, and Angie Balata, an Egyptian artist, in December 2012 with funding from the [[Danish Center for Culture and Development]], and was launched with a month-long event in the Spring of 2013 in Cairo, Luxor, Alexandria, and Mansoura that included painting sessions, workshops, and lectures on topics ranging from art to women's issues more generally.&lt;ref name = "Bigger, Bolder, Brighter: The Women on Walls graffiti campaign"&gt;{{cite news|last=ElNabawi|first=Maha|title=Bigger, Bolder, Brighter: The Women on Walls graffiti campaign|url=http://madamasr.com/content/bigger-bolder-brighter|accessdate=20 March 2014|newspaper=Mada Masr|date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project held its second campaign in February 2014.&lt;ref name = "Can Graffiti Remake Egypt?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bajec|first=Alessandra|title=Can Graffiti Remake Egypt?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2014/02/19/can-graffiti-remake-egypt.html|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==

=== Political graffiti and the Arab Spring ===
[[File:Down With The Military Rule(Graffiti).jpg|thumb|Down With The Military Rule(Graffiti)]]
During the Arab Spring revolutions, and in the years leading up to them, graffiti was commonly used as a form of popular protest. Street art was an effective way to spread the message of political rebellion. Furthermore, since authoritarian Arab leaders had poured significant resources into public beautification projects in order to demonstrate their absolute ownership of the public space, street art was a way for the people to reclaim that public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tripp|first=C.|title=Art  of  the  Uprisings  in  the  Middle  East|journal=Brown Journal of World Affairs|year=2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Arab Spring, street art became a prominent form of protest in many Arab countries, including Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demerdash|first=Nancy|title=Consuming Revolution: Ethics, Art and Ambivalence in the Arab Spring|journal=New Middle Eastern Studies|year=2012|volume=2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier example of this reclamation of public space is graffiti painted during the Palestinian intifada during the late 1980s. While Israeli state censorship prevented the production of a lot of Palestinian protest art, Palestinians were able to paint graffiti in order to spread their message without being stopped by the state. Also, the anonymity of the art form made it a stand-in for the collective spirit of Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peteet|first=Julie|title=The Writing on the Walls: The Graffiti of the Intifada|journal=Cultural Anthropology|year=1996|volume=11|issue=2|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, street art was not a widespread phenomenon before the January 25, 2011, but it quickly became one of the most powerful tools of the revolution.&lt;ref name="Revolution Graffiti"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grondahl|first=Mia|title=Revolution Graffiti: Street Art of the New Egypt|year=2012|publisher=American University in Cairo Press|location=Cairo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first days of the revolution, street art was largely used to mock then-president Hosni Mubarak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khatib|first=Lina|title=Street Art and the Egyptian Revolution|journal=Mediterranean Yearbook|year=2013|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Egyptian graffiti quickly expanded into a number of spaces, mediums, and genres. Popular types of revolutionary graffiti include political satire, mocking political and military leaders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Talon|first=Claire|title=Cairo's superficial clean-up brings graffiti artists out in force|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/cairo-graffiti-egypt-morsi|newspaper=The Guardian|date=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; murals depicting pharonic and biblical themes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abaza|first=Mona|title=The Buraqs of Tahrir|url=http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/5725/%20the-buraqs-of-tahrir%20.|newspaper=Jadaliyya|date=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; tags for social and political movements such as the April 6 Youth Movement and the Ultras,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fathi|first=Yasmine|title=6 April Youth Movement celebrate third anniversary|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/9506/Egypt/Politics-/-April-Youth-Movement-celebrate-third-anniversary.aspx|newspaper=Ahram Online|date=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bilal|first=Malika|title=Egypt's 'Ultras' pitch in at Tahrir protest|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/11/201111284912960586.html|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; and martyr paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abaza|first=Mona|title=Mourning, Narratives and Interactions with the Martyrs through Cairo’s Graffiti|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2013/10/07/mourning-narratives-and-interactions-with-the-martyrs-through-cairos-graffiti/|publisher=E-International Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; These various types of images are meant to critique the political order, incite anger, connect Egyptians with the past, and inspire solidarity for the revolutionary movement.

=== Female graffiti ===
In spite of the great proliferation of protest graffiti during the January 25 Revolution, it remained a largely male space, with men dominating the street artist community and very few pieces depicting women.&lt;ref name = "Egypt's graffiti artists make their mark"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Mat|title=Egypt's graffiti artists make their mark|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/04/egypts-graffiti-artists-make-their-mark-20144178384439962.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter this, movements such as the Graffiti Harimi project (the predecessor of Women on Walls) sought to increase the visibility of women in the public space by increasing the number of female figures in graffiti, with the intention of proving that women are worthy partners in the revolution. Female street art also serves the purpose of spreading political statements against the abuse of women. One recent denizen of the female graffiti scene supported by Women on Walls is [[Laila Ajjawi]], who has garnered international press&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a50015/this-palestinian-refugee-graffiti-artist-empowers-girls-with-street-art/|title = This Woman Is Using Graffiti to Change the Way Her Country Thinks About Girls|date = 2015-12-14|website = Cosmopolitan|access-date = 2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nypost.com/2015/05/07/womens-rights-isis-and-freedom-jordanian-street-art-expresses-its-frustration/|title = Women’s rights, ISIS, and freedom: Jordanian street art expresses its frustration|last = Froelich|first = Paula|last2 = Travel|first2 = Yahoo|website = New York Post|access-date = 2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; for her activities in the [[UNRWA]]-run Palestinian refugee camp outside of Irbid, Jordan.&lt;ref name="Revolution Graffiti"/&gt;{{RP|133}}

== The project ==
[[File:Anti-Sexual Harassment Graffiti in middle east.jpg|thumb|Anti-Sexual Harassment Graffiti in middle east]]

=== Mission ===
Despite the fact that women were early leaders in the January 25 Revolution, within months of the initial revolution women began to be excluded from protest spaces and political processes, and violence against women proliferated in revolutionary spaces such as Tahrir Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hafez|first=Sherine|title=No longer a bargain: Women, masculinity, and the Egyptian uprising|journal=American Ethnologist|year=2012|volume=39|issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1425.2011.01344.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This development, coupled with the already high rate of sexual assault in Egypt&lt;ref name="Egypt's graffiti artists make their mark"/&gt; and prevailing stereotype that women were not as capable as men,&lt;ref name="Revolution Graffiti"/&gt;{{rp|133}} inspired the Women on Walls project. The project seeks to educate the public on the status of women and promote women's rights through the medium of street art. From the project's Facebook page: "We are using art to discuss one of the most important topics in Egypt, women’s empowerment, and which involves many different issues, including the political, the social, the economic and the cultural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ست الحيطة - Women on Walls|url=https://www.facebook.com/womenonwalls/info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Directors ===

==== Mia Gröndahl ====
Mia Gröndahl is a Swedish journalist and street art documentarian who has lived in Egypt since 1996. She first became interested in graffiti when she lived in Gaza prior to moving to Egypt. After the advent of the January 25 Revolution, she spent over a year and a half documenting revolutionary street art in Egyptian cities for her book ''Revolution Graffiti: Street Art of the New Egypt''. It was through her research for this book that she was inspired to promote female graffiti; of the 17,000 pieces of street art she documented, only 253 of them included images of women. Of her motivation to start the project, she stated, ‘’I felt there’s was a need to support female artists, and there’s a very strong need to address women’s issues. Egypt is one of the worst countries when it comes to women’s rights.’’ &lt;ref name="Can Graffiti Remake Egypt?"/&gt; Her published works include ''Revolution Graffiti'', ''In Hope and Despair: Life in the Palestinian Refugee Camps'' (2003), ''Gaza Graffiti: Messages of Love and Politics'' (2009), and ''Tahrir Square: The Heart of the Egyptian Revolution'' (2011).&lt;ref name="'Women on Walls' campaign empowers women via street art"&gt;{{cite news|last=ElNabawi|first=Maha|title='Women on Walls' campaign empowers women via street art|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/women-walls-campaign-empowers-women-street-art|newspaper=Egypt Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Angie Balata ====
Angie Balata is the local cultural manager for the Women on Walls Project. She worked with Gröndahl on ''Revolution Graffiti'', documenting pieces, networking with street artists, and providing translations. Upon completing the book, the two women collaborated to expand the book launch into a larger exhibition, which became WOW.&lt;ref name="'Women on Walls' campaign empowers women via street art"/&gt;

=== First Edition ===
The first Women on Walls campaign was launched in April 2013, with nearly 40 artists participating, in the cities of Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, and Mansoura.&lt;ref name="Women on Walls"/&gt; Each city had a separate campaign led by well-known local graffiti artists: Mira Shahadeh and Zeft led the Cairo campaign, Ammar Abu Bakr led the Luxor campaign, Mohamed Khaled and Ghadir Wagdy led the Mansoura campaign, and Aya Tarek, Yazaan El Zo’bi, and Mohaned Nor led the Alexandria campaign. The campaigns were divided into two parts. The first part brought street artists to the town of Anafora for gender-related workshops, to learn about gender sensitive issues and work on how to discuss these issues in the street. In the second part, the artists returned to their respective cities to design pieces reflecting what they learned in the workshops. At the end, the project held a closing ceremony for final remarks and analysis of the finished work.&lt;ref name="'Women on Walls' campaign empowers women via street art"/&gt;

Notable participants included:
Abu Bakr,
Hanaa El Degham,
Ahmed Abdallah,
Ahmed Tony,
Sad Panda,
Mohamed El Moushir, and
the Mona Lisa Brigades.&lt;ref name="Bigger, Bolder, Brighter: The Women on Walls graffiti campaign"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bajec|first=Alessandra|title=Can Graffiti Remake Egypt?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2014/02/19/can-graffiti-remake-egypt.html|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second edition ===
The second campaign ran from February 8 to February 15, 2014, with 15 participating artists. Due to limited funds, the 2014 campaign only ran in Cairo. As with the first campaign, participants attended seminars and workshops with artists and feminist activists, including [[Cecilia Uddén]], [[Carolina Falkholt]], Radwa Fouda, Lamis Soleiman and Ismail Shawky, and then collaborated upon painting women into the public space. In addition, the second campaign partnered with organizations such as Egyptian feminist organization Nazra, and anti-harassment organization HarassMap in order to further educate participants on women's rights issues specific to Egypt.&lt;ref name="Bigger, Bolder, Brighter: The Women on Walls graffiti campaign"/&gt;
