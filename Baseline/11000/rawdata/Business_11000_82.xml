Prince Abdullah received elementary and secondary education in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=sauam/&gt; He then went to the United Kingdom for higher education&lt;ref name=wasrepme/&gt; where he studied engineering.&lt;ref name=eui/&gt;

==Career and activities==
Prince Abdullah's early career as an engineer involved both technical and management positions. He assumed the responsibility of the coordination of various studies for the two industrial cities, and later for the industrial security and safety sector.&lt;ref name=eui/&gt;

Abdullah bin Faisal began his career at the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu immediately after its establishment in 1975.&lt;ref name=eui/&gt; He served as the acting secretary general of the Royal Commission from 1985 to 1987. Then, he was appointed secretary general of the royal commission in 1987.&lt;ref name=sj&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudis confident US presence will prevent Iraq attack|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3TkpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NmUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1484,3825855&amp;dq=abdullah+bin+faisal+bin+turki&amp;hl=en|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=Sun Journal|date=21 August 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, he was appointed chairman of the body in 1991 and he served as chief executive officer of the commission and chairman of its board of directors.&lt;ref name=eui/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal decrees on ministerial and top-level appointments|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/archive/1997/news/page137.aspx|work=Saudi Embassy|accessdate=23 June 2012|date=6 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In April 2000, [[Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority|Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA)]] was created, responsible for promotions of the foreign and domestic investments in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SAGIA |url=http://www.gcf.org.sa/en/About-GCF/About-SAGIA/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019191332/http://gcf.org.sa/en/About-GCF/About-SAGIA/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 October 2009 |work=Global Competitiveness Forum |accessdate=7 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon Henderson| url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus96.pdf|title=After King Abdullah|work=Washington Institute|accessdate=28 July 2012|format=Policy Paper|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Abdullah was appointed governor of SAGIA with the rank of minister in 2000.&lt;ref name=eui/&gt;&lt;ref name=ameinfo03&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki Al Saud |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/23570.html |accessdate=7 June 2012 |work=AMEinfo |date=6 May 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529034728/http://www.ameinfo.com/23570.html |archivedate=29 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His tenure lasted until 2004 when he resigned from this post.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web|title=Wide Angle|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/the-saudi-question/whos-who-the-house-of-saud/prince-abdullah-bin-faisal-bin-turki-al-saud/2885/|work=PBS|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was speculated that since he was frustrated with the government’s bureaucratic approach and the slow pace of the reforms in the country, he left SAGIA.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

Prince Abdullah was the chairman of Saudi Italian Development Company (SIDCO), charged with the task of revitalizing Saudi Arabia's economy. Since he had knowledge of the Italian economy, he was regarded as the most appropriate figure to support the commercial relations between [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=sidco&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.sa-sidco.com/English/Mgt.html|work=Saudi Italian Development Company Limited (SIDCO)|accessdate=7 June 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202194446/http://www.sa-sidco.com/English/Mgt.html|archive-date=2 February 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015 Prince Abdullah became the Saudi ambassador to the USA.&lt;ref name=sauam&gt;{{cite news|author=Dina al-Shibeeb|title=Abdullah bin Faisal named new Saudi ambassador to Washington|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/10/21/Abdullah-bin-Faisal-named-new-Saudi-ambassador-to-Washington-.html|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=Al Arabiya|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded [[Adel al-Jubeir]] in the post.&lt;ref name=sauam/&gt; On 23 April 2017 Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud replaced Prince Abdullah as ambassador to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi Royal decree announces new appointments, restores benefits to government employees|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/1088886/saudi-arabia|accessdate=23 April 2017|work=Arab News|date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SAGIA governorship===
When Prince Abdullah was the governor of SAGIA, he strongly supported both liberal policies and privatization in the Saudi Arabia’s economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia's New Private Sector Investment Strategies|url=http://www.idcworld.com/saudiprivate.htm|work=International Development Consultants, LLC|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 2,000 foreign business licenses were issued during his tenure. The worth of these licenses were estimated to be 15 billion U.S. dollars.&lt;ref name=ameinfo03/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Prince Abdullah further encouraged the membership of Saudi Arabia to [[the World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; However, this goal was not achieved at that time because of Saudi Arabia’s protectionist policies towards the industries of oil production and telecommunications, and its inability to produce a formal trade agreement with the United States.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

==Personal life==
Abdullah bin Faisal is married and has four children:&lt;ref name=wasrepme/&gt; Turki, Salman, Elanoude and Sarah.&lt;ref name="alg"/&gt; He is keenly interested in environmental issues and in international relations as well as in the arts.&lt;ref name=eui/&gt;

'''Albert Thys''' (28 November 1849 &amp;ndash; 10 February 1915) was a Belgian businessman who was active in the [[Congo Free State]]. He gave his name of Thysville to the station of Sona Qongo, currently [[Mbanza-Ngungu]] in [[Bas-Congo]].

Born in [[Dalhem]], Thys graduated at the École de guerre, before entering into the service of king [[Leopold II of Belgium]] in 1876, as secretary of the colonial businesses. After the return of [[Henry Morton Stanley]], the king sent Thys to [[England]] to propose a new expedition to Central Africa on behalf of the [[Association Internationale Africaine]]. Thys was actively involved in the organisation of the first expeditions which would lead to the constitution of the Congo Free State.

After arriving in Congo in 1887 he promoted the [[Matadi-Kinshasa Railway|Matadi-Léopoldville Railway]], which was built from 1890 to 1898. He imposed a route by the south, deviating from the [[Congo river]]. He was one of the principal craftsmen of the development and the economic development of the Congo Free State and [[Belgian Congo]]. Notably he created the {{illm|Compagnie du Congo pour le Commerce et l'Industrie|nl}} (27 December 1886) and many of its subsidiary companies: the [[Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Congo]] (CCFC), the ''Compagnie des Magasins généraux'', the ''Société anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo'', the ''Compagnie des¨Produits'', the ''[[Compagnie du Katanga]]''.

He died in [[Brussels]], aged 66, in 1915.

'''Argent''' (''Money'') was a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[French language]] [[Category A services|Category A]] [[specialty channel]]. The channel was devoted to business news and [[finance|financial]] information. The channel was owned and operated by [[Groupe TVA]], a division of [[Quebecor Media]].  It was the francophone counterpart of [[Business News Network]].

==History==
On November 24, 2000, a consortium of companies including Groupe TVA (50.1%), Publications Transcontinental Inc. (30%) and BCE Media Inc. (19.9%) was granted a broadcasting licence by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) for a television channel called ''LCN Affaires'', described as "a national French-language Category 1 specialty television service devoted to business and personal finance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2000/DB2000-468.htm Decision CRTC 2000-468] CRTC 2000-12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the channel was launched, Groupe TVA bought the remaining shares from the other partners, bringing its ownership to 100%. Shortly thereafter, the channel was launched on February 21, 2005 as "Argent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tva.canoe.ca/groupetva/communiques/326.html LA PREMIÈRE CHAÎNE FINANCIÈRE FRANCOPHONE EN AMÉRIQUE DU NORD] Groupe TVA press release 2005-02-16 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 19, 2016, Quebecor announced that Argent would cease broadcasting after April 30, 2016. The company cited the channel's poor profitability as justification for the decision.&lt;ref name="gandm-argentshutdown"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quebecor Media's TVA Group closing business channel Argent|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/quebecor-medias-tva-group-closing-business-channel-argent/article29673259/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and family life==
Throughout much of his life Bell resided in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], born on 4 October 1868 at Moncreife Terrace, Craigie, Perth. Educated first at [[Perth Academy]] he later moved to [[Edinburgh]] continuing his studies at [[Craigmount School]].&lt;ref name=Oxford_DNB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weir|first1=Ronald B.|title=Bell, Arthur|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=50406&amp;back=|website=Oxford DNB|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 Bell married Miss Cammilla Bruce.&lt;ref name=Chronology&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Kinmond Bell – Chronology|url=http://www.gannochytrust.org.uk/community/arthur-kinmond-bell-chronology|website=Gannochy Trust|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was conducted in her native city of Edinburgh, but with both in their late 30s at the time of the marriage, a life without children seemed probable. It has been speculated that this contributed to his desire to make a lasting mark, leading to his [[philanthropy]].&lt;ref name=Duncan_2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duncan|first1=Jeremy|title=A Roof Over One's Head|date=2012|publisher=Farquhar and Son Ltd|location=Perth|isbn=978-0-9560620-7-9|pages=16–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bell joined the family business as a partner in 1895, following in the path of his father and grandfather.&lt;ref name=Bells_History&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nielson|first1=AC|title=Our History|url=http://www.bells.co.uk/?History|website=Bell's|publisher=Bell's|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly made his mark, and along with his brother, Robert, succeeded in doubling the company's profits before his father's death in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duncan|first1=Jeremy|title=A Roof Over One's Head|date=2012|publisher=Farquhar and Son Ltd|location=Perth|isbn=978-0-9560620-7-9|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Bell, as the eldest son, became managing director, and continued to expand the business despite the setbacks of the [[Great Depression]] and [[Prohibition in the United States]], becoming governor director in 1921 when the company became a limited company.&lt;ref name="Courier at RootWeb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Perth's Tribute to A. K. Bell extract available at RootsWeb|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/SANDEMAN/2004-10/1097742672|accessdate=13 July 2014|work=The Courier and Advertiser|date=4 July 1994|ref=The Courier and Advertiser}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion was achieved in large part through the use of advertising and agents, many of whom were members of his extended family living throughout the empire, and included the friendly takeover of three distilleries between 1933–1936. By the time of Bell's death in 1942, the company's profits were in excess of £100,000 per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chambers Scottish Biographical Dictionary|date=1992|publisher=Chambers Ltd|location=Edinburgh and New York|isbn=0-550-16043-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in his life, Bell saved the Perth linen industry by financially backing the one remaining company, John Shields and Co. intervening at the request of the [[Lord Provost]] Robert Nimmo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Perth Authority on Linen Manufacture|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19390626&amp;id=y0VAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kYUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3825,4070184|accessdate=12 July 2014|agency=Glasgow Herald|publisher=Herald and Times Group|date=26 June 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent and imminent closure of this company came as a shock to the [[Perth and Kinross Council|local council]], and the loss of 300 jobs would have been a blow to the city,. For his contribution Bell receiving the Freedom of Perth, and the workers of the company presented him with a parchment tribute as a thanks for his part in turning the company into a successful and growing enterprise.&lt;ref name=Duncan_2012 /&gt; Following his purchase of the company, Bell reconstructed the firm and re-equipped it for artificial fibre production, helping to secure the business into the future.&lt;ref name=Oxford_DNB /&gt;

==Philanthropic activities==
:"After a man has a roof over his head and his bread and butter is fairly well assured and has a surplus, I think you will agree with me that it is only common sense that he should spend part of that surplus for the benefit of his native city."&lt;ref name=75_Celebration&gt;{{cite news|title=Perth-born distiller Arthur Kinmond remembered|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/perth-born-distiller-arthur-kinmond-remembered-2731937|accessdate=10 July 2014|work=Daily Record|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This quotation from Bell's acceptance of the Freedom of Perth sums up his approach to philanthropy, and how as a beneficiary of the then booming [[Scotch whisky]] trade, Bell prospered and was able to look to benefit his home city. His first major project in this direction was the building of the Gannochy Housing Estate between 1924 and 1932.&lt;ref name="Bell and Trust"&gt;{{cite web|title=A K Bell and the Gannochy Trust|url=http://www.gannochytrust.org.uk/index.php?page=a-k-bell|website=Gannochy Trust|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model housing scheme was intended to benefit the hardworking of a younger generation, who had survived the harshness of war and were now looking to better themselves, with many of the original tenancies being granted to workers of Bell &amp; Sons.&lt;ref name=Duncan_2012 /&gt;

His next major project was the establishment of the [[Gannochy Trust]] in 1937,&lt;ref name=Chronology /&gt; founded partly to maintain the Gannochy estate and partly to ensure the continuing improvement of his native city into the future, even after his death.&lt;ref name="Bell and Trust" /&gt;

After housing, the other major concern for post-war Perth was the supply of clean water, with the [[River Tay]] becoming increasingly polluted. In answer to this problem Bell provided shares in Bell's Whisky to the Gannochy Trust for the purpose of establishing Sewage treatment works for Perth and the surrounding villages, having previously commissioned a survey of what needed to be done to improve the situation in 1925. In total the trust was able to provide £640,000 towards the projects, with the one in Perth being completed in 1971.&lt;ref name="Bell and Trust" /&gt;

==Recognition==
In contrast to many of his local contemporaries, such as [[John Dewar, 1st Baron Forteviot]] and [[Robert Pullar]], Bell received comparatively few public honours for his philanthropic activities during his life.&lt;ref name=Duncan_2012 /&gt; One distinction he did receive, on 18 March 1938, was the Freedom of Perth,&lt;ref name=Chronology /&gt; which he described as his greatest honour. This honour was granted primarily for his role in saving John Shields and Co. rather than for any of his philanthropic activities, which appear to have been done quietly and gone without any major public awareness during his life, a fact he would likely have been grateful for.&lt;ref name=Duncan_2012 /&gt;

In 1994, the decision was taken to name Perth's new multi-million-pound library the A. K. Bell library in honour of the man who had played such a large part in the city's history and whose legacy has had such a large impact on the city.&lt;ref name="Courier at RootWeb" /&gt; The library officially opened in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Tim|title=A Brief History of Perth|url=http://www.localhistories.org/perth.html|website=localhistories.org|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Arthur Kinmond Bell died unexpectedly of illness on 26 April 1942.&lt;ref name=Duncan_2012 /&gt; His will, though, proved him to be as generous in death as he was in life, gifting to 3 senior employees of Arthur Bell and Sons the sum of £5000, to all staff with 10 years experience in the company, £500, and to his gardeners, chauffeurs, and servants in his employ for 10 years or more, £200, all significant amounts for those who benefitted.&lt;ref name="Courier at RootWeb" /&gt;

At the time of his death Bell was living in Kincarrathie House, Perth, with his wife. Camilla later donated the house to the Kincarrathie Trust, who now run the house as a retirement home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kincarrathie House|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst89862.html|publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bendix Trophy.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Bendix Trophy. This one is on display at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The '''Bendix Trophy''' is a U.S. [[air racing|aeronautical racing]] trophy.  The transcontinental, point-to-point race, sponsored by industrialist [[Vincent Hugo Bendix|Vincent Bendix]] founder of [[Bendix Corporation]], began in 1931 as part of the [[National Air Races]]. Initial prize money for the winners was $15,000. The last Bendix Trophy Race was flown in 1962.

The trophy was brought back in 1998 by [[AlliedSignal]], the then-owner of the Bendix [[brand|brand name]] (which later merged with [[Honeywell]]), to "recognize contributions to aerospace safety by individuals or institutions through innovation in advanced safety equipment and equipment utilization."

The current awards of the ''Honeywell Bendix Trophy for Aviation Safety'' includes a scale reproduction of the original Bendix Trophy design and a citation.

==The race==
The purpose was to interest engineers in building faster, more reliable, and durable aircraft. Bendix competitors flew from [[Burbank, California]], to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], except for two years when the contest began in New York and ended in Los Angeles.

Famous competitors for the trophy included [[Jimmy Doolittle]], who won the first race, and several women. [[Amelia Earhart]] was the first woman to enter the Bendix, taking fifth place in 1935. In 1936, [[Louise Thaden]] and her copilot [[Blanche Noyes]] won the race. [[Laura Ingalls (aviator)|Laura Ingalls]] finished second. In 1938, [[Jacqueline Cochran]], arguably the greatest female aviator of all time, took home the trophy. [[Paul Mantz]] was the only pilot to ever win the Bendix three consecutive years, from 1946 through 1948.

The race was not run during [[World War II]]. Postwar winners were frequently military veterans from the [[United States Army Air Forces]]: the 1956 winner, [[Manuel J. Fernandez|Capt. Manuel Fernandez Jr.]], was the third-ranking Korean War USAAF ace. By the 1960s, American interest in air racing declined. This was probably due to an increased focus on [[Space Race|the space race]] during this time. Lt. [[Richard F. Gordon Jr.]], the winner in 1961, went on to become an [[astronaut]] with [[NASA]].

==Mister Mulligan==
''Mister Mulligan'' ([[Howard DGA-6]]), commissioned and flown by Ben Howard in the 1935 race, was the only airplane ever designed for the specific purpose of winning the Bendix Trophy. The plane was designed and developed by Ben Howard and [[Gordon Israel]], who went on the become an engineer for the [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]]. ''Mister Mulligan'' was designed to fly the entire length of the race nonstop and at high altitude. Neither had ever been done before. Howard and Israel, who co-piloted, won the trophy, changed how long distance airplanes were designed.

The second place plane in the 1935 race was actually a faster airplane, but had to make refuelling stops, which cost enough time to prevent [[Roscoe Turner]] from winning the race. The time difference was only 23.5 seconds between first and second place. The winning difference in speed, over the total distance was less than {{convert|0.2|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Mister Mulligan'' achieved {{convert|238.70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, compared to Roscoe Turner's {{convert|238.52|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

''Mister Mulligan'' not only won the Bendix, but also the [[Thompson Trophy]], when flown by Harold Neumann in 1935. Instead of a cross-country distance race, the Thompson was a closed-circuit race around pylons, a type of race for which it was not particularly well suited. Entered again in the Bendix in 1936, the ''Mister Mulligan'' was completely destroyed when the craft lost one of the propeller blades, resulting in a forced landing, {{convert|40|mi|km}} north of [[Crownpoint, New Mexico]]; this crash landing almost killed Howard and his co-pilot wife, Maxine.

'''Civic Openness in Negotiations''' ('''COIN''') is a set of [[Collective Bargaining]] rules involving government agencies and [[Labor union|public labor unions]] intended to ensure [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[accountability]]. The process allows for independent fiscal analysis and public scrutiny with a goal of reducing conflicts of interest, accounting for the full cost of agreements, ensuring adequate board review of contracts, and reducing long-term unfunded liabilities and unplanned expense.

COIN is also known as '''OPEN''' ('''Open Public Employee Negotiations''').

==Description==

COIN processes vary but usually have five distinct components:

*'''Independent Negotiator –''' Agencies hire an independent negotiator not impacted by any outcome in the negotiation process. This avoids conflict where agency staff - subject to the same provisions as the bargaining unit they are negotiating with - negotiate on behalf of Agency.
*'''Cost of Contracts''' – Under COIN, an agency's independently elected Auditor-Controller or one engaged by the independent negotiator, will take on the responsibility of analyzing the cost of any contract proposal. This ensures an equal playing ground for both labor organizations and the agency as both will be given the ability to comment about the analysis.
*'''Offers and Counteroffers''' – COIN requires all offers and counteroffers be disclosed to the public within 24 hours.
*'''Board Disclosure''' – Each member of the governing body of an agency will be required to disclose any and all verbal, written, or electronic communications they have had with an official representative of a recognized employee organization.
*'''Contract Approval''' – COIN ordinances require, before the final proposed contract is placed on the Board agenda, the [[Memorandum of Understanding]] to be posted on the Agency's website, usually 30 days or two Board meetings prior to board ratification. This allows the public to review contracts and perform independent financial scrutiny and provide public comment prior board ratification.

===Variations===

*'''Acknowledgements''' - Each Agency officer must certify in writing he/she has read and considered the fiscal impacts of each offer.
*'''Public Ratification''' - Voters in an Agency's district must ratify by referendum any contract resulting in benefits that cannot be reduced in the future due to constitutional protections or [[ERISA]]. Typically, these are changes to pension plans and tenure provisions.

==History==

The first COIN ordinance was written by Mayor pro-tempore Stephen Mensinger and  adopted by [[Costa Mesa]], CA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Costa Mesa: COIN Ordinance|url=http://www.costamesaca.gov/index.aspx?page=1570}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012. In subsequent years, it was also adopted by [[Beverly Hills]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Beverly Hills COIN Ordinance|url=http://beverlyhills.org/citygovernment/departments/administrativeservices/humanresources/memorandumofunderstanding/?NFR=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]], [[Fountain Valley]], [[Rancho Palos Verdes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racho Palos Verdes: OPEN Ordinance|url=http://www.rpvca.gov/801/Labor-Negotiations-OPEN-Ordinance}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], CA. It has been strongly championed by California State Senator, [[John Moorlach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pension Hole|url=https://johnmoorlach.wordpress.com/2015/07/31/moorlach-update-pension-hole-july-31-2015/|website=John Moorlach Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Moorlach|title=Civic Openness in Negotiations hold Elected Officials Accountable|url=http://unionwatch.org/civic-openness-in-negotiations-ordinances-hold-elected-officials-accountable/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a [[Civil grand jury|Civil Grand Jury]] in [[Marin County]] recommended the adoption of COIN by county agencies including the operator of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Need for Labor Negotiation Transparency|url=http://www.marincounty.org/~/media/files/departments/gj/reports-responses/2014/gj_labor_neg2.pdf?la=en|website=Civil Grand Jury of Marin County}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, COIN has been opposed by organized labor. In 2015, California Governor, Jerry Brown, signed an act officially called CRONEY&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civic Reporting Openness in Negotiations Efficiency Act, or CRONEY|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PCC&amp;division=2.&amp;title=&amp;part=3.&amp;chapter=4.5.&amp;article=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the California Public Contract Code, intended to reduce the number of California municipalities adopting COIN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New state law affects agencies, like Costa Mesa, using COIN negotiations rules|url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-1015-crone-law-20151014-story.html|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to [[Crony capitalism|Crony Capitalism]], the official title was changed through an opposing legislator's last minute amendment without public disclosure or comment to illustrate the problems of closed and nontransparent government practices.

'''Claudio Marzocco''' (born 21 February 1959) is an Italian engineer and businessman. He is the chief executive officer (CEO) of the [[Marzocco Group]], one of the leading [[real estate development]] companies in [[Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ellisphere.fr/dirigeant/MARZOCCO-CLAUDIO-19590221 Ellisphere], France.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early career==
In 1983, Marzocco graduated from the [[University of Padova]] with a [[civil engineering]] diploma and started working as an engineer in the construction sector in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telescoop.tv/browse/388714/17/monaco-les-coulisses-du-rocher.html|title=Telescoop.|publisher=Telescoop.tv|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1988, he was kidnapped for two weeks by the Calabria-based mafia [[N'drangheta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,8/articleid,0955_01_1988_0020_0008_12933306/|title=La Stampa.|publisher=Archiviolastamp.it|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kidnappers demanded a ransom from the Marzocco family, but Claudio Marzocco managed to escape after 15 days of abduction. “A week later, my whole family moved to Monaco where we found security for both ourselves and our business”, he said during an interview with French magazine L’Express.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/region/a-monaco-l-empire-de-beton-de-la-famille-pastor_1296649.html|title=L'Express.|work=L'EXPRESS.fr|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marzocco Group==
The Marzocco Group was founded in the 1960s by Domenico Marzocco, father of Claudio Marzocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24heuresactu.com/2013/11/13/groupe-marzocco-une-dynastie-de-constructeurs/|title=24heuresactu.|work=24heuresactu.com|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same year Claudio Marzocco was kidnapped, after moving to Monaco, he established the Marzocco Group in Monaco,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC-seYj5dY4 Montecarlo World Network.]&lt;/ref&gt; which was soon oriented as a real estate development company specializing in luxury buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20130830.AFP3703/a-monaco-les-49-etages-de-la-tour-odeon-attendent-leurs-millionnaires.html|title=Le Nouvel Observateur.|date=30 August 2013|work=nouvelobs.com|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Marzocco group, which is fully owned and managed by members of the Marzocco family, is now considered one of Monaco's leading real-estate development companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekonomico.fr/2013/12/dandros-a-marzocco-les-entreprises-familiales/|title=D’Andros à Marzocco : les entreprises familiales|work=Ekonomico|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Claudio Marzocco is the current{{when|date=October 2014}} company's [[Chief Executive Officer]]. His brothers Luca Marzocco, as well as Claudio’s sons Daniele and Niccolò, as well as his nephew Domenico Della Bella are also board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groupemarzocco.mc/fr/who-we-are/executive-teams|title=Groupe Marzocco Organization Chart.|publisher=Groupemarzocco.mc|accessdate=11 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803075420/http://www.groupemarzocco.mc/fr/who-we-are/executive-teams#|archive-date=2014-08-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="502">A '''Collateral Billing number''' (CBN) is a number that sometimes can be given in place of a [[purchase order]] or a [[credit card number]] to ensure a products return. For example, you receive a defective product and call the manufacturer, they in turn send you a replacement unit after collecting a purchase order, credit card or collateral billing number from you to charge the cost of the unit to in the event that you do not return the original unit.

A '''collective work''' under the [[copyright law of France]] is a [[collective work]] that contains the works of several authors created, assembled, harmonized and published under the direction of a person or  organization who owns the commercial and moral rights of the work as a whole. 
The work as a whole is distinct from the individual contributions, which are owned by the authors.
It is common for publication of articles on the Internet, in a different context and layout from the printed work, to be considered to be outside the standard agreement between the author and the owner of the collective work.

==Definitions==

Article L113-2 of the French Intellectual Property Code defines three types of multi-author works:{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=2}}
* "Work of collaboration" shall mean a work in the creation of which more than one natural person has participated.
* "Composite work" shall mean a new work in which a preexisting work is incorporated without the collaboration of the author of the latter work.
* "Collective work" shall mean a work created at the initiative of a natural or legal person who edits it, publishes it and discloses it under his direction and name and in which the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, without it being possible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work as created.{{efn|The definition in Spanish copyright law, much influenced by French law, says a collective work "consists of the collection of contributions from different authors whose personal contributions are based on autonomous creation, and for whom it is not possible to attribute separately a right over the whole of the work."{{sfn|Juan Carlos I|1987|loc=Art. 28}} This is perhaps clearer than the French form "in which the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, without it being possible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work as created."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=2}} }}

Article L113-5 states that "A collective work shall be the property, unless proved otherwise, of the natural or legal person under whose name it has been disclosed.  The author’s rights shall vest in such person."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=2–3}}
Article L123-3 states that "In the case of pseudonymous, anonymous or collective works, the term of the exclusive right shall be 70 years from January 1 of the calendar year following that in which the work was published."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=7}}

==Interpretations==

The concept of a collective work (''œuvre collective'') in French law is complicated and unclear, and case law and scholarly views do not always agree.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
Bernard Edelman, in his ''l’œuvre collective : une définition introuvable'' (1998), describes the legal definition of collective works as "obscure and tangled".{{sfn|Jacobacci Avocats|2014}}
However, all authorities agree that the concept of an ''oeuvre collective'' in France covers dictionaries, encyclopaedias and periodical
works such as newspapers or magazines.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
Courts have also ruled that collective works may include such things as the elements of a car body, a computer program, a poster and a guide of administrative formalities.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=70}}

Basic conditions for a collective work are that there must be a promoter, presenter or orchestrator, and the work must not be joint authorship.{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}
The work's ''maître'', a natural or legal person, directs creation of the collective work, harmonizes the contributions, edits, publishes and discloses the work.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
The  ''maître'' decides on the theme, treatment and spirit of the work, assembles the contributions, harmonizes it and publishes the overall work. 
The contributors have not significantly cooperated in creating the overall work, but have each worked independently under the direction of the ''maître''.{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}
It does not matter whether the contributors are identified or remain anonymous.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}

In a 1999 dispute over the rights of the daily newspaper [[Le Progrès]] to publish articles online, the lower court refused to designate Le Progrès a collective work, but the Court of Appeal ruled that it was a collective work by virtue of assembling a newspaper in several editions, selecting and presenting the contributions at the sole discretion of the owner, Groupe Progrès.{{sfn|Blocman|2000}}
By working under the direction of the owner, the contributors lose their creative independence, however important their contributions are to the collective work.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}

==Proprietary rights==

A collective work is unusual in French law in that a juristic person may be the initial owner of a work without having to show evidence that the copyright was assigned.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=71}}
As a rule, French courts do not recognise that an employee has transferred their rights to an employer unless there is evidence of such a transfer in the form of an agreement.
A collective work is an exception.
The ''maître'' takes all the ownership rights in a collective work, and these rights are directly vested in the ''maître'' rather than transferred from the contributors, as long as the ''maître'' directed the creative process enough for it to be considered a collective work.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=9}}

The 1885 [[Berne Convention]] stated that journalists owned their work, but this depends on whether a newspaper is seen as a collection of works or as a collective work.
In France, journalists own their work in either case.{{sfn|France ... Press Reference|loc=Industrial Relations}}
Article L121-8 states that whether or not a newspaper or periodical is considered to be a collective work the journalists retain the rights to exploit their contributions.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=9}}
The promoter is the sole owner of the rights in the collective work as a whole, but the contributors have author rights in their own contributions.
Case law has determined that the investor's initial right of property is limited to the first commercial release of the collective work.
The contributors can then commercialize their contributions separately as long as this does not adversely affect commercialization of the collective work as a whole.{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}
The contributors to a newspaper thus have the right to separately publish a thematic selection of articles without infringing the rights of the owner of the collective work.{{sfn|Ader|1997}}

==Moral rights==

Moral rights are seen as personality rights in French law, attached to the personality of the author and inalienable.
They are retained by the author even when the patrimonial rights are sold.{{sfn|Bretonnière|2012}}
The Intellectual Property Code says the ''maître'' has the author's rights, and does not distinguish between moral and economic rights.
However, only a natural person can be an author, and moral rights cannot be alienated from the author, giving rise to uncertainty over whether the ''maître'' could claim any moral rights in the collective work.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=9}}
However, in a 22 March 2012 decision the [[Court of Cassation (France)|French Supreme Court]] (''Cour de cassation'') reversed the decision of a lower court and stated that "the natural or legal person at the initiative of a collective work is vested with the author's rights over this work and, in particular, the moral rights prerogatives".{{sfn|Bretonnière|2012}}
The owner of the collective work may not be a natural person, so they are not an author in the strict sense, but they own the moral rights as well as the economic rights, and may therefore prohibit violations of their moral rights such as distortion of the collective work.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=86}}

Each contributor to the collective work retains the moral rights to their contribution, and may enforce this right against third parties or against the ''maître'' if they make unauthorized changes to the contribution. 
Despite this, the ''maître'' may modify the contributions as far as is needed to harmonize them with the collective work as a whole.
The moral right of the contributor is limited by the fusion of their contribution with those of the other co-authors.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=86}}

==Electronic reproduction==

The rise of the Internet has opened new questions about the rights of the authors of contributions to a collective work.{{sfn|France ... Press Reference|loc=Industrial Relations}}
When a newspaper is reproduced in its entirety the reproduction falls under the collective work regime.
Publication in successive editions of a newspaper during the course of the day, each of which reproduces a large part of the previous edition, is not seen as publication in another newspaper.
Electronic publication of the entire newspaper could therefore be seen as an edition of the same collective work.
However, partial or selective reproduction may require the agreement of the contributors.{{sfn|Ader|1997}}

As an example of digital reproduction of the full work, since 2005 the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (BnF) has been digitizing editions of daily and weekly periodicals that were published before 1943. Some of this has been through agreements with the publishers ''L’Ouest-Éclair'' and ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]''. 
Where the BnF does not have such an agreement, the BnF considers the newspaper to be a collective work that entered the public domain 70 years after publication.{{sfn|Presse écrite numérisée – BnF}}
Some of these digitized journals may contain contributions for which the individual author's rights have not expired.
Thus the cover of the digitized ''[[:fr:La Baïonnette|La Baïonnette]]'' of 2 December 1915 has an illustration by the artist [[:fr:Albert Jarach|Albert Jarach]], who died in 1962 and whose rights would not expire until 2033.{{sfn|La Baïonnette – BnF}}

France was the first country to introduce an online newspaper, with the [[Minitel]] service in the 1980s.
Today the online and print versions of newspaper are typically run by different departments and have different appearance, with the online versions updated frequently and providing video boxes and  interactive features. Some newspapers are online only.{{sfn|France ... Press Reference|loc=Print Media versus Electronic Media}}
A case between the French national union of journalists and ''[[Le Figaro]]'' newspaper was heard on 14 April 1999 by the Court of First Instance in Paris.
''Le Figaro'' had created a website where articles by the journalists could be consulted online.
The court ruled that although the printed newspaper was a collective work, the rights of the journalists concerning their articles had been infringed.
''Le Figaro'' only had the right to publish the articles in the printed newspaper, and the website would be considered another newspaper or magazine.{{sfn|Delcros|1999}}

On 9 December 1999 the Lyon Court of Appeal ruled similarly that the daily newspaper ''[[Le Progrès]]'' was guilty of forgery for having published its journalists' articles on the internet.
Although the newspaper was a collective work, the right of the owner to reproduction was limited to the paper edition, and the website could not be seen as an extension of that edition.{{sfn|Blocman|2000}}
A similar judgement was issued by the Court of Cassation  on 3 July 2013 in a case concerning the newspaper ''L'Union''.
The court said that whether or not that newspaper was a collective work, which had not been proven, the consent of a contributor was required before his contributions could be reproduced on an Internet site and reproduced in another newspaper.{{sfn|Audience publique du mercredi 3 juillet 2013}}

Newspapers have responded by signing agreements with journalist's unions that took different approaches to cover online publication of articles.
''Les Derniéres Nouvelles d'Alsace'' paid journalists for online use. 
''[[Le Monde]]'' compensated journalists for ceding their copyright. 
''[[Les Échos (newspaper)|Les Échos]]'' made an agreement that treated the print and online versions as one.{{sfn|France ... Press Reference|loc=Industrial Relations}}

The '''Dogs of the Dow''' is an [[investment strategy]] popularized by Michael B. O'Higgins in 1991, which proposes that an investor annually select for investment the ten [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA) stocks whose [[dividend]] is the highest fraction of their price.

==History==
Selecting some components of the DJIA is not a new idea. An article by H. G. Schneider was published in ''[[The Journal of Finance]]'' in 1951, based on selecting stocks by their [[price–earnings ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff (undated). [http://www.investorhome.com/dogs.htm "'Dogs of the Dow' and the 'Foolish Four'"]. investorhome.com. Retrieved May 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Proponents of the Dogs of the Dow strategy argue that [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip]] companies do not alter their dividend to reflect trading conditions and, therefore, the dividend is a measure of the average worth of the company; the stock price, in contrast, fluctuates through the [[business cycle]]. This should mean that companies with a [[High-yield stocks|high yield]], with a high dividend relative to stock price, are near the bottom of their business cycle and are likely to see their stock price increase faster than low-yield companies.

Under this model, an investor annually reinvesting in high-yield companies should out-perform the overall market. The logic behind this is that a high-dividend yield suggests both that the stock is oversold and that management believes in its company's prospects and is willing to back that up by paying out a relatively high dividend.  Investors are thereby hoping to benefit from both above-average stock-price gains as well as a relatively high quarterly dividend.  Of course, several assumptions are made in this argument.

The first assumption is that the dividend price reflects the company size rather than the company business model.  The second is that companies have a natural, repeating cycle in which good performances are predicted by bad ones. Due to the nature of the concept, the Dogs may come from a small number of sectors. For example, the ten stocks that belonged to the 2015 Dogs of the Dow list came from only six sectors, including industrials, energy, and healthcare,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Chart (undated) | url = http://hellomoney.co/portfolio/3701a6-dogs-of-the-dow-2015|title = Dogs of the Dow 1015 – Comparing Performance Between S&amp;P 500 and Dogs of the Dow – Stock List Is Based on DogsOfTheDow.com. | access-date = May 11, 2016 | publisher = Hello Money (hellomoney.co)}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]] which covers eleven sectors.

==Results==
O'Higgins and others back-tested the strategy as far back as the 1920s and found that investing in the Dogs consistently outperformed the market as a whole. Since that time, the data shows that the Dogs of the Dow as well as the popular variant, the Small Dogs of the Dow, have performed well.

For example, for the twenty years from 1992 to 2011, the Dogs of the Dow matched the average annual total return of the DJIA (10.8 percent) and outperformed the S&amp;P 500 (9.6 percent), as reported by the [http://www.dogsofthedow.com/ Dogs of the Dow] website located at dogsofthedow.com.

The Small Dogs of the Dow, which are the five lowest-priced Dogs of the Dow, outperformed both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 with an average annual total return of 12.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Staff (undated) | title= Dogs of the Dow Total Return: Dog Years|url=http://www.dogsofthedow.com/dogyrs.htm|publisher= Dogs of the Dow | access-date = May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When each individual year is reviewed, it is clear that both the Dogs of the Dow and Small Dogs of the Dow did not outperform each and every year. In fact, the Dogs of the Dow and Small Dogs of the Dow struggled to keep up with the Dow during latter stages of the [[dot-com boom|dot-com boom (1998 and 1999)]] as well as during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis (2007–2009)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Staff (undated) | title=Dogs of the Dow|url=http://www.dogsofthedow.com |publisher=Dogs of the Dow | access-date = May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that an investor would be best served by viewing this as a longer-term strategy by giving this portfolio of stocks time to recover in case of a rare-but-extreme economic event (e.g., dot-com boom, financial crisis).

==Criticism==
On January 8, 2014, John S. Tobey wrote an article in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine where he criticized the Dogs.  He said that it should use [[price weighting]], instead of [[equal weighting]], because that is what the DJIA uses. He said that, for the year 2013, using the price weighting the Dogs would have returned less, rather than more, than the DJIA. He suggested that it is too simple and it should use more factors such as [[dividend payout ratio|dividend–payout ratio]], growth of cash and earnings, price performance, and many other things. However, he did not say how to combine these into a strategy. He also criticized it for back-testing (although the method was published in 1991). He also said that the strategy would not work well for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = January 8, 2014 | author = Tobey John S. | title=Ditch 'Dogs of the Dow' – The Mutts Have Bad Genes, Improper Breeding and False Papers | work = [[Forbes]] | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntobey/2014/01/08/ditch-dogs-of-the-dow-the-mutts-have-bad-genes-improper-breeding-and-false-papers | access-date = May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flash is particularly visible as a solid patch of plastic at bottom centre-right, between the model aeroplane side and the sprue.]]'''Flash''', also known as '''flashing''', is excess material attached to a [[molding (process)|molded]], [[forging|forged]], or [[casting|cast]] product, which must usually be removed. This is typically caused by leakage of the material between the two surfaces of a mold (beginning along the [[parting line]]&lt;ref name="Kazmer2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kazmer|title=Injection mold design engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWTftzWhBp4C&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=15 April 2011|year=2007|publisher=Hanser Verlag|isbn=978-1-56990-417-6|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or between the base material and the mold (in the case of overmolding). Molding flash is seen when the optimized parameter on cull height is not calibrated.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} Proper design of mold parting surfaces can reduce or eliminate flash.&lt;ref name="VGX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_sg/Images/3014_tcm963-4308.pdf|title=NX I-deasVGX Core/Cavity|year=2007|publisher=Siemens PLM Software|accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molding flash can be caused from old or worn mold cavities that no longer fit tightly together. Other times, the complexity of the part requires so many mating pieces with such precise geometries that it is almost impossible to create a perfect fit on every impression. Most often, the type of material being molded, and its attendant viscosity in its liquid form, is the primary factor that leads to the creation of the unwanted mold flash.&lt;ref name="bozzelli"&gt;Bozzelli, John [http://www.ptonline.com/articles/an-expert-tells-how-to-stop-flash "An Expert Tells How to Stop Flash"], ''Plastics Technology'', July 2004, accessed May 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of removing flash, known as '''deflashing''', is commonly performed via cutting, breaking, [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], or [[Tumble finishing|tumbling]]. Some foundries use robot autogrinders to remove this unwanted material. It is very typical for molders to have their operators trim flash with hand tools at the molding machine between cycles. Many molders and OEMs seek out the use of batch processes including vibratory tumbling, cryogenic deflashing&lt;ref name="Nitrofreeze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nitrofreeze.com/services/deflashing/cryogenic-deflashing-using-blast-media/|title=Cryogenic Deflashing for Molded Plastic, Rubber &amp; Silicone|publisher=Nitrofreeze Cryogenic Solutions|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; or media blasting to remove unwanted flash from large batches of parts.

== Witness mark ==
In plastic injection, a faint mark called a '''witness mark''' (or '''witness line''') will occur along the parting line.&lt;ref name="Kazmer2007"/&gt; This is unavoidable and is usually accepted despite the minor aesthetics issue. However, some part surfaces (e.g. when used for sealing&lt;ref name="Bernard2005"&gt;{{cite patent|country=US | number = 6939500 | status = patent | title = Method and apparatus for eliminating a parting line witness mark from a molded part | gdate = 2005-09-06 | invent1 = Bernard, Edward Helmut}}&lt;/ref&gt;) cannot tolerate witness marks, and thus either the marks must be removed post-molding or the [[Molding (process)|mold]] redesigned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1834">'''Forged endorsement''' is a legal term used to describe a fraudulent payment. For example, someone may write a cheque with a forged signature. In this case the forged signature makes the endorsement fraudulent. Forging endorsements can be use to prevent the person or legal entity that the payment is made out to from being able to receive its value (such as cashing a cheque).

==Legal description==

If an [[Financial instrument|instrument]] is endorsed in full, it cannot be endorsed or negotiated except by an [[Negotiable instrument|endorsement]] signed by the person to whom or to whose order the instrument is payable. Thus, if such an instrument is negotiated by way of a forged endorsement, the endorsee will not acquire the title even though he be a purchaser for value and in good faith, because the endorsement is [[Legal nullity|nullity]]. But where the instrument has been endorsed in blank, it can be negotiated by mere delivery and the holder derives his title independent of the forged endorsement and can claim the amount from any of the parties to the instrument.

== Examples==
A bill is endorsed, “payable to X or order”. X endorses it in blank and it comes into the hands of Y, who simply delivers it to A. A would then forge Y's endorsement and transfers it to B. B, as the holder, does not derive his title through the forged endorsement to Y, but through the genuine endorsement of X and can claim payment from any of the parties to the instrument in spite of the intervening forged endorsement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6815">The '''Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles''' (The Principles), were created by [[ARMA International]] as a common set of principles that describe the conditions under which [[business records]] and related information should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arma.org/principles&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Principles==
The eight principles are designed to identify the major hallmarks of effective [[Information governance]], but do not follow a numerical hierarchy of importance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arma.org/principles&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Principle of Accountability'''
* '''Principle of Transparency'''
* '''Principle of Integrity'''
* '''Principle of Protection'''
* '''Principle of Compliance'''
* '''Principle of Availability'''
* '''Principle of Retention'''
* '''Principle of Disposition'''

The list of principles can be recalled with the help of the [[Mnemonic]] "A TIP CARD," which serves a dual purpose as it implies the principles are tips for effective recordkeeping.

==ARMA International Maturity Model for Information Governance==

Information is one of the most vital, strategic assets organizations possess. They depend on information to develop products and services, make critical strategic decisions, protect property rights, propel marketing, manage projects, process transactions, service customers, and generate revenues. This critical information is contained in the organizations' business records. 
It has not always been easy to describe what "good recordkeeping" looks like. Yet, this question gains in importance as regulators, shareholders, and customers are increasingly concerned about the business practices of organizations.

ARMA International recognized that a clear statement of "Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles®" (The Principles) would guide:

* CEOs in determining how to protect their organizations in the use of information assets; 
* Legislators in crafting legislation meant to hold organizations accountable; and 
* Records management professionals in designing comprehensive and effective records management programs.

The principles identify the critical hallmarks of information governance, which Gartner describes as an accountability framework that "includes the processes, roles, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals." As such, they apply to all sizes of organizations, in all types of industries, and in both the private and public sectors. Multi-national organizations can also use the Principles to establish consistent practices across a variety of business units.

===A Picture of Effective Information Governance===

The Maturity Model for Information Governance&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arma.org/gprinciples&lt;/ref&gt; begins to paint a more complete picture of what effective information governance looks like. It is based on the eight principles as well as a foundation of standards, best practices, and legal/regulatory requirements. The maturity model goes beyond a mere statement of the principles by beginning to define characteristics of various levels of recordkeeping programs. For each principle, the maturity model associates various characteristics that are typical for each of the five levels in the model:

* Level 1 (Sub-standard): This level describes an environment where recordkeeping concerns are either not addressed at all, or are addressed in a very ad hoc manner. Organizations that identify primarily with these descriptions should be concerned that their programs will not meet legal or regulatory scrutiny. 
* Level 2 (In Development): This level describes an environment where there is a developing recognition that recordkeeping affects the organization, and that the organization may benefit from a more defined information governance program. However, in Level 2, the organization is still vulnerable to legal or regulatory scrutiny since practices are ill-defined and still largely ad hoc in nature. 
* Level 3 (Essential): This level describes the essential or minimum requirements that must be addressed in order to meet the organization's legal and regulatory requirements. Level 3 is characterized by defined policies and procedures, and more specific decisions taken to improve recordkeeping. However, organizations that identify primarily with Level 3 descriptions may still be missing significant opportunities for streamlining business and controlling costs. 
* Level 4 (Proactive): This level describes an organization that is initiating information governance program improvements throughout its business operations. Information governance issues and considerations are integrated into business decisions on a routine basis, and the organization easily meets its legal and regulatory requirements. Organizations that identify primarily with these descriptions should begin to consider the business benefits of information availability in transforming their organizations globally. 
* Level 5 (Transformational): This level describes an organization that has integrated information governance into its overall corporate infrastructure and business processes to such an extent that compliance with the program requirements is routine. These organizations have recognized that effective information governance plays a critical role in cost containment, competitive advantage, and client service.

===How to Use the Maturity Model===

The Information Governance Maturity Model will assist an organization in conducting a preliminary evaluation of its recordkeeping programs and practices. Thoughtful consideration of the organization's practices should allow users to make an initial determination of the maturity of their organization’s information governance. Initially, it is not unusual for an organization to be at differing levels of maturity for the eight principles. It is also important to note that the maturity model represents an initial evaluation. In order to be most effective, a more in-depth analysis of organizational policies and practices may be necessary.

The maturity model will be most useful to leaders who wish to achieve the maximum benefit from their information governance practices. Effective information governance requires a continuous focus. But in order to get started, organizations can look to the steps below:

* Identify the gaps between the organization's current practices and the desirable level of maturity for each principle. 
* Assess the risk(s) to the organization, based on the biggest gaps. 
* Determine whether additional information and analysis is necessary. 
* Develop priorities and assign accountability for further development of the program.

The '''Gordon Bennett Aviation Trophy''' was an international airplane racing trophy awarded by [[James Gordon Bennett Jr.]], the American owner and publisher of the ''[[New York Herald]]'' newspaper. The trophy is one of three Gordon Bennett awards: Bennett was also the sponsor of an [[Gordon Bennett Cup (auto racing)|automobile race]] and a [[Gordon Bennett Cup (ballooning)|ballooning competition]].&lt;ref name='history'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esparacing.com/sport_pilot/air_racing_history.htm |title=Air Racing History |publisher=ESPA Racing |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='cof'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/up%20to%20WW%201/Reims%20Race.htm |title=Reims Air Race |publisher=Century of Flight |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms of the trophy competition were the same as those of the [[Schneider Trophy]]: each race was hosted by the nation which had won the preceding race, and the trophy would be won outright by the nation whose team won the race three times in succession. Accordingly, after [[Joseph Sadi-Lecointe]]'s victory in 1920 the Trophy became the permanent possession of the [[Aéro-Club de France]].&lt;ref name='history'/&gt;

==History==
[[File:James Gordon Bennett jr.jpg|thumbnail|upright|James Gordon Bennett]]
Following the success of the Gordon Bennett balloon competition, which had become the most important competition for the sport, Gordon Bennett announced a competition for powered aircraft in December 1908, commissioning a trophy from [[André Auroc]], the sculptor who had created the trophies for both the balloon and automobile competitions.  Formulation of the competition rules was entrusted to the Aéro-Club de France.&lt;ref&gt;Villard 1987, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  It was decided that each competing nation would be allowed to field a team of three competitors.

The 1909 competition was held as part of the [[Grande Semaine d'Aviation]] held at [[Reims]] in France, and consisted of 2 laps of a {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} circuit.  Like the subsequent competitions, it was not a direct race, but a time trial, with competitors taking off separately.  As aircraft became faster and their engines more reliable, the distance to be covered was increased each year.

The last competition was held in 1920 in the [[Communes of France|French communes]] of Orléans and Étampes. Unlike those held before the [[World War I|First World War]] which were over short courses marked by pylons, the competition was held between two points {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart because of the growing speed of aircraft. [[Joseph Sadi-Lecointe]] won in a time of 1 hour, 6 minutes and 17.2 seconds, while fellow French aviator Bernard de Roumanet finished  second in a time of 1 hour, 39 minutes and 6.9 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/212645443/Gordon-Bennett-Trophy-1920 |title=Gordon Bennett Trophy (1920) |publisher=Scribd |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1914 race was to have been held at Reims between 19 September and 28 September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1914/1914%20-%200389.html "The Gordon Bennett Aviation Race"][[Flight International|''Flight'']] 11 April 1914&lt;/ref&gt; but was cancelled due to the outbreak of the First World War. There was no contest in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%200720.html "No Gordon Bennett Contests This Year"][[Flight International|''Flight'']] 9 May 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

===1909===
[[File:Curtiss France.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Glenn Curtiss]] in his Curtiss No. 2 aircraft]]
The selection trial for the French team was held on the first day of the Grande Semaine d'Aviation.  Hampered by gusty winds and rain which turned the grass flying-field to glutinous mud, many of the twenty entrants were unable to take off and none managed to complete the necessary two laps. [[Eugène Lefebvre]], flying [[Wright Model A|Wright biplane]] put up the best performance, nearly completing the course; [[Louis Blériot]], who had managed to fly about 2.5&amp;nbsp;km in a [[Blériot XI]]  put up the next-best performance.  It was decided that the third place would be given on the basis of performance in the speed competition to be held that afternoon, and was taken by [[Hubert Latham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200517.html|title=Rheims Aviation Meeting|date=28 August 1909  |page=519  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wrights themselves had passed on an invitation to compete at Reims, though it seemed awkward since the Gordon Bennett Trophy was crowned with a large replica of a Wright Flyer. The [[Aero Club of America]], which had sponsored the Scientific American trophy won by Curtiss a year earlier, turned to him. His aircraft was not as well developed as the Wright machines and while it was more maneuverable than the European aircraft, it was not nearly as fast. Despite this disadvantage, Curtiss won in 15 minutes and 50.4 seconds. Blériot finished second place with a time of 15 minutes and 56.2 seconds, 5.8 seconds more than Curtiss.&lt;ref name='history'/&gt;&lt;ref name='cof'/&gt;

===1910===
The 1910 competition was held at the [[Belmont Park]] racetrack in [[New York (state)|New York]] as the culminating event of a week-long aviation meet.  The 5&amp;nbsp;km course marked out for the competition attracted strong criticism from the competing pilots.  [[Alfred Leblanc]], captain of the French team, described it as a death-trap because of the obstacles which would hinder any pilot trying to make an emergency landing, and a tight turn less than 30&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) from one of the grandstands was christened "Dead Man's Corner" by the press.  However, the race proceeded as planned.&lt;ref&gt;Villard 1987, pp. 58-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Contestants were permitted to start at any time during a seven-hour period on the day of the race.  Claude Grahame-White was first to take off at 8:42, flying a Blériot XI powered by a 100&amp;nbsp;hp [[Gnome Omega|Gnome Double Omega]] and completing his first lap in 3 minutes 15 seconds. He was followed by [[Alec Ogilvie]] flying a [[Wright Model R]] at 9:08 and Alfred Leblanc at 9:20. Leblanc, who was the chief pilot for the Blériot company, was flying a 100&amp;nbsp;hp Blériot XI differing slightly from Grahame-White's, with a different propeller and a reduced wingspan. Leblanc's aircraft was clearly faster: after four laps his time was 1 minute 20 seconds better than Grahame-White's and he completed his nineteenth lap after 52 minutes 49.6 seconds in the air, Grahame -White having completed the 20 lap course in 1 hour 1 minute 4.47 seconds.  However half-way round the last lap Leblanc's engine stopped, either through fuel shortage or the breakage of a fuel line, and he had to make a forced landing, colliding with a telegraph pole but fortunately escaping serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;Villard 1987, pp.84-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Alec Ogilvie had been forced to land by engine problems after 13 laps after a delay of 54 minutes he took off again and eventually completed the course in a total time of 2h 26m 36.6s, good enough to gain him third place.

[[Walter Brookins]], flying the [[Wright Model R|Wright "Baby Grand"]], was about to take off when Leblanc crashed, and decided to fly to the scene of the accident to see if he could help.  However shortly after takeoff a connecting rod broke and his aircraft was wrecked in the subsequent forced landing.  Brooking was unhurt.&lt;ref&gt;Villart 1987, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hubert Latham]] took off at 10:59, but his attempt was plagued by engine failures, and he spent about four hours on the ground making repairs, eventually completing the course in 5h 48m 53s, an average speed of {{convert|17.8|mph|kph|disp=flip|abbr=on}}.

Shortly before the latest permitted takeoff time  [[John Armstrong Drexel|John Drexel]] and [[John Moisant]], both flying Blériot IXs, started their attempts. Drexel was forced to retire after seven laps, while Moisant completed the course in 1h 57s 44.8s after landing more than once with engine problems, securing second place.&lt;ref&gt;Villard 1987, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200919.html The American International Meeting] [[Flight International|''Flight]] 5 November 1910 p. 917&lt;/ref&gt;

===1911===
[[File:Weymann-Gordon Bennett-2.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Charles Weymann standing in front of his Nieuport monoplane]]
The 1911 race was held on 1 July at the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]]'s flying field at [[RAF Eastchurch|Eastchurch]], and attracted a crowd of around 10,000 spectators despite the comparative remoteness to the location.  Both France and Britain entered three pilots with three reserves, the British entries including a [[Bristol Prier monoplane]] to be flown by [[Grahame Gilmour]], but this was not ready in time to compete.  The competition coincided with the [[Circuit of Europe]] air race, as a result of which the British pilot [[James Valentine (aviator)|James Valentine]] withdrew: however [[Charles Weymann]], the sole American representative chose to withdraw from the Circuit of Europe to take part in the Gordon Bennett competition.

The start of the competition was delayed by poor weather, and the first competitor [[Gustav Hamel]], did not take off until 2:50 in the afternoon. Flying a [[Blériot XXIII]] monoplane which had been modified shortly before the race by having its wings cut down by about a metre (39&amp;nbsp;in), he misjudged his first turn and
crashed at high speed, astonishingly escaping without serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;Villard 1987, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  At 3:00 Louis Chevalier, flying a [[Nieuport II]] powered by a {{convert|28|hp|kW}} Nieuport engine. After five laps his engine began showing signs of trouble and he was eventually forced to land after eleven laps, damaging his undercariage.  He then resumed his attempt flying a replacement aircraft, but this also suffered an engine failure shortly after takeoff and he was forced to withdraw.  Weymann took off at 3:45, impressing spectators by the steepness of his banked turns, shortly followed at 4:47 by Alec Ogilvie, flying the aircraft in which he had finished third the previous year, now powered by a 50&amp;nbsp;hp N.E.C engine.  Last to take off were [[Edouard Nieuport]] and [[Alfred Leblanc]].  Leblanc was recovering from influenza and, probably made cautious by Hamel's crash, did not take the corners as sharply as Weymann, and Nieuport's aircraft, with a less powerful engine that Weyman's, was clearly not in serious competition.

===1912===
The 1912 race was held on 9 September in Clearing, Illinois.  The race was 30 laps around an elliptical {{convert|4.14|miles|km|abbr=on}} course, for a total distance of {{convert|124.8|miles|km|abbr=on}}. As none of the U.S. aircraft available to fly that day could exceed {{convert|78|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and with Védrines practice flights averaging far better, a French win was expected prior to the start of the race.&lt;ref name=Keokuk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cairo/&gt;

[[file:חזי בצלאל עם נשיא רואנדה פול קגאמה.jpg|thumb|Hezi Bezalel with Rwandan President Paul Kagame]]

'''Hezi Bezalel''' (born 1951) is an Israeli [[businessman]]. He is active mostly in Israel, the US, Britain, India, and various countries in Africa. He serves as the Honorary Consul of Rwanda in Israel.

==Biography==
Bezalel was born in [[Basra]], Iraq and moved with his family to Israel when he was 5 years old. The family settled in the Or Yehuda Absorption Camp, and later on moved to Ramat Gan.
During his military service, he served as a tank commander in the [[Yom Kippur War]]. He later began his Economics studies at the Tel Aviv University. Following the completion of his M.A in Economics, he began teaching at the Tel Aviv University as well as the Ben Gurion University in Be'er Sheva. He worked as Prof. Haim Ben Shachar's teaching assistant and initiated his PhD studies in London.  

He moved from Israel to [[Kenya]] in the 1980s, where he established an investment bank in Nairobi, on behalf of a British investment group. In Africa, he became involved in investment banking, project implementation and financing and other businesses. He developed personal relationships with various stakeholders in Africa, such as the President of Rwanda, [[Paul Kagame]], Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni|Yoweri Moseveni]], who conducted a large scale economic liberalization process in the country, supported by the [[World Bank]]. In 1994, he established the "Efforte" holding group, that held real estate, mining, agriculture, aviation and other assets. 

In 1995, he purchased the failed Ugandan investment bank [[Nile Bank Limited]], transforming it to a successful and lucrative institution. The Nile Bank was sold to [[Barclays]] in 2006, gaining a large profit for Bezalel who was the main shareholder of the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsroom.barclays.com/r/901/barclays_strengthens_its_position_in_africa_with|title=Barclays {{!}} Barclays strengthens its position in Africa with acquisition of Nile Bank in Uganda {{!}} EDF Media Centre|website=www.newsroom.barclays.com|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bezalel is the founder and managing partner of The Marathon Group, an international investment group, that deals mainly in investment banking and international trade. The Group deals with projects in telecommunications, energy, infrastructure, agriculture and technology. It holds permanent offices and branches in the UK, US, South Africa, Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, India, Ethiopia and other countries in Africa and Asia.
Bezalel is the founder and owner of Carnie Capital, a global investment group based in Israel, operating in over 30 countries globally.

Bezalel is a close and personal friend of Rwandan President, [[Paul Kagame]]. A story published in the Israeli [[Maariv (newspaper)]], it is noted that "...Bezalel is considered an entrance gate for Israeli companies interested in working in Rwanda, and in getting in touch with the local government..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maariv.co.il/news/world/Article-525242|title=לצאת מהקבר: רואנדה מתאוששת מהצלקות ומסתכלת לעתיד|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, he acquired the Israeli Telecom company 018-Xphone. In January 2015, the company won a government tender to become Israel's 6th Cellular service provider. In 2016, it was announced that 018-Xphone will partner with local cellular provider [[Cellcom (Israel)]] to provide its cellular service in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-cellcom-and-xfone-sign-network-sharing-deal-1001139100|title=Cellcom and Xfone sign network sharing deal - Globes English|website=Globes|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, it was announced that Bezalel is leading a $300M investment fund in African businesses, together with the UK based Duet Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-hezi-bezalel-duet-group-raise-africa-investment-fund-1001088459|title=Hezi Bezalel, Duet Group raise Africa investment fund - Globes English|website=Globes|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He established the UAV and sensor technology company Meteor Aerospace together with [[Itzhak Nissan]], the former CEO of [[Israel Aerospace Industries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-meteor-aerospace-unveils-unmanned-warfare-capabilities-1001104953|title=Israel's Meteor Aerospace unveils unmanned craft - Globes English|website=Globes|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bezalel serves as the Honorary Consul of Rwanda in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2014-07-24/77079/|title=Mushikiwabo tips Rwandan students in Israel on agric|last=Tashoa|first=Athan|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has previously served as the Honorary Consul of Uganda. He also serves as the chairperson of the Israel-Ethiopia Friendship Organization. He is the chairman of Mountaintop Productions, an Israeli-American international film production company, founded in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mntntop.com/|title=Mountaintop Productions|website=Mountaintop Productions|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bezalel currently resides in Israel.

==Location==

The subdistrict runs from [[Shennan Road]] at [[SEG Plaza]] near [[Huaqiang Road Station]] of the [[Shenzhen Metro]] for {{convert|1|km}} north to the Pavilion Hotel.
It is at the spine of a shopping district, with cross streets Zhenzhong Road ({{lang|zh|振中路}}), Zhenhua Road ({{lang|zh|振华路}}) and Zhenxing Road ({{lang|zh|振兴路}}). Huafa Road ({{lang|zh|华发路}}) is immediately parallel to the east with Yannan Road ({{lang|zh|燕南路}}) further away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/knows/search?q=%E5%8D%8E%E5%BC%BA%E5%8C%97&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;pq=%E5%8D%8E%E5%BC%BA%E5%8C%97&amp;sc=8-3&amp;sp=-1&amp;sk=&amp;mkt=zh-cn |title=华强北 - Bing 网典 |publisher=Bing.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2015-04-30/043931778371.shtml|title=华强北会是中国硅谷吗？|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central area of the district is along Huaqiang Road ({{lang|zh|华强路}}), a busy pedestrian street which the district is named after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcmap.com.cn/guangdong/futianqu_huaqiangbeijiedao.html|title=华强北街道介绍_广东深圳市福田区华强北街道地名网|website=www.tcmap.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locale ==

The area is characterized by tree-lined streets with wide ({{convert|5|to|20|m}}) footpaths. Huaqiangbei is famous for its variety of electronics and clothing shops, though it has a notorious [[history]] of selling counterfeit and smuggled goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.tuxi.com.cn/dr/t/nth/nthjae.html|title=华强北手机批发市场见闻：水货、翻新机揭秘 - 突袭资讯|first=|last=IE=edge|website=news.tuxi.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sznews.com/zhuanti/node_113326.htm|title=华强北你还好吗？_深圳新闻网|website=www.sznews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.china.com.cn/2015-03/24/content_35140961.htm|title=华强北阵痛求变_新闻中心_中国网|first=|last=李林旭|website=news.china.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sznews.com/zhuanti/content/2012-08/13/content_7072822.htm|title=华强北“山寨手机”变身正规军_深圳新闻_深圳新闻网|first=|last=林毓瑾|website=www.sznews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inflatable rats''', or '''union rats''', are giant inflatables in the shape of cartoon rats, commonly used in the [[United States]] by protesting or striking [[trade union]]s. They serve as a sign of opposition against employers or nonunion contractors, and are intended to call public attention to companies employing nonunion labor. The practice dates from the 1990s.

==History==
Unions have been using them for years against companies that employ nonunion labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | url = http://www.workforce.com/section/00/article/24/15/94.html 
  | title =Unions' Inflatable Rat an Endangered Species 
  | date = 2005-09-09 | accessdate = 2008-07-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers have filed lawsuits charging that the use of the giant inflatable rats constituted unlawful [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]], and some courts have agreed. However, in May 2011, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) held that union use of an inflatable monster rat is not considered an unlawful activity when directed at a secondary employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | url =http://www.natlawreview.com/article/obama-board-and-giant-rat-nlrb-holds-union-use-inflatable-monster-rat-does-not-constitute--0  
  | title =The Obama Board and the Giant Rat: NLRB Holds That Union Use of Inflatable Monster Rat Does Not Constitute Unlawful Activity Directed At A Secondary Employer
  | date = 2011-05-28 | accessdate = 2011-05-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in Sheet Metal Workers Local 15, 356 NLRB No. 162  (2011) ruled that the inflatable rat did not constitute a [[signal picket]], but instead, constituted [[symbolic speech]] which is not subject to [[secondary boycott]] rules. This holding allows the union not only to place the inflatable rats at neutral entrances, but also to place them at locations where the picketed company is absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  |author=Lees, Judd H.

  |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate= 2011-08-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of using inflatable rats in union protests may have something to do with the usage of the word "[[rat]]" to refer to nonunion contractors. 

==Appearance==
[[File:Giant-inflatable-rat_crop.jpg|thumb||Inflatable rat in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]]]
While the inflatable rat sometimes varies in appearance and size, it generally features large teeth and grotesque features, particularly a scabby belly,&lt;ref name="Vice" &gt;{{Cite web
  |title=The History of Scabby the Rat
  |author= Sarah Jaffe 
  |url=https://www.vice.com/read/the-history-of-scabby-the-rat
  |publisher=vice.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the nickname of "scab" that is given to [[strikebreaker]]s. Many unions have nicknamed the inflatable rat "Scabby the Rat".

==Origin==
Chuck Salter, of fastcompany.com, dates the usage of inflatable union rats to 1991, when Mike O' Connor of a [[Plainfield, Illinois]] balloon and searchlight firm made a rat due to a request from two Chicago bricklayers union organizers, Don Newton and Ken Lambert.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;  {{As of|2003}}, the rats ranged from 6 to 30 feet tall, but 12 feet is the most popular height due to [[local law]]s limiting the height of inflatable objects on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | date = December 2003 | accessdate = 2008-07-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The inflatable rat appeared in the UK for the first time in the [[Grangemouth_Refinery#Ineos_industrial_disputes|2013 Grangemouth Oil Refinery dispute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4739">'''JetForm''' was the name of a Canadian software manufacturer created by four consultants (Wayne Hall, Bob Allum, Tom Hicks, and John Gleed) that was based out of [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] and an electronic form software product of the same name.

JetForm once had major offices in the [[United States]], various countries in Europe, [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. It was founded in 1982, and was listed under [[NASDAQ]] as FORMF, under the [[Pacific Stock Exchange]] as JTF, and the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] as JFM.

==History==
The company was originally named Indigo Software and was solely a software consulting firm. Indigo Software did work for the [[Government of Canada|Canadian Federal Government]] and [[IBM]] (as the maintainer of an IBM CAD software product); among other clients.  One significant government project resulted in an electronic forms product being created: iFiller, iPrint, et al.

With [[Microsoft]]'s release of [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.11]], Indigo Software did a major enhancement to the forms software and re-branded it JetForm.  The JetForm forms product was very successful, and Indigo Software's consulting work also began to focus on work associated with the JetForm software. Given the popularity of the forms software, Indigo Software made a decision to rename the company JetForm.

Its [[eponym]]ous series of products directly competed against other electronic forms software, such as [[Delrina]]'s [[PerForm]], and [[FormFlow]] products.

In September, 1996, [[Symantec]], which had bought Delrina the previous year, sold their Electronic Forms Division to JetForm. JetForm continued to develop the FormFlow series of products under its own name.

Around this time, JetForm bought the [[naming rights]] to the [[Ottawa Baseball Stadium]], naming it "JetForm Park".

On September 13, 2001, JetForm changed its name to Accelio. Accelio was acquired by [[Adobe Systems]] in February 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200202/200202accelioacq.html | title=Accelio acquisition press release | accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The electronic forms products were officially retired in 2004. Adobe marketed JetForm as Adobe Central Output Server [http://www.adobe.com/products/server/outputserver/], without any major changes. Adobe's successor for the JetForm technology was released June 7, 2007, as Adobe LiveCycle Enterprise Suite (ES)[http://www.adobe.com/products/livecycle/], part of the [[Adobe LiveCycle]] suite. The product was renamed again in April 9, 2009 to Adobe Central / Central Pro Output Server and reached its end of [https://www.adobe.com/support/products/enterprise/eol/eol_matrix.html#6 Extended Support] on June 30, 2016.  

JetForm Rises Again, In 2007 two of the original founders Tom Hicks, Wayne Hall and four of the core software developers of JetForm Central came together to build a new enterprise class document designer, merge engine, presentation and delivery system. The software is called DocOrigin (a play off the Origin of Documents). DocOrigin was first released in 2009 and in 2013 version 3.0 was released.

==JetForm Software==

'''JetForm Design''' allowed for routing and tracking in workflow systems, on-screen form creation, and access to [[SQL]] and [[ODBC]]-compliant databases. '''JetForm Filler''' was used for completing on-screen forms. JetForm also developed the XML form format [https://web.archive.org/web/20091223030550/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/xml/index_arch.html "XFA"], which was later adopted by Adobe into its PDF software.

One of the Indigo Forms software's innovations when it was introduced was its ability to have its forms installed into Laserjet font cartridges. This meant that the product only had to send forms data to the printer; since the form was already encoded in the font cartridge. Given the slow printer interfaces used at that time, this greatly reduced print times.

'''John Peter Boden''' (born 1 June 1961), often shortened to '''Johnnie Boden''',&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt; is an entrepreneur and founder of [[Boden (clothing)|Boden]], a catalogue clothing company, in 1991. As of 2014, Boden is worth £300&amp;nbsp;million.

== Early life ==
John Peter Boden was born on 1 June 1961{{where|date=September 2018}}. His father&lt;ref name="Info "/&gt; was a [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] who changed careers to become a farmer.&lt;ref name="Info "/&gt; John Boden was educated at Hawtreys preparatory school, then [[Eton College]], and read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|philosophy, politics, and economics]] (PPE) at [[Oriel College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Info "/&gt;

== Career ==
At 16, he edited the menswear section of the 1977 ''Harpers &amp; Queen Teenage Edition'', but Boden's father was "dismissive", calling it a "stupid job".&lt;ref name="T"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/9935907/Johnnie-Bodens-fashion-brand-is-the-love-of-his-life.html | title=Johnnie Boden's fashion brand is the love of his life | work=The Telegraph | date=17 March 2013 | accessdate=24 March 2014 |author1=Hopper, David |author2=Vallance, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving university, Boden became a stockbroker with Barclays Merchant Bank,&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; and [[SG Warburg Securities]].&lt;ref name="ES"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/go-johnnie-go-boden-is-a-500m-business-success-story-6513083.html | title=Go, Johnnie, go Boden is a £500m business success story | work=The Evening Standard | date=13 September 2010 | accessdate=24 March 2014 | author=Prynn, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; spending some time at [[Wall Street]].&lt;ref name="Info "/&gt; He was a stockbroker for five years.&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt; However, he "loathed" the job,&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt; and was "ill-suited&amp;nbsp;– really bad at it".&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; He ceased working as a stockbroker when he received an inheritance from a childless uncle.&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; He dabbled in other jobs, as a [[publican]] and teacher&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; in London.&lt;ref name="Info "/&gt; Boden enjoyed teaching, though disliked the low salaries.&lt;ref name="T "/&gt;

=== Boden ===

He founded [[Boden (clothing)|Boden]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt; launching his first catalogue featuring pictures drawn by a friend,&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; with eight menswear products available&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt; modelled by his friends.&lt;ref name="Info "/&gt; In 1992, Boden realised women were a better target for clothes, and launched women's clothing, followed by children's clothing,&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt; under the name 'Mini Boden', in 1996.&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; However, it took "at least 10 years" for the finances to settle down due to robbery, and other circumstances; which ultimately led his inheritance to be gone in under three years.&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; The firm is known for its "bright prints".&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt;

His foundation of Boden has enabled Boden to amass a personal fortune of £300mil (2014), placing him at 368 on the [[Sunday Times Rich List]].&lt;ref name="List"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://features.thesundaytimes.co.uk/rocj;ost/2013/live/richlist/view/group6/1/rank/-/boden#list | title=The Sunday Times Rich List | work=The Sunday Times | date=21 April 2013 | accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jose Yao Campos''' (1922 – May 1, 2016), also known by his Chinese name '''Yao Cho Diat''', was a [[Filipino-Chinese]] businessman best known as the founder of United Laboratories, and as the first of [[Ferdinand Marcos]]' closest cronies to enter into a settlement deal with the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG).

Successfully becoming a major player in the local Pharmaceuticals manufacturing industry by cofounding UNILAB after [[World War II]], he became early supporter of Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who tapped him as a "Financial Advisor."  In 1986, the Presidential Commission on Good Government cited him for having served as a "front man" for various "ill-gotten" wealth, including $52.5 million of real estate representing the most prominent [[Marcos Mansions]].  He then became the first of the [[Marcos cronies]] to make a deal with the PCGG in exchange for immunity from suit.  By the time he died in 2016, Yao Campos' family had become one of the Philippines' most powerful business clans, with UNILAB helmed by his firstborn, Joy Campos Hess and her son, Clinton Hess; his eldest son Joselito Yao founding condiments company Nutri-Asia and occupying top positions in Del Monte Philippines and the Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation; and his youngest child Jeffrey running Greenfields Development Corporation.

== Early life and move to the Philippines ==
Campos was born Yao Cho Diat in Ha-ngo-po, a village in Jinjing Town, [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]], part of modern-day [[Quanzhou]], China.&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060508" /&gt; He lived there as a youth and was educated in the Chinese classics until he was old enough to be accepted for admission to the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] established by [[Sun Yat-sen]]—an honor which he described as "''the ultimate dream of all patriotic Chinese boys.''"&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt; Instead of allowing him to attend the academy, however, his father sent Yao to [[Quezon province]] in the Philippines, where he would learn business skills from his older brother Yao Shiong Shio, who was already a successful trader.&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060508"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/business-life/2006/05/08/335608/who-will-be-next-taipans |title=Who will be the next taipans? |last=Flores |first=Wilson Lee |date=May 8, 2016 |work=The [[Philippine Star]] |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yao started out as a worker at his brother's buntal hat business before the war, and survived the [[Second World War]] by making his living as a buy-and-sell trader.&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060508" /&gt;

He eventually took "Jose Yao Campos" as his Filipino name.&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/business-life/2006/08/21/354033/pharmaceutical-king146s-little-told-tale |title=The Pharmaceutical King's Little-Told Tale |last=Flores |first=Wilson Lee |date=August 21, 2006 |work=The [[Philippine Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation of UNILAB ==
{{see also|Labor policy in the Philippines}}
Soon after the end of World War II in 1945, Yao Campos partnered with Mariano K. Tan to build a drugstore on Sto. Cristo Street in [[Binondo, Manila]].&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt; (Some sources also mention an American soldier named Robert Horowitz as Yao Campos' partner in charge of production when the drugstore was first built.&lt;ref name="Domenec2017"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Business ethics in action : seeking human excellence in organizations |last=Domènec. |first=Melé, |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=9781137074683 |location=Basingstoke [England] |oclc=891470965}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Describing the beginnings of the company, Yao Campos' brother-in-law and later UNILAB president Howard Q. Dee&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt; later recounted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Unilab started with humble beginnings as a small manufacturing enterprise. Our offices and modest production facilities were located in JY’s residential compound in [[Santa Mesa]]. We literally began as a home industry with no more than 30 employees. With the new monetary policies, in no time, a dozen foreign pharmaceutical companies established large manufacturing facilities. Unilab was the smallest but under the leadership of JY, we developed a game plan like no other. Our strategic planning showed us the way to segment the pharma market with a multi-divisional approach that would enable us to compete on all fronts. The keys were product sourcing and planning, synergism in promotions and distribution outreach."&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1959, after only fourteen years in operation, Yao Campos and Tan, with the help of Yao Campos' brother-in-law Dee, had transformed United Drug into United Laboratories, with the highest share of the Philippine pharmaceuticals market among all the Philippines' local drug manufacturers.&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt; This was attributed to the values Yao Campos was said to have instilled in the company, which admirers described as "the [[Confucianism|Confucian values]] of hard work, frugality, discipline, perseverance, filial piety to parents and ancestors, love of education and delayed personal gratification."&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt;

Under Yao Campos, UNILAB remained a proudly non-unionized company, with a company-initiated Employee Board providing benefits to employees instead of a union negotiating with the company on their behalf.&lt;ref name="Atienza2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt;  Unionization was so much of “a no-no to the owners” of UNILAB that they went as far as to hire a feng shui expert to redesign their corporate headquarters in response to a 1996 incident in which union organizers nearly succeeded in forming a union.&lt;ref name="Atienza2002"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Shrewd Business Tactics |last=Atienza |first=A.T. |year=2002 |isbn=9780595227235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early support of Ferdinand Marcos ==
Campos was an early supporter of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], making campaign contributions as early as Marcos’ first Congressional run in 1946.&lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-23/news/8601210600_1_jose-y-campos-eduardo-cojuangco-ferdinand-marcos |title=Marcos Graft Staggering: Investigators Trace Billions In Holdings |last=Crewdson |first=John |date=March 23, 1986 |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would eventually become one of the closest among Marcos’ cronies, along with [[Danding Cojaungco]] and [[Roberto Benedicto]].&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060508" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326" /&gt;

Although critics of the Marcos administration would later note that [[Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos’ cronies]] managed to make huge fortunes despite not being known as particularly good businessmen, Yao Campos and [[Rolando Gapud]] were often considered the notable exceptions, because of their established business record from before Marcos’ presidency.&lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326" /&gt;

Nevertheless, Marcos’ stint in the legislature allowed him to favor Yao Campos’ business. &lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326"/&gt; Having won as congressman, Marcos was soon made chairman of the House Committee on Commerce and Industry.&lt;ref name="DNDMarcos"&gt;{{Cite web |title="Ferdinand E. Marcos" |last=Department of National Defense |first=Government of the Republic of the Philippines |website=Department of National Defense website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he won a seat in the senate later, he became a member of the Senate Special Committee on Import and Price Controls and on Reparations.&lt;ref name="DNDMarcos" /&gt; This allowed Marcos to make his fortune by selling import licenses to businessmen.&lt;ref name="JariusBondoc20160815"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2016/08/15/1613577/plunder-be-glorified-marcos-libingan |title=Plunder to be Glorified with Marcos at the Libingan |last=Bondoc |first=Jarius |date=August 15, 2016  |work=The [[Philippine Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign benefactor Yao Campos’ company UNILAB was granted exclusive import licences in the Pharmaceuticals industry.&lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326" /&gt;

Because UNILAB’s market dominance turned it into a major supplier of pharmaceuticals for government health programs, Yao Campos found one more way to help build up Ferdinand Marcos during campaigns: by supplying the government with medicine packs branded “Medical Assistance to Rural Communities and Other Sectors” – the acronym for which spelled out “M.A.R.C.O.S.” &lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326" /&gt;

Marcos eventually asked Campos to became godfather to both Imee and Bongbong Marcos.&lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326" /&gt;

== "Front man" for the Marcoses ==
As an early supporter of Marcos, Yao Campos became a Financial advisor to the president.  While it was Roberto Benedicto who helped the Marcoses open a Swiss bank account under the fictitious names "William Saunders" and "Jane Ryan", it was Yao Campos organized 40 different [[Shell corporation|shell companies]] through whose bank accounts the Marcoses could later transfer the Saunders account money, giving them multiple additional layers beneath which to hide their identity.&lt;ref name="DaleRussakoff19860330"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/03/30/the-philippines-anatomy-of-a-looting/620251dc-cffe-46f3-be40-a248f501882c/ |title=The Philippines: Anatomy of a Looting |last=Russakoff |first=Dale |date=March 30, 1986 |work=The [[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served as the Marcoses' "front man| for various assets and properties.&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"&gt;{{cite news|title=Search for Marcos' wealth: Compromising with cronies Philip M. Lustre Jr. |date= February 25, 2016 |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/123667-marcos-cronies-compromise}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely publicized of these properties include the most prominent [[Marcos mansions]]—over P2.5 billion ($52.5 million) worth in real estate located in [[Metro Manila]], [[Rizal province|Rizal]], [[Laguna province|Laguna]], [[Cavite]], [[Bataan]] and [[Baguio City]].&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"&gt;{{cite news|title=Search for Marcos' wealth: Compromising with cronies Philip M.

== PCGG Deal ==
{{see also|Marcos mansions}}
Yao Campos was in Canada in 1986 &lt;ref name ="SethMydans19860522"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/22/world/philippines-seizes-a-big-corporation.html |title=Philippines Seizes a Big Corporation |last=Mydans  |first=Seth |date=May 22, 1986 |work=The [[New York Times]] |access-date=September 28, 2018 |language=en}}PHILIPPINES SEIZES A BIG CORPORATION By SETH MYDANS and SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/ref&gt; when Corazon Aquino’s Revolutionary Government took over the Philippines after the Marcoses were deposed by the EDSA revolution.  He was the first among the Marcos cronies to make a deal with the Aquino government in exchange for immunity from suit,&lt;ref name="SethMydans19860522" /&gt; and the deal he struck with the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG) was one of the agency’s earliest successes.&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"/&gt;

The 1986 settlement involved PhP 250 Million in cash and PhP 2.5 Billion worth of titles to 197 properties in Metro Manila, Rizal, Laguna, Cavite, Bataan, and Baguio—all of which Yao Campos admitted were under his name but actually part of the ill-gotten wealth of Ferdinand Marcos.&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"/&gt;
It also included a building on Efipanio de Los Santos Avenue (EDSA) where [[Imee Marcos]] had an office before the EDSA revolution, which eventually became the headquarters of the PCGG.&lt;ref name="SCMP20130505"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1227453/embarrassment-riches |title=Embarrassment of Riches |date=May 5, 2013 |work=South China Morning Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506033913/http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1227453/embarrassment-riches |archive-date=May 6, 2013 |dead-url=No |publication-place=Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the Marcos family confirmed that the properties surrendered by Yao Campos to the PCGG in 1986 were indeed owned by Ferdinand Marcos, arguing that Yao Campos should not have surrendered them to the government because “''under a constructive trust in favor of the estate of the former president.''”&lt;ref name="RainierAllanRonda20171122"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2007/11/22/28940/fm-heirs-want-cronyrsquos-assets-returned |title=FM heirs want crony’s assets returned |last=Ronda |first=Rainier Allan |date=November 22, 2007 |work=The Philippine Star |access-date=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life, death, and family empire ==
After the [[People Power Revolution]], Yao Campos earned a reputation as the most media-shy of all the Philippines’ taipans.&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"/&gt;  By the time Yao Campos died on Labor Day, May 1, 2016, UNILAB had become  the Philippines’ largest drug-manufacturing company, helmed by his eldest child, Joy Campos Hess and her son, Clinton Hess.&lt;ref name="Town&amp;Country2016"/&gt;

The rest of Yao Campos' children have also become dominant forces in their own industries, making the Yao Campos family one of the Philippines’ most powerful business clans.  Yao Campos’ eldest son and namesake, Joselito D. Yao Camoos, left UNILAB to found  the condiments company Nutri-Asia,&lt;ref name="Town&amp;Country2016"/&gt; and is now also vice chairman of [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]] Philippines, and chairman of [[Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Town&amp;Country2016"/&gt;

Yao Campos’ son, Jeffrey D.Y. Campos, in turn runs the real estate holdings company Greenfields Development.&lt;ref name="Town&amp;Country2016"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=November 8, 2016 |title=From Aboitiz to Zobel: The Most Powerful Families of the Philippines |url=https://www.townandcountry.ph/people/money-power/the-most-influential-families-in-the-philippines |magazine=Town &amp; Country Philippines |access-date=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julián Ganzábal''' (born 25 August 1946) is a former professional [[tennis]] player from Argentina.

==Biography==
Ganzábal, the top ranked Argentine player on tour until the emergence of [[Guillermo Vilas]], first played [[Davis Cup]] tennis for [[Argentina Davis Cup team|Argentina]] in 1967.

He defeated two-time [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] winner [[Fred Stolle]] at [[Swiss Open (tennis)|Gstaad]] in 1969, but didn't go deep into a [[Grand Prix tennis circuit|Grand Prix]] tournament until 1972, when he reached the semi-finals at home in [[ATP Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]]. Further semi-finals came at [[ATP Florence|Florence]] in 1974 and Berlin in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/tournaments/men's-tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1010002360|title=ITF Tennis - Pro Circuit - Florence - 06 May - 12 May 1974|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]]|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/tournaments/men's-tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1010002042|title=ITF Tennis - Pro Circuit - Berlin - 14 June - 20 June 1976|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]]|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a doubles player he partnered with Davis Cup teammate [[Lito Álvarez]] to finish runner-up at [[Dutch Open (tennis)|Hilversum]] in 1974. They were beaten in the final by another Argentine pairing of [[Tito Vázquez]] and Vilas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://leiden.courant.nu/issue/NLC/1974-07-22/edition/0/page/10|title=Ondanks vermoeidheid zege Guillermo Vilas|date=22 July 1974|work=[[Trouw]]|publisher=22 July 1974|page=10|language=Dutch|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his best on clay, Ganzábal reached the third round of the [[1976 French Open]], with wins over [[Iván Molina]] and [[Trey Waltke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/72555353/|title=Paris|date=3 June 1976|work=[[The Pantagraph]]|page=24|accessdate=24 December 2015|location=Bloomington, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would remain his best performance in a Grand Slam tournament. Soon after the French Open, he reached his highest career [[ATP Rankings|ranking]] of 68 in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tenniscircus.com/il-museo-del-tennis-presenta/il-tennis-un-affare-di-famiglia-1parte-brothers-in-tennis/|title=Il tennis: un affare di famiglia (1°parte) - Brothers in Tennis|date=19 June 2014|publisher=tenniscircus.com|language=Italian|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganzábal ended his Davis Cup career in 1975, after 13 ties for his country. He finished with a 16/9 record overall, which included 14 singles wins.

Following retirement he trained his younger brother [[Alejandro Ganzábal]], who was also a professional tennis player. The brothers are now major investors in Argentina's real estate industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/738865-alianza-para-levantar-edificios-de-lujo|title=Alianza para levantar edificios de lujo|last=Sainz|first=Alfredo|date=15 September 2005|work=[[La Nación]]|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[East India Company]]''' controlled most of the subcontinent of [[India]]. No other company in history has ever governed so many people. With the exception of [[China]], the E.I.C. controlled a larger population by the nineteenth century than any government of any country in the world.

==About the list==

The following list of '''East India Company directors''' is taken from the "Alphabetical List of Directors of the [[East India Company]] from 1758 to 1858", compiled by C.H. &amp; D. Philips and published in the ''[[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]]'', October 1941. This list has been compiled from manuscript records, in particular the Court Minutes and Home Miscellaneous Series, volume 764, at the [[India Office]], amplified and checked by information mainly taken from the "[[Annual Register]], the Asiatic Annual."

==How to read the list==
"The figures indicate the year of election to the Court of Directors and unless the name of the month in any particular year is given, the month is assumed to be that of April. It is important to remember that throughout the period the year of office was from April to the following April. When a span of years is shown the election dates given are inclusive."

"An asterisk placed after a year indicates that the director concerned was elected deputy chairman for that year, two asterisks, that he was chosen chairman, three, that he was first elected deputy and later in the same year appointed chairman. The abbreviations d., disq., respectively stand for died, disqualified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11238">'''Management accounting in supply chains''' (or supply chain controlling, SCC) is part of the [[supply chain management]] concept. This necessitates planning, monitoring, management and information about logistics and manufacturing processes throughout the [[value chain]]. The goal of management accounting in supply chains is optimizing these processes. This strategy focuses on supporting management.

== Overview ==
As value chains become more complex due to globalization, supply chain management (SCM) has become increasingly relevant in theory and practice. SCM encompasses extensive management-control tasks. This range of subjects is summarized by the definition of supply-chain controlling. The transfer of existing [[management control system]]s (MCM) to the SCM is insufficient because these primarily aim at internal (company) needs. Beyond past-oriented, financial figures there must also be future-oriented measurement; a number of approaches exist in the literature.

== Definition ==
Supply-chain management (SCM) has become increasingly relevant in theory and practice in light of more-complex supply chains. The SCM performs extensive operational tasks, including supply-chain controlling. Seuring&lt;ref&gt;Seuring, S. (2006): "Supply chain controlling: summarizing recent developments in German literature", in: ''[[Supply Chain Management: An International Journal]]'', 11/1 (2006), P. 10-14.&lt;/ref&gt; transfers the three main concepts of German supply chain-controlling literature into the specific demands of SCM:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Supply-chain controlling concept
|-
! Criteria !! Rationality-oriented !! Coordination-oriented !! Information-oriented
|-
| Specific problem || Ensuring rationality of supply-chain management || Assuring and maintaining coordination and flexibility in supply chain management || Decision-related information
|-
| Direct controlling objective || Balancing task-related and staff-related bottlenecks
|| System building and coordination of planning and control and providing information throughout the supply chain
|| Implementing of supply-chain-wide information systems
Providing problem-specific information to all participants in the supply chain
|-
| Indirect controlling objective || Performance-objective system || Profit (efficiency, short- and long-term profit)|| Profit and liquidity objectives
|}

The rationality-oriented approach of supply-chain controlling coordinates all participants in the supply chain to improve performance. Common management systems and instruments for performance measurement are developed, enabling guidance for individual companies and the entire supply chain. The coordination-oriented approach supports the supply-chain leadership. Organizational objectives include the selection of strategic partners, the distribution of tasks among companies, process management and ensuring the provision of information to all participants. The information-oriented supply-chain controlling concept emphasizes providing partners with relevant information for decision-making. An efficient reporting structure must be implemented, including strategic and operative organizations in the system and their technical aspects.

== Requirements ==
A requirement for the supply chain is the support of cooperating companies, ensuring future cooperation; companies must focus on common tools and targets. For this, an understanding of processes within the participating companies is indispensable. Information exchange (including sensitive data) within a supply chain is necessary to ensure its control, with coordination among in-house information systems. The requirements for management accounting in supply chains are significantly higher than the provision of key figures, but this is a fundamental task.

== Tasks and functions ==
The tasks and functions of controlling may be transferred to management accounting in supply chains, supplemented by a cross-company approach. However, the past-oriented aspects of the traditional concept are inappropriate. Due to the strategic importance of supply-chain management, forward-looking control requirements must be taken into account. Because of the complexity of a supply chain, a focus on interface management is necessary. In the literature, several tasks and functions are defined. Management accounting in supply chains has the following features:
* Planning
* Monitoring and control
* Information supply
* Coordination
* Rationality and reflection

== Aims ==
Because of different controlling directions, in management accounting of supply chains different aims are pursued and influence each other. Again, the challenge is the cross-company factor. Independent companies must agree on a common strategy for the SCM and define common aims. Two types of aims exist: direct and indirect.

=== {{anchor|Direct aims}}Direct ===
Direct aims relate to the support of SCM and controlling. This ensures logistical processes between parties in a supply chain or the introduction of a common performance-measurement system for verification of lead times.

=== {{anchor|Indirect aims}}Indirect ===
Company-wide, generalized aims may be pursued with management accounting in supply chains. Examples are competitiveness, expanding cooperation, growth, market development and greater customer orientation.

== Instruments ==
Management accounting in supply chains draws on modified traditional instruments of managerial accounting to accomplish cross-company objectives. There are two measuring instruments: the supply-chain map&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, T.; Cooper, M. (2003): “Strategic Supply Chain Mapping Approaches”; in: Journal of Business Logistics, Vol.24/2, 37–64.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[supply-chain operations reference]] (SCOR).&lt;ref&gt;Poluha, R. (2007): “Application of the SCOR Model in Supply Chain Management”, Youngstown, New York 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Supply chain scorecard}}Supply-chain scorecard ===
The basic model of the [[balanced scorecard]] (BSC) was introduced by Kaplan and Norton&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R.; Norton, D. (1992): "The Balanced Scorecard - Measures that Drive Performance", Harvard Business Review, Feb. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992. The BSC aims to achieve a balance between non-financial and financial measures. To use the scorecard in a cross-company context, several modifications of content and structure are necessary. The BSC consists of four generic perspectives, which are geared to the individual company. According to this, a generally accepted framework does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, P.; Speh, T. (2000): “Using the Balanced Scorecard to measure supply chain performance”, in: Journal of Business Logistics, Vol. 21/1, P. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; From a common strategy, the supply-chain scorecard (SCS) maps cross-company measures. Brewer and Speh note that focusing on the supply chain requires four perspectives:&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, P.; Speh, T. (2000): “Using the Balanced Scorecard to measure supply chain performance”, in: Journal of Business Logistics, Vol. 21/1, P. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Financial benefits
* Supply chain-management (SCM) goals
* SCM improvement
* End customer benefits
Independent of perspective, each should include internal and cross-company measures.

=== {{anchor|Cross-company activity based costing}}Cross-company activity-based costing ===
[[Activity-based costing]] is a model to assign indirect costs into direct ones.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, P. (1999): “Management Challenges of the 21st Century.” New York: Harper Business.&lt;/ref&gt; To use this model in the context of supply chains, there must be consistent defined and delimited cost and performance data. Since many companies participate in more than one supply chain, standardization across the sector is beneficial. Compatibility of information technology is important for improved data transfer, so manual entry is limited and high availability guaranteed. Several changes result from cross-company activity-based costing:&lt;ref&gt;Decker, H.C.; Van Goor, A.R. (2000): ““Supply chain management and management accounting: a case study of activity-based costing”, International Journal of Logistics: Research and Applications, Vol. 3 No. 1, pp. 41-52.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Determination of supply-chain efficiency (aggregate of cost and performance data)
* Detailed cost analysis (for decisions)
* Process benchmarking between supply-chain members
* Realization of target costs

=== {{anchor|Supply chain performance measurement system}}Supply-chain performance-measurement system ===
A primary task of management accounting in supply chains is performance measurement. The key elements of strategic goals include the measurement of resources, output and flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;Beamon, B.M. (1999): “Measuring supply chain Performance“, in: International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, Vol. 19 Iss: 3, P. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Efficient resource management is critical to profitability; without an acceptable output, customers will turn to other supply chains. In a changing environment, supply chains must adapt.&lt;ref&gt;Beamon, B.M. (1999): “Measuring supply chain Performance“, in: International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, Vol. 19 Iss: 3, P. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;
Measures for resource performance include total costs, distribution costs, manufacturing costs, measures of inventory and [[rate of return]].&lt;ref&gt;Beamon, B.M. (1999): “Measuring supply chain Performance“, in: International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, Vol. 19 Iss: 3, P. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of performance measures are numbers of items produced, time required to produce, customer satisfaction and product quality (which is difficult to express numerically). Reductions in  back orders, increased customer satisfaction and the ability to accommodate demand variations are advantages associated with flexibility.

'''''McDonald's Corporation v Steel &amp; Morris''''' [1997] EWHC QB 366, known as "the '''McLibel case'''", was an English [[lawsuit]] for [[libel]] filed by [[McDonald's|McDonald's Corporation]] against [[environmentalism|environmental]] activists Helen Steel and David Morris (often referred to as "The McLibel Two") over a factsheet critical of the company. Each of two [[hearing (law)|hearings]] in English courts found some of the leaflet's contested claims to be libellous and others to be true. The partial nature of the victory, the [[David and Goliath|David-and-Goliath]] nature of the case, and the drawn-out litigation embarrassed McDonald's.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The original case lasted nearly ten years which, according to the [[BBC]], made it the longest-running libel case in English history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=McLibel pair get police payout | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/820786.stm | date=5 July 2000}} {{cite news  | title='McLibel' pair in fresh court bid | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3632944.stm | date=7 September 2004}} {{cite news  | title=McLibel: Longest case in English history | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4266741.stm | date=15 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's announced it did not plan to collect the £40,000 it was awarded by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McDonald's lets McLibel case rest |publisher=AP |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071997/biz_mclibel.html |date=19 July 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006063257/http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071997/biz_mclibel.html |archivedate=6 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the decision, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled in ''Steel &amp; Morris v United Kingdom'' the pair had been denied a fair trial, in breach of Article 6 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (right to a fair trial) and their conduct should have been protected by Article 10 of the Convention, which protects the right to freedom of expression. The court awarded a judgement of £57,000 against the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;Press release issued by the Registrar. "[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=801399&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Chamber Judgment Steel and Morris v. The United Kingdom]" The [[European Court of Human Rights]], 15 February 2005. Received 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's itself was not involved in, or a party to, this action, as applications to the ECHR are independent cases filed against the relevant [[Sovereign state|state]].

In 2013 it was revealed that one of the authors of the "McLibel leaflet", [[Bob Lambert (undercover police officer)|Bob Lambert]], had been an undercover police officer who had infiltrated [[London Greenpeace]]. In 2016 it was revealed that a second undercover police officer, John Dines, had a sexual, romantic relationship with Helen Steel.

[[Franny Armstrong]] and [[Ken Loach]] made a documentary film, ''[[McLibel (film)|McLibel]]'', about the case.

==History==

===Background===
[[London Greenpeace]] was a small environmental campaigning group which existed between 1972 and 2001. They were not affiliated with the larger [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace International]] organisation, which they declined to join as they saw it being too "centralised and mainstream for their tastes".&lt;ref name="second"&gt;pg 388 of ''No Logo''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libel charges===
In 1990, McDonald's brought [[Slander and libel|libel]] proceedings against five London Greenpeace supporters, Paul Gravett, Andrew Clarke and Jonathan O'Farrell, as well as Steel and Morris, for distributing the sheet on the streets of London. This case followed past instances in which McDonald's threatened to sue more than fifty organisations for libel, including [[Channel 4]] television and several major publications. In all such cases, the media outlets settled, and offered apologies for the alleged libel.&lt;ref&gt;"Over the past 15 years, McDonald's has threatened legal action against more than 90 organisations in the U.K., including the [[BBC]], [[Channel 4]], the ''Guardian'', ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', the [[Scottish TUC]], the New Leaf Shop, student newspapers, and a children's theatre group. Even [[Prince Philip]] received a stiff letter. All of them backed down and many formally apologised in court." from "Why Won't British TV Show a Film about McLibel?", Franny Armstrong, 19 June 1998, ''[[The Guardian]]''; as quoted in ''No Logo''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[English defamation law]], the defendant must show that each disparaging statement made is substantively true. This can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Three of the charged individuals (Gravett, Clarke and O'Farrell) chose to apologise as requested by McDonald's. Steel and Morris, however, chose to defend the case.&lt;ref&gt;Skau, S. (2013) McLibel. followthethings.com (www.followthethings.com/mclibel.shtml) Accessed 16 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two were denied [[Legal Aid]], as was policy for libel cases, despite having very limited income.&lt;ref name="jobs"&gt;"For 313 days in court - the longest trial in English history - an unemployed postal worker (Morris) and a community gardener (Steel) went to war with chief executives from the largest food empire in the world." pg 389 of ''No Logo''&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, they had to represent themselves, though they received significant [[pro bono]] assistance. Steel and Morris called 180 witnesses, seeking to prove their assertions about [[food poisoning]], unpaid [[overtime]], misleading claims about how much McDonald's [[recycling|recycled]], and "corporate spies sent to infiltrate the ranks of London Greenpeace".&lt;ref&gt;pg 389 of ''No Logo''&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's spent several million pounds, while Steel and Morris spent £30,000; this disparity in funds meant Steel and Morris were not able to call all the witnesses they wanted, especially witnesses from South America who were intended to support their claims about McDonald's activities in that continent's rainforests.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;McLibel film, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In its libel allegation, McDonald's asserted all claims in the pamphlet as being false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/pretrial/state%27o%27claim.html |title=Statement of Claim |publisher=Mcspotlight.org |accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found it difficult to support this position despite the indirectness of some of the claims. The case eventually became a [[media circus]]. McDonald's executives, including [[Ray Cesca]], entered the witness box, enabling cross-examination by the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vidal|first=john|title=McLibel: British Culture on Trial|publisher=The New Press|date=1997|pages=11–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1995 McDonald's offered to settle the case (which "was coming up to its [tenth] anniversary in court"&lt;ref name="first"&gt;pg 387 of ''No Logo'', 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt;) by donating a large sum of money to a charity chosen by the two. They further specified they would drop the case if Steel and Morris agreed to "stop criticising McDonald's".&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; Steel and Morris secretly recorded the meeting, in which McDonald's said the pair could criticise McDonald's privately to friends but must cease talking to the media or distributing leaflets. Steel and Morris wrote a letter in response saying they would agree to the terms if McDonald's ceased advertising its products and instead only recommended the restaurant privately to friends.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Judgment===

====High Court====
The case was adjudicated by Hon. Mr Justice Rodger Bell.&lt;ref&gt;Bell J had never tried, or acted as a barrister in, a libel case. His area of law had been primarily professional negligence, and so it has been felt by many that he was "led" by Richard Rampton QC, for McDonald's, throughout most of the case.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 1997, Bell delivered a more than 1,000-page decision largely in favour of McDonald's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j379/mcdonalds_190697.htm |title=The Court Service - Queens Bench Division - Judgment - McDonald's Corporation &amp; McDonald's Restaurants Limited against Helen Marie Steel &amp; David Morris |publisher=Hmcourts-service.gov.uk |accessdate=13 November 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080605062408/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j379/mcdonalds_190697.htm |archivedate = 5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarised by a 45-page paper read in court.&lt;ref&gt;"On 19 June 1997, the judge finally handed down the verdict....It felt like an eternity to most of us sitting there, as Judge Rodger Bell read out his forty-five-page ruling - a summary of the actual verdict, which was over a thousand pages long. Although the judge deemed most of the factsheet's claims too hyperbolic to be acceptable (he was particularly unconvinced by its direct linking of McDonald's to "hunger in the 'Third World'"), he deemed others to be based on pure fact." pg 389-390 of ''No Logo''.&lt;/ref&gt; Steel and Morris were found liable on several points, but the judge also found some of the points in the factsheet were true.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; McDonald's considered this a legal victory, though it was tempered by the judge's endorsement of some of the allegations in the sheet. Specifically, Bell ruled McDonald's endangered the [[health]] of their workers and customers by "misleading advertising", and they "exploit children", that they were "culpably responsible" in the infliction of unnecessary [[cruelty to animals]], and they were "antipathetic"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/verdict10_sum.html|title=SUMMARY OF THE JUDGEMENT / Employment practices|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Trade union|unionisation]] and paid their workers low wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/quotes.html | date = 19 June 1997| title = Judgement Day Verdict - Highlights | publisher = McSpotlight | accessdate = 14 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although the decision awarded £60,000 to the company, McDonald's legal costs were much greater, and the defendants lacked the funds to pay it. Steel and Morris immediately appealed against the decision.&lt;ref name="BBC payout"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/820786.stm |title=McLibel pair get police payout |first=BBC |last=News |accessdate=12 May 2007 | date=5 July 2000 |authorlink=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 a documentary film was made about the case, also titled [[McLibel (film)|''McLibel'']]. This was updated in 2005 after the verdict of the final appeal.

In September 1998, the pair sued the [[Metropolitan Police]] for disclosing confidential information to investigators hired by McDonald's and received £10,000 and an apology for the alleged disclosure.&lt;ref name="BBC payout" /&gt;

====Court of Appeal====
An appeal began on 12 January 1999 and lasted 23 court days, ending on 26 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/msc_6jan99.html |title=Press Release - McLibel Support Campaign; 6 January 1999 |publisher=Mcspotlight.org |accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was heard in Court 1 of the Court of Appeal in the [[Royal Courts of Justice]]. The case was adjudicated by Lord Justices Pill and May and Mr Justice Keane. The defendants represented themselves in court, assisted by first year law student Kalvin P. Chapman ([[King's College London]]). McDonald's were represented by libel lawyer [[Richard Rampton|Richard Rampton QC]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onebrickcourt.com/barristers.asp?id=20 One Brick Court - Barristers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and a junior barrister, Timothy Atkinson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcspotlight.org/people/biogs/atkinson.html Curriculum Vitae - Timothy Atkinson]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ms Pattie Brinley-Codd of Barlow, Lyde &amp; Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcspotlight.org/people/biogs/brinley_codd.html Curriculum Vitae - Patti Brinley-Codd]&lt;/ref&gt; Steel and Morris filed a 63-point appeal. They had requested a time extension, but were denied. The verdict for the appeal was handed down on 31 March, in Court 1 at the Royal Courts of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/msc_25mar99.html Press Release - McLibel Support Campaign; 25 March 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges ruled it was fair comment to say that McDonald's employees worldwide "do badly in terms of pay and conditions"&lt;ref&gt;[Appeal Judgment p247]&lt;/ref&gt; and true "if one eats enough McDonald's food, one's diet may well become high in fat, etc., with the very real risk of heart disease". They further stated the last finding "must have a serious effect on their trading reputation since it goes to the very business in which they are engaged. In our judgment, it must have a greater impact on the respondents' [McDonald's] reputation than any other of the charges that the trial judge had found to be true".&lt;ref&gt;[Judgment p264]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The Court of Appeal also stated that it had "considerable sympathy" with the defendants' submissions that the leaflet meant "that there is a respectable body of medical opinion which links a junk food diet with a risk of cancer and heart disease", that 'this link was accepted both in literature published by McDonald's themselves and by one or more of McDonald's own experts and in medical publications of high repute', and that therefore 'that should have been an end of this part of the case'.&lt;ref&gt;[p169]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} They ruled against the defendants on the allegation that McDonald's food was a [[carcinogen]].&lt;ref&gt;[p170-2]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

As a result of their further findings against the Corporation, the three Lord Justices reduced Mr Justice Bell's award of £60,000 damages to McDonald's by £20,000. The court ruled against the argument by Steel and Morris that multinational corporations should no longer be able to sue for libel over [[public interest]] issues; they believed "that may be seen as an argument of some substance", but ultimately rejected it, on grounds that it was a matter for Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[p287]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}  Steel and Morris announced their intention to appeal over these and other points to the [[House of Lords]], and then take the [[UK Government|UK government]] to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] if necessary.

In response to the verdict, [[David Pannick, Baron Pannick|David Pannick QC]] said in ''[[The Times]]'': "The McLibel case has achieved what many lawyers thought impossible: to lower further the reputation of our law in the minds of all right thinking people."&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 24 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Steel and Morris appealed to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Law Lords]], arguing that their right to legal aid had been unjustly denied. When the Law Lords refused to accept the case, the pair formally retained [[solicitor]] [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article515008.ece|title=McDonald's gets a taste of defeat as Europe backs the McLibel Two|publisher=Times newspapers|date=16 February 2005|accessdate=29 January 2011|location=London|first=Frances|last=Gibb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[barrister]] (later [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] (England and Wales)), [[Keir Starmer]] QC to file a case with the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR), contesting the UK government's policy that legal aid was not available in libel cases, and setting out a highly detailed case for what they believed to be the oppressive and unfair nature of UK libel laws in general, and in their case in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/Echr.html European Court of Human Rights Application&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, this action was heard by the ECHR. Lawyers for Steel and Morris argued that the lack of legal aid had breached the pair's right to freedom of expression and to a fair trial.

====European Court of Human Rights====
[[File:Anti-McDonalds protest Leicester Square London 20041016.jpg|thumb|right|An anti-McDonald’s leafleting campaign in front of the McDonald’s restaurant in Leicester Square, London, during the European Social Forum season, 16-10-2004.]]
On 15 February 2005, the European Court of Human Rights ruled&lt;ref name="echr"&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-68224  CASE OF STEEL AND MORRIS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM (Application no. 68416/01): JUDGMENT]&lt;/ref&gt; that the original case had breached Article 6 (right to a fair trial) and Article 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and ordered that the UK government pay Steel and Morris £57,000 in compensation. In their ruling, the ECHR criticised the way in which UK laws had failed to protect the public right to criticise corporations whose business practices affect people's lives and the environment (which violates Article 10); they also ruled that the trial was biased because of the defendants' comparative lack of resources and what they believed were complex and oppressive UK libel laws.

In particular the Court held:
{{quote|in a democratic society even small and informal campaign groups, such as London Greenpeace, must be able to carry on their activities effectively and that there exists a strong public interest in enabling such groups and individuals outside the mainstream to contribute to the public debate by disseminating information and ideas on matters of general public interest such as health and the environment.|ECJR judgement, para. 89&lt;ref name="echr"/&gt;}}
{{quote|The safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (...), and the same principle must apply to others who engage in public debate.|ECHR judgement, para. 90&lt;ref name="echr"/&gt;}}
{{quote|It is true that large public companies inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their acts and, as in the case of the businessmen and women who manage them, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider in the case of such companies.|ECHR judgement, para. 94&lt;ref name="echr"/&gt;}}

In response to the European Court of Human Rights' decision, Steel and Morris issued the following press release:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Having largely beaten McDonald's... we have now exposed the notoriously oppressive and unfair UK laws. As a result of the... ruling today, the government may be forced to amend or scrap some of the existing UK laws. We hope that this will result in greater public scrutiny and criticism of powerful organisations whose practices have a detrimental effect on society and the environment. The McLibel campaign has already proved that determined and widespread grass roots protests and defiance can undermine those who try to silence their critics, and also render oppressive laws unworkable. The continually growing opposition to McDonald's and all it stands for is a vindication of all the efforts of those around the world who have been exposing and challenging the corporation's business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/releases/msc150205.html

===Post court developments===
In the course of the [[UK undercover policing relationships scandal]] it was revealed that one of the authors of the "McLibel leaflet" was [[Bob Lambert (undercover police officer)|Bob Lambert]], an undercover police officer who infiltrated [[London Greenpeace]]; John Dines, another undercover officer, was also Helen Steel's partner for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McLibel leaflet was co-written by undercover police officer Bob Lambert |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/mclibel-leaflet-police-bob-lambert-mcdonalds|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 June 2013|first=Paul|last=Lewis|author2=Rob Evans|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/09/undercover-uk-police-spy-apologises-after-being-tracked-down-by-woman-he-deceived|title=Undercover UK police spy apologises after being tracked down by woman he deceived|publisher=The Guardian|author= Paul Farrell and Rob Evans|date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Defamation Act 2013]] brought some changes to libel cases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/assembly-business/official-report/committee-minutes-of-evidence/session-2012-2013/july-2013/defamation-act-2013-libel-reform-campaign-briefing/|title=Defamation Act 2013: Libel Reform Campaign Briefing}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were expected to make it harder for corporations to abuse libel law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/6-may-2013/can-new-act-clean-up-libel-law/|author=Matt Byrne|title=Can new Act clean up libel law?|date=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The McLibel case also raised awareness about how defamation proceedings can harm the reputation of companies which raise them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaronandpartners.com/defamation-act-2013/|title=Defamation Act 2013|date=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[Streisand effect]].

==McDonald's response==
The ''McLibel'' film quoted McDonald's as offering little comment on the European Court decision other than to point out that it was the Government and not McDonald's who was the losing party and that "times have changed and so has McDonald's".

On a website aiming to state its view on issues raised about it, McDonald's stated that the case is in the past and the issues more so, and that both sides in it have moved on (although Morris and Steel did continue related litigation&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/15/food.foodanddrink&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Skau, S. (2013) McLibel. www.followthethings.com/mclibel.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
A feature-length documentary film, ''[[McLibel (film)|McLibel]]'', was made about the case by [[Franny Armstrong]] and [[Ken Loach]] in 1997. An extended version was produced in 2005.

'''Mirko Hermann''' (5 August 1868 – 2 April 1927) was a [[Croatia]]n industrialist, businessman and member of the [[Freemasonry]] in [[Osijek]], Croatia.

Hermann was born in Osijek on 5 August 1868. He was raised in a Croatian [[Jews|Jewish]] family of David Hermann. Hermann finished elementary and high school in Osijek. He attended and graduated from the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna]] and University of [[University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna]]. For a short period of time, after graduation, Hermann worked in [[Lika]] and later moved to [[Čepin]] near Osijek. In 1897 Hermann acquired on lease the agricultural estate "Mihajlović". He was also a renowned art collector and a longtime member of the "First Croatian-Slavonian traded company for the sugar industry" in Osijek. Hermann was one of the key renovators of [[Masonic Lodge|Masonic]] activity in Osijek. From 1903 he was a member of the [[Freemasonry]] lodge "Ljubav bližnjega" (''The Neighbour's Love'') and from 1912 founder and [[Masonic Lodge Officers|Worshipful Master]] of the lodge "Budnost" (''Vigilance''). Due to disagreements with some members and the internal conflicts in the lodge, caused by new political circumstances after the [[World War I]], Hermann retired from a place of Worshipful Master and left the lodge in 1923.&lt;ref name="os"&gt;{{Cite news | language = Croatian | last = Živaković-Kerže  | first = Zlata |author2=Nevenka Drahotuski | title = Osječki spomendan 5. kolovoza | pages= | newspaper = [[Osijek]] | date = 2011-08-04 | url = http://www.osijek.hr/index.php/cro/Osijek/Osjecki-spomendan/Osjecki-spomendan-5.-kolovoza | accessdate = 2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | language = Croatian | last = Matičić | first = Slaven | title = Masoni u Osijeku: Jedna od najjačih loža u cijeloj regiji | pages =  | newspaper = Kultura u [[Osijek]]u - www.kultura-osijek.com | date = 2012-11-24 | url = http://www.kultura-osijek.com/urbana-kultura-i-stil/masoni-u-osijeku-jedna-od-najjacih-loza-u-cijeloj-regiji | accessdate = 2013-05-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130616154815/http://www.kultura-osijek.com/urbana-kultura-i-stil/masoni-u-osijeku-jedna-od-najjacih-loza-u-cijeloj-regiji | archivedate = 2013-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | language = Croatian | last = | first = | title = Otvorenje izložbe OSTAVŠTINA OSJEČKE SLOBODNOZIDARSKE LOŽE "BUDNOST" u Hrvatskom povijesnom muzeju u Zagrebu | pages= | newspaper = www.culturenet.hr | date = 2004 | url = http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?id=3932 | accessdate = 2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | language = Croatian | last =  | first =  | title = Zbirka slikarstva 20. stoljeća, I. polovica | pages =  | newspaper = Galerija likovnih umjetnosti Osijek - www.gluo.hr | date = 2004 | url = http://www.gluo.hr/zs20.html | accessdate = 2013-05-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130616154745/http://www.gluo.hr/zs20.html | archivedate = 2013-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hermann was legal guardian of Terezija Svećenski, mother of [[Louis Svećenski]], until her death.&lt;ref name=essekeri&gt;{{cite news|url=http://essekeri.hr/bio/73-lujo-svecenski|title=Biografija: Lujo Svećenski|publisher=Essekeri|work=essekeri.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Zagreb]] on 2 April 1927 and was buried at the [[Mirogoj Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="os"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Gradska groblja Zagreb: Mirko Hermann, Mirogoj Ž-8-I-61&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

In the law of [[contract]]s, the '''mirror image rule,''' also referred to as an unequivocal and absolute acceptance requirement, states that an [[offer and acceptance|offer]] must be accepted exactly with no modifications. The offeror is the master of one's own offer. An attempt to accept the offer on different terms instead creates a [[counter-offer]], and this constitutes a rejection of the original offer.&lt;ref&gt;(Restatement(2d) Contracts §59)&lt;/ref&gt;

==England==
The [[English common law]] established the concepts of ''[[consensus ad idem]]'', offer, acceptance and counter-offer.  The leading case on counter-offer is ''[[Hyde v Wrench]]'' [1840].&lt;ref&gt; Hyde v Wrench [1840] EWHC Ch J90&lt;/ref&gt;   The phrase "Mirror-Image Rule" is rarely (if at all) used by English lawyers; but the concept remains valid, as in ''[[Gibson v Manchester City Council]]'' [1979],&lt;ref&gt;Gibson v Manchester City Council [1979] UKHL 6|&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corp Ltd|Butler Machine Tool v Excello]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-cello Cpn (England) Ltd 1979 1 WLR 401 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
This position is adhered to in [[Australia]] ([[New South Wales]]). If a person were to accept an offer, but make a modification, then they are actually rejecting the offer presented to them and are proposing a counter-offer: ''Masters v Cameron'' (1954) 91 CLR 353. That modifying party is then the one making a new offer, and the original offeror is now the one who has to accept.

==United States==
{{See also|United States contract law#UCC .C2.A7 2-207|Uniform Commercial Code#Section 2-207: Battle of the forms|Offer and acceptance#Battle of the forms}}

In the [[United States]], this rule still exists at common law.  However, the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] ("UCC") dispenses with it in § 2-207. (but it can also be argued that § 2-207(1) enforces the mirror image rule)&lt;ref&gt;Text of § 2-207: https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/article2.htm#s2-207&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, its applicability depends upon what law governs.  Most states have adopted the UCC, which governs transactions in goods.  Contracts for services or land, for example, would not be governed by the UCC.  The 2nd restatement of contracts also provides that when parties have not agreed to an essential term, "a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court."  However, it may not be possible for a reasonable term to be supplied by the court.

'''Pehr (Per) Georg Scheutz''' (23 September 1785 &amp;ndash; 22 May 1873) was a 19th-century Swedish lawyer, translator, and inventor, who is now best known for his pioneering work in computer technology.

==Life==
Scheutz studied law at [[Lund University]], graduating in 1805. He then worked as a [[Lawyer|legal expert]] and [[translator]] (he translated several works of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]]) before turning predominantly to liberal [[politics]] and [[mechanical engineering]].

He is most known for his inventions; the best known of these is the '''[[Scheutzian calculation engine]]''', invented in 1837 and finalized in 1843. This machine, which he constructed with his son Edvard Scheutz, was based on [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[difference engine]]. In 1851 they obtained funds from government to build an improved model, which was created in 1853 (was roughly the size of a piano), and subsequently demonstrated at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|World's Fair in Paris, 1855]]. The machine was then sold in 1856 to the Dudley Observatory in Albany, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut1wgt6kSBEC&amp;pg=PA12#v=snippet&amp;q=difference%20engine&amp;f=false|title=Specimens of Tables, Calculated, Stereomoulded, and Printed by Machinery|last=Scheutz|first=George|last2=Scheutz|first2=Edward|date=1857|publisher=Whitnig|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Preface 8-12,14-15; p. 3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.639.3286|title=First Printing Calculator|last=Merzbach|first=Uta C.|authorlink= Uta Merzbach |last2=Zoology|first2=Smithsonian Contributions To|last3=Ripley|first3=S.

The devices were used for creating [[logarithm]]ic tables.

While the machine was not perfect and could not produce complete tables, [[Martin Wiberg]] reworked the construction from the ground up and in 1875 created a compact device which would print complete tables.

Scheutz was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1856.

'''See Wai Hun''' also known as '''Wai Hun''', is a Malaysian financial technology professional. She is the co-founder and CEO of [[JurisTech]], a fintech  company based in Malaysia.

==Early life and education==

As a teenager, Wai Hun wanted to be a lawyer, her father suggested it would be an ideal career path for her since she was good at winning arguments. As a young adult, Wai Hun thought a career in accounting would be a better option. But first semester into her accounting degree at [[Tunku Abdul Rahman University College]], she decided accounting wasn't for her. She wanted to study a STEM subject. Wai Hun's father enrolled her into a computer science program in Sedaya College. Wai Hun looks back to this moment as a pivotal point in her life, when she realized programming and technology was going to be her lifelong passion. She later earned her bachelor's degree in business computing, from the [[University of Winnipeg]]. She graduated as a gold medalist from the University of Winnipeg for being the best graduate in her year.&lt;ref name="kinibiz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinibiz.com/story/issues/200661/being-fickle-pays.html|title=Being fickle pays|website=KINIBIZ|accessdate=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endeavormalaysia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endeavormalaysia.org/endeavor/see-wai-hun/|website=endeavormalaysia.org|title=Endeavor Malaysia|accessdate=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Wai Hun started her career as a consultant at [[Ernst &amp; Young]], then later worked as a business analyst at Sistemaju before joining Sapura to develop and implement business intelligence solutions. At Sapura, Wai Hun met John Lim, a Malaysian software developer who would eventually become the Chief Technological Officer of JurisTech.&lt;ref name="digitalnewsasia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/startup-scaleups/creating-financial-change|title=Creating financial change|website=Digital News Asia|accessdate=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endeavor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://endeavor.org/entrepreneur/wai-hun-see/|title=Wai Hun See|website=Endeavor|accessdate=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wai Hun and John Lim started Natsoft(M) Sdn Bhd, the parent company of JurisTech; in 1997 amidst the [[Asian Financial Crisis]]. Their company was initially poised to sell data mining, AI and data analytics tools and services to banks. However the initial offering was not successful because back then, the markets weren't ready for data mining and AI solutions, also because of the Asian Financial Crisis, no one could afford them. Then Wai Hun and John Lim decided to offer debt collection and litigation software to cope with existing market needs. This new approach was an instant success, as Wai Hun recalls that this was the point in her career as an entrepreneur where customers actually started chasing her, instead of the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themalaysianreserve.com/2017/04/03/tech-duo-with-flair-for-accomplishing-critical-missions-across-industries/|title=Tech duo with flair for accomplishing critical missions across industries - The Malaysian Reserve|website=themalaysianreserve.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/sme/2014/04/03/banking-on-ai-software-companys-products-gain-traction-in-financial-institutions/|title=Software company&amp;#8217;s products gain traction in financial institutions - SME - The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalnewsasia2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/startup-scaleups/creating-financial-change?page=2|title=Creating financial change|website=Digital News Asia|accessdate=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focusmalaysia.my/Enterprise/building-a-business-on-necessity|title=Building a business on necessity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundersasia.com/profile.html?profileID=237|title=Welcome to Founders Asia|website=www.foundersasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6874">'''Social dialogue''' (or social concertation) is the process whereby [[social partners]] (trade unions and employer organisations) negotiate, often in collaboration with the government, to influence the arrangement and development of work-related issues, labour market policies, social protection, taxation or other economic policies. It is a widespread procedure to develop public policies in Western Europe in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Baccaro &amp; Simoni|first =|date = 2008|title = Policy Concertation in Europe|url = http://cps.sagepub.com/content/41/10/1323.abstract|journal = Comparative Political Studies|volume = 41|issue = 10|doi = 10.1177/0010414008315861|pmid =|access-date = 3 September 2016|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These can be direct relations between the social partners themselves ("bipartite") or relations between governmental authorities and the social partners ("tripartite").
To make it more clear, Social dialogue can mean negotiation, consultation or simply an exchange of views between representatives of employers, workers and governments. It may consist of relations between labour and management, with or without direct government involvement. Social dialogue is a flexible tool that enables governments and employers’ and workers’ organizations to manage change and achieve economic and social goals.

Examples of social dialogue activity include mutual information, open discussion, concertation&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social Concertation in Times of Austerity|url = https://www.oapen.org/search?identifier=442727|publisher = Amsterdam University Press|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9789089643957|language = en|first = Alexandre|last = Afonso}}&lt;/ref&gt; (on-going tripartite dialogue), exchanges of opinions, consultation and negotiation (agreements /common opinions).

European social dialogue is enshrined in the [[Treaty establishing the European Community]] (articles 138 and 139; ex 118a and 118b) and it is promoted by the [[European Commission]] as an instrument for a better governance and promotion of social and economic reforms.

==Definition==
According to the [[ILO]]’s definition, it means the practice of [[tripartism]] between governments and the representative organizations of workers and employers within and across borders are now more relevant to achieving solutions and to building up social cohesion and the rule of law through, among other means, international labor standards.&lt;ref&gt;ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The aim of social dialogue is to advance opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom, equality, security and human dignity.

==Enabling conditions==
Social dialogue includes all types of negotiation, consultation and exchange of information between, or among, representatives of governments, employers and workers on issues of common interest&lt;ref&gt;Ishikawa,2003&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Respect for the fundamental rights of freedom of association and [[collective bargaining]].

2. Strong, independent workers' and employers' organizations with the technical capacity and knowledge required to participate in social dialogue.

3. Political will and commitment to engage in social dialogue on the part of all parties.

4. Appropriate institutional support.
&lt;ref&gt;International labor organization official website social dialogue&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means==
1. Information sharing：

The inevitable foundation of effective social dialogue is to share information.Even It doesn’t include discussion or real action, it still have its meaning.

2. Consultation：

Consultation exceeds information sharing, it needs exchanging perspective, opinion, ideas, and forms a deep conversation.

3. Negotiation/Conclude convention：

Some members need to be authorized to form the binding conventions.

4. Collective bargaining：

Collective bargaining is not only the inseparable form in social dialogue, but also be widely used. In every country, Collective      
bargaining is an indicator to identify the ability of social dialogue’s level.

==The dilemma of pushing==
Social dialogue faced challenge in some countries. Take Croatia for example, government and social partner couldn’t have consensus on adoption to overcome economic crisis in terms of public cost decrease and job saving through bargaining in several months.

==The difference in nations==
Social dialogue may take place at different levels and in various form, depending on national circumstances.

===France===

Social dialogue in [[France]] was hard to be national because of the political opposite in groups of social partner. Except for collective bargaining, it highlighted the discussion in tripartism on the issues of employment policy and human resource development. Employment committee in France proceeded consultation and participation of policy establishment on the issues of promoting employment and job training.

===Germany===

Because of the high coverage rate of unions and employers’ groups in [[Germany]], and less of problems in political and ideological conflicts, social dialogue in national level elaborated higher influence on establishment of national policies. Except for job training and employment security, it also emphasized bargaining and negotiation in work conditions, including shortening of work hours and wage increase.

===Austria, Denmark, Ireland and Holland===

When European Union (EU) suffered from the high rate of unemployment, there was brilliant performances in terms of macroeconomic development and employment rate in [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Ireland]] and Holland at the 1990s. Take 2001 for example, the unemployment rate of other 15 countries in EU was up to 7.4 percent. On the contrary, the unemployment rate of these four countries was merely 3.5 percent. ILO thought that the main reason of these four countries’ success was social dialogue, macroeconomic policies and labor market policies. For instance, the Wassenaar Agreement signed in Holland in 1982, and Denmark advocated the national recovery program with Ireland in 1987. These agreements stood for the will of social partner to solve economic dilemma.

'''''Today's Business''''' is an American business news television program that aired on [[CNBC]] in the early morning, 5–7 am ET timeslot, hosted for the end of its run by [[Liz Claman]] and [[Bob Sellers]]. It was replaced by ''[[Wake Up Call (2002 TV program)|Wake Up Call]]'' on Feb 4, 2002.  The show covered news that was expect to affect the stock market trading day ahead.

==''Today's Business: Early Edition''==
In 1999, ''Today's Business: Early Edition'' was added on weekdays from 4–5 am ET on CNBC. It was hosted by [[Bob Sellers]] and [[Bonnie Behrand]], which expanded the whole ''Today's Business'' block to 3 hours.

''Today's Business: Early Edition'' provided frequent round-ups of key business and general news stories, along with sports updates. Regular segments included "Wake Up with Jay", highlights from Jay Leno's ''Tonight Show'' monologue, and live weather reports from Chief Meteorologist Joe Witte.

==CNBC Europe edition==

A business news television program also titled ''Today's Business'' aired on [[CNBC Europe]] from 6–7 am [[Central European Time|CET]] (5–6 am [[Western European Time|WET]]) between January 2001 and March 2007. It was originally based on the [[CNBC]] U.S. morning version of ''Today's Business''.

The European ''Today's Business'' was presented by [[Steve Sedgwick]] from 2006 through the end of the program's run in 2007. Earlier presenters of the program were [[Simon Hobbs]] (2001–2003), [[Serena Al-Awa]] (2003), and [[Guy Johnson (journalist)|Guy Johnson]] (2003–2006).

Segments on the program included a review of the previous day's business, a news headlines round-up, as well as early results from the markey. The program also linked up with [[CNBC Asia]] for continuing coverage of the Asian session.

The program was renamed from ''Today's Business Europe'' in May 2003. While the title was only slightly altered, the program was reduced from two hours to one (with the then-titled CNBC ''[[Europe Squawk Box]]'' gaining an hour). While ''Today's Business Europe'' had been presented in front of CNBC Europe's video wall, the new program, initially co-anchored by Guy Johnson and Serena Al-Awa, was presented from behind a desk.

The program ended its run on March 23, 2007 and was replaced on March 26, 2007 by a new show, ''[[Capital Connection (TV programme)|Capital Connection]]'', co-anchored by [[Maura Fogarty]] at CNBC Asia in Singapore and Sedgwick in London.
