      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8869">In [[Thread (computer science)|multithreaded]] [[computer science|computing]], the '''ABA problem''' occurs during synchronization, when a location is read twice, has the same value for both reads, and "value is the same" is used to indicate "nothing has changed".  However, another thread can execute between the two reads and change the value, do other work, then change the value back, thus fooling the first thread into thinking "nothing has changed" even though the second thread did work that violates that assumption.

The ABA problem occurs when multiple [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] (or [[Process (computing)|processes]]) accessing shared data interleave.  Below is the sequence of events that will result in the ABA problem:
* Process &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; reads value A from shared memory,
* &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is [[Preemption (computing)|preempted]], allowing process &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; to run,
* &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; modifies the shared memory value A to value B and back to A before preemption,
* &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; begins execution again, sees that the shared memory value has not changed and continues.

Although &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; can continue executing, it is possible that the behavior will not be correct due to the "hidden" modification in shared memory.

A common case of the ABA problem is encountered when implementing a [[lock-free]] data structure.  If an item is removed from the list, deleted, and then a new item is allocated and added to the list, it is common for the allocated object to be at the same location as the deleted object due to optimization.  A pointer to the new item is thus sometimes equal to a pointer to the old item which is an ABA problem.

== Examples ==

Consider a software example of ABA using a [[lock-free]] [[Stack (data structure)|stack]]:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
  /* Naive lock-free stack which suffers from ABA problem.*/
  class Stack {
    std::atomic&lt;Obj*&gt; top_ptr;
    //
    // Pops the top object and returns a pointer to it.
    //
    Obj* Pop() {
      while(1) {
        Obj* ret_ptr = top_ptr;
        if (!ret_ptr) return nullptr;
        // For simplicity, suppose that we can ensure that this dereference is safe
        // (i.e., that no other thread has popped the stack in the meantime).
        Obj* next_ptr = ret_ptr-&gt;next;
        // If the top node is still ret, then assume no one has changed the stack.
        // (That statement is not always true because of the ABA problem)
        // Atomically replace top with next.
        if (top_ptr.compare_exchange_weak(ret_ptr, next_ptr)) {
          return ret_ptr;
        }
        // The stack has changed, start over.
      }
    }
    //
    // Pushes the object specified by obj_ptr to stack.
    //
    void Push(Obj* obj_ptr) {
      while(1) {
        Obj* next_ptr = top_ptr;
        obj_ptr-&gt;next = next_ptr;
        // If the top node is still next, then assume no one has changed the stack.
        // (That statement is not always true because of the ABA problem)
        // Atomically replace top with obj.
        if (top_ptr.compare_exchange_weak(next_ptr, obj_ptr)) {
          return;
        }
        // The stack has changed, start over.
      }
    }
  };
&lt;/source&gt;

This code can normally prevent problems from concurrent access, but suffers from ABA problems.  Consider the following sequence:

Stack initially contains ''top'' → A → B → C

Thread 1 starts running pop:
  ret = A;
  next = B;
Thread 1 gets interrupted just before the &lt;tt&gt;compare_exchange_weak&lt;/tt&gt;...

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
  { // Thread 2 runs pop:
    ret = A;
    next = B;
    compare_exchange_weak(A, B)  // Success, top = B
    return A;
  } // Now the stack is top → B → C
  { // Thread 2 runs pop again:
    ret = B;
    next = C;
    compare_exchange_weak(B, C)  // Success, top = C
    return B;
  } // Now the stack is top → C
  delete B;
  { // Thread 2 now pushes A back onto the stack:
    A-&gt;next = C;
    compare_exchange_weak(C, A)  // Success, top = A
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Now the stack is ''top'' → A → C

When Thread 1 resumes:
  compare_exchange_weak(A, B)

This instruction succeeds because it finds ''top'' == ret (both are A), so it sets top to next (which is B).  As B has been deleted the program will access freed memory when it tries to look at the first element on the stack. In C++, as shown here, accessing freed memory is [[undefined behavior]]: this may result in crashes, data corruption or even just silently appear to work correctly. ABA bugs such as this can be difficult to debug.

== Workarounds ==

=== Tagged state reference ===
A common workaround is to add extra "tag" or "stamp" bits to the quantity being considered. For example, an algorithm using [[compare and swap]] on a pointer might use the low bits of the address to indicate how many times the pointer has been successfully modified. Because of this, the next compare-and-swap will fail, even if the addresses are the same, because the tag bits will not match. This is sometimes called ABAʹ since the second A is made slightly different from the first. Such tagged state references are also used in [[transactional memory]].

If "tag" field wraps around, guarantees against ABA do not stand anymore. However, it has been observed that on currently existing CPUs, and using 60-bit tags, no wraparound is possible as long as the program lifetime (that is, without restarting the program) is limited to 10 years; in addition, it was argued that for practical purposes it is usually sufficient to have 40-48 bits of tag to guarantee against wrapping around. As modern CPUs (in particular, all modern x64 CPUs) tend to support 128-bit CAS operations, in certain use cases it allows to provide firm guarantees against ABA when using tagging. &lt;ref&gt;'No Bugs' Hare, [http://ithare.com/cas-reactor-for-non-blocking-multithreaded-primitives/ CAS (Re)Actor for Non-Blocking Multithreaded Primitives], Overload #142&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermediate nodes ===
A correct but expensive approach is to use intermediate nodes that are not data elements and thus assure invariants as elements are inserted and removed [Valois].

=== Deferred reclamation ===
Another approach is to defer reclamation of removed data elements.  One way to defer reclamation is to run the algorithm in an environment featuring an [[Garbage collection (computer science)|automatic garbage collector]]; a problem here however is that if the GC is not lock-free, then the overall system is not lock-free, even though the data structure itself is.

Another way to defer reclamation is to use one or more [[hazard pointer]]s, which are pointers to locations that otherwise cannot appear in the list.  Each hazard pointer represents an intermediate state of an in-progress change; the presence of the pointer assures further synchronization [Doug Lea].  Hazard pointers are lock-free, but can only track at most two elements for being in-use.

Yet another way to defer reclamation is to use [[Read-copy-update|read-copy update (RCU)]], which involves enclosing the update in an RCU read-side critical section and then waiting for an RCU grace period before freeing any removed data elements.  Using RCU in this way guarantees that any data element removed cannot reappear until all currently executing operations have completed.  RCU is lock-free, but isn't suitable for all workloads.

Some architectures provide "larger" atomic operations such that, as example, both forward and backward links in a doubly linked list can be updated atomically; while this feature is architecture-dependent, it, in particular, is available for x86/x64 architectures (x86 allows for 64-bit CAS, and all modern x64 CPUs allow for 128-bit CAS) and IBM's [[z/Architecture]] (which allows for up to 128-bit CAS). 

Some architectures provide a [[Load-Link/Store-Conditional|load linked, store conditional]] instruction in which the store is performed only when there are no other stores of the indicated location.  This effectively separates the notion of "storage contains value" from "storage has been changed".  Examples include DEC Alpha, MIPS, PowerPC and ARM (v6 and later).

The '''abyssal zone''' or '''abyssopelagic zone''' is a layer of the [[pelagic zone]] of the ocean. "Abyss" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἄβυσσος}}, meaning bottomless. At depths of {{convert|4000|to|6000|m|ft}}, this zone remains in perpetual darkness. These regions are also characterized by continuous cold and lack of nutrients. The abyssal zone has temperatures around {{convert|2|to|3|C|F}} through the large majority of its mass.&lt;ref name="biome"&gt;{{cite web |title=Deep Sea Biome |url=http://www.untamedscience.com/biology/world-biomes/deep-sea-biome |publisher=Untamed Science |accessdate=2009-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331095054/http://untamedscience.com/biology/world-biomes/deep-sea-biome |archivedate=31 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the deeper part of the ''midnight zone'' which starts in the [[bathyal zone|bathypelagic]] waters above.&lt;ref name="biome"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zone"&gt;{{cite web |title=Abyssal |last=Nelson |first=Rob |url=http://www.thewildclassroom.com/biomes/abyssal.html |publisher=The Wild Classroom |date=April 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325100618/http://www.thewildclassroom.com/biomes/abyssal.html |archivedate=25 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area below the abyssal zone is the sparsely inhabited [[hadal zone]].&lt;ref name="betweenzones"&gt;{{cite web |title=Abyssal |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abyssal |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2009-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418044525/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abyssal |archivedate=18 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zone above is the [[bathyal zone]].&lt;ref name="betweenzones"/&gt;

==Trenches==
{{main|Hadal zone}}
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|200px|left|Layers of the pelagic zone]]

The deep trenches or fissures that plunge down thousands of metres below the ocean floor (for example, the midoceanic trenches such as the [[Mariana Trench]] in the [[Pacific]]) are almost unexplored.&lt;ref name=zone/&gt; Previously, only the [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'', the [[teleoperated|remote control]] [[submarine]] ''[[Kaikō ROV|Kaikō]]'' and the ''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'' have been able to descend to these depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Bathyscaph Trieste|url=http://www.bathyscaphtrieste.com/|publisher=Bathyscaphtrieste.com|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's deepest-diving submarine missing|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2003-07-01-Sub-missing_x.htm|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company Inc.|date=2003-07-02|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of March 25, 2012 one vehicle, the ''[[Deepsea Challenger]]'' was able to penetrate to a depth of 10,898.4 metres (35,756&amp;nbsp;ft).

==Biology==

Overall, the deep sea is a very food-limited environment. In the abyssal zone, biomass is directly related to the amount of food either supplied from transporting [[ocean currents]] or from the water column above. The [[biological pump]] is thought of as the main driver for cycling organic matter (e.g. particulate organic carbon or [[dissolved organic carbon]]) from the atmosphere into the surface ocean, and eventually to the deep ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glover|title=Temporal Change in Deep-Sea Benthic Ecosystems: A Review of the Evidence From Recent Time-Series Studies|journal=Advances in Marine Biology|date=2010|volume=58|pages=10–12|doi=10.1016/S0065-2881(10)58001-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that organisms in the abyssal zone have no access to sunlight, they rely heavily on nutrients sinking from above (known as [[marine snow]]). These nutrients can be in the form of sediments, algae, fecal pellets, or fish carcasses, to name a few. Spatially, the abundance of organisms in the deep ocean is hypothesized to be highest where the surface productivity is the highest, as long as there is efficient export from surface ocean to deep ocean. Studies have shown that marine snow alone does not supply an adequate amount of nutrients to support the population of [[Benthos|benthic organisms]]. However, population booms of algae or animals near the surface ocean can result in heavy pulses of [[particulate organic matter]] that, in a few weeks, will deliver as many nutrients as would normally be delivered over decadal timescales of marine snow transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine biology: Feast and famine on the abyssal plain|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131111185518.htm|website=ScienceDaily|publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sea floor locations, such as [[mid-ocean ridges]], are unique in that they contain [[hydrothermal vents]]. These vents emit geothermically reduced sulfur compounds that allow for microbial [[primary production]], sustaining many benthic organisms in absence of the sunlight required for photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karl|first1=D.M.|last2=Wirsen|first2=C.O.|last3=Jannasch|first3=H.W.|title=Deep-sea primary production at the Galapagos hydrothermal vents|journal=Science|date=March 21, 1980|volume=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Bar Foundation''' ('''ABF''') is an independent, [[nonprofit]] national [[research institute]] established in 1952 and located in [[Chicago]]. It conducts objective [[empirical]] research on [[law]] and legal institutions. This program of sociolegal research is conducted by an interdisciplinary staff of Research Faculty trained in such diverse fields as [[law]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], [[history]], and [[anthropology]].  

The ABF was initially located in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] on the [[University of Chicago]] campus. It subsequently moved to the American Bar Association building in [[downtown Chicago]], and remained there after the ABA departed, now sharing the building with part of the [[Northwestern University]] downtown professional schools.  The most recent directors (beginning in the 1970s) of the ABF were Spencer L. Kimball (also a professor of law at the [[University of Chicago]] and a former dean of the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]]), John P. Heinz (professor at [[Northwestern University School of Law]]), [[Bill Felstiner|William "Bill" Felstiner]], Bryant Garth (now dean of [[Southwestern Law School]]),  Robert Nelson (also a professor in the Department of Sociology, Northwestern University and MacCrate Research Chair in the Legal Professions at the ABF), and current director Ajay Mehrotra (also a professor of law at Northwestern University School of Law).

The American Bar Foundation Research Faculty produces ''[[Law and Social Inquiry]]'' (LSI), a peer-reviewed academic journal that publishes empirical research about law, legal institutions, and legal processes.  LSI currently is published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]].

The American Bar Foundation is a resource for [[lawyers]], [[scholars]], and policy makers who seek analyses of the theory and functioning of law, legal institutions, and the legal profession. The Foundation's work is supported by the American Bar Endowment, by The Fellows of the American Bar Foundation, and by grants for particular research projects from private foundations and government agencies.

The '''NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC)''' is an aeronautical research center operated by [[NASA]]. Its primary campus is located inside [[Edwards Air Force Base]] and is considered NASA's premier site for aeronautical research.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/bldg_703/overview.html|title=Building 703 Facilities Overview|last=Conner|first=Monroe|date=2015-02-19|work=NASA|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFRC operates some of the most advanced aircraft in the world and is known for many aviation firsts, including critical support for the first manned [[airplane]] to exceed the [[speed of sound]] in level flight with the Bell X-1,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-085-DFRC.html|title=NASA Armstrong Fact Sheet: First Generation X-1|last=Gibbs|first=Yvonne|date=2015-08-12|work=NASA|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; highest speed ever recorded by a manned, powered aircraft (North American X-15),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/research/x15/|title=Aerospaceweb.org {{!}} Aircraft Museum - X-15|website=www.aerospaceweb.org|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-052-DFRC.html|title=NASA Armstrong Fact Sheet: X-15 Hypersonic Research Program|last=Gibbs|first=Yvonne|date=2015-08-13|work=NASA|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first pure digital fly-by-wire aircraft (F-8 DFBW),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/history/pastprojects/F8/index.html|title=F-8 Digital Fly-By-Wire|last=Gibbs|first=Yvonne|date=2017-05-10|work=NASA|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others.

On March 1, 2014, the facility was renamed in honor of [[Neil Armstrong]], a former test pilot at the center and the first human being to walk on the surface of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-center-renamed-for-neil-armstrong/|title=NASA Center Renamed in Honor of Neil A.

Dryden]], a prominent [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]] who at the time of his death in 1965 was NASA's deputy administrator. It has also previously been known as the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] '''Muroc Flight Test Unit''' (1945), the '''NACA High-Speed Flight Research Station''' (1949), the '''NACA High-Speed Flight Station''' (1954), the '''NASA High-Speed Flight Station''' (1958) and the '''NASA Flight Research Center''' (1959).

AFRC was also the home of the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] (SCA), a modified Boeing 747 designed to carry a Space Shuttle orbiter back to [[Kennedy Space Center]] if one landed at Edwards.

Until 2004, Armstrong Flight Research Center operated the oldest [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bomber, a B-52B model (tail number 008) which had been converted to [[drop test]] aircraft, dubbed '[[Balls 8]].'  It dropped a large number of [[supersonic]] test vehicles, ranging from the [[North American X-15|X-15]] to its last research program, the [[hypersonic]] [[X-43A]], powered by a [[Pegasus rocket]].  The aircraft was retired and is currently on display near the North Gate of Edwards.&lt;ref&gt;Google Earth imagery date 26 August 2012, {{Coord|34.99289444|-117.88343889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
Though Armstrong Flight Research Center has always been located on the shore of Rogers Dry Lake Bed, its precise location has changed over the years. It currently resides on the North Western Edge of the lakebed, just south of Edwards Air Force Bases' North Gate. Visitation to the center requires obtaining access to both Edwards AFB and NASA AFRC. Rogers dry lake bed offers a unique landscape which is well suited for flight research. Dry conditions, few rainy days per year, and large, flat, open spaces in which emergency landings can be performed. At times, Rodgers dry lake bed can host a runway length of over 40,000 feet, and is home to a 2000' diameter compass rose, in which aircraft can land into the wind in any direction.

===Douglas Skyrocket===
{{Main|Douglas Skyrocket}}
[[Image:D-558-2 Dropped from B-29 Mothership - GPN-2000-000251.jpg|thumb|left|NACA's Douglas D-558-II Skyrocket being dropped from a [[B-29 Superfortress]]]]
NASA's predecessor, NACA, operated the Douglas Skyrocket. A successor to the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]]'s [[Bell X-1]], the D-558-II could operate under [[rocket]] or [[jet engine|jet]] power. It conducted extensive tests into aircraft stability in the [[transsonic]] range, optimal supersonic wing configurations, rocket plume effects, and [[high-speed flight]] dynamics. On November 20, 1953, the Douglas Skyrocket became the first aircraft to fly at over twice the speed of sound when it attained a speed of Mach 2.005. Like the X-1, the D-558-II could be air-launched using a [[B-29 Superfortress]]. Unlike the X-1, the Skyrocket could also [[takeoff]] from a [[runway]] with the help of [[JATO]] units.

===Controlled Impact Demonstration===
{{Main|Controlled Impact Demonstration}}
[[Image:Boeing 720 Controlled Impact Demonstration.jpg|right|thumb|A remotely piloted [[Boeing 720]] is destroyed in the [[Controlled Impact Demonstration]].]]
The Controlled Impact Demonstration was a joint project with the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to research a new jet fuel that would decrease the damage due to fire in the crash of a large airliner. On December 1, 1984, a remotely piloted [[Boeing 720]] aircraft was flown into specially built ''wing openers'' which tore the wings open, fuel spraying everywhere. Despite the new fuel additive, the resulting fire ball was huge; the fire still took an hour to fully extinguish.

Even though the fuel additive did not prevent a fire, the research was not a complete failure. The additive still prevented the combustion of some fuel which flowed over the fuselage of the aircraft, and served to cool it, similar to how a conventional [[rocket engine]] cools its nozzle. Also, instrumented [[crash test dummies]] were in the airplane for the impact, and provided valuable research into other aspects of crash survivability for the occupants.

===Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment===
[[Image:SR-71 LASRE cold test.jpg|thumb|left|A modern [[Skunk Works]] project leverages an older: [[LASRE]] atop an [[SR-71 Blackbird]].]]
{{Main|Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment}}
LASRE was a [[NASA]] experiment in cooperation with [[Lockheed Martin]] to study a [[reusable launch vehicle]] design based on a linear [[aerospike engine|aerospike]] [[rocket engine]]. The experiment's goal was to provide in-flight data to help [[Lockheed Martin]] validate the computational predictive tools they developed to design the craft. LASRE was a small, half-span model of a lifting body with eight thrust cells of an [[aerospike engine]]. The experiment, mounted on the back of an [[SR-71 Blackbird]] aircraft, operated like a kind of "flying [[wind tunnel]]."

The experiment focused on determining how a reusable launch vehicle's engine plume would affect the aerodynamics of its lifting body shape at specific altitudes and speeds reaching approximately {{convert|750|mph|m/s}}. The interaction of the aerodynamic flow with the engine plume could create drag; design refinements look to minimize that interaction.

===Lunar Landing Research Vehicle===
{{Main|Lunar Landing Research Vehicle}}
[[Image:LLRV 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]]]]
The Lunar Landing Research Vehicle or LLRV was an [[Apollo Project]] era program to build a simulator for the [[Moon landing]]. The LLRVs, humorously referred to as "[[Flying bedstead|Flying Bedsteads]]", were used by the FRC, now known as the Armstrong Flight Research Center, at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], Calif., to study and analyze piloting techniques needed to fly and land the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] in the moon's airless environment.

'''''Canopus in Argos: Archives''''' is a sequence of five [[science fiction]] [[novel]]s by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize in Literature]]-winning author [[Doris Lessing]] which portray a number of societies at different stages of development, over a great period of time. The focus is on accelerated [[evolution]] being aided by advanced species for less advanced species and societies.

The novels take place in the same [[future history]], but do not relate a continuous storyline. Each book covers unrelated events, with the exception of ''Shikasta'' and ''The Sirian Experiments'', which tell the story of accelerated evolution on [[Earth]] through the eyes of [[Canopus|Canopean]]s and [[Sirius|Sirian]]s respectively.

==Novels==
#''[[Shikasta]]'' (1979) – A [[secret history]] of Earth from the perspective of the advanced Canopus civilisation that is thinking in [[Aeon|eons]] rather than centuries. The history spans from the very beginning of life into a future World War Three. It includes the trial of all Europeans for the crimes of colonialism.
#''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980) – Depicts the influence of unknown higher powers on interactions between a series of civilizational "zones" of varying degrees of advancement that encircle the planet Earth. One zone is representative of an overtly feminine high civilisation initially coupled by royal marriage to a militant and male civilisation. The novel culminates with the latter, male, civilisation allying with a tribal female realm again following directives from Canopus.
#''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' (1980) – Focuses, like ''Shikasta'', on the history of Earth, but from the perspective of visitors from [[Sirius]] rather than Canopus. The Sirians are depicted as a highly managed society, with fascist overtones, that attempts experiments on lesser civilisations while trying to mitigate the stagnation of their ruling class. The story is told from the perspective of Ambien II, one of a peer group of five who rule Sirius.
#''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' (1982) – The story of the civilisation on a planet that, because of interstellar "re-alignments", is slowly facing extinction, and Canopus's relationship with them. The story is greatly influenced by [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s [[Terra Nova Expedition|Antarctic]] expedition, and is Lessing's homage to it.
#''[[The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire]]'' (1983) – A story of Canopean agents on a less advanced planet; explores hazards of [[rhetoric]] and mirrors events in revolutionary societies such as [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Communist Russia]].

The five books have also appeared compiled in a single volume entitled ''Canopus in Argos: Archives'' (1992, {{ISBN|0-679-74184-4}}).

==Background==
When Lessing began writing ''Shikasta'' she intended it to be a "single self-contained book". But as her [[fictional universe]] developed, she found she had ideas for more than just one book, and ended up writing a series of five.&lt;ref name=Remarks/&gt;

The ''[[Canopus]] in [[Argo Navis|Argos]]'' series as a whole falls into categories of [[social science fiction|social]] or [[soft science fiction]] ("space fiction" in Lessing's own words&lt;ref name=Remarks&gt;{{cite book | last = Lessing | first = Doris | authorlink = Doris Lessing | title = Shikasta | year = 1994 | origyear = 1979 | publisher = Flamingo | location = London | isbn = 0-00-712776-6 |chapter= Some Remarks | page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;) because of its focus on characterisation and social-cultural issues, and its lack of emphasis of the details of scientific technology. This set of writings represented a major shift of focus for Lessing, influenced by [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[mystical]] themes in [[Sufism]], in particular by [[Idries Shah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mural.uv.es/vemivein/biography.html |title=Doris Lessing |work=Mural |accessdate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later wrote several essays on Sufism which were published in her essay collection, ''Time Bites'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2007/bio-bibl.html |title=Doris Lessing: Biobibliographical Notes |work=NobelPrize.org |accessdate=18 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012225914/https://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2007/bio-bibl.html |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The ''Canopus in Argos'' was not well received by some reviewers and readers,&lt;ref name=Hazelton&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/10/specials/lessing-space.html?_r=1 |title=Doris Lessing on Feminism, Communism and 'Space Fiction' |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Lesley |last=Hazelton |authorlink=Lesley Hazleton |date=1982-07-25 |accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; who felt that Lessing had abandoned her "rational worldview".&lt;ref name=Galin&gt;{{cite book | last = Galin | first = Müge | title = Between East and West: Sufism in the Novels of Doris Lessing | publisher = [[State University of New York Press]] | year = 1997 | location = [[Albany, New York]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EbHys4CzN0YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1 | page = 21 | isbn = 0-7914-3383-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted her to write in the Preface to the third book, ''The Sirian Experiments'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lessing | first = Doris | authorlink = Doris Lessing | title = The Sirian Experiments | year = 1994 | origyear = 1980 | publisher = Flamingo | location = London | isbn = 0-00-654721-4 |chapter= Preface | page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=I would so like it if reviewers and readers could see this series, ''Canopus in Argos: Archive'', as a framework that enables me to tell (I hope) a beguiling tale or two; to put questions, both to myself and to others; to explore ideas and sociological possibilities.}}

Later Lessing discovered that many younger people who had read the ''Canopus'' series were not interested in her other works. They told her, "Oh, realism, I can't be bothered with that."&lt;ref name=Donoghue&gt;{{cite web  | last = Donoghue | first = Denis | authorlink = Denis Donoghue (academic) | title = Alice, The Radical Homemaker | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 22 September 1985 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/10/specials/lessing-terrorist.html | accessdate = 4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' and ''The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five'' were adapted for the opera by composer [[Philip Glass]] with [[libretto]]s written by Lessing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2431&amp;State_2905=2&amp;composerId_2905=540 |title=Philip Glass |work=Chester Music and Novello &amp; Company |accessdate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Centre for Applied Genomics''' is a genome centre in the Research Institute of [[Sickkids|The Hospital for Sick Children]], and is affiliated with the [[University of Toronto]]. TCAG also operates as a Science and Technology Innovation Centre of [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genomecanada.ca/en/portfolio/science.aspx Genome Canada Science and Technology Platforms]&lt;/ref&gt; with an emphasis on [[next-generation sequencing]] (NGS) and [[bioinformatics]] support. Research at TCAG focuses on the [[genetics|genetic]] and genomic basis of human variability, health and disease, including research on the genetics of [[autism spectrum disorder]] and structural variation of the [[human genome]]. The Centre is located in the Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning in downtown [[Toronto]], Canada.

==History==
The need for a centralized core facility for human genome research at [[Sickkids|SickKids Hospital]] prompted the establishment of The Centre for Applied Genomics (TCAG) in 1998. The Founding Director and Associate Director were Drs. [[Lap-Chee Tsui]] and [[Stephen W. Scherer]], respectively. Dr. Scherer is now the Scientific Director.

Funding from the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI) enabled TCAG to form by consolidating existing core facilities including the [[Medical Research Council of Canada]] Genome Resource Facility, the [http://www.cgdn.ca/ Canadian Genetic Diseases Network] (CGDN) large insert clone core, the CGDN [[Dna sequencing|DNA Sequencing]] Core and the SickKids Biotechnology Service [[Dna sequencing|DNA Sequencing]] and Synthesis labs. A genome-wide [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] [[genotyping]] laboratory at the [[OHRI|Ottawa Health Research Institute]] led by Dr. Dennis  Bulman was added. Subsequently, operational funding from the [[CIHR]] Genomics Special Projects panel provided for additional staff.

In 2001, a proposal entitled "Genome Resource Core Platform" was submitted to the then newly formed [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada]. This provided operational support, enhancing existing facilities and adding a mouse [[genotyping]] core at the University of Toronto led by Dr. Lucy Osborne. In 2002, SickKids built a new [[Affymetrix]] [[microarray]] facility. This core has quickly grown to become the largest such service centre in Canada and is in the top ten in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Data provided by Affymetrix, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, TCAG entered a second phase of development driven by a $12 million [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]]/[http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/Home.html Ontario Innovation Trust] funded project entitled "Integrative Genomics for Health Research",&lt;ref&gt;Integrative Genomics for Health Research news item (Ontario Innovation Trust website) [http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/SStories21-40/StorySickKidsScherer.html]&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for consolidation of the mouse [[genotyping]] core with the SickKids facilities. This award also supported the establishment of an "Ontario Population Genomics Repository" (OPGP) to be used as controls in studies of common diseases. To efficiently complete this project, TCAG partnered with Dr. John McLaughlin's group at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)]].

In May, 2004, an application to the newly announced [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]] Research Hospital Fund resulted in a $10.9 million award to build out lab space and consolidate all operations on the 14th and 15th floors of the Toronto Medical Discovery Tower (TMDT) in the [[MaRS Discovery District]]. TCAG was the first occupant of TMDT (in August, 2005), quickly followed by other SickKids scientists. Investments in computer infrastructure from the 2003 [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]]/[http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/Home.html Ontario Innovation Trust] competition resulted in the establishment of new phases of the [http://ccb.sickkids.ca/hpf_index.html high-performance computing cluster] (HPF) that is currently used by TCAG and many other users, to allow analysis of large [[genomic]] datasets arising from new [[Dna microarray|microarray]] and [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] technologies. Further enhancements to the TCAG infrastructure were supported by a $10.7 million renewal grant from CFI's Leading Edge Fund competition, entitled "Integrative Genomics for Health Research&amp;nbsp;– Phase II",  awarded in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/News-Room/Past-News/2009/cfi-funding.html SickKids press release, June 18, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a CFI grant entitled "The Centre for Applied Genomics: Paediatric Genomes to Outcomes" provided further infrastructure support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/Newsroom/Past-News/2013/Leading-Edge-Fund-grants.html SickKids kicks off 2013 with two Leading Edge Fund grants, January 13, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, TCAG moved to the Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, a new building housing the SickKids Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tcag.ca/news/news130930.html The Centre for Applied Genomics has moved - news item, TCAG website, October 229, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

TCAG operates in large part on Science and Technology Innovation Centre (STIC) funds from [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada], administered by the [http://www.ontariogenomics.ca Ontario Genomics Institute].

==Research==
Current research at TCAG centres around large-scale projects performed by facility personnel, including support of [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada] projects, and a significant focus on the genetics of [[autism spectrum disorder]]s and structural variation of the [[human genome]]. Service work is also performed for over 600 other academic, private sector and government labs each year, drawn from 30 different countries and spanning a wide variety of research disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Data from progress reports submitted to the Ontario Genomics Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Past research at TCAG is reflected by numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications. In 2008, TCAG Scientific Directors, Associate Scientists and staff co-authored 58 peer-reviewed manuscripts dependent in some way (either entirely, or in part) on the platform infrastructure, as documented in [[Pubmed|PubMed]].&lt;ref&gt;PubMed search for publications authored by these individuals during calendar year 2008, excluding Dr. Brudno who was added in 2009 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, over 270 such papers have been published.&lt;ref&gt;PubMed search for publications authored by these individuals, 2002 through present, excluding Drs. Brudno and Beyene who were added more recently [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support of other researchers worldwide is found in many similar publications, with at least 145 papers in scholarly journals, book chapters, or graduate thesis dissertations acknowledging support or use of database resources during 2008 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Google Scholar full-text search results:  publications referring to The Centre for Applied Genomics or the Database of Genomic Variants, either in the Acknowledgments section or body text, and published either electronically or in print.

==Core Facilities==
[[Image:TCAG lab.jpg|right|320px|thumb|TCAG DNA Synthesis Facility]]
TCAG employs a variety of genomic technologies to support different types of experimentation. These are organized into separate Core Facilities, with dedicated managers.

===Informatics and Biostatistics===
The [[Bioinformatics]] team assists with data handling and analysis, and develops new algorithms and analytical methods, with a focus on the analysis of high-throughput ("next-generation") sequencing data. The Statistical Analysis group provides project consultation and [[Statistical power|power analysis]], statistical analysis ([[Genetics|genetic]], [[DNA microarray|microarray]], and [[Biochemical pathway|pathway]] data, [[epidemiology]], [[population genetics]]), and [[copy number variation]] analysis, as well as developing new statistical methods.

===DNA Sequencing and Synthesis===
The facility uses conventional capillary [[Sanger sequencing]] on [[Applied Biosystems]] 3730xl instruments, governed by a [[Lims|Laboratory Information Management System]] (LIMS). Additionally, [[next-generation sequencing]] (NGS) using [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] HiSeq 2500 and HiScan SQ instruments, [[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]] Ion Proton and [[Applied Biosystems]] SOLiD instruments, and a [[454 Life Sciences|454]]/[[Roche Diagnostics|Roche]] GS-FLX Titanium instrument is performed. A key component of this facility is the use of high-performance computing and [[bioinformatics]] support for NGS analysis.

The [[Oligonucleotide#Synthesis|Oligonucleotide Synthesis]] component of this facility makes conventional, long (up to 120 [[DNA base|bases]]) and modified [[oligonucleotide]]s, and purifies these by desalting, cartridge or high-performance liquid chromatography ([[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]]).

===Microarray and Genetic Analysis===
The [[Microarray]] and Gene Expression Core Facility has a dedicated manager, and operates technologies from [[Affymetrix]], [[Agilent]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]]. Additionally, there is a wide variety of analytical [[software]] packages available for on-site data analysis.

===Cytogenomics and Genome Resources===
The Cytogenomics and Genome Resources Core Facility has a single manager between these two functions. Cytogenomics includes karyotyping and spectral (SKY) [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] (for [[mouse]], human, and other species), fluorescent ''in situ'' hybridization ([[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]]) mapping, transgenic insertion site mapping (G-to-FISH mapping) and clone labeling for [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]] experiments. The Genome Resources components includes a clone repository (Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) [[cDNA]] ([[mouse]] and human), genomic clones including human [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s (BACs)) and provides project consultation and design assistance ([[Annotation#Computational biology|annotation]], database [[Information retrieval|queries]], probe selection). It also provides [[Cdna library|cDNA library]] screening and [[quantitative PCR]].

===Genetic Analysis===
The Genetic Analysis area includes capillary-based [[genotyping]] ([[Applied Biosystems]] [[TaqMan]] and SNaPshot, [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]]s), custom [[genotyping]] (e.g. [[heteroduplex]] analysis), [[mouse]] genotyping (for cross progeny and [[genetic linkage]] analysis), and [[methylation]] analysis (for [[epigenetics]] research).

===Biobanking===
The Biobanking Core Facility has its own dedicated manager. It performs [[White blood cell|white cell]] immortalization (from blood) and banking, [[fibroblast]] [[Cell culture|culture]] and banking, culture and banking of other cell types including non-human cells, [[Nuclear DNA|genomic DNA]] preparation from blood, [[saliva]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] or [[Cell (biology)|cells]], and [[Whole genome amplification|whole-genome amplification]] (WGA).

==Funding sources==
TCAG is funded by several agencies, including the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI), [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada] through the [http://www.ontariogenomics.ca Ontario Genomics Institute], the [[Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation]].

The '''Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies''' ('''CCCS''') was a research centre at the University of Birmingham, England. It was founded in 1964 by [[Richard Hoggart]], its first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turner |first1=Graeme |title=British cultural studies : an introduction |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415252287 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 to 2002, the Centre played a major role in developing the field of [[cultural studies]].

== History ==
The Centre was the focus for what became known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies, or, more generally, 'British cultural studies'.  After its first director, [[Richard Hoggart]] departed in 1968, the Centre was led by [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] (1969-1979). He was succeeded by Richard Johnson (1980-1987).  The Birmingham CCCS approach to culture and politics evolved from a complex moment within British post-war history: the rise of the anti-Stalinist New Left; the promotion of adult education in Britain after World War II; the "Americanization" of British popular culture and the growth of mass communication in the decades after 1945; the growing multiculturalism of British society; and, the eventual influence within British academia of new critical methods like semiotics and structuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Stuart |title=Race, Culture, and Communications: Looking Backward and Forward at Cultural Studies |journal=Rethinking Marxism |date=March 1992 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=10–18 |doi=10.1080/08935699208657998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dworkin |first1=Dennis |title=Cultural Marxism in postwar Britain : history, the new left, and the origins of cultural studies |date=1997 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822319144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on a variety of influences ([[feminism]], [[structuralism]], [[Marxism]] - - especially the work of [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[sociology]], [[critical race theory]], and [[post-structuralism]]), over the course of several decades the Centre pioneered a variety of approaches to the study of culture, including: ideological analysis; studies of working-class cultures and subcultures; the role of media audiences; feminist cultural research; hegemonic struggles in state politics; and the place of race in social and cultural processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shulman |first1=Norma |title="Conditions of their Own Making: An Intellectual History of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham" |journal=Canadian Journal of Communication |date=1993 |volume=18 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of this development can be found in the series of stencilled occasional papers the Centre published between 1973 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stencilled Occasional Papers of the Birmingham CCCS - University of Birmingham |url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/research/projects/cccs/publications/stencilled-occasional-papers.aspx |website=www.birmingham.ac.uk |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;   


== Noted staff members ==
The Centre produced many key studies and developed the careers of prominent researchers and academics. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who became the centre's director in 1968, developed his seminal ''Encoding/Decoding'' model here. Of special importance is the collective research that led to Policing the Crisis (1978), a study of law and order campaigns that focused on "mugging" (a code for street violence). This anticipated many of the law and order themes of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Conservative government in the 1980s. Other noted Centre books include 'Off-Centre: Feminism and Cultural Studies'; 'Resistance through Rituals'; 'The Empire Strikes Back'; 'Border Patrols: Policing the Boundaries of Heterosexuality'.

Richard Johnson was later director and encouraged research in social and cultural history. The centre staff included Maureen McNeil, noted theorist of culture and science, Michael Green who focused on media,  cultural policy and regional cultures in the midlands, and Ann Gray, culture and media.

Graduates and associates of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and the Department of Cultural Studies include: [[Paul Gilroy]] (King's College London) theorist of culture and race, [[Angela McRobbie]] (Goldsmiths) theorist of consumption, femininity and popular culture, Celia Lury (Goldsmiths) feminist theory and consumption, Jackie Stacey (University of Manchester), film, cancer culture and science in culture, Sarah Franklin (LSE) science as culture, Debbie Epstein (University of Cardiff), education, childhood and youth studies, sexuality and popular culture, Peter Redman (The Open University) masculinities, psychoanalytic theory, Mary Jane Kehily (The Open University) childhood and youth studies, Joyce Canaan (City University, Birmingham) cultures of higher education, Anoop Nayak (Newcastle University) geographies of race,  Deborah Lynn Steinberg (Warwick University) science cultures, sexuality and popular culture, Hilary Pilkington (Warwick University) Russia and youth subcultures, Sue Wright (Danish Pedagogic University) cultures of higher education, Hazel Carby (Yale) race and literature, David Parker (Nottingham University), Mica Nava (University of East London) media studies,  Graham Dawson (University of Brighton) historical cultural studies, Chris Griffin (Bath University) girls and youth cultures,  and Adrian Kear (Aberystwith University) performance studies and psychoanalysis, Kevin J. Brehony (Roehampton University) historical studies of educational ideologies.

[[Empirical]] researchers included David Morley and Charlotte Brunsdon, who produced ''[[The Nationwide Project]]'' at the Centre. Dorothy Hobson's research about the reception of ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' was based on her MA dissertation. Another important empirical researcher is [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], who received his PhD from the CCCS in 1972 and stayed as a researcher there until 1981.

In later years, on the dissolution of the Centre and formation of the Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS), [[Sadie Plant]], noted cybertheorist and feminist (author of ''Zeroes + Ones: Digital Women and the New Technoculture''), taught there, as did Jorge Larrain, the well-known Chilean sociologist and cultural historian, author of ''Identity and Modernity in Latin America'' and John Gabriel, sociologist of race. [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]], a Sociologist with interests in Information Society issues and sympathy for the 'cultural turn', joined the newly formed Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology in 1999, but left for City University London when the department was abruptly closed in 2002.

== Closure in 2002 ==
{{tone|date=December 2014}}
The new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology was unexpectedly and abruptly closed in 2002, a move the university's senior management described as 'restructuring'. The immediate reason given for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's Research Assessment Exercise of 2001, though a dean from the university described the decision as a consequence of "inexperienced 'macho management.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Frank|title=Cultural Studies and Sociology at, and After, the Closure of the Birmingham School|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2004|volume=18|issue=6|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four of the department's fourteen members of staff were to be "retained" and its hundreds of students (nearly 250 undergraduates and postgraduates at that time, many from abroad) to be transferred to other departments. In the ensuing dispute most department staff left. There were protests against the decision to close Cultural Studies and Sociology from around the world and the University received much adverse criticism.

In April 2002, according to student testimonies, rumors began to circulate that the Department was going to be closed down because it had received a "very bad" 3a mark in a recent [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (RAE). Despite assurances as to the contrary, on June 21, 2002, right after the end of term, staff members received emails informing them of a decision that had already been taken to close down the Department. The decision was to be ratified on June 26.

Students and staff began a campaign to save the school, which gained considerable attention in the national press (see links below) and sparked numerous letters of support from former [[alumni]] all over the world. The main argument of the campaigners was that the Department was being closed down because of economic pressures relating to the public funding of British universities in accordance with RAE marks. The Department of Cultural Studies was a top money-making unit inside the School of Social Sciences.

Additionally, concerns were expressed that the Department was being "belatedly punished" for its political [[Radicalization|radicalism]], as one journalist put it. Indeed, the unreservedly [[leftwing]] Department's long history of conflict with the University's administration was well known to all{{dubious|date=August 2016}} who had studied at the [[University of Birmingham]] between the 1960s and the 1980s.{{Cn|date=August 2016}}

Of the four staff members who were "retained", one was attached to the Department of Social Policy, one to the Department of English, and one to the Institute of European Studies. The remaining ten staff members were invited to retire voluntarily in return for a severance package (one year's pay).

Professor [[David Marsh (political scientist)|David Marsh]], a political sociologist from the Department of Political Science and International Studies (POLSIS), was drafted in as temporary head of a new Department of Sociology, with Cultural Studies dropped from the title. Further posts were created in Sociology during 2003.

The Department had been top of the Guardian league table for Sociology before its closure and it continues to excel in this poll. The Department was recently ranked fourth in Guardian league tables for Sociology.

== 50th anniversary ==

{{update-section|date=August 2016}}
The 50th anniversary of the establishment of CCCS came in 2014. To mark this occasion, academics at the [[University of Birmingham]]– in collaboration with former members of staff at the Centre, including Richard Johnson, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and Michael Green, created an archive of CCCS-related material at the Cadbury Research Library at Birmingham.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9568">[[File:Chemotaxis, Capillary Tube Assay.svg|thumb|The process of chemotaxis can be demonstrated using a capillary tube assay(shown above). The motile prokaryotes can sense chemicals in their environment and change their motility accordingly. When no chemicals are present, movement is completely random. When a repellent or attractant chemical is present, the motility changes; runs become longer and tumbles become less frequent so that the net movement towards or away from the chemical can be achieved. The net movement can be seen in the beaker, where the bacteria accumulate around the attractant, and away from the repellent.

'''Chemotaxis assays''' are experimental tools for evaluation of [[chemotactic]] ability of [[prokaryotic]] or [[eukaryotic]] cells.
A wide variety of techniques have been developed. Some techniques are [[qualitative property|qualitative]] - allowing an investigator to approximately determine a cell's chemotacic affinity for an analyte - while others are [[quantitative property|quantitative]], allowing a precise measurement of this affinity.

== Quality control ==
In general, the most important requisite is to calibrate the [[incubation time]] of the assay both to the model cell and the ligand to be evaluated. Too short incubation time results no cells in the sample, while too long time perturbs the concentration gradients and measures more [[chemokinesis|chemokinetic]] than [[chemotactic]] responses.

The most commonly used techniques are grouped into two main groups:

== Agar-plate techniques ==
[[Image:Chtx-asay-agar.PNG|thumb|right|450px|Chemotaxis assays with agar plates]]
This way of evaluation deals with [[agar-agar]] or [[gelatine]] containing semi-solid layers made prior to the experiment. Small wells are cut into the layer and filled with cells and the test substance. Cells can migrate towards the chemical gradient in the semi solid layer or under the layer as well. Some variations of the technique deal also with wells and parallel channels connected by a cut at the start of the experiment (PP-technique). Radial arrangement of PP-technique (3 or more channels) provides the possibility to compare chemotactic activity of different cell populations or study preference between ligands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Kőhidai L. | title= Method for determination of chemoattraction in Tetrahymena pyriformis.| journal= Curr Microbiol | year= 1995| volume= 30| pages= 251–3 | doi= 10.1007/BF00293642 | pmid= 7765899 | issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting of cells: positive responder cells could be counted from the front of migrating cells, after staining or in native conditions in light microscope.

== Two-chamber techniques ==
[[Image:Chtx-twochamber-techn.PNG|thumb|right|450px|Chemotaxis chamber assays]]

=== Boyden chamber ===
Chambers isolated by filters are proper tools for accurate determination of chemotactic behavior. The pioneer type of these chambers was constructed by Boyden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Boyden, S.V. | title= The chemotactic effect of mixtures of antibody and antigen on polymorphonuclear leucocytes. | journal= J Exp Med | year= 1962| volume= 115 | issue= 3| pages=453–66 | doi= 10.1084/jem.115.3.453 | pmid= 13872176 | pmc= 2137509}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motile cells are placed into the upper chamber, while fluid containing the test substance is filled into the lower one. The size of the motile cells to be investigated determines the pore size of the filter; it is essential to choose a diameter which allows active transmigration. For modelling ''in vivo'' conditions, several protocols prefer coverage of filter with molecules of [[extracellular matrix]] ([[collagen]], [[elastin]] etc.) Efficiency of the measurements was increased by development of multiwell chambers (e.g. NeuroProbe), where 24, 96, 384 samples are evaluated in parallel. Advantage of this variant is that several parallels are assayed in identical conditions.

=== Bridge chambers ===
In another setting the chambers are connected side by side horizontally (Zigmond chamber)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| author=Zigmond S.H.
| title=Ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to orient in gradients of chemotactic factors
| journal=Journal of Cell Biology
| year=1977
| volume=75
| issue=2
| pages=606–616
| doi=10.1083/jcb.75.2.606
| citeseerx=10.1.1.336.4181
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as concentric rings on a slide (Dunn chamber)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zicha D. |author2=Dunn G.A. |author3=Brown A.F. | title= A new direct-viewing chemotaxis chamber.| journal= J Cell Sci | year=  1991 | volume= 99| pages=769–75|pmid= 1770004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentration gradient develops on a narrow connecting bridge between the chambers and the number of migrating cells is also counted on the surface of the bridge by light microscope. In some cases the bridge between the two chambers is filled with agar and cells have to "[[Bacterial gliding|glide]]" in this semisolid layer.

=== Capillary techniques ===
Some capillary techniques provide also a chamber like arrangement, however, there is no filter between the cells and the test substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leick V. |author2=Helle J. | title= A quantitative assay for ciliate chemotaxis.| journal= Anal Biochem | year= 1983| volume= 135| pages=466–9 | doi= 10.1016/0003-2697(83)90713-3 | pmid= 6660520 | issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantitative results are gained by the multiwell type of this probe using 4-8-12-channel pipettes. Accuracy of the pipette and increased number of the parallel running samples is the great advantage of this test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Kőhidai, L., Lemberkovits, É. and Csaba, G.| title= Molecule dependent chemotactic responses of Tetrahymena pyriformis elicited by volatile oils.| journal= Acta Protozool | year= 1995| volume= 34| pages= 181–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting of cells: positive responder cells are count from the lower chamber (long incubation time) or from the filter (short incubation time). For detection of cells general staining techniques (e.g. [[trypan blue]]) or special probes (e.g. mt-dehydrogenase detection with MTT assay) are used. Labelled (e.g. [[fluorochrome]]s) cells are also used, in some assays cells get labelled during transmigration the filter.

== Other techniques ==
[[Image:Chtx-other-techn.PNG|thumb|right|450px|Other chemotaxis assay techniques]]
Besides the above-mentioned two, most commonly used family of techniques a wide range of protocols were developed to measure chemotactic activity. Some of them are only qualitative, like aggregation tests, where small pieces of agar or filters are placed onto a slide and accumulation of cells around is measured.

In another semiquantitative technique cells are overlaid the test substance and changes in [[opalescence]] of the originally cell-free compartment is recorded during the incubation time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koppelhus U. |author2=Hellung-Larsen P. |author3=Leick V. | title= An improved quantitative assay for chemokinesis in Tetrahymena.| journal= Biol Bull| year= 1994 | volume= 187| pages= 8–15 | doi= 10.2307/1542160 | pmid= 7918798 | issue= 1 | publisher= Marine Biological Laboratory | jstor= 1542160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third very frequently used, however, qualitative technique is the T-[[maze]] and its adaptations for microplates. In the original version a container drilled in a peg is filled with cells. Then the peg is twisted and the cells get contact with two other containers filled with different substances. The incubation is stopped with resetting the peg, the cell number is counted from the containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Houten J. |author2=Martel E. |author3=Kasch T. | title= Kinetic analysis of chemokinesis of Paramecium.| journal= J Protozool | year= 1982| volume= 29| pages= 226–30| pmid=7097615 | issue= 2 | doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.1982.tb04016.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, lately,{{When|date=January 2018}} microfluidic devices have been more and more frequently used to test quantitatively, and precisely, for chemotaxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seymour J. R. |author2=J. R. Ahmed |author3=Marcos S. R | title= A microfluidic chemotaxis assay to study microbial behavior in diffusing nutrient patches.| journal= Limnol.

'''Command and control''' or '''C2''' is a "set of organizational and technical attributes and processes ... [that] employs human, physical, and information resources to solve problems and accomplish missions" to achieve the goals of an organization or enterprise, according to  a 2015 definition by [[military science|military scientists]] [[Marius Vassiliou]], [[David S. Alberts]] and [[Jonathan R. Agre]],&lt;ref&gt;Vassiliou, Marius, David S. Alberts, and Jonathan R. Agre (2015). "C2 Re-Envisioned: the Future of the Enterprise." CRC Press; New York; p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite journal |title=Re-conceptualizing Command and Control |journal=Canadian Military Journal |date=Spring 2002 |pages=53–63 |volume=3 |number=1 |author1=Ross Pigeau |author2=Carol McCann |url=http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo3/no1/doc/53-64-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term often refers to a military system.

Versions of the [[United States Army]] [[List of United States Army Field Manuals|''Field Manual 3-0'']] circulated circa 1999, define C2 in a [[military]] organization as the exercise of [[authority]] and direction by a properly designated [[commanding officer]] over assigned and attached [[Armed forces|forces]] in the accomplishment of a [[Military operation|mission]].&lt;ref&gt;''para''&amp;nbsp;5-2, [[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 3-0|United States Army Field Manual: FM&amp;nbsp;3–0]]&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |author=Headquarters, Department of the Army |authorlink=United States Department of the Army#Headquarters, Department of the Army |title=FM&amp;nbsp;3–0, Operations |date=14 June 2001 |place=Washington, DC |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office|GPO]] |oclc=50597897 |url=http://155.217.58.58/cgi–bin/atdl.dll/fm/3-0/fm3-0.exe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020219134603/http://155.217.58.58/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/fm/3-0/fm3-0.exe | archivedate=19 February 2002 |deadurl=yes |format=PDF inside [[Zip (file format)|ZIP]]–[[Self-extracting archive|SFX]] |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;br/&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-0.pdf Newer versions of FM 3-0] do not define ''Command and control'', even though they use the term extensively.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Builder, Carl H., Bankes, Steven C., Nordin, Richard, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/2006/MR775.pdf "Command Concepts – A Theory Derived from the Practice of Command and Control"], MR775, [[RAND]], {{ISBN|0-8330-2450-7}}, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1988 [[NATO]] definition, command and control is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated individual over assigned resources in the accomplishment of a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modelling Command and Control: Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork |author1=Neville Stanton |author2=Christopher Baber |author3=Don Harris |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |date=1 January 2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Modelling_Command_and_Control.html?id=chqJM48ZBBkC&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Australian Defence Force]] definition, similar to that of NATO, emphasises that C2 is the system empowering designated personnel to exercise lawful authority and direction over assigned forces for the accomplishment of missions and tasks.&lt;ref name=ADDP001&gt;{{cite web |title=ADDP 00.1 Command and Control |date=27 May 2009 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |pages=1–2 |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/adfwc/Documents/DoctrineLibrary/ADDP/ADDP_00_1_Command_and_Control.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Australian doctrine goes on to state: The use of agreed terminology and definitions is fundamental to any C2 system and the development of joint doctrine and procedures. The definitions in the following paragraphs have some agreement internationally, although not every potential ally will use the terms with exactly the same meaning.&lt;ref name=ADDP001/&gt;)

==Overview==

===US perspective===
The US ''[[Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/ DoD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms], www.dtic.mil&lt;/ref&gt; defines command and control as: "The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Also called C2. Source: JP 1".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/data/c/3226.html Command and control] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629002310/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/data/c/3226.html |date=29 June 2011 }}, Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, www.dtic.mil&lt;/ref&gt;

The edition of the ''Dictionary'' "As Amended Through April 2010" elaborates, "Command and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and [[Military operation|operations]] in the accomplishment of the mission."&lt;ref name=JP12010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joint Chiefs of Staff (U.S.)|title=Joint Publication 1-02. Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (As Amended Through 31 January 2011)|date=8 November 2010|entry=Command and Control|page=65|url=http://ra.defense.gov/Portals/56/Documents/rtm/jp1_02.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this sentence is missing from the "command and control" entry for the edition "As Amended Through 15 August 2014."&lt;ref name=JP12014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joint Chiefs of Staff (U.S.)|title=Joint Publication 1-02. Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (As Amended Through 15 August 2014)|date=8 November 2010|entry=Command and Control|page=44|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commanding officers are assisted in executing these tasks by specialized [[Staff (military)|staff officers]] and enlisted personnel. These ''military staff'' are a group of officers and enlisted personnel that provides a bi-directional [[information flow|flow of information]] between a [[Officer (armed forces)|commanding officer]] and subordinate [[military units]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The purpose of a military staff is mainly that of providing accurate, timely information which by category represents information on which command decisions are based. The key application is that of decisions that effectively manage unit resources. While information flow toward the commander is a priority, information that is useful or contingent in nature is communicated to lower staffs and units.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Computer security industry===
{{main article|Command and control (malware)}}
This term is also in common use within the [[computer security]] industry and in the context of [[cyberwarfare]]. Here the term refers to the influence an attacker has over a compromised computer system that they control. For example, a valid usage of the term is to say that attackers use "command and control infrastructure" to issue "command and control instructions" to their victims. Advanced analysis of command and control methodologies can be used to identify attackers, associate attacks, and disrupt ongoing malicious activity.&lt;ref&gt;Command Five Pty Ltd, [http://www.commandfive.com/papers/C5_APT_C2InTheFifthDomain.pdf "Command and Control in the Fifth Domain"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227035957/http://www.commandfive.com/papers/C5_APT_C2InTheFifthDomain.pdf |date=27 February 2012 }}, February 2012, www.commandfive.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivative terms==
There are a plethora of derivative terms which emphasise different aspects, uses and sub-domains of C2. These terms come with a plethora of associated abbreviations – for example, in addition to C2, command and control is also often abbreviated as C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and sometimes as C&amp;C.

==Command and control centers==
[[File:Soviet command ship SSV-33.jpg|thumb|The Soviet nuclear-powered command and control naval ship ''SSV-33 Ural''.]]
A '''command and control center''' is typically a secure room or building in a government, military or [[prison]] facility that operates as the agency's dispatch center, surveillance monitoring center, coordination office and alarm monitoring center all in one. Command and control centers are operated by a government or municipal agency.

Various branches of the [[US military]] such as the [[US Coast Guard]] and [[US Navy|Navy]] have command and control centers. They are also common in many large correctional facilities.

A command and control center that is used by a military unit in a deployed location is usually called a "command post".&lt;ref&gt;[http://peoc3t.monmouth.army.mil/cp/cpsi_cpp.html US Army PEO C3T – Project Manager, Command Posts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511155756/http://peoc3t.monmouth.army.mil/cp/cpsi_cpp.html |date=11 May 2010 }}, peoc3t.monmouth.army.mil&lt;/ref&gt; A warship has a [[Combat Information Center]] for tactical control of the ship's resources, but commanding a fleet or joint operation requires additional space for commanders and staff plus [[C4I]] facilities provided on a [[Flagship]] (e.g., aircraft carriers), sometimes a [[Command ship]] or upgraded logistics ship such as [[USS Coronado (AGF-11)|USS ''Coronado'']].

==Command and control warfare==
Command and control warfare encompasses all the military tactics that use communications technology. It can be abbreviated as C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;W. An older name for these tactics is "signals warfare", derived from the name given to communications by the military. Newer names include [[information operations]] and [[information warfare]].

The following techniques are combined:
* [[Operations security]] (OPSEC)
* [[Military deception]]
* [[Psychological operations]] (PSYOP)
* [[Electronic warfare]] (EW)
* [[Psychological warfare]]
* Cyber Operations
with the physical destruction of enemy communications facilities. The objective is to deny [[information]] to the enemy and so disrupt its [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] capabilities. At the same time precautions are taken to protect friendly command and control capabilities against retaliation.

In addition to targeting the enemy's [[Command and control (military)|command and control]], [[information warfare]] can be directed to the enemy's [[politics|politicians]] and other civilian communications.

{{Beyond the Standard Model}}
In [[cosmology]], the '''cosmological constant problem''' or '''vacuum catastrophe''' is the disagreement between the observed values of [[vacuum energy]] [[energy density|density]] (the small value of the [[cosmological constant]]) and theoretical large value of [[zero-point energy]] suggested by [[quantum field theory]].

Depending on the [[Planck energy]] cutoff and other factors, the discrepancy is as high as 120 orders of magnitude,&lt;ref name="AdlerCasey1995" /&gt; a state of affairs described by physicists as "the largest discrepancy between theory and experiment in all of science"&lt;ref name="AdlerCasey1995" /&gt; and "the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics."&lt;ref name=Hobson&gt;{{cite book |author=MP Hobson, GP Efstathiou &amp; AN Lasenby |year=2006 |title=General Relativity: An introduction for physicists  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dryXCWR7EIC&amp;pg=PA187 |page=187 |edition=Reprint |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-82951-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The basic problem of a vacuum energy producing a gravitational effect was identified as early as 1916 by [[Walther Nernst]]. &lt;ref name=Nernst&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=W Nernst
 |year=1916
 |title=Über einen Versuch von quantentheoretischen Betrachtungen zur Annahme stetiger Energieänderungen zurückzukehren

|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=April 2017}} The value was predicted {{according to whom|date=April 2017}} to be either zero or very small{{why|date=April 2017}}, so that the theoretical problem was already apparent, and began to be actively discussed in the 1970s.

With the development of [[inflationary cosmology]] in the 1980s, the problem became much more important: as cosmic inflation is driven by vacuum energy, differences in modeling vacuum energy leads to huge differences in the resulting cosmologies.&lt;ref&gt;S. Weinberg “The cosmological constant problem”, Review of Modern Physics 61 (1989), 1-23. {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.61.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=April 2017}}

==Quantum description==
After the development of quantum field theory in the 1940s, the first to address contributions of quantum fluctuations to the cosmological constant was [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|Zel’dovich]] (1967, 1968).&lt;ref&gt;Zel’dovich, Y.B., ‘Cosmological Constant and Elementary Particles’
JETP letters 6 (1967), 316-317 and ‘The Cosmological Constant and the Theory of Elementary
Particles’ Soviet Physics Uspekhi 11 (1968), 381-393.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2017}} In quantum mechanics, the vacuum itself should experience quantum fluctuations. In general relativity, those quantum fluctuations constitute energy that would add to the cosmological constant. However, this calculated vacuum energy density is many orders of magnitude bigger than the observed cosmological constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A simple explanation of mysterious space-stretching ‘dark energy?’|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/simple-explanation-mysterious-space-stretching-dark-energy|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|date=10 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original estimates of the degree of mismatch were as high as 120 orders of magnitude; however, modern research suggests that, when [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz invariance]] is taken into account, the degree of mismatch is closer to 60 orders of magnitude.&lt;ref name="afraid to ask"&gt;Martin, Jerome. "Everything you always wanted to know about the cosmological constant problem (but were afraid to ask)." Comptes Rendus Physique 13.6-7 (2012): 566-665.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calculated vacuum energy is a positive, rather than negative, contribution to the cosmological constant because the existing vacuum has negative quantum-mechanical ''pressure'', and in general relativity, the gravitational effect of negative pressure is a kind of repulsion. (Pressure here is defined as the flux of [[Momentum#Quantum mechanical|quantum-mechanical momentum]] across a surface.) Roughly, the vacuum energy is calculated by summing over all known quantum-mechanical fields, taking into account interactions and self-interactions between the ground states, and then removing all interactions below a minimum "cutoff" wavelength to reflect that existing theories break down and may fail to be applicable around the cutoff scale. Because the energy is dependent on how fields interact within the current vacuum state, the vacuum energy contribution would have been different in the early universe; for example, the vacuum energy would have been significantly different prior to [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking#Higgs mechanism|electroweak symmetry breaking]] during the [[Chronology of the universe#Electroweak symmetry breaking and the quark epoch|quark epoch]].&lt;ref name="afraid to ask" /&gt;

===Renormalization===
The vacuum energy in quantum field theory can be set to any value by renormalization. This view treats the cosmological constant as simply another fundamental physical constant not predicted or explained by theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rugh and Zinkernagel (2002), 36ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a renormalization constant must be chosen very accurately because of the many-orders-of-magnitude discrepancy between theory and observation, and many theorists consider this ad-hoc constant as equivalent to ignoring the problem.&lt;ref name="AdlerCasey1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=Ronald J.|last2=Casey|first2=Brendan|last3=Jacob|first3=Ovid C.|title=Vacuum catastrophe: An elementary exposition of the cosmological constant problem|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=63|issue=7|year=1995|pages=620–626|issn=0002-9505|doi=10.1119/1.17850|bibcode=1995AmJPh..63..620A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed solutions==
Some physicists propose an anthropic solution, and argue that we live in one region of a vast [[multiverse]] that has different regions with different vacuum energies. These [[anthropic argument]]s posit that only regions of small vacuum energy such as the one we live in are reasonably capable of supporting intelligent life. Such arguments have existed in some form since at least 1981. Around 1987, [[Steven Weinberg]] estimated that the maximum allowable vacuum energy for gravitationally-bound structures to form is problematically large, even given the observational data available in 1987, and concluded the anthropic explanation appears to fail; however, more recent estimates by Weinberg and others, based on other considerations, find the bound to be closer to the actual observed level of dark energy.&lt;ref name=linde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martel|first1=Hugo|last2=Shapiro|first2=Paul R.|last3=Weinberg|first3=Steven|title=Likely Values of the Cosmological Constant|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=January 1998|volume=492|issue=1|pages=29–40|doi=10.1086/305016|arxiv=astro-ph/9701099|bibcode=1998ApJ...492...29M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropic arguments gradually gained credibility among many physicists after the discovery of dark energy and the development of the theoretical [[string theory landscape]], but are still derided by a substantial skeptical portion of the scientific community as being problematic to verify. Proponents of anthropic solutions are themselves divided on multiple technical questions surrounding how to calculate the proportion of regions of the universe with various dark energy constants.&lt;ref name=linde&gt;Linde, Andrei. "A brief history of the multiverse." Reports on Progress in Physics 80, no. 2 (2017): 022001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dark universe"&gt;Bull, Philip, Yashar Akrami, Julian Adamek, Tessa Baker, Emilio Bellini, Jose Beltrán Jiménez, Eloisa Bentivegna et al. "Beyond ΛCDM: Problems, solutions, and the road ahead." Physics of the Dark Universe 12 (2016): 56-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proposals involving modifying gravity to diverge from the [[general relativity]]. These proposals face the hurdle that the results of observations and experiments so far have tended to be extremely consistent with general relativity and the ΛCDM model, and inconsistent with thus-far proposed modifications. In addition, some of the proposals are arguably incomplete, because they solve the "new" cosmological constant problem by proposing that the actual cosmological constant is exactly zero rather than a tiny number, but fail to solve the "old" cosmological constant problem of why quantum fluctuations seem to fail to produce substantial vacuum energy in the first place. Nevertheless, many physicists argue that, due in part to a lack of better alternatives, proposals to modify gravity should be considered "one of the most promising routes to tackling" the cosmological constant problem.&lt;ref name="dark universe"/&gt;

===Quantum field theory predictions based on light front quantization ===
{{incomprehensible|date=December 2018}}
[[Light front quantization]] is a rigorous alternative due to [[Paul Dirac]] to the usual [[second quantization]] method (instant-form method). [[Causality]] and frame-independence (Poincaré invariance) are explicit, contrary to quantization in the instant-form method.  The light-front [[vacuum state]] is defined as the [[eigenstate]] of lowest [[invariant mass]].

[[Vacuum fluctuations]] do not appear in the Light-Front vacuum since all particles have positive [[momenta]] p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;= p&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;+p&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Since p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is conserved, particles cannot couple to the light front vacuum since it has p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=0.

These features make the [[quantum field theory]] vacuum essentially trivial, with no vacuum dynamics such as condensate (i.e. [[vacuum expectation value]]). In contrast, vacuum fluctuations appear in the vacuum of the ordinary instant-form (the lowest energy [[eigenstate]] of the instant-form [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]), but the physical effects depend on the arbitrary choice of Lorentz frame.  This fact and the violation of causality indicate that the instant-form vacuum cannot represent of the physical vacuum.

While the features of the LF vacuum have been known for a long time,&lt;ref&gt;H. Leutwyler, J.R. Klauder, L. Streit. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02826338 Quantum field theory on lightlike slabs], Nuovo Cim. A66 (1970) 536 DOI: 10.1007/BF02826338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Casher and L. Susskind. [https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.9.436 Chiral magnetism (or magnetohadrochironics)] Phys. Rev. D9 (1974) 436 DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.9.436&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011, [[Stanley Brodsky]] and Robert Shrock showed&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Brodsky and R. Shrock. [https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1151 Condensates in Quantum Chromodynamics and the Cosmological Constant.] Proc.Nat.Acad.Sci. 108 (2011) 45-50, [arXiv:0905.1151].&lt;/ref&gt; that the absence of condensates implies that in the [[Standard Model]] of Particle Physics, there is no contribution from [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]], [[Weak interactions]] and [[QCD]] to the cosmological constant. It is thus predicted to be zero in a flat [[space-time]]. This was later validated and developed,&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Brodsky, C. D. Roberts, R. Shrock and P. C. Tandy. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4610 Essence of the vacuum quark condensate]. Phys.Rev. C82 (2010) 022201 [arXiv:1005.4610].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Brodsky, C. D. Roberts, R. Shrock and P. C. Tandy. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2376 Confinement contains condensates]. Phys.Rev. C85 (2012) 065202 [arXiv:1202.2376]&lt;/ref&gt; by other prominent QCD theorists.

In the case of the [[Higgs mechanism]], the usual Higgs vacuum expectation value in the instant-form vacuum is replaced by a constant scalar background field  - a "[[zero mode]]" with k&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;=0. The phenomenological predictions are unchanged using the LF formalism.  Since the Higgs zero mode has no energy or momentum density, it does not contribute to the cosmological constant.

The [[Cosmological constant#Positive value|small non-zero value of the cosmological constant]] must then be attributed to other mechanisms; for example a slight curvature of the [[shape of the universe]] (which is not excluded within 0.4% (as of 2017)&lt;ref name="NASA_Shape"&gt;{{cite web| title=Will the Universe expand forever?| url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html| publisher=[[NASA]]| date=24 January 2014| accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fermi_Flat"&gt;{{cite web| title=Our universe is Flat|
url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/our-flat-universe?email_issue=725| publisher=FermiLab/SLAC| date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unexpected connections|author=Marcus Y. Yoo|journal=Engineering &amp; Science|volume=LXXIV1|date=2011|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) could modify the [[Higgs field]] zero-mode, thereby possibly producing a non-zero contribution to the cosmological constant.

'''Cultural materialism''' is an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] research orientation first introduced by [[Marvin Harris]] in his 1968 book ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'',&lt;ref name=Harris2001a&gt;{{citation |year=2001a |orig-year=First published 1968 |author=Harris, Marvin |authorlink=Marvin Harris |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=978-0-7591-0132-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yUUYN3X18dwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rise+Anthropological+Theory#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010|ref = harv}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a theoretical paradigm and research strategy.

Harris's concept of cultural materialism was influenced by the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], as well as their theories as modified by [[Karl August Wittfogel]] and his 1957 book, ''[[Oriental Despotism (book)|Oriental Despotism]]''.{{sfnb|Harris|2001a| p = 673ff}} Yet this  [[economic materialism|materialism]] is distinct from [[Marxist]] [[dialectical materialism]], as well as from [[materialism|philosophical materialism]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{citation |year=2004 |author=Moore, Jerry D |chapter=Marvin Harris: Cultural Materialism |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAFPjP3yg10C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=%22Marvin+Harris%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BDCLTP_2AYTJcay3-b0E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Marvin%20Harris%22&amp;f=false |pages=203–215 |title=Visions of Culture: An Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists |edition=2nd |place=Walnut Creek, CA |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=978-0-7591-0410-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QAFPjP3yg10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Visions+of+Culture%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0411-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Malthus]]'s work encouraged Harris to consider reproduction of equal importance to production. The research strategy was also influenced by the work of earlier anthropologists including [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Edward Tylor]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] who, in the 19th century, first proposed that cultures evolved from the less complex to the more complex over time. [[Leslie White]] and [[Julian Steward]] and their theories of [[cultural evolution]] and [[cultural ecology]] were instrumental in the reemergence of evolutionist theories of culture in the 20th century and Harris took inspiration from them in formulating cultural materialism.

==[[epistemology|Epistemological]] principles==
Cultural materialism is a scientific [[Research#Research methods|research strategy]] and as such utilizes the [[scientific method]]. Other important principles include [[operational definition]]s, [[Karl Popper]]'s [[falsifiability]], [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s [[paradigms]], and the [[positivism]] first proposed by [[Auguste Comte]] and popularized by the [[Vienna Circle]]. The primary question that arises in applying the techniques of science to understand the differences and similarities between cultures is how the research strategy "treats the relationship between what people say and think as subjects and what they say and think and do as objects of scientific inquiry".&lt;ref name=Harris2001bp29&gt;Harris, Marvin (2001b), p29.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this cultural materialism makes a distinction between behavioral events and ideas, values, and other mental events.

It also makes the distinction between [[emic and etic]] operations. Emic operations, within cultural materialism, are ones in which the descriptions and analyses are acceptable by the native as real, meaningful, and appropriate. Etic operations are ones in which the categories and concepts used are those of the observer and are able to generate scientific theories. The research strategy prioritizes etic behavior phenomena.

==Theoretical principles==
* [[Etic]] and behavioral infrastructure, comprising a society's relations to the environment, which includes their ethics and behavioral modes of production and reproduction (material relations).
* Etic and behavioral [[Structure]], the ethics and behavioral domestic and political economies of a society (social relations).
* Etic and behavioral [[base and superstructure|Superstructure]], the ethics and behavioral symbolic and ideational aspects of a society, e.g. the arts, rituals, sports and games, and science (symbolic and ideational relations).
* Emic and mental Superstructure, including "conscious and unconscious cognitive goals, categories, rules, plans, values, philosophies, and beliefs" (Harris 1979:54) (meaningful or ideological relations).

Within this division of culture, cultural materialism argues for what is referred to as the principle of probabilistic infrastructural determinism.  The essence of its materialist approach is that the infrastructure is in almost all circumstances the most significant force behind the evolution of a culture. Structure and superstructure are not considered "insignificant, epiphenomenal reflexes of infrastructural forces".&lt;ref name=Harris2001bp72&gt;Harris, Marvin (2001b), p.72&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and symbolic/ideational aspects act as regulating mechanisms within the system as a whole.

The research strategy predicts that it is more likely that in the long term infrastructure probabilistically determines structure, which probabilistically determines the superstructures, than otherwise. Thus, much as in earlier Marxist thought, material changes (such as in technology or environment) are seen as largely determining patterns of social organization and ideology in turn.

===Disagreement with Marxism===
In spite of the debt owed to the economic theories of Marx and Engels, cultural materialism rejects the Marxist [[dialectic]] which in turn was based on the theories of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

During the 1980s, Marvin Harris had a productive interchange with behavioral psychologists, most notably Sigrid Glenn, regarding interdisciplinary work.  Very recently, behavioral psychologists have produced a set of basic exploratory experiments in an effort toward this end.&lt;ref name=Wardetal2009&gt;{{citation |year=2009 |author1=Ward, Todd.A. |author2=Eastman, Raymond. |author3= Ninness, Chris |last-author-amp=yes |title=An Experimental Analysis of Cultural Materialism: The Effects of Various Modes of Production on Resource Sharing |journal=Behavior and Social Issues |volume=18 |pages=58–80 |url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/viewFile/1950/2185 |accessdate=10 September 2010 |doi=10.5210/bsi.v18i1.1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently young anthropologists have re-approached the work of Marvin Harris as part of a new anthropology of infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year=2009 |author=Dalakoglou, D. |title=An Anthropology of Road |url= https://books.google.com/?id=N90nlwEACAAJ&amp;dq=an+anthropology+of+the+road+Dalakoglou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Courtyard of the prison grounds.jpeg|thumb|The 18th century debtors' prison at the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] in [[Valletta]], now the offices of the Health Ministry in [[Malta]]]]
A '''debtors' prison''' is a [[prison]] for [[Natural person|people]] who are unable to pay [[debt]]. Through the mid 19th century, debtors' prisons (usually similar in form to locked [[workhouses]]) were a common way to deal with unpaid debt in places like [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="Cory"&gt;Cory, Lucinda. [http://www.rib.uscourts.gov/ONTHEDOCKET/vol2,%20iss2.PDF "A Historical Perspective on Bankruptcy"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228083132/http://www.rib.uscourts.gov/ONTHEDOCKET/vol2%2C%20iss2.PDF |date=February 28, 2008 }}, ''On the Docket'', Volume 2, Issue 2, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Rhode Island, April/May/June 2000, retrieved December 20, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; Destitute persons who were unable to pay a court-ordered judgment would be incarcerated in these prisons until they had worked off their debt via labor or secured outside funds to pay the balance. The product of their labor went towards both the costs of their incarceration and their accrued debt. Increasing access and lenience throughout the [[history of bankruptcy law]] have made prison terms for unaggravated [[indigence]] illegal over most of the world.

Since the late 20th century, the term ''debtors' prison'' has also sometimes been applied by critics to [[criminal justice system]]s in which a court can sentence someone to prison over willfully unpaid [[Criminal procedure|criminal fees]], usually following the order of a [[judge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justanswer.com/topics-contempt-of-court/|title=What is Contempt of Court and other Contempt of Court Questions Answered|work=JustAnswer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in some jurisdictions within the [[United States]], people can be held in [[contempt of court]] and jailed after willful non-payment of [[Child support in the United States|child support]], garnishments, confiscations, fines, or back taxes. Additionally, though properly served [[Civil procedure|civil duties]] over private debts in nations such as the United States will merely result in a [[default judgement]] being rendered ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' if the defendant willfully declines to appear by law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nasonlawfirm.com/archives/548|title=What Happens If I Get Sued?|work=nasonlawfirm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a substantial number of indigent debtors are legally incarcerated for the crime of failing to appear at civil debt proceedings as ordered by a judge. In this case, the crime is not indigence, but disobeying the judge's order to appear before the court.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tampa1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calpen1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="minn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harrington1"/&gt;  Critics argue that the "willful" terminology is subject to individual [[mens rea]] determination by a judge, rather than statute, and that since this presents the potential for judges to incarcerate legitimately indigent individuals, it amounts to a de facto "debtors' prison" system.

== History ==

=== Medieval Europe ===
During Europe's [[Middle Ages]], debtors, both men and women, were locked up together in a single, large cell until their families paid their debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.articlesdepo.com/loans/56618.php Articlesdepo.com] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debt prisoners often died of diseases contracted from other debt prisoners. Conditions included starvation and abuse from other prisoners. If the father of a family was imprisoned for debt, the family business often suffered while the mother and children fell into poverty. Unable to pay the debt, the father often remained in debtors' prison for many years. Some debt prisoners were released to become [[serf]]s or [[indentured servant]]s ([[debt bondage]]) until they paid off their debt in labor.

== By region ==

=== Canada ===
{{main|Imprisonment for debt (Upper Canada)}}

=== Council of Europe ===
Article 1 of [[European Convention on Human Rights#Protocol 4 - civil imprisonment, free movement, expulsion|Protocol 4]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] prohibits the imprisonment of people for breach of a contract. Turkey and the United Kingdom (due to concerns over British nationality law) have signed but never ratified Protocol 4. Greece and Switzerland have neither signed nor ratified this protocol.

=== France ===

France allows for ''contrainte par corps'', now denominated ''contrainte judiciaire'', for money owed to the State by non-insolvant debtors aged from 18 to 65; its length is limited following the amount of the debt and aims to pressure the debtor to pay his debts, consequently the owed money stays owed to the State.

=== Germany ===
[[File:Nuernberg-maennereisen-v-nw.jpg|thumb|right|Schuldturm in [[Nuremberg]]]]
In the late Middle Ages, and at the beginning of the modern era, public law was codified in Germany. This served to standardize the coercive arrest (''Pressionshaft''), and got rid of the many arbitrary sanctions that were not universal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2006/0919/recht/0108/index.html Berlinonline.de] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222215014/http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2006/0919/recht/0108/index.html |date=December 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas (like Nürnberg) the debtor could sell or redistribute their debt.

In most of the cities, the towers and city fortifications functioned as jails. For certain sanctions there were designated prisons, hence some towers being called debtors' prison (''Schuldturm''). The term ''Schuldturm'', outside of the Saxon constitution, became the catchword for public law debtor’s prison.

In the early modern era, the debtor’s detainment or citizen’s arrest remained valid in Germany. Sometimes it was used as a tool to compel payment, other times it was used to secure the arrest of an individual and ensure a trial against them in order to garnish wages, [[replevin]] or a form of [[trover]]. This practice was particularly disgraceful to a person’s identity, but had different rules than criminal trials. It was more similar to the modern enforcement of sentences (''Strafvollzug'') e.g. the debtor would be able to work off their debt for a certain amount of days, graduated by how much they owed.

The [[North German Confederation]] eliminated debtors' prisons on May 29, 1868.

At present a comparable concept to debtors' prison still exists in various forms in Germany:{{fact|date=July 2017}}
* A maximum of 6 weeks coercive arrest for failure to pay fine (''Bußgeld'').
* A maximum of 6 months coercive arrest for failure to issue an oath of not being able to pay any kind of liability.
* As an alternative sentence, if a fine (''Geldstrafe'') is not paid, up to 6 months.
* As a personal arrest for the securing of a foreclosure or garnishment on wages.
* Failure to pay child support as ordered by court, which is a crime under the Penal Code.

=== Great Britain (later the United Kingdom) ===
[[File:St Briavels Castle Debtors Prison.jpg|thumb|right|A mid-Victorian depiction of the debtors' prison at [[St Briavels Castle]]]]
In England during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, 10,000 people were imprisoned for debt each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A 20th Century Debate About Imprisonment for Debt|last = Ware|first = Stephen|date = July 2014|journal = American Journal of Legal History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A prison term did not alleviate a person's debt, however; an inmate was typically required to repay the creditor in-full before being released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.historyextra.com/facts/nutshell-debtors’-prisons|title = In a Nutshell: Debtor's Prisons|date = February 10, 2015|accessdate = |website = History Extra|publisher = BBC|last = Wilkes|first = Jonny|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151212102229/http://www.historyextra.com/facts/nutshell-debtors%E2%80%99-prisons|archivedate = December 12, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the later [[United Kingdom]], debtors' prisons varied in the amount of freedom they allowed the debtor. With a little money, a debtor could pay for some freedoms; some prisons allowed inmates to conduct business and to receive visitors; others (including the [[Fleet Prison|Fleet]] and [[King's Bench Prison]]s) even allowed inmates to live a short distance outside the prison—a practice known as the 'Liberty of the Rules'—and the Fleet even tolerated clandestine '[[Fleet Marriage]]s'.

Life in these prisons, however, was far from pleasant, and the inmates were forced to pay for their keep. Samuel Byrom, son of the writer and poet [[John Byrom]], was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet in 1725, and in 1729 he sent a petition to his old school friend, the [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset|Duke of Dorset]], in which he raged against the injustices of the system. Some debtor prisoners were even less fortunate, being sent to prisons with a mixture of vicious criminals and petty criminals, and many more were confined to a single cell.

The father of the [[England|English]] author [[Charles Dickens]] was sent to one of these prisons (the [[Marshalsea Prison|Marshalsea]]), which were often described in Dickens's novels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charles-dickens.com/ Charles Dickens Bibliography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215121741/http://www.charles-dickens.com/ |date=2010-12-15 }} at charles-dickens.com&lt;/ref&gt; He became an advocate for debt prison reform, and his novel ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' dealt directly with this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Charles Dickens, Social Worker in His Time|last = Andrews|first = Arlene B.|date = October 2012|journal = Social Work|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Debtors' Act of 1869]] limited the ability of the courts to sentence debtors to prison, but it did not entirely prohibit them from doing so.  Debtors who had the means to pay their debt, but did not do so, could still be incarcerated for up to six weeks, as could those who defaulted on debts to the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/32-33/62/part/I|title = Debtors Act of 1869|date = |accessdate = 6 December 2015|website = |publisher = The National Archives (UK)|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, there was a significant reduction in the number of debtors imprisoned following the passage of the 1869 Act.   By 1870, the total number of debtors imprisoned decreased by almost 2,000, dropping from 9,759 in 1869 to 6,605 in 1870.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Judicial Statistics, England and Wales, Part 2|last = |first = |publisher = Great Britain Home Office|year = 1907|isbn = |location = |pages = 35|url = https://books.google.com/?id=64AzAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=debt%20imprisonment%20statistics%20england&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=debt%20imprisonment%20statistics%20england&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, by 1905 that  number had increased to 11,427.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some of London's debtors' prisons were the [[Coldbath Fields Prison]], [[Fleet Prison]], [[Giltspur Street Compter]], [[King's Bench Prison]], [[Marshalsea Prison]], [[Poultry Compter]], and [[Wood Street Counter]]. The most famous was [[The Clink|the Clink prison]], which had a debtor's entrance in Stoney Street. This prison gave rise to the British slang term for being incarcerated in any prison, hence "in the clink". Its location also gave rise to the term for being financially embarrassed, "stoney broke".

=== Greece ===
Ιmprisonment for debts, whether to the tax office or to a private bank, was still practiced until January 2008, when the law changed after imprisonment for unpaid taxes, as well as other debts to the government or to the social security office, was declared unconstitutional after having been practiced for 173 years; imprisonment was, however, still retained for debts to private banks.{{clarify|date=April 2009}} The situation regarding imprisonment (προσωποκράτηση (prosōpokrάtēsē): custody) for debts to the government is still unclear, as courts continue to have this ability for criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reporto.gr/news.asp?ID=7710 Reporto.gr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205184819/http://www.reporto.gr/news.asp?ID=7710 |date=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
{{main|Castellania (Valletta)}}
An eighteenth century debtors' prison is found within the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] in [[Valletta]], Malta, now used as offices by the Ministry for Health. It remained in use as a prison until the nineteenth century. People who fail to pay their debts today are given prison sentences to be served at Corradino Prison in [[Paola, Malta|Paola]].

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Debtors in the [[United Arab Emirates]], including [[Dubai]], are imprisoned for failing to pay their debts. This is a common practice in the country. Banks are not sympathetic to the debtors once they are in prison, so many just choose to leave the country where they can negotiate for settlements later. The practice of fleeing UAE to avoid arrest because of debt defaults is considered a viable option to customers who are unable to meet their obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/middleeast/12dubai.html|work=The New York Times|title=Laid-Off Foreigners Flee as Dubai Spirals Down|first=Robert F.|last=Worth|date=2009-02-12|accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/how-the-world-is-dealing-with-the-issue-of-debtors|work=The National|title=How the world is dealing with the issue of debtors|first=Wayne|last=Arnold|date=2008-12-24|accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States of America ===

==== Early debtors' prisons (colonization–1850) ====
Many Colonial American jurisdictions established debtors' prisons using the same models used in Great Britain. [[James Wilson]], a signatory to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], spent some time in a debtors' prison while still serving as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/signers/wilson.htm |publisher=ushistory.org |location= |title=James Wilson 1742-1798 |first=Thomas |last=Kindig |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710163946/http://www.ushistory.org/Declaration/Signers/wilson.htm |archivedate=2015-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow signatory [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] spent three years, from 1798 to 1801, in the Prune Street Debtors' Prison, [[Philadelphia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Axelrod|first=Alan|title=The Real History of the American Revolution|date=2007|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ushistory.org/tour/washington-square.htm|publisher=ushistory.org|title=Washington Square: Go to Jail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Lee III, better known as [[Henry Lee III|Henry "Light-Horse" Lee]], a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] general and father of Robert E.

Debtors' prisons were prevalent throughout the [[United States]] up until the mid-1800s. Economic hardships following the [[War of 1812]] with [[Great Britain]] helped swell prison populations with simple debtors. This resulted in significant attention being given to plights of the poor and most dependent jailed under the widespread practice, possibly for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Acquisition of Political, Social, and Industrial Rights of Man in America|last=McMaster|first=John B.|year=1903|publisher=Imperial Press|location=Cleveland|isbn=978-1-4097-7187-6|pages=63–66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2cUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=1816+debtors+prison#v=onepage&amp;q=1816%20debtors%20prison&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing disfavor over debtors' prisons along with the advent and early development of [[Bankruptcy in the United States|U.S. bankruptcy laws]] led states to begin restricting imprisonment for most civil debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G.

* The routine jailing of persons who owe civil debt when such debts are related to child support arrears. Imprisonment for such debt is legally justified by the legal fiction that the incarceration is not for the debt, but rather for not obeying a court order to pay the debt.

In an article in ''[[The American Conservative]]'', Michael Shindler argues that another factor responsible for debtors' prison type arrests is that "Whereas indigent defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to a court-appointed lawyer in criminal cases involving incarceration, indigent debtors in state and local courts have no one to defend them against the error and abuse that characterizes debt collection litigation." Similarly, Shindler writes, regarding explicitly illegal debtors' prison type arrests ordered by local judges,"the reason these officials engage in this sort of excessive behavior is often due to ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shindler|first=Michael|date=September 17, 2018|title=Private Creditors Can Put You in Jail|url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-travesty-of-private-creditors-putting-people-in-jail/|journal=The American Conservative|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-A debtors' prison is a prison for people who are unable to pay debt. Through the mid 19th century, debtors' prisons (usually similar in form to locked workhouses) were a common way to deal with unpaid debt in Western Europe.[1] Destitute persons unable to pay a court-ordered judgment would be sentenced to these prisons until they had worked off their debt via labor or secured outside funds to pay the balance; the product of their labor went towards both the costs of their incarceration and their accrued debt. Increasing access and lenience throughout the history of bankruptcy law have made prison terms for unaggravated indigence illegal over most of the world.

== International agreements ==
In 1976 Article 11 of the ICCPR – [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] – came into effect stating, "No one shall be imprisoned merely on the ground of inability to fulfill a contractual obligation."

This international treaty contradicts many domestic laws of ratified states which allows for civil jail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8294">An '''economic input-output life-cycle assessment''', or '''EIO-LCA''' involves the use of aggregate sector-level data to quantify the amount of environmental impact that can be directly attributed to each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors in producing its output. Combining such data sets can enable accounting for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of traditional [[Life-cycle assessment]]s. EIO-LCA analysis traces out the various economic transactions, resource requirements and environmental emissions (including all the various manufacturing, transportation, mining and related requirements) required for producing a particular product or service.

EIO-LCA relies on sector-level averages that may or may not be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product. To the extent that the good or service of interest is representative of a sector, EIOLCA can provide very fast estimates of full supply chain implications for that good or service.

==Background==
Economic input-output analysis was developed by the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Wassily Leontief]]. It quantifies the interrelationships among sectors of an economic system, enabling identification of direct and indirect economic inputs of purchases. This concept was extended by including data about environmental and energy analysis from each sector to account for [[supply chain]] environmental implications of economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, C. T., Lave, L. B., and Matthews, H. S. (2005) ''Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Goods and Services: An Input-Output Approach'', Resources for the Future Press. {{ISBN|978-1-933115-24-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Input-output transactions tables, which track flows of purchases between sectors, are collected by the federal government in the United States. EIO works as follows: If &lt;math&gt;X_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; represents the amount that sector &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; purchased from sector &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in a given year and &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the "final demand" for output from sector &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the amount of output purchased for consumption, as opposed to purchased by other businesses as supplies for more production), then the total output &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; from sector &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; includes output to consumers plus output sold to other sectors:

&lt;math&gt;x_i = y_i + \sum_jX_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

If we define &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; as the normalized production for each sector, so that &lt;math&gt;A_{ij} = X_{ij}/x_j&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;x_i = y_i + \sum_jA_{ij}x_j&lt;/math&gt;

In vector notation

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y} + \mathbf{Ax}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y} = (\mathbf{I - A})\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = (\mathbf{I - A})^{-1}\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;

This result indicates that knowing only the final demand from each sector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; and the normalized IO matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, one can calculate the total implied production &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; from each sector of the economy. If data are available on a particular emissions release (or other attribute of interest) from each sector of the economy, then a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be compiled to represent various releases (columns) per $ output from each sector (rows). Total additional emissions &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; associated with additional final demand of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; can then be calculated as:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{R}^T\Delta\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{R}^T(\mathbf{I - A})^{-1}\Delta\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;

This simple result enables very quick analysis, taking into account releases associated with the entire supply chain requirements needed to provide a specific final demand, on average. The equations are based on average data in the current economy, but they can be used to make predictions for marginal changes in output (such as one more unit of a particular product) if 
# average output and marginal output are assumed to be sufficiently close (i.e., the impact of ''one more unit'' = the impact of ''the average unit''), and
# the marginal change in final output &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; is representative of the product of interest (ex: if the product will use electricity from wind energy exclusively, then using the electricity sector, which is dominated by coal, would yield a poor estimate).

Finally, if the researcher has estimates for valuation of [[externality]] costs associated with each item in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; (or, alternatively, if weighting coefficients are available that represent the relative importance of each item in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;, using [[ecological indicator]]s, for example) then the externality costs (or weights) per unit of releases could be compiled into a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}&lt;/math&gt; in order to calculate the scalar "environmental impact metric" &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta m = \mathbf{m}^T\Delta\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{m}^T\mathbf{R}^T\Delta\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{m}^T\mathbf{R}^T(\mathbf{I - A})^{-1}\Delta\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;

Generally there is wide uncertainty associated with estimates of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}&lt;/math&gt;, so such aggregation should be done only with care, including [[sensitivity analysis]]. Typically, researchers examine specific elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; rather than attempting to aggregate.

The big picture result is that by collecting data on average economic sector transactions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and average sector emissions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to make quick predictions about the full supply chain emissions associated with a product of interest by representing the product as marginal changes in production from relevant sectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Software==
Researchers at the Green Design Institute of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] began developing a web-based tool for performing an EIO-LCA in the 1990s.  The underlying software&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiolca.net www.eiolca.net]&lt;/ref&gt; traces out the various economic transactions, resource requirements and environmental emissions associated with the production of a particular product or service. The model captures all the various manufacturing, transportation, mining and related requirements to produce a product or service. For example, one might wish to trace out the implications of purchasing $ 46,000 of reinforcing steel and $ 104,000 of concrete for a kilometer of roadway pavement. Environmental implications of these purchases can be estimated using EIO-LCA. The current (2002) model is based upon the Department of Commerce's 428 sector industry input-output model of the US economy.

In 2018, VitalMetrics Group, an environmental consultancy, developed a web-based Spend Analysis Tool&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vitalmetricsgroup.com/sustainability-tools/ www.vitalmetricsgroup.com/sustainability-tools/]&lt;/ref&gt; for quantifying the environmental impacts associated with an organization’s entire upstream supply chain. It is compliant with the approach for quantifying spend-based impacts defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain Accounting and Reporting Standard. The tool utilizes the Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive (CEDA)&lt;ref&gt;Suh, S., 2005: Developing Sectoral Environmental Database for Input-Output Analysis: Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive of the U.S., Economic Systems Research, 17 (4), 449 – 469] https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09535310500284326&lt;/ref&gt;, a peer-reviewed EIO-LCA database with a base year of 2014. CEDA represents 389 industrial sectors, the commodities and the linkages between them, and over 2,700 environmental exchanges arising from them, including extraction of various natural resources, water consumption, land use, and emissions to air, water and soil.

==Methodology and hypotheses==
===Issues with research===
Within the field of pornography research, there are many challenges that arise due to strong opinions and feelings on the topic. [[Confirmation bias]] is prevalent due to societal taboos surrounding pornography. While many studies hypothesize about and study negative effects of pornography, few researchers explore potential benefits or positive aspects of pornography. A large percentage of studies suffer from [[methodological]] issues. In one meta-study by researchers at Middlesex University in England, over 40,000 papers and articles were submitted to the team for review and 276 or 0.69% were suitable for consideration due to the low quality of research within the field.&lt;ref name="middlesexstudy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22987051|title=Do we know whether pornography harms people?|last=Fidgen|first=Jo|date=2013-06-25|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zillmann's research===
[[File:Zillmann Fig 5.png|thumb|300px|Figure 5 in ''Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography.''&lt;ref name="prolonged"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/V/ |last=Zillmann |first=Dolf |title=Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography |website=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;]][[File:Zillmann Fig 10.png|thumb|300px|Figure 10 in ''Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography.''&lt;ref name="prolonged"/&gt;]]

In ''Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography'', a review of pornography research conducted for the [[Surgeon General of the United States]] in 1986, Zillmann noted that inconsistencies in the literature on pornography exist, but overall concluded that extensive viewing of pornographic material may produce some [[sociology|sociological]] effects he argued were negative, including a decreased respect for long-term, [[monogamy|monogamous]] relationships, and an attenuated desire for [[reproduction|procreation]].&lt;ref name="prolonged"/&gt; He describes the hypothetical basis for these conclusions stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;The values expressed in pornography clash so obviously with the family concept, and they potentially undermine the traditional values that favor marriage, family, and children ... Pornographic scripts dwell on sexual engagements of parties who have just met, who are in no way attached or committed to each other, and who will part shortly, never to meet again ... Sexual gratification in pornography is not a function of emotional attachment, of kindness, of caring, and especially not of continuance of the relationship, as such continuance would translate into responsibilities, curtailments, and costs ...&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, pages 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other contemporary researchers disagreed, McKay &amp; Dolf noting "neglected in work on pornography is that adults capable of functioning in contemporary society are also quite able to distinguish the difference between reality and fantasy. That such a point requires stating is indicative of the overly simplistic model of human behaviour which is reflected in this type of work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKay|first1=H.B.|last2=Dolff|first2=D.J|title='The Impact of Pornography: An Analysis of Research and Summary of Findings';  Working Papers on Pornography and Prostitution Report No. 3|date=1984|publisher=Department of Justice, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects as [[Gail Dines]] summarizes Zillman's 1989 study, include "alters perceptions of sexuality; specifically, it fosters presumptions of popularity for less common sexual practices; breeds discontent with the physical appearance and the sexual performance of intimate partners; trivializes rape as a criminal offense and also trivializes sexual child abuse as a criminal offense; and promotes insensitivity toward victims of sexual violence and promotes men's beliefs that they would be capable of committing rape. In addition, habitual male consumers of common pornography appear to be at greater risk of becoming sexually callous and sexually violent toward women than occasional users."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dines|first1=Gail|title=Pornland : how porn has hijacked our sexuality|date=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0807044520}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Bryant|editor-first1=D. Zillmann, J.|title=Pornography : research advances and policy considerations|date=1989|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale (New Jersey)|isbn=0805806156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avedon Carol]] has explained of Zillmann's term "sexually callous" that he meant "a greater tolerance for homosexuality; a belief that women should be able to choose other priorities beside motherhood; less belief in marriage; a belief that women may enjoy sex and choose to participate in it for reasons other than pleasing their husbands or conceiving children - in short, the goals of most feminist groups of the time. Zillmann was unable to demonstrate any increase in misogynist or violent attitudes and desires, although he did try." and stated of the sponsor of the report "Having noted the varied interpretability of Zillmann and Bryant's findings, the [USA] Surgeon-General's report said that the only reliable findings of the research that supposedly proved men were more callous towards women after looking at pornography was this: the group that saw pornography estimated more accurately the prevalence of sexual practices in society. The control group, which did not see the material, tended to underestimate grossly how common certain sexual acts were" and commented "But even this result may be less reliable than it appears, due to methodological problems. Zillmann and Bryant had tried to include non-students in their research, but many of them left the study group when they discovered they would be asked to look at pornography. This meant that the control group contained a different population - older, perhaps more settled married men, for example - and thus any differences in the answers the groups gave to the questions might only reflect different attitudes among the different groups, and not pornography effects at all. The study was no longer controlled. In the end, the research may only mean that older, married men are less critical of their partners than young, single psychology students, and that such young, educated men have more liberal attitudes about women's roles and homosexuality, and more realistic knowledge of sexual practices in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carol|first1=Avedon|title=Nudes, Prudes and Attitudes: Pornography and Censorship|date=1994|publisher=New Clarion Press|location=Gloucester|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addiction==
[[Pornography addiction]] is a purported [[behavioral addiction]] characterized by [[compulsive]], repeated use of pornographic material until it causes serious negative consequences to one's physical, mental, social, and/or financial well-being.&lt;ref name="dsm-5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SteinHollander2009"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dan J. |last1=Stein |first2=Eric |last2=Hollander |first3=Barbara Olasov |last3=Rothbaum |title=Textbook of Anxiety Disorders |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=quQY1R8vsZcC&amp;pg=PA359 |accessdate=24 April 2010 |date=31 August 2009 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |isbn=978-1-58562-254-2|pages=359–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17503551"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parashar A, Varma A |title=Behavior and substance addictions: is the world ready for a new category in the DSM-V? |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=257; author reply 258–9 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17503551 |doi= |url=http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1035}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no diagnosis of pornography addiction in the current ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]).&lt;ref name="dsm-5" /&gt; The DSM-5 considered the diagnosis of hypersexuality-related behavioral disorders (to which porn addiction was a subset), but rejected it because "there is insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders."&lt;ref name="dsm-5"&gt;{{Cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=Fifth|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Arlington, VA|pages=481, 797–798|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|quote=Thus, groups of repetitive behaviors, which some term behavioral addictions, with such subcategories as "sex addiction," "exercise addiction," or "shopping addiction," are not included because at this time there is insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, some psychologists suggest that any [[maladaptive]] sexual symptoms represent a manifestation of an underlying disorder, such as depression or anxiety which is simply manifesting itself sexually, or, alternatively, there is no underlying disorder and the behavior simply is not maladaptive. These psychologists do not recognize the concept of addiction, only chemical dependence, and believe the concept and diagnosis to be stigmatizing and unhelpful.&lt;ref&gt;The British Psychological Society, "Response to the American Psychiatric Association: DSM-5 Development", 2001 [http://apps.bps.org.uk/_publicationfiles/consultation-responses/DSM-5%202011%20-%20BPS%20response.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlBQ8G56X7YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Myth+of+addiction+ley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU7sqG85nPAhVU2WMKHUMBB_cQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Myth%2520of%2520addiction%2520ley&amp;f=false|title=The Myth of Sex Addiction|last=Ley|first=David J.|date=2014-07-10|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442213050|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two 2016 neurology reviews found evidence of addiction related brain changes in internet pornography users. Psychological effects of these brain changes are described as desensitization to reward, a dysfunctional anxiety response, and impulsiveness.&lt;ref name=Kraus2016rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhn2016rev/&gt; Another 2016 review suggests that internet behaviors, including the use of pornography, be considered potentially addictive, and that problematic use of online pornography be considered an "internet-use disorder".&lt;ref name=Brand2016rev/&gt;

==Sexual violence==

===Controlled studies===
{{See also|Correlation does not imply causation}}
A controlled study describes the relationship between given behaviors or environmental conditions and health effects in a laboratory setting in which conditions other than those under study are effectively held constant across groups of participants receiving various levels of the experimental condition(s).  Since it is considered that the only functional difference between groups is the level of experimental condition(s) received, researchers can strongly infer cause-and-effect relationships from [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] associations between experimental condition(s) and health consequences.  Thus, if executed properly, controlled studies have high levels of [[internal validity]].  However, such studies often suffer from questionable [[external validity]] due to the considerable differences between real-world environments and the experimental context, and the consequent belief that results cannot be generalized beyond that context.&lt;ref name=psychtextbooks/&gt;

The link between pornography and sexual aggression has been the subject of multiple [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]].&lt;ref name="g"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/malamuth/pdf/00arsr11.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pornography and Attitudes Supporting Violence Against Women: Revisiting the Relationship in Nonexperimental Studies |first=Gert Martin |last=Hald |first2=Neil |last2=Malamuth |first3=Carlin |last3=Yuen |year=2000 |website=UCLA Division of Social Sciences |accessdate=13 March 2013}}

A meta-analysis conducted in 2015 found that pornography "consumption was associated with sexual aggression in the United States and internationally, among males and females, and in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Associations were stronger for verbal than physical sexual aggression, although both were significant. The general pattern of results suggested that violent content may be an exacerbating factor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Meta-Analysis of Pornography Consumption and Actual Acts of Sexual Aggression in General Population Studies|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12201/abstract|journal = Journal of Communication|date = 2015-12-01|issn = 1460-2466|pages = 183–205|doi = 10.1111/jcom.12201|language = en|first = Paul J.|last = Wright|first2 = Robert S.|last2 = Tokunaga|first3 = Ashley|last3 = Kraus|volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=July 2016}}

In an earlier review of this literature Ferguson and Hartley (2009) argued that "it is time to discard the hypothesis that pornography contributes to increased sexual assault behavior".&lt;ref name="Ferguson &amp; Hartley (2009)"&gt;{{citation |last=Ferguson|first=Christopher J.|title=The pleasure is momentary...the expense damnable?  The influence of pornography on rape and sexual assault.|url=http://www.christopherjferguson.com/pornography.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that the authors of some studies tended to highlight positive findings while deemphasizing null findings, demonstrating confirmation bias in the published literature.  Ferguson and Hartley concluded that controlled studies, on balance, were not able to support links between pornography and sexual violence.

===Epidemiological studies===
An [[epidemiological]] study describes the association between given behaviors or environmental conditions, and physical or psychological health by means of observation of real-world phenomena through statistical data.  Epidemiological studies generally have high levels of [[external validity]], insofar as they accurately describe events as they occur outside of a laboratory setting, but low levels of [[internal validity]], since they do not strongly establish cause-and-effect relationships between the behaviors or conditions under study, and the health consequences observed.&lt;ref name=psychtextbooks&gt;*Mitchell, M. and Jolley, J.

Danish criminologist [[Berl Kutchinsky]]'s ''Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark'' (1970), a scientific report ordered by the Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, found that the legalizing of pornography in [[Denmark]] had not resulted in an increase of [[sex crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home20.inet.tele.dk/gorzelak/dps/anmeldelser/barbano_kutchinsky.html [[Berl Kutchinsky]]: ''Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030030642/http://home20.inet.tele.dk/gorzelak/dps/anmeldelser/barbano_kutchinsky.html |date=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, many other experiments have been conducted, either supporting or opposing the findings of [[Berl Kutchinsky]], who would continue his study into the social effects of pornography until his death in 1995. His life's work was summed up in the publication ''Law, Pornography, and Crime: The Danish Experience'' (1999). Milton Diamond from the [[University of Hawaii]] found that the number of reported cases of child sex abuse dropped markedly immediately after the ban on sexually explicit materials was lifted in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/DIAM/effects_pornography.htm The Effects of Pornography: An International Perspective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203171037/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/DIAM/effects_pornography.htm |date=2012-02-03 }} [[University of Hawaii]] Porn 101: Eroticism, Pornography, and the First Amendment: Milton Diamond Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, a review of epidemiological studies by Neil M. Malamuth found that the quantity of pornographic material viewed by men was positively correlated with degree to which they endorsed sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Malamuth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malamuth|first=Neil M.|title=Do Sexually Violent Media Indirectly Contribute to Antisocial Behavior?|publisher=Public Health Service of United States|date=August 4, 1986|pages=38|url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/W/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malamuth's work describes Check (1984), who found among a diverse sample of [[Canadians|Canadian]] men that more exposure to pornography led to higher acceptance of [[rape myth]]s, violence against women, and general sexual callousness. In another study, Briere, Corne, Runtz and Neil M. Malamuth, (1984) reported similar correlations in a sample involving college males. On the other hand, the failure to find a statistically significant correlation in another previous study led Malamuth to examine other interesting correlations, which took into account the information about [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] the samples obtained in their childhood, and pornography emerged as the second most important source of information.&lt;ref name="Malamuth" /&gt;  Malamuth's work has been criticized by other authors, however, such as Ferguson and Hartley (2009) who argue Malamuth has exaggerated positive findings and has not always properly discussed null findings.&lt;ref name="Ferguson &amp; Hartley (2009)"/&gt;

The [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] tried several times to have California’s Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health’s Appeals Board force companies in the pornography industry to treat actors and actresses as employees subject to [[occupational safety and health]] regulation; in a 2014 case brought against [[Treasure Island Media]] an administrative judge found that the company did have to comply with regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitz-Gerald|first1=Sean|title=Condoms Required for CA Porn Performers: Judge|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/California-Judge-Issues-Landmark-Ruling-on-Unprotected-Porn-242117921.html|work=NBC Southern California|date=January 27, 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers]] feels schoolchildren need to be educated about pornography and warned what is reasonable and what is not acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-21938823 |first=Katherine |last=Sellgren |title=BBC News - Pupils 'should be taught about risks of pornography' |date=26 March 2013 |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK children's commissioner initiated a meta-study conducted by researchers at Middlesex University which concluded that pornography is linked to unrealistic attitudes about sex, beliefs that women are sex objects, more frequent thoughts about sex, and found that children and young people who view pornography tend to hold less progressive gender role attitudes.&lt;ref name="middlesexstudy" /&gt; Miranda Horvath stated about this: "But it is not possible to establish causation from correlational studies, and to say whether pornography is changing or reinforcing attitudes."&lt;ref name="middlesexstudy" /&gt;

Electromechanics focuses on the interaction of electrical and mechanical systems as a whole and how the two systems interact with each other. This process is especially prominent in systems such as those of DC Machines which can be designed and operated to generate power from a mechanical process ([[Electric generator|generator]]) or used to power a mechanical effect ([[motor]]). Electrical engineering in this context also encompasses [[electronic engineering|electronics engineering]].

Electromechanical devices are ones which have both electrical and mechanical processes. Strictly speaking, a manually operated switch is an electromechanical component due to the mechanical movement causing an electrical output. Though this is true, the term is usually understood to refer to devices which involve an electrical signal to create mechanical movement, or vice versa mechanical movement to create an electric signal. Often involving electromagnetic principles such as in [[relay]]s, which allow a [[voltage]] or current to control another, usually isolated circuit voltage or current by mechanically switching sets of contacts, and [[solenoid]]s, by which a voltage can actuate a moving linkage as in solenoid valves.

Before the development of modern electronics, electromechanical devices were widely used in complicated subsystems of parts, including [[electric typewriter]]s, [[teleprinter]]s, [[Shortt-Synchronome clock|clocks]], initial [[television]] systems, and the very early electromechanical [[digital computer]]s.

== History ==
The first electric motor was invented in 1821 by [[Michael Faraday]]. The motor was developed only a year after [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discovered that the flow of electric current creates a proportional magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/iconic-objects/iconic-objects-list/faradays-motor|title=Michael Faraday's electric magnetic rotation apparatus (motor)|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early motor was simply a wire partially submerged into a glass of mercury with a magnet at the bottom. When the wire was connected to a battery a magnetic field was created and this interaction with the magnetic field given off by the magnet caused the wire to spin.

Ten years later the first electric generator was invented, again by Michael Faraday. This generator consisted of a magnet passing through a coil of wire and inducing current that was measured by a galvanometer. Faraday's research and experiments into electricity are the basis of most of modern electromechanical principles known today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/iconic-objects/iconic-objects-list/faraday-generator|title=Michael Faraday's generator|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in electromechanics surged with the research into long distance communication.The [[Industrial Revolution]]'s rapid increase in production gave rise to a demand for intracontinental communication, allowing electromechanics to make its way into public service. [[Relay]]s originated with [[telegraphy]] as electromechanical devices were used to [[Signal regeneration|regenerate]] telegraph signals. The [[Strowger switch]], the [[Panel switch]], and similar devices were widely used in early automated [[telephone exchange]]s. [[Crossbar switch]]es were first widely installed in the middle 20th century in [[Sweden]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Great Britain]], and these quickly spread to the rest of the world.

Electromechanical systems saw a massive leap in progress from 1910-1945 as the world was put into global war twice. [[World War I]] saw a burst of new electromechanics as spotlights and radios were used by all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/wwi-technology-and-weapons-war|title=WWI: Technology and the weapons of war {{!}} NCpedia|website=www.ncpedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[World War II]], countries had developed and centralized their military around the versatility and power of electromechanics. One example of these still used today is the [[alternator]], which was created to power military equipment in the 1950s and later repurposed for automobiles in the 1960s. Post-war America greatly benefited from the military's development of electromechanics as household work was quickly be replaced by electromechanical systems such as microwaves, refrigerators, and washing machines. The [[electromechanical television]] systems of the late 19th century were less successful.

[[Typewriter|Electric typewriter]]s developed, up to the 1980s, as "power-assisted typewriters". They contained a single electrical component, the motor. Where the keystroke had previously moved a typebar directly, now it engaged mechanical linkages that directed mechanical power from the motor into the typebar. This was also true of the later IBM [[Selectric]]. At [[Bell Labs]], in the 1946, the Bell [[Model V]] computer was developed. It was an electromechanical relay-based device; cycles took seconds. In 1968 electromechanical systems were still under serious consideration for an aircraft flight control computer, until a device based on [[large scale integration]] electronics was adopted in the [[Central Air Data Computer]].

== Modern practice ==
Today, electromechanical processes are mainly used by power companies. All fuel based generators convert mechanical movement to electrical power. Some renewable energies such as [[Wind power|wind]] and [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] are powered by mechanical systems that also convert movement to electricity.

In the last thirty years of the 20th century, equipment which would generally have used electromechanical devices became less expensive. This equipment became cheaper because it used more reliably integrated [[microcontroller]] circuits containing ultimately a few million transistors, and a [[computer program|program]] to carry out the same task through logic. With electromechanical components there were only moving parts, such as mechanical [[electric actuator]]s. This more reliable logic has replaced most electromechanical devices, because any point in a system which must rely on mechanical movement for proper operation will inevitably have mechanical wear and eventually fail. Properly designed electronic circuits without moving parts will continue to operate correctly almost indefinitely and are used in most simple feedback control systems. Circuits without moving parts appear in a large number of items from [[traffic light]]s to [[washing machine]]s.

Another electromechanical device is [[Piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric devices]], but they do not use electromagnetic principles. Piezoelectric devices can create sound or vibration from an electrical signal or create an electrical signal from sound or mechanical vibration.

To become an electromechanical engineer, typical college courses involve mathematics, engineering, computer science, designing of machines, and other automotive classes that help gain skill in troubleshooting and analyzing issues with machines. To be an electromechanical engineer a bachelor's degree is required, usually in electrical, mechanical, or electromechanical engineering. As of April 2018, only two universities, [[Michigan Tech|Michigan Technological University]] and [[Wentworth Institute of Technology]], offer the major of electromechanical engineering. To enter the electromechanical field as an entry level technician, an associative degree is all that is required.

As of 2016, approximately 13,800 people work as electro-mechanical technicians in the US. The job outlook for 2016 to 2026 for technicians is 4% growth which is about an employment change of 500 positions. This outlook is slower than average.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, Electro-mechanical Technicians, on the Internet at http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electro-mechanical-technicians.htm (visited April 13, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy management==
[[Image:Hot metalwork.jpg|right|thumb|Thermal energy is the amount of random molecular [[kinetic energy]].]]

Energy accounting is a system used in [[energy management system]]s to measure and analyze energy consumption to improve [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] within an organization.&lt;ref name=Acc /&gt; Organisations such as Intel corporation use these systems to track energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B. Donnellan, [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/MISQE_SustainableIT_Intel_2012.pdf “Developing an Sustainable IT Capability: Lessons From Intel’s Journey,”] MIS Quarterly Executive, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 61–74, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Various [[energy transformation]]s are possible. An energy balance can be used to track energy through a system. This becomes a useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts. How much energy is needed at each point in a system is measured, as well as the form of that energy. An accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus work done, and transformations within a system. Sometimes, non-useful work is what is often responsible for environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml Science Notes: Energy Accounting and Balance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |date=2010-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy balance==
[[Energy returned on energy invested]] (EROEI) is the ratio of energy delivered by an energy technology to the energy invested to set up the technology.

'''Environmental soil science''' is the study of the interaction of humans with the [[pedosphere]] as well as critical aspects of the [[biosphere]], the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], and the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Environmental [[soil science]] addresses both the fundamental and applied aspects of the field including: buffers and surface water quality, [[vadose zone]] functions, [[septic drain field]] site assessment and function, land treatment of [[wastewater]], [[stormwater]], [[erosion]] control, [[soil contamination]] with metals and pesticides, [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated soils, restoration of [[wetlands]], [[soil degradation]], [[nutrient management]], movement of viruses and bacteria in soils and waters, [[bioremediation]], application of [[molecular biology]] and [[genetic engineering]] to development of soil microbes that can degrade hazardous pollutants, [[land use]], [[global warming]], [[acid rain]], and the study of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] soils, such as [[terra preta]]. Much of the research done in environmental soil science is produced through the use of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Hongwei|last2=An|first2=Jing|last3=Wei|first3=Shuhe|last4=Gu|first4=Jian|last5=Liang|first5=Wenju|title=Spatial Patterns and Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in Soils in a Resource-Exhausted City, Northeast China|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|date=2015|volume=10|issue=9|page=e0137694|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0137694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziadat|first1=Feras Mousa|last2=Yeganantham|first2=Dhanesh|last3=Shoemate|first3=David|last4=Srinivasan|first4=Raghavan|last5=Narasimhan|first5=Balaji|last6=Tech|first6=Jaclyn|title=Soil-Landscape Estimation and Evaluation Program (SLEEP) to predict spatial distribution of soil attributes for environmental modeling|journal=International Journal of Architectural and Biological Engineering|date=2015|volume=8|issue=3|pages=158–172|doi=10.3965/j.ijabe.20150803.1270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Termite mound.jpg|thumb|[[Termite]] mound: termites developed eusociality in the [[Jurassic]] period, over 145 million years ago.]]

'''Eusociality''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] εὖ ''eu'' "good" and [[social]]), the highest level of organization of [[animal sociality]], is defined by the following characteristics: cooperative [[Offspring|brood]] care (including care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within a colony of adults, and a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. The division of labor creates specialized behavioral groups within an animal society which are sometimes called [[castes]]. Eusociality is distinguished from all other social systems because individuals of at least one caste usually lose the ability to perform at least one behavior characteristic of individuals in another caste.

Eusociality exists in certain [[insect]]s, [[crustacean]]s and [[mammal]]s.  It is mostly observed and studied in the [[Hymenoptera]] ([[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s) and in [[termite]]s. A colony has caste differences: queens and reproductive males take the roles of the sole reproducers, while soldiers and workers work together to create a living situation favorable for the brood. In addition to Hymenoptera and Isoptera, there are two known eusocial vertebrates among [[rodent]]s: the [[naked mole-rat]] and the [[Damaraland mole-rat]]. Some [[shrimp]]s, such as ''[[Synalpheus regalis]]'', are also eusocial. [[E. O. Wilson]] has claimed that [[humans]] are eusocial, but his arguments have been disputed by a large number of evolutionary biologists, who note that humans do not have division of reproductive labor.&lt;ref name=Gintis/&gt;

Several other levels of animal sociality have been distinguished. These include [[sociality|presocial (solitary but social), subsocial, and parasocial]] (including communal, quasisocial, and semisocial).

== History ==

[[File:Revisando las larvas de una colmenas.jpg|thumb|Co-operative brood rearing in [[honeybees]]]]

The term "eusocial" was introduced in 1966 by Suzanne Batra who used it to describe nesting behavior in [[Halictinae|Halictine]] bees.&lt;ref name=Crespi1995&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crespi | first=Bernard J. | author-link=Bernard Crespi | author2=Douglas Yanega | title=The Definition of Eusociality | journal=Behav Ecol | year=1995 | volume=6 | pages=109–115 | doi=10.1093/beheco/6.1.109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Batra1968&gt;{{cite journal | last=Batra | first=Suzanne W. T. | title=Behavior of Some Social and Solitary Halictine Bees Within Their Nests: A Comparative Study (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) | journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society | date=Jan 1968 | volume=41 | issue=1 | pages=120–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batra observed the cooperative behavior of the bees, males and females alike, as they took responsibility for at least one duty (i.e. burrowing, cell construction, [[oviposition]]) within the colony. The cooperativeness was essential as the activity of one labor division greatly influenced the activity of another.

For example, the size of [[pollen]] balls, a source of food, depended on when the egg-laying females oviposited. If the provisioning by pollen collectors was incomplete by the time the egg-laying female occupied a cell and oviposited, the size of the pollen balls would be small, leading to small offspring.&lt;ref name=Batra1968 /&gt; Batra applied this term to species in which a colony is started by a single individual. Batra described other species, where the founder is accompanied by numerous helpers—as in a swarm of bees or ants—as "hypersocial".

In 1969, [[Charles D. Michener]]&lt;ref name="Michener 1969 299–342"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Michener | first=Charles D. | title=Comparative Social Behavior of Bees | journal=Annu. Rev. Entomol. | year=1969 | volume=14 | pages=299–342 | doi=10.1146/annurev.en.14.010169.001503}}&lt;/ref&gt; further expanded Batra’s classification with his comparative study of social behavior in bees. He observed multiple species of bees ([[Apoidea]]) in order to investigate the different levels of animal sociality, all of which are different stages that a colony may pass through. Eusociality, which is the highest level of animal sociality a species can attain, specifically had three characteristics that distinguished it from the other levels:

# "Egg-layers and worker-like individuals among adult females" (division of labor)
# The overlap of generations (mother and adult offspring)
# Cooperative work on the cells of the bees' honeycomb&lt;ref name="Crespi1995"/&gt;

[[E. O. Wilson]] then extended the terminology to include other social insects; such as ants, wasps, and termites. Originally, it was defined to include organisms (only invertebrates) that had the following three features:&lt;ref name=Crespi1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gadagkar 1993 215–216"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gadagkar | first=Raghavendra | title=And now... eusocial thrips! | journal=Current Science | year=1993 | volume=64 | issue=4 | pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson_Insect_Societies&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilson | first=Edward O. | title=The Insect Societies | year=1971 | publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge. Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson2005&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wilson | first=Edward O. | author2=Bert Hölldobler | title=Eusociality: Origin and Consequences | journal=PNAS | date=20 September 2005 | volume=102 | issue=38 | pages=13367–13371 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0505858102 | pmid=16157878 | pmc=1224642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Reproductive division of labor (with or without sterile castes)
# Overlapping generations
# Cooperative care of young

As eusociality became a recognized widespread phenomenon, however, it was also discovered in a group of [[Chordata|chordates]], the mole-rats. Further research also distinguished another possibly important criterion for eusociality, known as "the point of no return". This is characterized by eusocial individuals that become fixed into one behavioral group, which usually occurs before reproductive maturity. This prevents them from transitioning between behavioral groups and creates an animal society that is truly dependent on each other for survival and reproductive success. For many insects, this irreversibility has changed the anatomy of the worker caste, which is sterile and provides support for the reproductive caste.&lt;ref name=Crespi1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson2005 /&gt;

== Taxonomic range ==
Most eusocial societies exist in [[arthropod]]s, while a few are found in [[mammal]]s.

=== In insects ===

The order [[Hymenoptera]] contains the largest group of eusocial insects, including [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s{{mdash}}those with reproductive "queens" and more or less [[infertility|sterile]] "workers" and/or "soldiers" that perform specialized tasks.&lt;ref name=Holldobler1990&gt;{{cite book | last=Hölldobler | first=B. | title=The Ants | year=1990 | publisher=Belknap Press | location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the well-studied social wasp ''[[Polistes versicolor]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Polistes wasps and their social parasites: an overview |journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici |date=2006 |volume=43 |issue=5/6 |pages=531–549 |jstor=23736760}}&lt;/ref&gt; dominant females perform tasks such as building new cells and ovipositing, while subordinate females tend to perform tasks like feeding the larvae and foraging. The task differentiation between castes can be seen in the fact that subordinates complete 81.4% of the total foraging activity, while dominants only complete 18.6% of the total foraging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zara | first1 = Fernando | last2 = Balestieri | first2 = Jose | year = 2000 | title = Behavioural Catalogue of Polistes versicolor Olivier (Vespidae: Polistinae) Post-emergent Colonies | journal = Naturalia | volume = 25 | pages = 301–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While only a moderate percentage of species in bees (families [[Apidae]] and [[Halictidae]]) and wasps ([[Crabronidae]] and [[Vespidae]]) are eusocial, nearly all species of ants ([[Formicidae]]) are eusocial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Peters |first=Ralph S. |last2=Krogmann |first2=Lars |last3=Mayer |first3=Christoph |last4=Donath |first4=Alexander |last5=Gunkel|first5=Simon |last6=Meusemann |first6=Karen |last7=Kozlov |first7=Alexey |last8=Podsiadlowski |first8=Lars |last9=Petersen |first9=Malte |date=April 2017 |title=Evolutionary History of the Hymenoptera |journal=Current Biology |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=1013–1018 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.01.027|pmid=28343967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some major lineages within these groups are mostly or entirely eusocial, as well, such as the bee tribes [[Apini]], [[Bombini]], [[Euglossini]], and [[Meliponini]], and the wasp subfamilies [[Polistinae]] and [[Vespinae]]. Eusociality in these families is sometimes managed by a set of [[pheromones]] that alter the behavior of specific castes in the colony. These pheromones may act across different species, as observed in ''[[Apis andreniformis]]'' (black dwarf honey bee), where worker bees responded to queen pheromone from the related ''[[Apis florea]]'' (red dwarf honey bee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wongvilas | first1 = S. | last2 = Deowanish | first2 = S. | last3 = Lim | first3 = J. | last4 = Xie | first4 = V. R. D. | last5 = Griffith | first5 = O. W. | last6 = Oldroyd | first6 = B. P. | year = 2010 | title = Interspecific and conspecific colony mergers in the dwarf honey bees ''Apis andreniformis'' and ''A. florea'' | journal = Insectes Sociaux | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 251–255 | doi = 10.1007/s00040-010-0080-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pheromones are sometimes used in these castes to assist with foraging. Workers of the Australian stingless bee ''[[Tetragonula carbonaria]]'', for instance, mark food sources with a pheromone, helping their nest mates to find the food.&lt;ref name=Bartareau1996&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartareau, T. |year=1996 |title=Foraging Behaviour of Trigona Carbonaria (Hymenoptera: Apidae) at Multiple-Choice Feeding Stations |journal=Australian Journal of Zoology |volume=44 |issue=2 |doi=10.1071/zo9960143 |pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive specialization generally involves the production of sterile members of the species, which carry out specialized tasks to care for the reproductive members. It can manifest in the appearance of individuals within a group whose behavior or morphology is modified for group defense, including self-sacrificing behavior ("[[Altruism in animals|altruism]]"). An example of a species whose sterile caste displays this altruistic behavior is ''[[Myrmecocystus mexicanus]]'', one of the species of honey ant. Select sterile workers fill their abdomens with liquid food until they become immobile and hang from the ceilings of the underground nests, acting as food storage for the rest of the colony.&lt;ref name="Conway1986"&gt;Conway, John R. "The Biology of Honey Ants." ''The American Biology Teacher'', Vol. 48, No. 6 (Sep., 1986), pp. 335–343.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all social species of insects have distinct morphological differences between castes. For example, in the Neotropical social wasp ''[[Synoeca surinama]], ''social displays determine the caste ranks of individuals in the developing brood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=The Nature and Evolution of Swarming In Tropical Social Wasps (Vespidae, Polistinae, Polybini) | last=West-Eberhard | first=M. J. | date=1982 | journal=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; These castes are sometimes further specialized in their behavior based on age. For example,'' [[Scaptotrigona postica]]'' workers assume different roles in the nest based on their age. Between approximately 0–40 days old, the workers perform tasks within the nest such as provisioning cell broods, colony cleaning, and nectar reception and dehydration. Once older than 40 days, ''[[Scaptotrigona postica]]'' workers move outside of the nest to practice colony defense and foraging.&lt;ref name="Drones 435-447"&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Veen |first=J.W. |author2=Sommeijer, M. J. |author3=Meeuwsen F. |title=Behaviour of drones in Melipona (Apidae, Meliponinae) |journal=Insectes Sociaux |date=November 1997 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=435–447 |doi=10.1007/s000400050063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Lasioglossum aeneiventre]]'', a halictid bee from Central America, nests may be headed by more than one female; such nests have more cells, and the number of active cells per female is correlated with the number of females in the nest, implying that having more females leads to more efficient building and provisioning of cells.&lt;ref name= "Wcislo2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wcislo, W.

[[Termite]]s (order [[Blattodea]], infraorder [[Isoptera]]) make up another large portion of highly advanced eusocial animals. The colony is differentiated into various castes: the queen and king are the sole reproducing individuals; workers forage and maintain food and resources;&lt;ref&gt;Costa-Leonardo AM, Haifig I. (2014). Termite Communication During Different Behavioral Activities. In: Biocommunication of Animals. Dortrecht, Springer, 161-190.&lt;/ref&gt; and soldiers defend the colony against ant attacks. The latter two castes, which are sterile and perform highly specialized, complex social behaviors, are derived from different stages of [[pluripotent]] larvae produced by the reproductive caste.&lt;ref name=Thorne1997&gt;{{cite journal | last=Thorne | first=B.

This species also participates in cooperative brood care, in which individuals care for juveniles that are not their own.&lt;ref name=Kent1992 /&gt;

Some species of [[gall-inducing insect]]s, including the [[gall]]-forming [[aphid]], ''[[Pemphigus spyrothecae]]'' (order [[Hemiptera]]), and [[thrips]] (order [[Thysanoptera]]), were also described as eusocial.&lt;ref name=Stern1994&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stern | first=D.L. | title=A phylogenetic analysis of soldier evolution in the aphid family Hormaphididae | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society | year=1994 | volume=256 | issue=1346 | pages=203–209 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1994.0071| pmid=8029243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aoki2005&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aoki | first=S. | author2=Imai, M. | title=Factors affecting the proportion of sterile soldiers in growing aphid colonies | journal=Population Ecology | year=2005 | volume=47 | issue=2 | pages=127–136 | doi=10.1007/s10144-005-0218-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; These species have very high relatedness among individuals due to their partially [[asexual reproduction|asexual mode of reproduction]] (sterile soldier castes being clones of the reproducing female), but the gall-inhabiting behavior gives these species a defensible resource that sets them apart from related species with similar genetics. They produce soldier castes capable of fortress defense and protection of their colony against both predators and competitors. In these groups, therefore, high relatedness alone does not lead to the evolution of social behavior, but requires that groups occur in a restricted, shared area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/359724a0 | author=Crespi B. J. | year=1992 | title=Eusociality in Australian gall thrips | journal=Nature | volume=359 | issue=6397 | pages=724–726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These species have morphologically distinct soldier castes that defend against [[kleptoparasite]]s (parasitism by theft) and are able to reproduce [[parthenogenetically]] (without fertilization).&lt;ref name=Stern1996&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stern | first=D. | author2=Foster, W. | title=The evolution of soldiers in aphids | journal=Biological Reviews | year=1996 | volume=71 | pages=27–79 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1996.tb00741.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In crustaceans ===
Eusociality has also arisen three different times among some [[crustacean]]s that live in separate colonies. ''[[Synalpheus regalis]]'', ''[[Synalpheus filidigitus]]'', and ''[[Synalpheus chacei]]'', three species of parasitic shrimp that rely on fortress defense and live in groups of closely related individuals in tropical reefs and sponges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Multiple origins of eusociality among sponge-dwelling shrimps (''Synalpheus'') | first=J. Emmett | last=Duffy | author2=Cheryl L. Morrison | author3=Ruben Rios | journal=Evolution | volume=54 | issue=2 | year=2000 | pages=503–516 | pmid=10937227 | doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00053.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; live eusocially with a single breeding female and a large number of male defenders, armed with enlarged snapping claws. As with other eusocial societies, there is a single shared living space for the colony members, and the non-breeding members act to defend it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Bulletin of Marine Science | title=On the frequency of eusociality in snapping shrimps (Decapoda: Alpheidae), with description of a second eusocial species | author=Duffy, J. E | year=1998 | volume=63 | issue=2 | pages=387–400 | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1998/00000063/00000002/art00011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fortress defense hypothesis additionally points out that because sponges provide both food and shelter, there is an aggregation of relatives (because the shrimp do not have to disperse to find food), and much competition for those nesting sites. Being the target of attack promotes a good defense system (soldier caste); soldiers therefore promote the fitness of the whole nest by ensuring safety and reproduction of the queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duffy | first1=J.E. | title=The ecology and evolution of eusociality in sponge-dwelling shrimp | journal=Genes, Behaviors and Evolution of Social Insects | date=2003 | pages=217–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eusociality offers a competitive advantage in shrimp populations. Eusocial species were found to be more abundant, occupy more of the habitat, and use more of the available resources than non-eusocial species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duffy | first1=J.E. | last2=Macdonald | first2=K.S. | title=Kin structure, ecology and the evolution of social organization in shrimp: a comparative analysis | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | date=2010 | volume=277 | issue=1681 | pages=575–584 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.1483 | pmid=19889706 | pmc=2842683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hultgren | first1=K.M. | last2=Duffy | first2=J.E. | title=Phylogenetic community ecology and the role of social dominance in sponge-dwelling shrimp | journal=Ecology Letters | date=2012 | volume=15 | issue=7 | pages=704–713 | doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01788.x| pmid=22548770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Macdonald | first1=K.S. | last2=Rios | first2=R. | last3=Duffy | first3=J.E. | title=Biodiversity, host specificity, and dominance by eusocial species among sponge-dwelling alpheid shrimp on the Belize Barrier Reef | journal=Diversity and Distributions | date=2006 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=165–178 | doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2005.00213.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies add to these findings by pointing out that cohabitation was more rare than expected by chance, and that most sponges were dominated by one species, which was frequently eusocial.

=== In mammals ===
[[File:Naked mole rat-National Museum of Nature and Science.jpg|thumb|[[Naked mole-rat]], one of two eusocial species in the [[Blesmol|Bathyergidae]]]]

Among mammals, eusociality is known in two species in the [[Blesmol|Bathyergidae]], the [[naked mole-rat]] (''Heterocephalus glaber'') and the [[Damaraland mole-rat]] (''Fukomys damarensis''), both of which are [[diploid]] and highly [[inbred]].&lt;ref name=Burda&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Burda | first1=H.

However, this classification is controversial owing to disputed definitions of 'eusociality'.
To [[inbreeding avoidance|avoid inbreeding]], mole rats sometimes outbreed and establish new colonies when resources are sufficient.&lt;ref name="O'Riain and Faulkes, (2008)"&gt;{{cite book | last1=O'Riain | first1=M.J. | last2=Faulkes | first2=C.

Some mammals in the [[Carnivora]] and [[Primates]] exhibit eusocial tendencies. Perhaps most notable are [[meerkat]]s (''Suricata suricatta'') and [[dwarf mongoose]]s (''Helogale parvula''). These show cooperative breeding and marked reproductive skews. In the dwarf mongoose, the breeding pair receives food priority and protection from subordinates and rarely has to defend against predators.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Williams, S.A.  |author2=Shattuck, M.R.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2015 |title= Ecology, longevity and naked mole-rats: confounding effects of sociality? |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |volume=282 |issue=1802 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.1664 |pmid=25631992  |pages=20141664|pmc=4344137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===

An early 21st century debate focused on whether humans are [[prosocial]] versus eusocial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Foster |first1 = Kevin R. |last2 = Ratnieks |first2 = Francis L.W. |year = 2005 |title = A new eusocial vertebrate? |url = http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/foster/FosterRatnieksTREE2005.pdf |journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume = 20 |issue = 7 |pages = 363–364 |doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2005.05.005 |pmid = 16701397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward O. Wilson]], in his controversial&lt;ref name=Gintis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawkins2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pinker2012/&gt; 2012 book, ''The Social Conquest of the Earth'', referred to humans as a species of eusocial ape. He supported his reasoning by stating our eusocial similarities to ants, and by observing that early [[hominins]] cooperated to rear their children while other members of the same group hunted and foraged; he noted that all eusocial species went through just such a stage of collective rearing.&lt;ref name=Gintis/&gt; Humans also fall under some of Wilson's original criteria of eusociality (some kind of division of labor, overlapping generations, and cooperative care of young including ones that are not their own). Wilson argued that through cooperation and teamwork, ants and humans gain a type of "superpower" that is unavailable to other social animals that have failed to make the leap from social to eusocial. In his view, eusociality creates the superorganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Wilson |first = Edward O. |title = The Social Conquest of Earth |year = 2012 |publisher = Liveright }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's claims created a vigorous debate.&lt;ref name=Gintis&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Gintis |first1 = Herbert |title = Clash of the Titans.

D. Hamilton]]'s [[inclusive fitness]] theory, formulating instead a controversial theory of [[group selection]]. Wilson's claims, especially as formulated in his 2010 paper with Nowak and Tarnita,&lt;ref name=Nowak2010/&gt; were "vigorously rejected"&lt;ref name=Gintis/&gt; by up to 134 scientists at a time, writing in the same journal, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', as well as by well-known individuals such as [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref name=Dawkins2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Dawkins |first1 = Richard |authorlink1 = Richard Dawkins |title = The Descent of Edward Wilson.

Gintis thus agreed with Dawkins that humans are not eusocial, though he suggested some changes to Hamilton's rule to make it more complete.&lt;ref name=Gintis/&gt;

== Evolution ==
{{Main | Evolution of eusociality}}

=== Phylogenetic distribution ===

Eusociality is a rare but widespread phenomenon in species in at least seven orders in the [[Animal|animal kingdom]], as shown in the [[phylogenetic tree]] (non-eusocial groups not shown). All species of termites are eusocial, and it is believed that they were the first eusocial animals to evolve, sometime in the upper [[Jurassic]] period (~150 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Thorne | first1=B.L. | last2=Grimaldi | first2=DA | last3=Krishna | first3=K | editor-last1=Abe | editor-first1=T. | editor-last2=Bignell | editor-first2=D.E | editor-last3=Higashi | editor-first3=M. | title=Termites: evolution, sociality, symbioses, ecology. | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers | date=January 1, 2001 | origyear=1st.

Thus the number of independent evolutions of eusociality is still under investigation. The major eusocial groups are shown in boldface in the phylogenetic tree.

=== Paradox ===

Prior to the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], eusociality was seen as an apparent evolutionary paradox: if adaptive evolution unfolds by differential reproduction of individual organisms, how can individuals incapable of passing on their genes evolve and persist? In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] referred to the existence of sterile castes as the "one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my theory".&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles. ''On the Origin of Species'', 1859. Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin anticipated that a possible resolution to the paradox might lie in the close family relationship, which [[W.D. Hamilton]] quantified a century later with his 1964 [[inclusive fitness]] theory. After the gene-centered view of evolution was developed in the mid 1970s, non-reproductive individuals were seen as an extended phenotype of the genes, which are the primary beneficiaries of natural selection.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Inclusive fitness and haplodiploidy ===
{{further|haplodiploidy}}

According to [[inclusive fitness]] theory, organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, but also via increasing the reproductive output of other individuals that share their genes, especially their close relatives. Individuals are selected to help their relatives when the cost of helping is less than the benefit gained by their relative multiplied by the fraction of genes that they share, i.e. when ''Cost &lt; relatedness * Benefit''. Under inclusive fitness theory, the necessary conditions for eusociality to evolve are more easily fulfilled by [[haplodiploid]] species because of their unusual relatedness structure.

In [[haplodiploid]] species, females develop from fertilized eggs and males develop from unfertilized eggs. Because a male is haploid, his daughters share 100% of his genes and 50% of their mother's. Therefore, they share 75% of their genes with each other. This mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what W. D. Hamilton first termed "supersisters" which are more related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hamilton | first=W. D. | title=The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour II | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | date=20 March 1964 | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=17–52 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90039-6 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022519364900396 | accessdate=13 November 2012 | pmid=5875340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though workers often do not reproduce, they can potentially pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters than they would by having their own offspring (each of which would only have 50% of their genes). This unusual situation, where females may have greater fitness when they help rear siblings rather than producing offspring, is often invoked to explain the multiple independent evolutions of eusociality (arising at least nine separate times) within the haplodiploid group Hymenoptera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quiñones|first=Andrés E.|last2=Pen|first2=Ido|date=2017-06-23|title=A unified model of Hymenopteran preadaptations that trigger the evolutionary transition to eusociality|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=8|pages=15920|doi=10.1038/ncomms15920|issn=2041-1723|pmc=5490048|pmid=28643786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all eusocial species are haplodiploid (termites, some snapping shrimps, and mole rats are not). Conversely, many bees are haplodiploid yet are not eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, resulting in a hive of half-sisters that share only 25% of their genes. The association between haplodiploidy and eusociality is below statistical significance.&lt;ref name=Nowak2010/&gt; Haplodiploidy alone is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Edward O.|date=2008-01-01|title=One Giant Leap: How Insects Achieved Altruism and Colonial Life|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/58/1/17/233334|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=58|issue=1|pages=17–25|doi=10.1641/b580106|issn=1525-3244}}&lt;/ref&gt; However relatedness does still play a part, as monogamy (queens mating singly) has been shown to be the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=William O.

=== Ecology ===

Many scientists citing the close phylogenetic relationships between eusocial and non-eusocial species are making the case that environmental factors are especially important in the evolution of eusociality. The relevant factors primarily involve the distribution of food and predators.

Increased parasitism and predation rates are the primary ecological drivers of social organization. Group living affords colony members defense against enemies, specifically predators, parasites, and competitors, and allows them to gain advantage from superior foraging methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Edward O.|last2=Hölldobler|first2=Bert|date=2005-09-20|title=Eusociality: Origin and consequences|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/102/38/13367|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|language=en|volume=102|issue=38|pages=13367–13371|doi=10.1073/pnas.0505858102|issn=0027-8424|pmid=16157878|pmc=1224642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of some aphids, all eusocial species live in a communal nest which provides both shelter and access to food resources. Mole rats and ants live in underground burrows; wasps, bees, and some termites build above-ground hives; thrips and aphids inhabit galls (neoplastic outgrowths) induced on plants; ambrosia beetles and some termites nest together in dead wood; and snapping shrimp inhabit crevices in marine sponges. For many species the habitat outside the nest is often extremely arid or barren, creating such a high cost to dispersal that the chance to take over the colony following parental death is greater than the chance of dispersing to form a new colony. Defense of such fortresses from both predators and competitors often favors the evolution of non-reproductive soldier castes, while the high costs of nest construction and expansion favor non-reproductive worker castes.

The importance of ecology is supported by evidence such as experimentally induced reproductive division of labor, for example when normally solitary queens are forced together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cahan, S. H.  |author2=Gardner-Morse, E. | title=The emergence of reproductive division of labor in forced queen groups of the ant Pogonomyrmex barbatus | journal=Journal of Zoology | volume=291 | issue=1 | pages=12–22 | year=2013 | doi=10.1111/jzo.12071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, female [[Damaraland mole-rat]]s undergo hormonal changes that promote dispersal after periods of high rainfall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Molteno, A. J. |author2=Bennett, N. C. | title=Rainfall, dispersal and reproductive inhibition in eusocial Damaraland mole-rats (Cryptomys damarensis) | journal=Journal of Zoology | volume=256 |issue=4 | pages=445–448 | year=2002 | doi=10.1017/s0952836902000481}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the plasticity of eusocial traits in response to environmental cues.

Climate also appears to be a selective agent driving social complexity; across bee lineages and Hymenoptera in general, higher forms of sociality are more likely to occur in tropical than temperate environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toth|first=A. L.|last2=Robinson|first2=G. E.|date=2009-01-01|title=Evo-Devo and the Evolution of Social Behavior: Brain Gene Expression Analyses in Social Insects|url=http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/74/419|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology|language=en|volume=74|pages=419–426|doi=10.1101/sqb.2009.74.026|issn=0091-7451|pmid=19850850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, social transitions within Halictidae bees, where eusociality has been gained and lost multiple times, are correlated with periods of climatic warming. Social behavior in facultative social bees is often reliably predicted by ecological conditions, and switches in behavioral type have been experimentally induced by translocating offspring of solitary or social populations to warm and cool climates. In ''H. rubicundus'', solitary females produce a single brood in cooler regions and social females produce two broods in warmer regions. In another species of sweat bees, ''L. calceatum'', social phenotype has been predicted by altitude and micro-habitat composition, with social nests found in warmer, sunnier sites, and solitary nests found in adjacent, cooler, shaded locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shell|first=Wyatt A.|last2=Rehan|first2=Sandra M.|date=2017-07-24|title=Behavioral and genetic mechanisms of social evolution: insights from incipiently and facultatively social bees|journal=Apidologie|language=en|pages=1–18|doi=10.1007/s13592-017-0527-1|issn=0044-8435|volume=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multilevel selection ===
{{further|Group selection}}

Once pre-adaptations such as group formation, nest building, high cost of dispersal, and morphological variation are present, [[group selection|between-group competition]] has been cited as a quintessential force in the transition to advanced eusociality. Because the hallmarks of eusociality will produce an extremely altruistic society, such groups will out-reproduce their less cooperative competitors, eventually eliminating all non-eusocial groups from a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nowak | first1=M. A. | last2=Tarnita | first2=C. E. | last3=Wilson | first3=E. O. | title=The evolution of eusociality | journal=Nature | date=2010 | volume=466 | issue=7310 | pages=1057–1062 | doi=10.1038/nature09205 | pmid=20740005 | pmc=3279739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multilevel selection has however been heavily criticized by some for its conflict with the [[kin selection]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Abbot, Patrick  | title=Inclusive fitness theory and eusociality | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=471 | issue=7339 | pages=E1–E4 | year=2011 | doi=10.1038/nature09831 | pmid=21430721 | display-authors=etal | pmc=3836173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reversal to solitarity ===

A reversal to solitarity is an evolutionary phenomenon in which descendants of a eusocial group evolve solitary behavior once again. Bees have been model organisms for the study of reversal to solitarity, because of the diversity of their social systems. Each of the four origins of eusociality in bees was followed by at least one reversal to solitarity, giving a total of at least nine reversals.&lt;ref name="Michener 1969 299–342"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gadagkar 1993 215–216"/&gt; This suggests that eusociality is costly to maintain, and can only persist when ecological variables favor it. Disadvantages of eusociality include the cost of investing in non-reproductive offspring, and an increased risk of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zara, Fernando |author2=Balestieri, Jose |title=Behavioural Catalogue of Polistes versicolor Olivier (Vespidae: Polistinae) Post-emergent Colonies |journal=Naturalia |volume=25 |year=2000 |pages=301–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All reversals to solitarity have occurred among primitively eusocial groups; none have followed the emergence of advanced eusociality. The "point of no return" hypothesis posits that the morphological differentiation of reproductive and non-reproductive castes prevents highly eusocial species such as the honeybee from reverting to the solitary state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wongvilas, S. |author2=Deowanish, S |author3=Lim, J. |author4=Xie, V. R. D. |author5=Griffith, O. W. |author6=Oldroyd, B. P. |year=2010 |title=Interspecific and conspecific colony mergers in the dwarf honey bees ''Apis andreniformis'' and ''A. florea'' |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=251–255 |doi=10.1007/s00040-010-0080-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological and developmental mechanisms ==

An understanding of the physiological causes and consequences of the eusocial condition has been somewhat slow; nonetheless, major advancements have been made in learning more about the mechanistic and developmental processes that lead to eusociality.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fletcher | first=D. | author2=Ross K. | title=Regulation of Reproduction in Eusocial Hymenoptera | journal=Annual Review of Entomology | year=1985 | volume=30 | pages=319–343 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.30.1.319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Involvement of pheromones ===

[[Pheromones]] are thought to play an important role in the physiological mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of eusociality. In fact the evolution of enzymes involved both in the production and perception of pheromones has been shown to be important for the emergence of eusociality both within termites and in Hymenoptera.&lt;ref name="Harrison2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Mark C.|last2=Jongepier|first2=Evelien|last3=Robertson|first3=Hugh M.|last4=Arning|first4=Nicolas|last5=Bitard-Feildel|first5=Tristan|last6=Chao|first6=Hsu|last7=Childers|first7=Christopher P.|last8=Dinh|first8=Huyen|last9=Doddapaneni|first9=Harshavardhan|last10=Dugan|first10=Shannon|last11=Gowin|first11=Johannes|last12=Greiner|first12=Carolin|last13=Han|first13=Yi|last14=Hu|first14=Haofu|last15=Hughes|first15=Daniel S.

Queen mandibular glands were found to produce a mixture of five compounds, three [[aliphatic]] and two [[aromatic]], which have been found to control workers.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999&gt;{{cite journal | last=Vargo | first=E. | title=Reproductive development and ontogeny or queen pheromone production in the fire ant ''Solenopsis invicta'' | journal=Physiological Entomology | year=1999 | volume=24 | issue=4 | pages=370–376 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-3032.1999.00153.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandibular gland extracts inhibit workers from constructing queen cells in which new queens are reared which can delay the hormonally based behavioral development of workers and can suppress ovarian development in workers.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; Both behavioral effects mediated by the nervous system often leading to recognition of queens ([[Pheromone#Releaser|releaser]]) and physiological effects on the reproductive and endocrine system ([[Pheromone#Primer|primer]]) are attributed to the same pheromones. These pheromones volatilize or are deactivated within thirty minutes, allowing workers to respond rapidly to the loss of their queen.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt;

The levels of two of the aliphatic compounds increase rapidly in virgin queens within the first week after [[eclosion]] (emergence from the pupal case), which is consistent with their roles as sex attractants during the mating flight.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; It is only after a queen is mated and begins laying eggs, however, that the full blend of compounds is made.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; The physiological factors regulating reproductive development and pheromone production are unknown.

In several ant species, reproductive activity has also been associated with pheromone production by queens.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; In general, mated egg laying queens are attractive to workers whereas young winged virgin queens, which are not yet mated, elicit little or no response. However, very little is known about when pheromone production begins during the initiation of reproductive activity or about the physiological factors regulating either reproductive development or queen pheromone production in ants.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt;

Among ants, the queen pheromone system of the fire ant ''[[Solenopsis invicta]]'' is particularly well studied. Both releaser and primer pheromones have been demonstrated in this species. A queen recognition (releaser) hormone is stored in the poison sac along with three other compounds. These compounds were reported to elicit a behavioral response from workers. Several primer effects have also been demonstrated. Pheromones initiate reproductive development in new winged females, called female sexuals.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; These chemicals also inhibit workers from rearing male and female sexuals, suppress egg production in other queens of multiple queen colonies and cause workers to execute excess queens.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; The action of these pheromones together maintains the eusocial phenotype which includes one queen supported by sterile workers and sexually active males ([[Drone (bee)|drones]]). In queenless colonies that lack such pheromones, winged females will quickly shed their wings, develop ovaries and lay eggs. These virgin replacement queens assume the role of the queen and even start to produce queen pheromones.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; There is also evidence that queen weaver ants ''[[Oecophylla longinoda]]'' have a variety of [[exocrine]] glands that produce pheromones, which prevent workers from laying reproductive eggs.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt;

Similar mechanisms are used for the eusocial wasp species ''[[Vespula vulgaris]]''. In order for a ''Vespula vulgaris'' queen to dominate all the workers, usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony, she exerts pheromone to signal her dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne [[pheromone]] from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance.&lt;ref name= "Carpenter"&gt;{{Cite journal | url= | title=Phylogenetic relationships and classification of the Vespinae (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) | last=Carpenter | first=J.M | date=1987 | journal=Systematic Entomology | doi=10.1111/j.1365-3113.1987.tb00213.x | pmid= | pages=413–431 | volume=12| issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mode of action of inhibitory pheromones which prevent the development of eggs in workers has been convincingly demonstrated in the bumble bee ''[[Bombus terrestris]]''.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; In this species, pheromones suppress activity of the [[corpora allata]] and [[juvenile hormone]] (JH) secretion. The corpora allata is an endocrine gland that produces JH, a group of hormones that regulate many aspects of insect physiology.&lt;ref name=Feyereisen1981&gt;{{cite journal | last=Feyereisen | first=R. | author2=Tobe S. | title=A rapid partition assay for routine analysis of juvenile hormone released by insect corpora allata | journal=Analytical Biochemistry | year=1981 | volume=111 | issue=2 | pages=372–375 | doi=10.1016/0003-2697(81)90575-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; With low JH, eggs do not mature. Similar inhibitory effects of lowering JH were seen in halictine bees and polistine wasps, but not in honey bees.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt;

=== Other strategies ===

A variety of strategies in addition to the use of pheromones have evolved that give the queens of different species of social insects a measure of reproductive control over their nest mates.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; In many [[Polistes]] wasp colonies, monogamy is established soon after colony formation by physical dominance interactions among foundresses of the colony including biting, chasing and food soliciting.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; Such interactions created a dominance hierarchy headed by individuals with the greatest ovarian development.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; Larger, older individuals often have an advantage during the establishment of dominance hierarchies.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; The rank of subordinates is positively correlated with the degree of ovarian development and the highest ranking individual usually becomes queen if the established queen disappears.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; Workers do not [[oviposit]] when queens are present because of a variety of reasons: colonies tend to be small enough that queens can effectively dominate workers, queens practice selective [[oophagy]] or egg eating, or the flow of nutrients favors queen over workers and queens rapidly lay eggs in new or vacated cells.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; However, it is also possible that morphological differences favor the worker. In certain species of wasps, such as ''[[Apoica flavissima]]'' queens are smaller than their worker counterparts. This can lead to interesting worker-queen dynamics, often with the worker policing queen behaviors. Other wasps, like ''[[Polistes instabilis]]'' have workers with the potential to develop into reproductives, but only in cases where there are no queens to suppress them.

In primitively eusocial bees (where castes are morphologically similar and colonies usually small and short-lived), queens frequently nudge their nest mates and then burrow back down into the nest.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; This behavior draws workers into the lower part of the nest where they may respond to stimuli for cell construction and maintenance.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; Being nudged by the queen may play a role in inhibiting ovarian development and this form of queen control is supplemented by oophagy of worker laid eggs.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; Furthermore, temporally discrete production of workers and gynes (actual or potential queens) can cause size dimorphisms between different castes as size is strongly influenced by the season during which the individual is reared. In many wasp species worker caste determination is characterized by a temporal pattern in which workers precede non-workers of the same generation.&lt;ref name=Hunt2010&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hunt | first=J. | author2=Wolschin F. | author3=Henshaw M. | author4=Newman T. | author5=Toth A. | author6=Amdam G. | title=Differential gene expression and protein abundance evince ontogenetic bias toward castes in a primitively eusocial wasp | journal=PLOS ONE | date=17 May 2010 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010674 | volume=5 | issue=5 | pages=e10674 | pmid=20498859 | pmc=2871793}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, for example in the bumble bee, queen control weakens late in the season and the ovaries of workers develop to an increasing extent.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; The queen attempts to maintain her dominance by aggressive behavior and by eating worker laid eggs; her aggression is often directed towards the worker with the greatest ovarian development.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt;

In highly eusocial wasps (where castes are morphologically dissimilar), both the quantity and quality of food seem to be important for caste differentiation.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; Recent studies in wasps suggest that differential larval nourishment may be the environmental trigger for larval divergence into one of two developmental classes destined to become either a worker or a gyne.&lt;ref name=Hunt2010 /&gt; All honey bee larvae are initially fed with [[royal jelly]], which is secreted by workers, but normally they are switched over to a diet of pollen and honey as they mature; if their diet is exclusively royal jelly, however, they grow larger than normal and differentiate into queens. This jelly seems to contain a specific protein, designated as royalactin, which increases body size, promotes ovary development and shortens the developmental time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kamakura | first=Masaki | title=Royalactin induces queen differentiation in honeybees | journal=Nature | date=May 2011 | volume=473 | pages=478–483 | doi=10.1038/nature10093 | pmid=21516106 | issue=7348| hdl=2123/10940 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the differential expression in ''Polistes'' of larval genes and proteins (also differentially expressed during queen versus caste development in honey bees) indicate that regulatory mechanisms may occur very early in development.&lt;ref name=Hunt2010 /&gt;

== Definition debates ==
[[Image:AntsStitchingLeave.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Weaver ants]], here collaborating to pull nest leaves together, can be considered primitively eusocial, as they do not have permanent division of labor.]]

Subsequent to Edward O. Wilson's original definition, other authors have sought to narrow or expand the definition of eusociality by focusing on the nature and degree of the division of labor, which was not originally specified. A narrower and more widely accepted definition specifies the requirement for irreversibly distinct behavioral groups or castes (with respect to sterility and/or other features). Such a definition, however, excludes social [[vertebrate]]s, like the mole rats, and some Hymenoptera species, like the [[weaver ants]].&lt;ref name=Crespi1995 /&gt;

For example, depending on the availability of resources and the condition of the environment, mole rats can change between different types of social behaviors.&lt;ref name="O'Riain and Faulkes, (2008)"/&gt; In 2005, according to Wilson and Hölldobler, these types of animals would be considered primitively eusocial, which is different from eusocial, since the labor division is not permanent.&lt;ref name=Wilson2005 /&gt; A broader definition, on the other hand, would include mole rats because it allows for any temporary division of labor or non-random distribution of reproductive success to constitute eusociality.

In 2010, [[Martin Nowak|Nowak]], Tarnita and Wilson challenged the theoretical explanation of the evolution of eusociality. Based on the concept of [[inclusive fitness]], the [[kin selection]] theory considers the relatedness of individuals to be one of the most important factors that lead to eusociality. This brought up issues like the irrelevance of haplodiploidy and maternal control. Nowak et al. argued that the kin selection theory is inadequate because it can explain only a subset of eusocial populations due to its assumptions (i.e. "all interactions must be additive and pairwise" which excludes any interaction that involves more than two players). To them, the standard natural selection theory, which is a more general approach than the current explanation of eusociality, is the appropriate theory to use since it explains the same phenomenon and it would work for a larger number of eusocial cases. It also requires simpler mathematical calculations when explaining the evolution of eusociality.&lt;ref name=Nowak2010&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nowak | first=Martin | author2=Corina Tarnita | author3=Wilson, Edward O. | title=The evolution of eusociality | journal=Nature | date=26 August 2010 | volume=466 | pmid=20740005 | issue=7310 | pages=1057–1062 | doi=10.1038/nature09205 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7310/full/nature09205.html | pmc=3279739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/08/kin-selection-challenged/2/ |title=Kin Selection Challenged |publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper led to a large influx of publications that refuted Nowak et al.'s ideas and supported the validity and specificity of the kin selection theory.&lt;ref name=Gintis/&gt; Among these, Trivers and Hare studied the haplodiploid Hymenoptera, finding that the workers were able to win the parent-offspring conflict, countering the parents' best interest and selecting the outcome that has the greater benefit for the workers (i.e. reproductive success with higher relatedness to workers than the queen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Trivers | first=R. L. | author2=Hare, H. | title=Haploidploidy and the Evolution of the Social Insect | journal=Science | date=23 January 1976 | volume=191 | issue=4224 | pages=249–263 | doi=10.1126/science.1108197 | pmid=1108197}}&lt;/ref&gt; This refuted Nowak et al.'s defense that future offspring development could be based solely on the fitness of parents.

[[Image:Acer palmatum BotGartenMuenster Faecherahorn 6691.jpg|right|225px|thumb|This [[cultivar]] of [[Japanese maple]] has a [[dome]]-like habit.]]
'''Habit''' is equivalent to '''habitus''' in some applications in [[biology]]; the term refers variously to aspects of behaviour or structure, as follows: 
*In [[zoology]] (particularly in [[ethology]]), '''habit''' usually refers to aspects of more or less predictable ''behaviour'', [[instinct]]ive or otherwise, though it also has broader application. '''Habitus''' refers to the characteristic form or morphology of a species.
*In botany '''habit''' is the characteristic form in which a given species of [[plant]] grows (see [[Glossary of plant morphology#Plant habit]]).&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior ==
In [[zoology]], ''habit'' (not to be confused with ''habitus'' as described below) usually refers to a specific [[behavior]] pattern, either adopted, [[Learning|learned]], pathological, [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|innate]], or directly related to [[physiology]]. For example:
* ...the [cat] was in the ''habit'' of springing upon the [door knocker] in order to gain admission...&lt;ref name="ChambersChambers1835"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Chambers|author2=Robert Chambers|title=Chambers's Edinburgh Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA69|year=1835|publisher=W. Orr|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If these sensitive parrots are kept in cages, they quickly take up the ''habit'' of feather plucking.&lt;ref name="LantermannVriends1986"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Werner Lantermann|author2=Matthew M. Vriends|title=New Parrot Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ilp6E-rV4NYC&amp;pg=PA110|year=1986|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=978-0-8120-3729-6|pages=110–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[spider monkey]] has an [[arboreal]] ''habit'' and rarely ventures onto the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|forest]] floor.
* The [[brittlestar]] has the ''habit'' of breaking off arms as a means of [[Antipredator adaptation|defense]].

''Mode of life'' (or ''lifestyle'', ''modus vivendi'') is a concept related to ''habit'', and it sometimes is referred to as the ''habit'' of an animal. It may refer to the [[animal locomotion|locomotor]] capabilities, as in "([[motile]] ''habit''", [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]], errant, sedentary), [[feeding behaviour]] and mechanisms, nutrition mode (free-living, [[parasitic nutrition|parasitic]], [[holozoic nutrition|holozoic]], [[saprotrophic]], [[Primary nutritional groups|trophic type]]), type of [[habitat]] ([[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[arboreal]], [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]], [[marine biology|marine]], freshwater, seawater, [[benthos|benthic]], [[pelagic]], [[nektonic]], [[planktonic]], etc.),  period of activity ([[Diurnality|diurnal]], [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]]), types of [[ecological interaction]], etc.

The habits of plants and animals often change in response to changes in their [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. For example: if a species develops a disease or there is a drastic change of habitat or local climate, or it is removed to a different region, then the normal habits may change. Such changes may be either [[Wiktionary:pathological|pathological]], or [[Adaptive behavior|adaptive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wynne|first=Parry|title=Disease May Help Shape Animals' Migration Habits|url=http://www.livescience.com/10441-disease-shape-animals-migration-habits.html|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
In [[botany]], habit is the general appearance, growth form, or [[plant architecture|architecture]]. For example:
* Many species of [[maple]] have a [[shrub]]by ''habit'' and may form [[shrub|bushes]] or [[hedge (barrier)|hedge]]s rather than [[tree]]s.
* Certain [[alpine plants]] have been chosen for [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] because of their [[dwarfing|dwarf]] ''habit''.

Plants may be [[woody plant|woody]] or [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]]. The main types of woody plants are [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[liana]]s. Climbing plants ([[vine]]s) can be woody (lianas) or herbaceous (nonwoody vines). Plants can also be categorized in terms of their ''habit'' as [[subshrub]]s (dwarf shrub, bush), [[cushion plant]]s and [[succulent]]s.

There is some overlap between the classifications of plants according to their habit and their [[plant life-form|life-form]].

Other terms in biology refer similarly to various [[Taxon|taxa]]; for example:
* [[Fungi]] are described by their ''growth patterns'': [[mold]]s, [[yeast]]s, [[mushroom]]s and [[dimorphic fungi]]. 
* [[Lichen]]s structure is described their ''growth form'': foliose, [[crustose]], fruticose or gelatinous.
* [[Bryophyte]]s structure is described as foliose or [[thallose]].
* The structure of a given species of [[algae]] is referred to as its ''type'' or ''{{Interlanguage link multi|level of organization|de|3=Organisationsstufe}}''. 
* [[Bacteria]] are described by their ''[[Bacterial cellular morphologies|morphology]]'' or ''shape''. 
* [[Animal]] structure is described by  its ''[[body plan]]'', which encompasses the [[body symmetry]], the type of [[germ layer]]s and of [[body cavity|body cavities]].

Since the distinction between the concepts – mode of behavior and [[Morphology (biology)|morphological form]] – are significant in zoology, the term ''habitus'' (from which the word ''habit'' derives) is used to describe form as distinct from behaviour (''habit''). The term ''habitus'' also occurs in botanical texts, but there it is used almost interchangeably with ''habit'', because plant behaviour generally does not correspond closely to the concept of habits in the zoological sense.

[[File:PacificYew 7684.jpg|thumb|Pacific yew used for its anti-cancer properties]]
'''Herbalism''' is the study of using plants for medicinal purposes and has dated back since the first humans arose around 100,000 to 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Fu-Shuang|last2=Weng|first2=Jing-Ke|date=2017-07-31|title=Demystifying traditional herbal medicine with modern approach|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nplants2017109.pdf|journal=Nature Plants|language=En|volume=3|issue=8|pages=17109|doi=10.1038/nplants.2017.109|issn=2055-0278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, [[herb]]s have been used by cultures across the world to treat a variety of ailments and diseases. As modern medicine has progressed, traditional practices of [[herbalism]] have been considered{{by whom|date= November 2018}} to be primitive and archaic. But with the rise of new technology, the invaluable information accumulated by this practice in combination with [[biotechnology]] could be used to open up new way of approaching medicine through expanding the current library of compounds to be used for pharmaceutical advancement and being able to develop new and effective treatments for complex diseases.

== History of herbalism ==
With the 400,000 of plant species known to date, there are many [[metabolite]]s derived from plants that can be applied to human biology from curing headaches to [[autoimmune disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://modernherbalmedicine.com/articles/natural-approaches-to-autoimmune-disorders.html|title=Natural Approaches to Autoimmune Disorders|website=modernherbalmedicine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[morphine]], a pain drug, comes from [[poppy]], while [[paclixatxel]], an anti-[[cancer]] drug, comes from [[pacific yew]]. Humans have used these properties of plants across numerous cultures and have accumulated a rich collection of data on the causes and effects of certain plants on the human body. This gave rise to the practice of herbalism, which in the past served as many cultures’ primary method of dealing with ailments.								
The first written records of herbalism date back to [[Ancient Egypt]] around 1,500 BC in the [[Papyrus Ebers]] where more than 800 plant medicines and their effects on the human body were documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/ShenNongBenCaoLingTheDivineFarmersMateriaMedica/ShenNong%20Ben%20Cao%20ling(The%20Divine%20Farmers%20Materia%20Medica)_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Shen Nong Ben Cao Ling(The Divine Farmers Materia Medica)"|website=archive.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Compendium of Materia Medica, written by [[Li Shizhen]], a Chinese herbalist of the sixteenth century, contains information on 1,893 different herbs and 11,096 prescriptions, demonstrating the breadth of knowledge accumulated on herbalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/ebook/9780520959743/the-ben-cao-gang-mu|title=The Ben Cao Gang Mu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cultures, herbalism is often tied with spirituality. For example, in African culture, it is believed that healing is a religious act, while in the Chinese culture, vital energy (qi) and the balance between yin and yang play a crucial role in healing. Perhaps due to the lack of scientific evidence, herbalist practices has been disregarded, but it is no accident that so many cultures from across the world have chosen to treat disease through plants. Plants hold many biological solutions that can be applied to humans and paralleled with years of trial and error on behalf of herbalists to harness this information, herbalism has the potential to revolutionize modern medicine.								

== Modern herbalism ==
Currently, many of the treatments approved by the [[FDA]] are single-compounds and do not have the ability to treat complex issues such as cancer or [[type II diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patridge|first=Eric|last2=Gareiss|first2=Peter|last3=Kinch|first3=Michael S.|last4=Hoyer|first4=Denton|date=February 2016|title=An analysis of FDA-approved drugs: natural products and their derivatives|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25617672|journal=Drug Discovery Today|volume=21|issue=2|pages=204–207|doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2015.01.009|issn=1878-5832|pmid=25617672}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of the prescriptions found in herbalism use multiple ingredients mixed in a specific ratio to be synergistic. This is known as the combinatorial effect and it is hypothesized that through multiple metabolites targeting many different sites, the simultaneous action has the potential to cure these complex diseases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiyohara|first=Hiroaki|last2=Matsumoto|first2=Tsukasa|last3=Yamada|first3=Haruki|date=June 2004|title=Combination Effects of Herbs in a Multi-herbal Formula: Expression of Juzen-taiho-to's Immuno-modulatory Activity on the Intestinal Immune System|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC526207/|journal=Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|volume=1|issue=1|pages=83–91|doi=10.1093/ecam/neh004|issn=1741-427X|pmid=15257329}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a treatment called Food Allergy Herbal Formula-2 (FAHF-2) is currently under development to reduce [[peanut allergy|peanut allergies]]. Developed by Chinese scientist Xiu-Min Li, FAHF-2 was refined from an ancient traditional Chinese herbal prescription known as Wu Mei Wan, which was originally used to cure [[intestinal]] [[parasitic infection]]s but shares a similar mechanism as a [[food allergy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It consists of nine different herbs and has shown in trial to be effective for curing food allergies. However, when these nine different herbs are used individually, the treatment is much less effective, demonstrating the power of the combinatorial effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srivastava|first=Kamal D.|last2=Kattan|first2=Jacob D.|last3=Zou|first3=Zhong Mei|last4=Li|first4=Jing Hua|last5=Zhang|first5=Libang|last6=Wallenstein|first6=Sylvan|last7=Goldfarb|first7=Joseph|last8=Sampson|first8=Hugh A.|last9=Li|first9=Xiu-Min|date=January 2005|title=The Chinese herbal medicine formula FAHF-2 completely blocks anaphylactic reactions in a murine model of peanut allergy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15637565|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=115|issue=1|pages=171–178|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2004.10.003|issn=0091-6749|pmid=15637565}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many herbal prescriptions use the combinatorial effect, if this phenomenon can be analyzed and understood, many kinds of diseases could be cured with just a single prescription. 

The power of herbalism has shown itself to be very promising, but perhaps in conjunction with new developments in biotechnology, it can be used to its full potential.

== Developments in biotechnology ==

=== Bioinformatic algorithms ===
[[Bioinformatics]] is the use of computers to solve biological problems specifically within the fields of [[macromolecular]] structures, [[genome]] sequences, and the results of functional genomics experiments, where large sets of data are involved. For example, they have been used to search a database of gene expression data sets from human cells treated with various small molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamb|first=Justin|last2=Crawford|first2=Emily D.|last3=Peck|first3=David|last4=Modell|first4=Joshua W.|last5=Blat|first5=Irene C.|last6=Wrobel|first6=Matthew J.|last7=Lerner|first7=Jim|last8=Brunet|first8=Jean-Philippe|last9=Subramanian|first9=Aravind|date=2006-09-29|title=The Connectivity Map: Using Gene-Expression Signatures to Connect Small Molecules, Genes, and Disease|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5795/1929|journal=Science|language=en|volume=313|issue=5795|pages=1929–1935|doi=10.1126/science.1132939|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17008526}}&lt;/ref&gt; This database allows researchers to find patterns between small molecules and their mechanisms of action and can be applied to the field of herbalism through identifying the medicinal properties of plant compounds. For instance, this technology aided in the discovery of [[celastrol]], a compound extracted from plant called ''[[Tripterygium wilfordi]]'' commonly used in traditional traditional Chinese medicine as a [[leptin]] sensitizer used to control obesity. Gene expression signatures of lean and obese mice were compared and through analysis researchers determined that celsastrol was the top compound in the database that correlated with anti-leptin resistance. Later, celastrol was tested in mice and shown to reduce obesity and could potentially be used as a treatment for obesity in humans. This example demonstrates the power of plant metabolites and how valuable knowledge of herbalism can as new technology such as bioinformatic algorithms are employed.

=== Crystalline sponge method ===
X-ray single-crystal diffraction is often used to identify and analyze structures of compounds which is an important step to analyzing existing herbal prescriptions to develop new medications. However, this method has key restrictions which limit its use. X-ray single-crystal diffraction requires the sample to be obtained as single [[crystal]]s and in larger quantities. The crystalline sponge method would allow the sample to be aqueous and also requires as little as 80 nanograms of the sample.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inokuma|first=Yasuhide|last2=Yoshioka|first2=Shota|last3=Ariyoshi|first3=Junko|last4=Arai|first4=Tatsuhiko|last5=Hitora|first5=Yuki|last6=Takada|first6=Kentaro|last7=Matsunaga|first7=Shigeki|last8=Rissanen|first8=Kari|last9=Fujita|first9=Makoto|date=2013-03-28|title=X-ray analysis on the nanogram to microgram scale using porous complexes|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23538828?dopt=Abstract&amp;holding=npg|journal=Nature|volume=495|issue=7442|pages=461–466|doi=10.1038/nature11990|issn=1476-4687|pmid=23538828}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology uses networked porous metal complexes which have high molecule-recognition ability that can absorb molecules from an aqueous solution and order them regularly in the crystal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This way, the molecule can be analyzed with x-ray diffraction and provides a much higher accuracy than [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With this technology, researchers were able to uncover the complete stereochemistry of miyakosyne A, a scarce natural marine product. Due to the small structural difference between one [[methylene]] unit, chemical and spectroscopic methods were not precise enough to determine its exact structure, making x-ray diffraction the only viable method. A tiny crystal sponge of approximately 100 by 100 by 100 µm3 was treated with 5 mg of miyakosyne A and analyzed with x-ray diffraction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This allowed the complete structure of miyakosyne A to be revealed, making researchers hopeful for its application in a variety of its fields, including herbalism. As many organic compounds from plants must first be dried into a powder and in large quantities before analysis or analyzed through inaccurate methods such as NMR or mass spectrometry, the crystalline sponge method would greatly simplify the process of identifying compounds of interest. As a result, this would make it easier for researchers to study specific metabolites and their potential applications.

=== Combinatorial biosynthesis ===
Combinatorial biosynthesis is the use of engineered enzymes and pathways to produce different metabolites as opposed traditional chemical synthesis, which is costly, inefficient, and produces byproduct waste.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Huihua|last2=Liu|first2=Zihe|last3=Zhao|first3=Huimin|last4=Ang|first4=Ee Lui|date=2015-02-12|title=Recent advances in combinatorial biosynthesis for drug discovery|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4334309/|journal=Drug Design, Development and Therapy|volume=9|pages=823–833|doi=10.2147/DDDT.S63023|issn=1177-8881|pmc=4334309|pmid=25709407}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, in the context of herbalism, if a specific metabolite is scare in its herbal form, it can be produced through combinatorial synthesis to create a cheap and eco-friendly treatment. Currently, there are three major strategies for combinatorial biosynthesis: precursor-directed biosynthesis, enzyme-level modification, and pathway-level recombination.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Precursor-directed biosynthesis creates different metabolites through using different substrates through the same metabolic pathway. Because pathways are promiscuous and non-substrate specific, nonnative substrates can be integrated into the pathway to produce useful variations of metabolites.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If this approach is used to manipulate the metabolic pathway of certain herbs, it could lead to new drug discovery.

The second strategy for combinatorial biosynthesis is enzyme-level modification, entailing either swapping entire domains, modules, or subunits, site-specific [[mutagenesis]], or directed evolution. Swapping entire domains, modules, or subunits of [[enzyme]]s is the classical approach of combinatorial biosynthesis and allows for the direct editing of enzymes in a specific pathway, resulting in new metabolites.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Site-specific mutagenesis is the modification of individual amino acids in a sequence. Compared to the previous technique, it is less invasive, leading to higher yields of viable protein.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By introducing a single mutation, the substrate specificity of the protein can change, which could improve drugs and even make natural substances found in plants more effective at treating disease. Directed evolution takes a similar approach to site-specific mutagenesis, but creates larger alterations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As a result, new metabolites can emerge with and make existing treatments even more effective.

The final strategy for combinatorial biosynthesis is pathway-level recombination. This is the editing of the pathway itself. Pathway-level recombination is performed through using biosynthetic genes from different species of organisms to create a pathways in a host organism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This technique often used to edit yeast so they can produce metabolites of interest from rare herbs or plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4422">An '''ionospheric heater''', or an ionospheric HF pump facility, is a powerful radio wave transmitter with an array of [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s which is used for research of plasma turbulence, the [[ionosphere]] and upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name=LeyserWong&gt;Powerful electromagnetic waves for active environmental research in geospace, by T. B. Leyser and A. Y. Wong (Reviews of Geophysics, Vol. 47, RG1001, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; These transmitters operate in the high frequency (HF) range (3-30&amp;nbsp;MHz) at which radio waves are reflected from the ionosphere back to the ground. With such facilities a range of plasma turbulence phenomena can be excited in a semi-controlled fashion from the ground, during conditions when the ionosphere is naturally quiet and not perturbed by for example aurora. This stimulus-response type of research complements passive observations of naturally excited phenomena to learn about the ionosphere and upper atmosphere.

The plasma turbulence phenomena that are studied include different types on nonlinear wave interactions, in which different waves in the plasma couple and interact with the transmitted radio wave, formation and self organization of filamentary plasma structures, as well as electron acceleration. The turbulence is diagnosed by for example [[incoherent scatter]] radar, by detecting the weak electromagnetic emissions from the turbulence and optical emissions. The optical emissions result from the excitation of atmospheric atoms and molecules by electrons that have been accelerated in the plasma turbulence. As this process is the same as for the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]], the optical emission excited by HF waves have sometimes been referred to as artificial aurora, although sensitive cameras are needed to detect these emissions, which is not the case for the real aurora.

Ionospheric HF pump facilities need to be sufficiently powerful to provide the possibility for plasma turbulence studies, although any radio wave that propagates in the ionosphere affects it by heating the electrons. That radio waves affect the ionosphere was discovered already in the 1930s with the [[Luxemburg-Gorky effect|Luxemburg effect]]. Although the research facilities need to have powerful transmitters, the power flux in the ionosphere for the most powerful facility (HAARP) is below 0.03 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/factSheet.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007235012/http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/factSheet.html |archivedate=2009-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives an energy density in the ionosphere that is less than 1/100 of the thermal energy density of the ionospheric plasma itself.&lt;ref name=LeyserWong /&gt; The power flux may also be compared with the solar flux at the Earth's surface of about 1.5&amp;nbsp;kW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. During aurora generally no ionospheric effects can be observed with the HF pump facilities as the radio wave power is strongly absorbed by the naturally heated ionosphere.

'''Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA)''' is a tool to determine the most [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]] option among different competing alternatives to purchase, own, operate, maintain and, finally, dispose of an object or process, when each is equally appropriate to be implemented on technical grounds. For example, for a highway pavement, in addition to the initial construction cost, LCCA takes into account all the user costs, (e.g., reduced capacity at work zones), and agency costs related to future activities, including future periodic maintenance and rehabilitation. All the costs are usually discounted and total to a present-day value known as [[net present value]] (NPV). This example can be generalized on any type of material, product, or system.

In order to perform an LCCA scoping is critical - what aspects are to be included and what not?  If the scope becomes too large the tool may become impractical to use and of limited ability to help in decision-making and consideration of alternatives; if the scope is too small then the results may be skewed by the choice of factors considered such that the output becomes unreliable or partisan.  Usually, the LCCA term implies that environmental costs are not included, whereas the similar [[Whole-life cost|Whole-Life Costing]], or just [[Life Cycle Analysis]] (LCA), generally has a broader scope, including [[environmental costs]].
 
To help building and facility managers make sound decisions, the US [[Federal Energy Management Program]] (FEMP) provides guidance and resources on applying LCCA that permits the cost-effectiveness of [[Efficient energy use|energy]] and [[water efficiency]] investments to be evaluated (see [https://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=907459 NIST Handbook 135]).  This document includes an introduction to LCCA.

Life cycle cost can be conducted in two approaches: deterministic and probabilistic method.

[[File:US Army 52327 25th CAb touches down in Kuwait.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Small arms live-fire training, simulating advancing upon an enemy compound at [[Camp Buehring]], Kuwait, 2009.]]
A '''live-fire exercise''' or LFX is any [[military exercise]] in which a realistic scenario for the use of specific equipment is demonstrated. In the popular lexicon this is applied primarily to tests of weapons or weapon systems that are associated with the various branches of a nation's [[armed forces]], although the term can be applied to the civilian arena as well.

==Armed services==
Armed services usually use live-fire exercises as an opportunity to use real [[ammunition]] in a realistically created combat situation. The area in which these tests are conducted will be devoid of people to avoid casualties, and will likely be owned by the government which authorized the test. Most live-fire tests are conducted either against derelict equipment, such as tanks and ships, or against remotely controlled drones.

The purpose of this type of exercise is twofold: First, it offers recruits the chance to get accustomed to their weapons so that they will know how to properly operate them; secondly, this provides soldiers with an opportunity to fire live ammunition without having to worry about an actual enemy returning fire. This allows soldiers to get reacquainted with the feel and time of actually using and expending ammunition, rather than simply simulating the experience. Live-fire exercises of this type can be observed either by remotely controlled cameras or by long-range [[telescope|telescopic]] devices, such as [[binoculars]].

===Army===
[[File:Mercedes-Benz G-Class of the Canadian Land Forces.JPG|thumb|right|A Canadian Army Mercedes-Benz G-Class wagon in a live-fire exercise with Canadian soldier firing the mounted C6 GPMG.]]
An army, being the main branch responsible for land combat, is perhaps the best known group that conducts live-fire exercises. Most live-fire exercises occur within the [[military base]] where the units conducting the exercise are located. In some cases, one installation will host units from another for a larger live-fire exercise. Equipment tested under these circumstances range from [[small arms]] and [[assault rifle]] fire all the way up to missile systems and [[artillery]] fire. In the case of small arms, the tests are usually proficiency based and aimed at ensuring a soldier can fire their assigned weapons. In the case of the latter, missile systems may be test-fired at remotely controlled drones to simulate a situation in which enemy missiles or aircraft are launched at allied or friendly forces, while artillery units can take the opportunity to test new shells or to fire under adverse [[weather]] conditions for a chance to see how the artillery pieces will perform.

===Marine forces===
[[File:M1A1 firing main gun 3.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines conduct a live-fire exercise with an M1A1 Abrams Tank in Iraq.]]
For the most part [[marine (armed services)|marine]] corps live-fire exercises are similar to the army's live-fire exercises. One notable difference stems from the amphibious nature of a marine force's duty, which can lead the force to incorporate [[amphibious assault ship]]s when they conduct live-fire exercises.

===Air forces===
[[Image:B-2 Spirit bombing, 1994.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[B-2 Spirit]] dropping [[Mark 83 bomb|Mk.82 bombs]] in a 1994 training exercise off [[Point Mugu, California|Pt. Mugu]] in the Pacific Ocean.]]
An [[air force]], due to its nature, usually limits live-fire exercises to the air, although bombing exercises can be conducted as well.

During live-fire exercises dealing with air-to-air combat, remotely controlled [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] are frequently used to simulate enemy [[aircraft]]. In modern times, the drones are fired on by planes loaded with some type of [[air-to-air missile]], with the objective of the exercise being to destroy the drone. These test are usually done to ensure that guidance packages within the missiles will work, although they can be done to test other factors, such as a missile's susceptibility to [[Radar jamming and deception|jamming]] or to see if a new type of dodging technique will work against the missiles fired.

Live-fire exercises involving air-to-surface work are usually centered around [[precision-guided munition]]s. In some cases, tests involving bombs will make use of [[wikt:derelict|derelict]] buildings or, even more frequently, vehicles. Live-fire bombing exercises are usually conducted with precision-guided munitions to ensure that they work correctly, but are also used to test new and experimental weapons to ensure that they work as they were originally designed to. These test are usually monitored by [[chase plane]]s and by cameras to determine if everything worked as it was originally intended to.

Live-fire exercises may also be conducted against planes for the purpose of testing a plane's susceptibility to SAM sites, or as a means to test a plane's stealth features.

===Naval forces===
[[Image:USSTheSullivans-firingmissi.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer}}s fire anti-missile missiles during a live-fire exercise.]]
Naval live-fire exercises may use anti-ship [[missile]]s and [[torpedo]]es, although tests involving air-to-air and [[air-to-surface missile]], guns and bombs are not uncommon. Navies conduct live-fire exercises to test elements of an integrated defense system, such as the US [[Aegis combat system|Aegis]]; namely, its ability to track and destroy enemy [[anti-ship missile]]s. Tests can also include an integrated defense system's compatibility to fire new missiles or newer versions of the same missile. Live-fire tests are also conducted with a [[CIWS]] system, which is designed as the last line of defense for a ship. Surface ships also frequently test-fire the various guns kept and maintained aboard the vessel; these can range from sidearms and rifles up to the [[16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun|16" guns]] of the mothballed US {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}}s. This is done to maintain the skill and knowledge needed to operate the weapon. In the case of [[aircraft carrier]]s, the pilots assigned to the carrier may conduct air-to-air and air-to-surface missile exercises similar to those of the air force; additionally, these pilots may also conduct live-fire exercises against derelict ships. Recent aircraft carriers have incorporated missile-launching systems, and have taken part in live-fire exercises involving missiles.

For [[submarine]]s, both fast attack and ballistic missile (or "boomers"), live-fire tests may include firing sea-to-land missiles at targets on shore or launching dummy ballistic missiles; however, the most frequent live-fire exercises conducted by submarines involve firing torpedoes at a target. The best-known tests of torpedoes are those conducted against a derelict ship, typically on a ship from a navy's own [[reserve fleet|mothball fleet]] that has become too old or obsolete to warrant maintaining. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the torpedo will work under combat conditions, and such tests can be used to determine whether or not noisemakers or other [[decoy]]s will have any effect against the unit when launched.

===Use against training soldiers===
Some forces, especially in more [[authoritarian]] societies{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, have also been known to use live ammunition against their own forces in military exercises,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} to ensure that the soldiers 'take their training seriously' and get accustomed to being shot at before facing actual enemies. This kind of fire is usually not intended to kill anyone, though practices such as firing into the ground close to a soldier going through an obstacle course pose obvious risks.&lt;!-- Cannot cite this, but saw a movie about an Arab military training camp 15 years ago in which this was done. Please reference if possible --&gt;

German [[Waffen SS]] training involved the usage of live ammunition, designed to make the soldiers tougher than regular soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waffen-ss.com/page.php?page=100 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630135835/http://waffen-ss.com/page.php?page=100 |archivedate=30 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]], just after [[Joseph Stalin]] died in 1954, conducted a live [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[Nuclear testing|test]], during exercises at the [[Totskoye range]], against soldiers at a distance believed to be safe when in [[trench]]es. Any immediate deaths can't be proven today, but [[Russia]]n [[human rights]] activists assert that the long aftermath death toll is in the thousands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

A similar live nuclear test was performed by the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Marine Corps Test Unit]] and [[US Army]] Armored Task Force "Razor" during exercise [[Operation Teapot|Teapot]] ([[Desert Rock VI]]) at the [[Nevada Test Site]] in 1955.

The British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] and [[Royal Marines]] are also known to use live rounds, for the former during the jungle phase of training, and the latter using live rounds in their final exercise.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The SAS also use live-fire in regular close quarter combat training.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Non-military==
[[Image:CannonWithSmoke.jpg|thumb|left|Cannon in a Civil War [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]: The large amounts of gunpowder used often affected visibility significantly. Gunners hope for a strong wind that will allow them to continue to see their target.]]
Weapons tests are not usually conducted by civilian agencies; however, some civilian groups do conduct live-fire tests of equipment to ensure that they work properly or to test new methods. Examples here would include [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] ([[shooting range]]s) and [[controlled explosion]]s by demolition experts. Sometimes, [[historical reenactment]]s, such as those done for the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], will include live-fire demonstrations so the general public can observe historical equipment in action.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Other types==
[[Image:Peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg|thumb|right|Testing of the [[LG-118A Peacekeeper]] re-entry vehicles, all eight fired from only one missile. Each line represents the path of a warhead which, were it live, would detonate with the explosive power of twenty-five [[Little Boy|Hiroshima-style]] weapons.]]
Other types of live-fire exercises include various [[nuclear testing|nuclear tests]] conducted by the world's nuclear powers. Also in this group are the live-fire tests of new and exotic weaponry like the [[Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb]], or "Mother of all Bombs". Also numbered among the unique weapons tests are test fires of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBM) and [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s. Recently, a new addition was made to this area when live-fire tests began of the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, nicknamed "[[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars]]". These live-fire tests are aimed at intercepting incoming enemy ballistic missiles before they can detonate over their designated target.

==Dangers==
[[File:US Navy 090226-N-1251W-002 Gunners Mate 1st Class Leland Pasion explains how to inspect rounds for safety before a live-fire exercise aboard the amphibious dock landing ship USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Inspection for safety before a live-fire exercise]]
[[Image:USS Iowa BB61 Iowa Explosion 1989.jpg|thumb|right|On 19 April 1989, {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|6}}{{'}}s #2 turret [[USS Iowa turret explosion|exploded]] during a routine live-fire training exercise. Forty-seven sailors died as a result of the blast.]]
In any situation in which [[hazardous material]]s are involved there exists the potential for a mishap to occur, and when these mishaps occur the results can be as spectacular as they are deadly. All forms of ordnance contain some type of [[explosive]] charge to launch and, in most cases, detonate, a weapon. If these charges are inappropriately stored or handled the result can be serious injury or death to the person and anyone in the immediate vicinity. Other dangers include faulty guidance and sensory information, which can cause guided ordnance to inadvertently target friendly or neutral units. Advances in technology have helped to reduce, and in some cases eliminate, problems with these materials; nonetheless, extreme care must be given when using or implementing them. For example, the handling of [[gunpowder]] demands the use of [[glove]]s and an area free of [[static electricity]] and other potential sparks which could ignite the powder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6398">The '''Media Object Server''' ('''MOS''') protocol allows [[newsroom]] computer systems (NCS) to communicate using a standard protocol with [[video server]]s, [[sound server|audio servers]], [[Movie stills photographer|still stores]], and [[character generator]]s for [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosprotocol.com/ |title=MOS Project |publisher=Mosprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xml.coverpages.org/mos-x.html |title=Cover Pages: MOS-X (Media Object Server – XML) |publisher=Xml.coverpages.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MOS protocol is based on [[XML]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Qureshi |first=Rizwan |url=http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/34527/MOS-Protocol-Fundamentals |title=MOS Protocol Fundamentals – CodeProject® |publisher=Codeproject.com |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables the exchange of the following types of messages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosprotocol.com/mos_faq.htm#what_does_MOS_do |title=Mos Faq |publisher=Mosprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Descriptive Data for Media Objects. : The MOS "pushes" descriptive information and pointers to the NCS as objects are created, modified, or deleted in the MOS.  This allows the NCS to be "aware" of the contents of the MOS and enables the NCS to perform searches on and manipulate the data the MOS has sent.
; Playlist Exchange. : The NCS can build and transfer playlist information to the MOS.  This allows the NCS to control the sequence that media objects are played or presented by the MOS.
; Status Exchange. : The MOS can inform the NCS of the status of specific clips or the MOS system in general.  The NCS can notify the MOS of the status of specific playlist items or running orders.

MOS was developed to reduce the need for the development of [[Device driver|device specific drivers]]. By allowing developers to embed functionality and handle events, vendors were relieved of the burden of developing device drivers. It was left to the manufacturers to interface newsroom computer systems. This approach affords broadcasters flexibility to purchase equipment from multiple vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmaker.us/TheMOSStory.html |title=Newsmaker |publisher=Newsmaker.us |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also limits the need to have [[Computer operator|operators]] in multiple locations throughout the studio as, for example, multiple [[character generator]]s (CG) can be fired from a single control [[workstation]], without needing an operator at each CG console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topic/Media_Object_Server |title=Media Object Server – eNotes.com Reference |publisher=Enotes.com |date=2002-03-21 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOS enables [[journalists]] to see, use, and control media devices inside [[Associated Press]]'s [[ENPS]] system so that individual pieces of newsroom [[Video production|production]] technology speak a common [[XML]]-based language.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois, USA |url=http://www.enps.com/pages/enps_integration/what_is_mos |title=ENPS and MOS |publisher=Enps.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of MOS ==

The first meeting of the MOS protocol development group occurred at the [[Associated Press]] [[ENPS]] developer's conference in [[Orlando, Florida]] in 1998. The fundamental concepts of MOS were released to the public domain at that conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosprotocol.com/mos_faq.htm#MOS_group |title=Mos Faq |publisher=Mosprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an [[open protocol]], the MOS Development Group encourages the participation of broadcast equipment vendors and their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mosprotocol.com/how_to_participate_in_mos.htm |title=How to Participate in MOS |publisher=Mosprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927040738/http://www.mosprotocol.com/how_to_participate_in_mos.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 companies are said to work with AP on MOS-related projects. Compatible hardware and software includes [[video editing]], [[File server|storage]] and [[Content management system|management]]; [[Broadcast automation|automation]]; machine control; [[Teleprompter|prompters]]; character generators; [[Digital audio editor|audio editing]], store and management; [[web publishing]], [[Interactive television|interactive TV]], [[Electronic field production|field transmission]] and [[Motion graphics|graphics]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Current development is happening on two tracks: a [[Network socket|socket-based]] version, and a [[web service]] version. The current official versions of the MOS protocol, as of January 2011, are 2.8.4 (sockets) and 3.8.4 (web service).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosprotocol.com/MOS%20Files/2.8.4/MOS_Protocol_Version_2.8.4.htm |title=MOS Protocol 2.8.4 (Current) |publisher=Mosprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 proposals began to introduce IP Video support in the MOS protocol. This proposal allows representations of live IP Video sources such as NDI ([[Network Device Interface]]) to be included as MOS objects alongside MOS objects representing files to be played off disk&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sienna-tv.com/ndi/ndimonitor.html|title=NDIMonitor|website=www.sienna-tv.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] based implementation called jmos that is currently compatible with MOS specification 2.8.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/jmos/ |title=jmos – Open java implementation for Media Object Server Communications Protocol (MOS) – Google Project Hosting |publisher=Code.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded an Emmy to the MOS Group for "Development and Standardization of Media Object Server (MOS) Protocol."&lt;ref&gt;http://mosprotocol.com/forums/topic/mos-emmy-statues-nominations-and-voting/&lt;/ref&gt;

MCA was originally developed to describe the control in metabolic pathways
but was subsequently extended to describe signaling and [[Gene regulatory network|genetic networks]]. MCA has sometimes also been referred to as ''Metabolic Control Theory'' but this terminology was rather strongly opposed by [[Henrik Kacser]], one of the founders{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.

(2004) A Frequency Domain Approach to Sensitivity Analysis of Biochemical Systems , Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 108, 1143-1152.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that MCA can be [[Isomorphism|mapped directly]] on to classical [[control theory]] and are as such equivalent.

The two main control coefficients are the flux and concentration control coefficients. Flux control coefficients are defined by:

&lt;math&gt; C^J_{v_i} = \left( \frac{dJ}{dp} \frac{p}{J} \right) \bigg/ \left( \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial  p}\frac{p}{v_i} \right) = \frac{d\ln J}{d\ln v_i} &lt;/math&gt;

and concentration control coefficients by:

&lt;math&gt; C^S_{v_i}  = \left( \frac{dS}{dp} \frac{p}{S} \right)  \bigg/ \left( \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial p} \frac{p}{v_i} \right) = \frac{d\ln S}{d\ln v_i} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Summation Theorems ===
The flux control [[summation]] theorem was discovered independently by the Kacser/Burns group and the Heinrich/Rapoport group in the early 1970s and late 1960s. The flux control summation theorem [[Logical implication|implies]] that metabolic fluxes are systemic properties and that their control is shared by all [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] in the system. When a single reaction changes its control of the flux this is compensated by changes in the control of the same flux by all other reactions.

&lt;math&gt; \sum_i C^J_{v_i} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sum_i C^S_{v_i} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

== Elasticity Coefficients ==

The elasticity coefficient measures the local response of an enzyme or other chemical reaction to changes in its environment. Such changes include factors such as substrates, products or effector concentrations. For further information please refer to the dedicated page at [[Elasticity Coefficient]]s.

=== Connectivity Theorems ===

The [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]] theorems are specific relationships between elasticities and control coefficients. They are useful because they highlight the close relationship between the [[Chemical kinetics|kinetic]] properties of individual reactions and the system properties of a pathway. Two basic sets of theorems exists, one for flux and another for concentrations. The concentration connectivity theorems are divided again depending on whether the system species &lt;math&gt; S_n &lt;/math&gt; is different from the local species &lt;math&gt; S_m &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; \sum_i C^J_i \varepsilon^i_S = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sum_i C^{S_n}_i \varepsilon^i_{S_m} = 0 \quad n \neq m &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sum_i C^{S_n}_i \varepsilon^i_{S_m} = -1 \quad n = m &lt;/math&gt;

== Control Equations ==

It is possible to combine the summation with the connectivity theorems to obtain [[Closed-form expression|closed expressions]] that relate the control coefficients to the elasticity coefficients. For example, consider the simplest [[Trivial (mathematics)|non-trivial]] pathway:

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; X_o \rightarrow S \rightarrow X_1 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

We assume that &lt;math&gt; X_o &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; X_1 &lt;/math&gt; are [[Boundary (thermodynamic)|fixed boundary]] species so that the pathway can reach a steady state. Let the first step have a rate &lt;math&gt; v_1 &lt;/math&gt; and the second step &lt;math&gt; v_2 &lt;/math&gt;. Focusing on the flux control coefficients, we can write one summation and one connectivity theorem for this simple pathway:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C^J_{v_1} + C^J_{v_2} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; C^J_{v_1} \varepsilon^{v_1}_S + C^J_{v_2} \varepsilon^{v_2}_S = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Using these two equations we can solve for the flux control coefficients to yield:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C^J_{v_1} = \frac{\varepsilon^{2}_S}{\varepsilon^{2}_S - \varepsilon^{1}_S} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; C^J_{v_2} = \frac{-\varepsilon^{1}_S}{\varepsilon^{2}_S - \varepsilon^{1}_S} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Using these equations we can look at some simple extreme behaviors. For example, let us assume that the first step is completely insensitive to its product (i.e. not reacting with it), S, then &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon^{v_1}_S = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the control coefficients reduce to:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C^J_{v_1} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; C^J_{v_2} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

That is all the control (or sensitivity) is on the first step. This situation represents the classic [[Rate-determining step|rate-limiting step]] that is frequently mentioned in text books. The flux through the pathway is completely dependent on the first step. Under these conditions, no other step in the pathway can affect the flux. The effect is however dependent on the complete insensitivity of the first step to its product. Such a situation is likely to be rare in real pathways. In fact the classic rate limiting step has almost never been observed experimentally. Instead, a range of limitingness is observed, with some steps having more limitingness (control) than others.

We can also derive the concentration control coefficients for the simple two step pathway:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C^S_{v_1} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2}_S - \varepsilon^{1}_S} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; C^S_{v_2} = \frac{-1}{\varepsilon^{2}_S - \varepsilon^{1}_S} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== Three Step Pathway ==

Consider the simple three step pathway:

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; X_o \rightarrow S_1 \rightarrow S_2 \rightarrow X_1 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; X_o &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; X_1 &lt;/math&gt; are fixed boundary species, the control equations for this pathway can be derived in a similar manner to the simple two step pathway although it is somewhat more tedious.

&lt;math&gt;
C^J_{e_1} = \varepsilon^{2}_1 \varepsilon^{3}_2 / D
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C^J_{e_2} = -\varepsilon^{1}_1 \varepsilon^{3}_2 / D
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C^J_{e_3} = \varepsilon^{1}_1 \varepsilon^{2}_2 / D
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
where D the denominator is given by:

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
D = \varepsilon^{2}_1 \varepsilon^{3}_2 -\varepsilon^{1}_1 \varepsilon^{3}_2 + \varepsilon^{1}_1 \varepsilon^{2}_2
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that every term in the numerator appears in the denominator, this ensures that the flux control coefficient summation theorem is satisfied.

Likewise the concentration control coefficients can also be derived, for &lt;math&gt; S_1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
C^{S_1}_{e_1} = (\varepsilon^{3}_2 - \varepsilon^{2}_2) / D
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C^{S_1}_{e_2} = - \varepsilon^{3}_2 / D
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C^{S_1}_{e_3} = \varepsilon^{2}_2 / D
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
And for &lt;math&gt; S_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C^{S_2}_{e_1} = \varepsilon^{2}_1 / D
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C^{S_2}_{e_2} = -\varepsilon^{1}_1 / D
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C^{S_2}_{e_3} = (\varepsilon^{1}_1 - \varepsilon^{2}_1) / D
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the denominators remain the same as before and behave as a [[Normalizing constant|normalizing]] factor.

== Derivation using Perturbations ==

Control equations can also be derived by considering the effect of perturbations on the system. Consider that reaction rates &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; are determined by two enzymes &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Changing either enzyme will result in a change to the steady state level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the steady state reaction rates &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Consider a small change in &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; of magnitude &lt;math&gt;\delta e_1&lt;/math&gt;. This will have a number of effects, it will increase &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; which in turn will increase &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; which in turn will increase &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt;. Eventually the system will settle to a new steady state. We can describe these changes by focusing on the change in &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt;. The change in &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt;, which we designate &lt;math&gt;\delta v_2&lt;/math&gt;, came about as a result of the change &lt;math&gt;\delta x&lt;/math&gt;. Because we are only considering small changes we can express the change &lt;math&gt;\delta v_2&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;\delta x&lt;/math&gt; using the relation:

&lt;math&gt;
\delta v_2 = \frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x} \delta x
&lt;/math&gt;

where the derivative &lt;math&gt;\partial v_2/\partial x&lt;/math&gt; measures how responsive &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; is to changes in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The derivative can be computed if we know the rate law for &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if we assume that the rate law is &lt;math&gt;v_2 = k_2 x&lt;/math&gt; then the derivative is &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;. We can also use a similar strategy to compute the change in &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; as a result of the change &lt;math&gt;\delta e_1&lt;/math&gt;. This time the change in &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; is a result of two changes, the change in &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; itself and the change in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. We can express these changes by summing the two individual contributions:

&lt;math&gt;
\delta v_1 = \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial e_1} \delta e_1 + \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x} \delta x
&lt;/math&gt;

We have two equations, one describing the change in &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and the other in &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt;. Because we allowed the system to settle to a new steady state we can also state that the change in reaction rates must be the same (otherwise it wouldn't be at steady state). That is we can assert that &lt;math&gt;\delta v_1 = \delta v_2&lt;/math&gt;. With this in mind we equate the two equations and write:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x} \delta x = \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial e_1} \delta e_1 + \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x} \delta x &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the ratio &lt;math&gt;\delta x/\delta e_1&lt;/math&gt; we obtain:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta x}{\delta e_1} = \dfrac{-\dfrac{\partial v_1}{\partial e_1}}{\dfrac{\partial v_2}{\partial x} - \dfrac{\partial v_1}{\partial x}} &lt;/math&gt;

In the limit, as we make the change &lt;math&gt;\delta e_1&lt;/math&gt; smaller and smaller, the left-hand side converges to the derivative &lt;math&gt;dx/de_1&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\delta e_1 \rightarrow 0} \frac{\delta x}{\delta e_1} = \frac{dx}{de_1} = \dfrac{-\dfrac{\partial v_1}{\partial e_1}}{\dfrac{\partial v_2}{\partial x} - \dfrac{\partial v_1}{\partial x}} &lt;/math&gt;

We can go one step further and scale the derivatives to eliminate units. Multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; and dividing both sides by $x$ yields the scaled derivatives:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx}{de_1} \frac{e_1}{x}= \frac{-\dfrac{\partial v_1}{\partial e_1}\dfrac{e_1}{v_1}}
  {\dfrac{\partial v_2}{\partial x} \dfrac{x}{v_2} - \dfrac{\partial v_1}{\partial x} \dfrac{x}{v_1}} &lt;/math&gt;

The scaled derivatives on the right-hand side are the elasticities, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^v_x&lt;/math&gt; and the scaled left-hand term is the scaled sensitivity coefficient or concentration control coefficient, &lt;math&gt;C^x_{e}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; C^x_{e_1} = \frac{\varepsilon^1_{e_1}}{\varepsilon^2_x - \varepsilon^1_x} &lt;/math&gt;

We can simplify this expression further. The reaction rate &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; is usually a linear function of &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt;. For example, in the Briggs-Haldane equation, the reaction rate is given by &lt;math&gt;v= e_1 k_{cat} x/(K_m + x)&lt;/math&gt;. Differentiating this rate law with respect to &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; and scaling yields: &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{v_{1}}_{e_1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Using this result gives:

&lt;math&gt;
C^x_{e_1} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2_x - \varepsilon^1_x}
&lt;/math&gt;

A similar analysis can be done where &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; is perturbed. In this case we obtain the sensitivity of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
C^x_{e_2} = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2_x - \varepsilon^1_x}
&lt;/math&gt;

The above expressions measure how much enzymes &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; control the steady state concentration of intermediate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. We can also consider how the steady state reaction rates &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; are affected by perturbations in &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt;. This is often of importance to metabolic engineers who are interested in increasing rates of production. At steady state the reaction rates are often called the fluxes and abbreviated to &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_2&lt;/math&gt;. For a linear pathway such this example, both fluxes are equal at steady state so that the flux through the pathway is simply referred to as &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;. Expressing the change in flux as a result of a perturbations in &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; and taking the limit as before we obtain:
&lt;math&gt;
C^J_{e_1} = \frac{\varepsilon^1_x}{\varepsilon^2_x - \varepsilon^1_x}, \quad C^J_{e_2} = \frac{-\varepsilon^1_x}{\varepsilon^2_x - \varepsilon^1_x}
&lt;/math&gt;

The above expressions tell us how much enzymes &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; control the steady state flux. The key point here is that changes in enzyme concentration, or equivalently the enzyme activity, must be brought about by an external action.

'''Mucigel''' is a slimy substance that covers the [[root cap]] of the [[root]]s of [[plants]]. It is a highly hydrated [[polysaccharide]], most likely a [[pectin]], which is secreted from the outermost (epidermal) [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of the rootcap. Mucigel is formed in the [[Golgi bodies]] of such cells, and is secreted through the process of [[exocytosis]]. The layer of [[microorganism]]-rich soil surrounding the mucigel is called the [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|rhizosphere]].

Mucigel serves several functions, including&lt;!--but probably not limited to--&gt;:
* Protection of rootcap; prevents [[desiccation]]
* Lubrication of rootcap; allows root to more efficiently penetrate the soil
* Creation of [[symbiotic]] environment for [[nitrogen fixing]] [[bacteria]] (i.e. [[diazotrophs]]) and [[fungi]] (which help with water absorption)
* Provision of a 'diffusion bridge' between the fine root system and soil particles, which allows for a more efficient uptake of water and mineral nutrients by roots in dry soils.

The '''Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment''' ({{lang-nl|Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu}} or simply ''RIVM''),  is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] research institute that is an independent agency of the Dutch [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)|Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport]].

RIVM performs tasks to promote [[public health]] and a safe living [[Natural environment|environment]] by conducting research and collecting knowledge worldwide. The results are used to support the Dutch government in formulating its policy. RIVM's primary tasks are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onderzoekinformatie.nl/en/oi/nod/organisatie/ORG1236213/ Search of the Dutch Research Data Base (NOD)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rivm.nl/en/aboutrivm/ About RIVM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221023446/http://www.rivm.nl/en/aboutrivm/ |date=2007-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*research 
*policy support 
*national coordination 
*intervention programmes 
*provision of reliable information to the general public and to professionals working in health care, infectious diseases, the environment, nutrition and safety.

RIVM is located in [[Bilthoven]] and employs over 1500 people, many of whom work in multidisciplinary fields.

==History==

RIVM was founded in 1910 when the Central Laboratory for Public Health was created and the present size of the institute is the result of a merger between three government institutes in 1984. RIVM has now become a large, complex organisation with many different international links and a range of activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciesin.org/IC/rivm/about.html The Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)] (at Columbia University, New York, USA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==

The RIVM organisation consists of three domains with specific knowledge and expertise: Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology (Centre for Infectious Disease Control), Environment and Safety (including environmental incident service), Public Health and Health Services (including food and food safety).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9030">A '''paraprofessional educator''', alternatively known as a '''para''', '''para-pro''', '''paraeducator''', '''instructional assistant''', '''educational assistant''', '''teacher's aide''' or '''classroom assistant''', is a [[teaching]]-related position within a school generally responsible for specialized or concentrated assistance for [[student]]s in [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[secondary school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Zehrbach, Reid, et al. (1972) ''Paraprofessional Educator Manager: A New Professional Role in Early Childhood Education.'' 	Illinois Univ., Urbana. Inst. of Research for Exceptional Children. ERIC # ED064816.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all countries and states have a fixed definition of "paraprofessional" and may use all of the terms listed above, and many others, interchangeably.

== By country ==
Paraprofessionals are widely employed in schools in the United States and Canada, and in some European countries.

In England and Wales, the term used for education paraprofessionals is Teaching Assistant (TA). In recent years, legislation has been introduced which enables teachers to delegate a range of tasks to their TAs. Teaching Assistants in England and Wales can apply for Higher Level Teaching Assistant (HLTA) status, which requires them to document the ways in which their work meets a set of specified criteria. Those with HLTA status can substitute for teachers and (where appropriate) supervise other TAs. Scotland uses the term "classroom assistant" rather than "teaching assistant" as teaching is strictly not part of an assistant's responsibilities there.

In Canada, they are widely known as Educational Assistants to emphasize their role in educating special needs students.

In Japan, foreign native speakers employed as paraprofessional language educators (primarily English) are known as [[Assistant Language Teacher]]s. Similar institutions exist in Germany and France where they are known as [[Foreign Language Assistant]]s.

==Duties==
Paraprofessional educators generally assist [[teacher]]s in the [[classroom]], supervise students outside of the classroom, or provide administrative support for teaching.&lt;ref name=BLS&gt;Teacher Assistants in the [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos153.htm Occupational Outlook Handbook] 2010-11 Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Job duties range from filling teaching positions to supplementing regular classroom [[curriculum]] with additional enrichment activities for students. Other positions include classroom aides, special education aides, school library technical assistants, and tutors.

Some paraprofessionals work directly with students, in which case they may listen to students practice reading aloud, help students understand and complete their assignments, or assist students with special needs.&lt;ref name=BLS /&gt;  

Many paraprofessionals are assigned to supervise groups of students who are eating, playing outside, or on [[field trip]]s. They may be assigned to perform clerical work for a teacher, in which case they may grade assignments, type up records for attendance or grades, set up equipment, and help prepare [[Instructional_materials|materials for instruction]], e.g., by making photocopies of worksheets.&lt;ref name=BLS /&gt; 

Many teacher assistants work primarily or exclusively with students who have special educational needs. Their duties vary according to the needs of the student, and may include physical care for students who are unable to care for themselves (such as feeding, lifting, moving, or cleaning), behavioral management, or academic assistance.&lt;ref name=BLS /&gt;

Some paraprofessionals don't work with the school directly, rather the school district.  Paraprofessionals can work in other programs that the school district provide, such as [[Childcare|school aged childcare]] and recess/ lunch duties. This links the paraprofessional to the students, but not the teacher or schools itself.  

The role of the paraprofessional educator is constantly evolving. Today, more than ever, paraprofessionals are teaching lessons, working with small groups for remediation, leading extracurricular clubs/sports and are no longer simply the "teacher's aide" of the past.

==Requirements==
Requirements to become a paraprofessional vary widely, normally ranging from a [[high school diploma]], [[G.E.D.]], two years of [[college]] education, or an [[associate degree]]. Some positions may require experience, particularly as an aide in an instructional role like in [[special education]] and in [[English as a Second Language]] instruction.

===Regulation===
In the United States, the [[No Child Left Behind]] federal legislation requires that educational paraprofessionals be "highly qualified".&lt;ref&gt;[http://arkedu.state.ar.us/commemos/static/fy0203/1623.html Paraprofessional certification.] Arkansas State Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of highly qualified is left to the individual states, as are the means for measuring qualification. The [[United States Department of Education]] has issued guidelines regarding paraprofessionals whose positions are funded under [[Title&amp;nbsp;I]] of the federal legislation. According to the Department of Education, "Paraprofessionals who provide instructional support", include those who:
#Provide one-on-one tutoring if such tutoring is scheduled at a time when a student would not otherwise receive instruction from a teacher,
#Assist with classroom management, such as by organizing instructional materials,
#Provide instructional assistance in a computer laboratory,
#Conduct parental involvement activities,
#Provide instructional support in a library or media center,
#Act as a translator, or
#Provide instructional support services under the direct supervision of a highly qualified teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/paraguidance.doc Title I, Section 1119(g)(2): Paraprofessional Guidance], U.S. Department of Education. Retrieved 2/9/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certification===
Some jurisdictions offer or require certification for some paraprofessionals. Others may require a contracted paraprofessional to pass an examination. Some require none of the above

A paraprofessional certificate is typically a certificate that an educator has obtained by passing an exam enabling them to perform a task requiring extensive knowledge, but not requiring a college degree and teaching license. Subject areas could include any areas of education such as a GED Teacher, Alternate School Teacher, ISS Teacher, After School Tutor, Home School Teacher, Credit Recovery Teacher, Continuing Education Teacher, and any Special Education area which could be but is not limited to CML, tutoring, and providing any needs to an individual student.

===Training===

The training of paraprofessional educators varies widely by state and district.  The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) in collaboration with the National Paraeducator Resource Center (NPRC) has validated some guidelines for use in training paraeducators to serve "individuals with exceptionalities"  A link to these can be found here [http://www.cec.sped.org/Standards/Paraeducator-Preparation-Guidelines [link&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;].   Professional development companies, such as 321insight.com and PD360 provide targeted training to enhance paraeducator competency.

===Salaries===
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' records of Occupational Employment Statistics, teacher assistants earn an average salary of $25,270. Teacher assistants in Elementary and Secondary Education make an average of $25,490, while teacher assistants working at Child Day Care services earn less and teacher assistants working in higher education earn more. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes259041.htm Teacher Assistants.] Bureau of Labor Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special education==
Paraprofessional educators are frequently used to help support student/s in [[special education]] settings.  Paraprofessional educators in these roles work with students with a variety of disabilities including learning disabilities, emotional disturbance, [[autism]] spectrum disorders, [[ADHD]], [[schizophrenia]], developmental disabilities, and communication disorders. Paraprofessional educators may work in special classrooms, resource rooms or serve as inclusion assistants who accompany individual students throughout their day. Paraprofessional educators in these roles may require specialized training in behavior management, de-escalation, personal-[[professional boundaries]], and sometimes physical restraint.&lt;ref&gt;5.

'''Petri AG''' was an [[automotive parts]] company based in [[Germany]]. It was acquired by the Japanese company [[Takata Corporation]] in 2000, forming the European subsidiary Takata-Petri.

== History ==
Petri AG was founded in [[Aschaffenburg]] in 1899 by Richard Petri and started to produce [[steering wheel]]s and interior trims.
Richard Petri founded the first plant (Plant 01) in [[Aschaffenburg]], which is now the European Headquarters of [[Takata Corporation#Takata-Petri|Takata-Petri]]. Later, Petri's firm expanded further and added other plants for the production of plastic parts, like the Plant 02 in Nilkheim, near [[Aschaffenburg]] and Plant 03 in Albertshausen, near [[Bad Kissingen]]. Steering wheel production is still located in Aschaffenburg. Other plastic components and interior trims are mostly produced in Albertshausen. Aside from these plants, Petri also founded some research and assembly plants later on. In 1981, Petri AG developed and produced the first [[airbag]] system in collaboration with [[Mercedes-Benz]]. In 2000, Japanese competitor [[Takata Corporation]] acquired Petri AG, forming the subsidiary Takata-Petri, renamed Takata AG in early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.takata.com/en/about/history.html History], Takata Corporation website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Takata AG is a global leader{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} in the production of [[steering wheel]]s and plastic parts, not only in the [[automotive]] industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6629">{{for|other uses of ''prolepsis''|Prolepsis (disambiguation)}}
'''Procatalepsis''', also called '''prolepsis''' or '''prebuttal''', is a [[figure of speech]] in which the speaker raises an objection to their own argument and then immediately answers it. By doing so, they hope to strengthen their argument by dealing with possible counter-arguments before their audience can raise them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialog Theory for Critical Argumentation|author=Douglas N. Walton|pages=106|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|isbn=978-90-272-1885-8|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]] anticipating future responses and answering possible objections will set up one's argument for a strong defense. The ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' states that there are three distinct theoretical uses of prolepsis: argumentation, literary discussion, and conjunction with narratological analyses of the order of events.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaDict"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childers|first1=Joseph|last2=Hentzi|first2=Gary|title=The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism|year=1995|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-07243-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2013}}

In argumentation, procatalepsis is used to answer the opponent's possible objections before they can be made. In literary discussion, procatalepsis is used as a figure of speech in which a description is used before it is strictly applicable. Sayings such as "I'm a dead man" exemplify the suggestion of a state that has not yet occurred. In [[Narratology|narratological analyses]] prolepsis can be used with the order of events and presentation of events in texts. This refers to the study of narrative in respect to "flash-forwards" in which a future event serves as an interruption of the present time of the text.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaDict" /&gt;

Example:
* "It is difficult to see how a pilot boat could be completely immune to capsizing or plunging, but pilot boat design criteria must meet the needs of the industry and pilotage authorities."

As a linguistic phenomenon found in both classic and current languages, prolepsis is described as the construction whereby the subject of a subordinate clause occurs by anticipation as an object in the main clause.&lt;ref&gt;Panhuis, Dirk. "Prolepsis in Greek as a Discourse Strategy." ''Glotta'' 62.1/2 (1984): n. pag. JSTOR. Web. 30 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this definition is strictly technical as used in linguistics, it has also been used to describe the more general phenomenon of objects or phrases appearing earlier than intended or expected. 

==Other examples in rhetoric and argument== 

Procatalepsis as a rhetorical technique is also related to and used in other forms and techniques. A [[hypophora]] is described as a figure of speech in which a speaker raises a question then immediately answers it. Since these questions are often raised as possible dissenting opinions or audience objections, the hypophora can be said to be a use of procatalepsis.

The [[Straw Man]] argument, an informal fallacy in which one misrepresents an opposing argument in order to further one's own, can serve as an example of misused procatalepsis. In this fallacy, the rhetor misconstrues the words, arguments, or views of an opponent, most often on purpose, to facilitate rebuttal or create a false impression on the audience. This, in effect, creates a "straw man" against which the rhetor will then defend and strengthen his or her argument. &lt;ref&gt;Douglas Walton, "The Straw Man Fallacy." ''In Logic and Argumentation'', ed. Johan van Bentham, Frans H. van Eemeren, Rob Grootendorst and Frank Veltman. Amsterdam, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, North-Holland, 1996. pp. 115-128&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct use of procatalepsis is still an effective tactic in an argument, since it allows the rhetor to answer opponents before they have a chance to raise the counterargument themselves. This "inoculation" can be subtle, but also signaled rather obviously (e.g. "Now, my opponent might argue that X. But, as you can see, Y"). The unique benefit to this more overt approach is twofold: The rhetor successfully replies to an opposing argument or audience objection, but also builds a sort of trust and authority with the audience. Then, if the opponent does in fact bring up the argument that the rhetor anticipated, the rhetor appears to be correct not only in the subject matter of the argument but in the general course of the argument itself.

==Inoculation==
Procatalepsis is linked to the rhetorical term [[Inoculation theory|inoculation]]. The ''Encyclopedia of Communication Theory'' describes this rhetorical technique in relation to its medical definition: introducing small doses of viruses to the body in order to build up immunization.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Littlejohn|first1=Stephen W.|last2=Foss|first2=Karen A.|title=Encyclopedia of Communication Theory|year=2009|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-5937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2013}} In rhetoric, the small dose of the threat parallels to the awareness of the opposing argument that is used to build up one's argument by defense in prolepsis. William McGuire proposed the Inoculation Theory in 1964 to challenge attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that make an argument more resistant when exposed to counter views in weakened, small doses. Persuasion research in the 1950s found that providing two sides of an issue created a greater resistance to later arguments.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm" /&gt; This is closely related to the rhetorical use of procatalepsis as an opposing argument to defend the intended view of the argument.

Inoculation and procatalepsis are both present in certain courtroom situations, as described in the ''Encyclopedia of Communication Theory''. An attorney may set up their defense by disclaiming the negative views or classifications of the accused as untrue: "The prosecutor will call Ms. Jones evil, a bad mother, and a poor member of society, but these labels are not true. I will prove to you their inaccuracy." When the prosecutor asserts an attack on Ms. Jones' character, the jury is already prepared and expecting to hear it and they may question or even discount these accusations. The goal is not to overwhelm the audience members with anticipation or the opposing view of the argument, but rather to use the inverse argument to one's advantage through strategic rhetoric.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm" /&gt;

'''Purchasing''' refers to a [[business]] or [[organization]] attempting to acquire [[Good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] to accomplish its goals. Although there are several organizations that attempt to set standards in the purchasing process, processes can vary greatly between organizations. Typically the word “purchasing” is not used interchangeably with the word “[[procurement]]”, since procurement typically includes [[expediting]], supplier quality, and transportation and logistics (T&amp;L) in addition to purchasing.

== Details ==
Purchasing managers/directors, and procurement managers/directors guide the organization’s [[Procurement|acquisition]] procedures and standards. Most organizations use a three-way check as the foundation of their purchasing programs{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}. This involves three departments in the organization completing separate parts of the acquisition process. The three departments do not all report to the same senior manager, to prevent unethical practices and lend credibility to the process. These departments can be purchasing, receiving and accounts payable; or engineering, purchasing and [[accounts payable]]; or a plant manager, purchasing and accounts payable. Combinations can vary significantly, but a purchasing department and accounts payable are usually two of the three departments involved.

When the receiving department is not involved, it is typically called a two-way check or two-way purchase order. In this situation, the purchasing department issues the purchase order [[receipt]] not required. When an invoice arrives against the order, the accounts payable department will then go directly to the requestor of the purchase order to verify that the goods or services were received. This is typically what is done for goods and services that will bypass the receiving department. A few examples are software delivered electronically, NRE work (non-reoccurring engineering services), consulting hours, etc.

Historically, the purchasing department issued [[purchase order|purchase]] for supplies, services, equipment, and raw materials. Then, in an effort to decrease the administrative costs associated with the repetitive ordering of basic consumable items, "blanket" or "master" agreements were put into place. These types of agreements typically have a longer duration and increased scope to maximize the quantities of scale concept. When additional supplies were required, a simple release would be issued to the supplier to provide the goods or services.

Another method of decreasing administrative costs associated with repetitive contracts for common material, is the use of company credit cards, also known as "[[Purchasing Card]]s" or simply "P-Cards". P-card programs vary, but all of them have internal checks and audits to ensure appropriate use. Purchasing managers realized once contracts for the low dollar value consumables are in place, procurement can take a smaller role in the operation and use of the contracts. There is still oversight in the forms of audits and monthly statement reviews, but most of their time is now available to negotiate major purchases and setting up of other long term contracts. These contracts are typically renewable annually.

This trend away from the daily procurement function (tactical purchasing) resulted in several changes in the industry. The first was the reduction of personnel. Purchasing departments were now smaller. There was no need for the army of clerks processing orders for individual parts as in the past. Another change was the focus on negotiating contracts and procurement of large capital equipment. Both of these functions permitted purchasing departments to make the biggest [[financial]] contribution to the organization. A new term and job title emerged – [[Strategic sourcing]] and Sourcing Managers. These professionals not only focused on the bidding process and negotiating with suppliers, but the entire supply function. In these roles they were able to add value and maximize savings for organizations. This value was manifested in lower [[inventories]], less personnel, and getting the end product to the consumer quicker. Purchasing managers' success in these roles resulted in new assignments outside to the traditional purchasing function – logistics, materials management, distribution, and warehousing. More and more purchasing managers were becoming Supply Chain Managers handling additional functions of their organization's operation. Purchasing managers were not the only ones to become Supply Chain Managers. Logistic managers, material managers, distribution managers, etc. all rose to the broader function and some had responsibility for the purchasing functions now.

In [[accounting]], purchases is the amount of goods a company bought throughout this year. It also refers to information as to the kind, quality, quantity, and cost of goods bought that should be maintained. They are added to [[inventory]]. Purchases are offset by [[Purchase Discount]]s and [[Purchase Returns and Allowances]]. When it should be added depends on the [[Free On Board]] (FOB) policy of the trade. For the purchaser, this new inventory is added on shipment if the policy was FOB shipping point, and the seller remove this item from its inventory. On the other hand, the purchaser added this inventory on receipt if the policy was FOB destination, and the seller remove this item from its inventory when it was delivered.

Goods bought for the purpose other than direct selling, such as for [[Research and Development]], are added to inventory and allocated to Research and Development [[expense]] as they are used. On a side note, equipments bought for Research and Development are not added to inventory, but are [[Capital expenditure|capitalized]] as [[asset]]s.

=== Acquisition process ===
The revised [[Acquisition (military)|acquisition]] process for major systems in the U.S. Department of Defense is shown in the next figure. The process is defined by a series of phases during which technology is defined and matured into viable concepts, which are subsequently developed and readied for production, after which the systems produced are supported in the field.&lt;ref name="DAUP 01"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203501/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Acquisition Process.jpg|center|thumb|560px|Model of the Acquisition Process.&lt;ref name = "DAUP 01"/&gt;]]
The process allows for a given system to enter the process at any of the development phases. For example, a system using unproven technology would enter at the beginning stages of the process and
would proceed through a lengthy period of technology maturation, while a system based on mature
and proven technologies might enter directly into engineering development or, conceivably, even
production. The process itself includes four phases of development:&lt;ref name = "DAUP 01"/&gt;

* Concept and Technology Development: is intended to explore alternative concepts based on assessments of operational needs, technology readiness, risk, and affordability.
* Concept and Technology Development phase begins with concept exploration. During this stage, concept studies are undertaken to define alternative concepts and to provide information about capability and risk that would permit an objective comparison of competing concepts.
* System Development and Demonstration phase. This phase could be entered directly as a result of a technological opportunity and urgent user need, as well as having come through concept and technology development.
* The last, and longest, phase is the Sustainment and Disposal phase of the program. During this phase all necessary activities are accomplished to maintain and sustain the system in the field in the most cost-effective manner possible.

=== Selection of bidders ===
This is the process where the organization identifies potential suppliers for specified supplies, services or equipment. These suppliers' credentials and history are analyzed, with the products or services they offer. The bidder selection process varies from organization to organization, but can include running credit reports, interviewing management, testing products, and touring facilities. This process is not always done in order of importance, but rather in order of expense. Often purchasing managers research potential bidders obtaining information on the organizations and products from media sources and their own industry contacts. Additionally, purchasing might send Request for Information (RFI) to potential suppliers to help gather information. Engineering would also inspect sample products to determine if the company or organisation can produce products they need. If the bidder passes both of these stages engineering may decide to do some testing on the materials to further verify quality standards. These tests can be expensive and involve significant time of multiple technicians and engineers. Engineering management must make this decision based on the cost of the products they are likely to procure, the importance of the bidders’ product to production, and other factors. Credit checks, interviewing management, touring plants as well as other steps could all be utilized if engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain managers decide they could help their decision and the cost is justifiable.

Other organizations might have minority procurement goals to consider in selection of bidders. Organizations identify goals in the use of companies owned and operated by certain ethnicities or women owned business enterprises. Significant utilizing of minority suppliers may qualify the firm as a potential bidder for a contract with a company or governmental entity looking to increase their minority supplier programs

This selection process can include or exclude international suppliers depending on organizational goals and criteria. Companies looking to increase their pacific rim supplier base may exclude suppliers from the Americas, Europe, and Australia. Other organizations may be looking to purchase domestically to ensure a quicker response to orders as well as easier collaboration on design and production.

Organizational goals will dictate the criteria for the selection process of bidders. It is also possible that the product or service being procured is so specialized that the number of bidders are limited and the criteria must be very wide to permit competition. If only one firm can meet the specifications for the product then the purchasing managers must consider utilizing a “Sole Source” option or work with engineering to broaden the specifications if the project will permit alteration in the specifications. The sole source option is the part of the selection of bidders that acknowledges there is sometimes only one reasonable supplier for some services or products. This can be because of the limited applications for the product cannot support more than one manufacturer, proximity of the service provided, or the products are newly designed or invented and competition is not yet available.

=== Bidding process ===
This is the process an organization utilizes to procure goods, services or equipment. Processes vary significantly from the stringent to the very informal. Large corporations and governmental entities are most likely to have stringent and formal processes. These processes can utilize specialized bid forms that require specific procedures and detail. The very stringent procedures require bids to be open by several staff from various departments to ensure fairness and impartiality. Responses are usually very detailed. Bidders not responding exactly as specified and following the published procedures can be disqualified. Smaller private businesses are more likely to have less formal procedures. Bids can be in the form of an email to all of the bidders specifying products or services. Responses by bidders can be detailed or just the proposed dollar amount.

Most bid processes are multi-tiered. Acquisitions under a specified dollar amount can be “user discretion” permitting the request or to choose who ever they want. This level can be as low as $100 or as high as $10,000 depending on the organization. The rationale is the savings realized by processing these request the same as expensive items is minimal and does not justify the time and expense. Purchasing departments watch for abuses of the user discretion privilege. Acquisitions in a mid range can be processed with a slightly more formal process. This process may involve the user providing quotes from three separate suppliers. Purchasing may be asked or required to obtain the quotes. The formal bid process starts as low as $10,000 or as high as $100,000 depending on the organization. The bid usually involves a specific form the bidder fills out and must be returned by a specified deadline. Depending of the commodity being purchased and the organization the bid may specify a weighted evaluation criterion. Other bids would be evaluated at the discretion of purchasing or the end users. Some bids could be evaluated by a cross-functional committee. Other bids may be evaluated by the end user or the buyer in Purchasing. Especially in small, private firms the bidders could be evaluated on criteria or factors that have little if anything to do with the actual bid. Examples of these factors are history of the bidder with the company, history of the bidder with the company’s senior management at other firms, and bidder’s breadth of products.

=== Technical evaluation ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Technical evaluations, evaluations of the technical suitability of the quoted goods or services, if required, are normally performed prior to the commercial evaluation. During this phase of the procurement process, a technical representative of the company (usually an engineer) will review the proposal and designate each bidder as either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.

Technical evaluation is usually carried out against a set of pre-determined Technical Evaluation Criteria. There are two types of criteria, general criteria (whereby scores are given if they are met) and essential criteria (failing of which shall render the bid technically disqualified).

=== Commercial evaluation ===
[[Cost of Money]] is calculated by multiplying the applicable currency interest rate by the amount of money paid prior to the receipt of the Goods. If the money was to have remained in the buyer's account, interest would be drawn. That interest is essentially an additional cost associated with such Progress or Milestone payments.

The manufacturing location is taken into consideration during the evaluation stage primarily to calculate for freight costs and regional issues. For instance, it is common in Europe for factories to close during the month of August for a summer holiday. Labor agreements may also be taken into consideration and may be drawn into the evaluation if the particular region is known to have frequent labor disputes.

The manufacturing [[lead-time]] is the time from the placement of the order (or time final drawings are submitted by the Buyer to the Seller) until the goods are manufactured and prepared for delivery. Lead-times vary by commodity and can range from several days to years.

Transportation time is evaluated while comparing the delivery of goods to the Buyer's required use-date. If Goods are shipped from a remote port, with infrequent vessel transportation, the transportation time could exceed the schedule and adjustments would need to be made.

Delivery Charges - the charge for the Goods to be delivered to a stated point.
* Bid Validity
* Packing
* Bid Adjustments
* Terms and Conditions
* Seller's Services
* Standards Organizations
* Financial Review
* Payment Currency
* Risk Analysis - market volatility, financial stress within the bidders
* Testing

=== Negotiating ===
Negotiating is a key skillset in the Purchasing field. One of the goals of Purchasing Agents is to acquire goods per the most advantageous terms of the buying entity (or simply, the "Buyer"). Purchasing Agents typically attempt to decrease costs while meeting the Buyer's other requirements such as an on-time delivery, compliance to the commercial terms and conditions (including the warranty, the transfer of risk, assignment, auditing rights, confidentiality, remedies, etc.).

Good negotiators, those with high levels of documented "cost savings", receive a premium within the industry relative to their compensation. Depending on the employment agreement between the Purchasing Agent (Buyer) and the employer, Buyer's cost savings can result in the creation of value to the business, and may result in a flat-rate bonus, or a percentage payout to the Purchasing Agent of the documented cost savings.

Purchasing Departments, while they can be considered as a support function of the key business, are actually revenue generating departments. For example, if the company needs to buy $30 million USD of widgets and the Purchasing Department secures the widgets for $25M USD, the Purchasing Department would have saved the company $5M USD. That savings could exceed the annual budget of the department, which in effect would pay the department's overhead - the employee's salaries, computers, office space, etc.

=== Post-award administration ===
Post-award administration typically consists of making minor changes, additions or subtractions, that in some way change the terms of the agreement or the Seller's Scope of Supply. Such changes are often minor, but for auditing purposes must be documented into the existing agreement. Examples include increasing the quantity of a Line Item or changing the metallurgy of a particular component.

=== Order closeout ===
Is the closing of order.&lt;!-- DUH! --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15503">'''Red Hill''' is an archaeological term for a small mound with a reddish colour found in the coastal and tidal river areas of [[East Anglia]] and [[Essex]]. Red Hills are formed as a result of generations of salt making, deriving their colour from the rubble of clay structures used in the salt-making process that have been scorched red by fires used to evaporate [[sea water]] to make salt cakes.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DR Wilson, ''Air Photo Interpretation'' (Tempus, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; They date from the [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age Britain|Iron Age]] and into the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]].&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

Small red mounds had been a noticeable feature of the coastal landscape in Essex and East Anglia for many centuries,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; but the first archaeological investigation&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"&gt;Fawn, A.J., Evens, K.A., McMaster, I., Davies, G.M.R.

(1879) 'The Salting Mounds of Essex' in Archaeological Journal XXXVI&lt;/ref&gt; Originally Stopes thought that the mounds were [[Medieval]] in date, and were used for producing [[alkalis]] for glass making.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; However other investigations, such as that by [[John Christopher Atkinson]], who compared them to similar mounds in [[Yorkshire]], saw the mounds as prehistoric or Roman in date.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; In 1906 the Essex Archaeological Society and Essex Field Club created the ''Red Hills Exploration Committee'' to identify the purpose, age and extent of the Red Hills, undertaking excavations at [[Langenhoe]] and [[Goldhanger]], and later in 1909 at [[Canewdon]] on the [[River Crouch]].&lt;ref name="Reader 1908"&gt;Reader, F.W.

(1910) 'Report of the Red Hills Exploration Committee 1908-9'. Proceedings of the Society of Antiquities XXIII 2nd Series&lt;/ref&gt; Conclusions as to the exact nature of the type of activity carried out at the Red Hills were still lacking however, with archaeologist [[Flinders Petrie]] suggesting that the sites were where [[kelp]] and [[seaweed]] had been burned in order to create alkali solutions for soap and glass,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; whilst other archaeologists suggested pottery kilns.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; However some early comparisons to salt-processing sites in [[Brittany]] in the early Twentieth century lead to tentative suggestions that salt was at the heart of the Red Hills' purpose,&lt;ref&gt;Wilmer, H.

G. Hoskins|Hoskins]].&lt;ref&gt;WG Hoskins, ''Fieldwork in Local History'', (Faber &amp; Faber Ltd. 1967, pp. 154-158)&lt;/ref&gt; During these investigations much information was gathered both on the date and purpose of the Red Hills.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

==Description and purpose==

===Description===

Over 300 Red Hills have been identified so far, mostly along the Essex and [[Norfolk]] coasts, with others in [[Suffolk]] and [[Kent]].&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The vast majority of Red Hills are located on low-lying coastal flats in [[Tidal estuary|tidal estuaries]] and in back-waters like Hamford Water between Harwich and [[Walton-on-the-Naze]] in Essex.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; They take the form of low mounds, ranging in size from about 200 square metres (equivalent to a 16m diameter circle) to a hectare (equiv. to a 115m diameter circle).&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; William Stopes identified one on Mersea Island near the Strood Channel which was 30 acres in size, but acknowledged that it may have consisted of more than one mound.&lt;ref name="Stopes 1979"/&gt; The height of many mounds has been much truncated by ploughing, with others located close to rivers and the sea either being eroded away or covered with [[Alluvium|alluvial silt]],&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; but an average sized mound at Peldon in Essex, 0.2 acres in size, still stands at a height of roughly 1.3m (meaning a volume of about 1000 cu metres, equivalent to 1500 tons of earth).&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The strata of the mounds is made up of tips of [[briquetage]] (broken fragments of fired clay from hearths, evaporation pans and other salt-making furniture which give the mound its red colouration), ash, charcoal and unfired clay.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lesley &amp; Roy Adkins, ''The Handbook of British Archeology''&lt;/ref&gt; Most have large pits cut into the ground around them that have been lined with clay to produce a water-tight tank.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

===Features===

Several structures relating to salt production are found at Red Hills, whose purpose in the process is inferred from archaeological analysis and from analogies to Medieval and more recent techniques for obtaining sea salt.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

====Settling Tanks====

Rows of oval clay-lined pits dug into the alluvium around the Red Hills are interpreted as tanks for holding sea water.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; These tanks are usually in groups, with those found at Red Hills at Goldhanger,&lt;ref name="Brisay 1978"&gt;de Brisay, K.W. (1978) ‘The Excavations of a Red Hill at Peldon, Essex, with notes on some other sites’ Antiquities Journal LVIII pt.1&lt;/ref&gt; Maldon,&lt;ref name="Reader 1908"/&gt; and at Leigh Beck at Canvey Island&lt;ref name="Brisay 1972"&gt;de Brisay, K.W. (1972) Preliminary Report on the Exploration of the Red Hill at Osea Road, Maldon, Essex. Published by Colchester Archaeological Group Annual Bulletin 15&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of groups of three. Most tanks are between 1 and 2m in diameter, and around 1m deep, with a potential holding capacity of over 1000 litres.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

====Hearths====

''In situ'' hearths are relatively rare at Red Hill sites.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Parts of hearth substructures were found at the Red Hills on Osea Road near Maldon&lt;ref name="Brisay 1972"/&gt; and at [[Tollesbury]] in Essex,&lt;ref&gt;de Brisay, K.W. (1978) ‘A Red Hill at Tollesbury, Essex: Its background and excavation. Report on the First Year’  Published in Colchester Archaeological Group Bulletin 21&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the first identifiable hearth was found at Peldon close to the central settling tank in a group of three.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; This consisted of a subrectangular 1.8m x 0.8m clay walled structure, surviving to 0.4m high, with evidence of multiple firings.&lt;ref name="Brisay 1978"/&gt; Other hearths containing [[Imbrex and tegula|Roman tile]] have been found at Leigh Beck on Canvey Island, and others have been located at Red Hills along Fenn Creek near [[South Woodham Ferrers]].&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

====Flues====

Flue ducts for directing hot gas from fires to heat chambers have been found at some sites, but are very rare.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; At the ''Goldhanger VIII'' Red Hill nine flues and two ''fire-floors'' on top of the Red Hill mound,&lt;ref name="Reader 1910"/&gt; suggesting that they post-date most of the activity on the site.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

====Briquetage====

''[[Briquetage]]'' refers to the broken fragments of clay structures found in great quantities at Red Hill sites.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Much of this material is locally made and of a crude quality, suggesting that it was expedient.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Although some of the clay appears to have been fired in a kiln, much of it is bonfire-made.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The redness of the material is created during its use, as the iron oxide content of the clay is [[Redox reaction|converted]] to red iron ferric oxide in an atmosphere containing a surplus of oxygen.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Some briquetage has lost its red colouration during its use as part of the salt evaporation furniture, turning grey, purple or brown.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; 90 per cent of briquetage consists of flat faced rectangular slabs of varying sizes, which can be reconstructed into large, rectangular clay vessels and trays.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Some examples from Langenhoe and Peldon have decorated rims.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Other examples of briquetage include pedestals and ''T-shapes'', believed to have held the rectangular clay vessels above fires,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; triangular ''fire-bars'' 20–40&amp;nbsp;cm in size that may suspended vessels above fires,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; triangular or plectrum-shaped wedges and long clay rods of unknown purposes,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; and ''pinch-props'', small lumps of briquetage that have a flat base and at least one other facet, possibly used to mend clay vessels.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

===Purpose===

The interpretation of these features as salt-making sites comes from the discovery of these features and artefacts associated with them. The briquetage and signs of burning at all Red Hills are taken as evidence that intensive use of fires took place on the sites.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Red Hills are found in close proximity to sources of salt water,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; and since Red Hills have clay-lined tanks for holding liquids associated with them, this is seen as an important fluid used in the activities which took place at the mounds.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The charcoal, red-scorching, and fired clay briquetage is seen as evidence that fires and heating took place at the mounds,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; and so, since some of the briquetage has traces of green-glaze on its surfaces caused by the vitrification of clay with salt acting as a [[Ceramic flux|fluxing agent]],&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; the suggestion that [[saline water|salt water]], stored in the water-tight tanks, was being heated in clay trays to obtain salt as the end product is seen as the most likely purpose of the Red Hills.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Other industrial activities such as pottery making and metal working are seen as less likely due to the lack of any supporting evidence for such processes.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

==Function==

Red Hills are located on low-lying land close to marshes, estuaries and tidal bays,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; with rivers such as the Crouch and [[River Roach|Roach]], which have low [[freshwater]] outflows, having Red Hills far inland along their tidal estuaries.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;  Use of the Red Hill sites is believed to have been seasonal, with activity occurring from Spring until the end of Summer.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The drier conditions of Spring allow for the construction of the clay structures for the season (which if constructed in damp conditions would have cracked when fired), and the collection of fire-wood.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Analysis of the charred remains of fire-wood from Red Hills sites suggests that [[coppicing|coppiced wood]] was used in the fires at the site, an activity that in itself required careful management over time.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

Sea-water may have been collected in tidally-fed [[Solar pond|sun pans]] cut into tidal channels to allow for solar evaporation in the initial stages of the process, although no such features have been positively identified.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Instead, sea water seems to have been collected in the clay-lined settling tanks, which were submerged by the high-tide or were filled manually when the tide was lower.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The depth of these tanks suggests that they were designed to allow the alluvial mud and other unwanted solids in the water to settle to the bottom, to be emptied out later.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; As this settling procedure could take several hours, having more than one tank allowed for them to be at different stages of the settling process, meaning that salt making could continue with little down-time.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

Sea-water contains around 3.5 per cent solids on average, 2.7 per cent being salt,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; with 96.5ccs of sea-water having  to be evaporated in order to obtain 2.7&amp;nbsp;g of salt.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; This would have been done by transferring water from the tanks to large rectangular trays suspended over fires that would have evaporated off the water.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; For the first batch of water the tray would have been filled before the fire was lit, to reduce the risk of cracking, after which water would have been constantly added from the tanks whilst salt crystals would have been constantly ladled out.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; [[Lime scale|Lime]] and [[gypsum]] hard-scale would form first, as pan-scale at the base of the trays.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Then, as the salt content in the trays rose from 2.7 per cent to 28 it would start to form crystals in the boiling water (meaning that 90ccs out of an original 100ccs of water would have needed to evaporate before salt crystals form).&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Removing crystals before all of the water had evaporated from the tray was the intention, as it meant that impurities would have been left in the tray and the process could be continued all day without having to close the evaporation process down whilst salt was collected.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; In theory the tray vessel could have been topped up with water roughly one hundred times before the concentration of the [[Bittern (salt)|bittern]] impurities and pan-scale left behind became too high.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The salt crystals ladled out of the trays would have been placed in drying vessels and baskets close to a source of heat.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; From this "salt cakes" would be created, ready for transportation.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14069">'''Religiosity''' is difficult to define, but different scholars have seen this concept as broadly about religious orientations and involvement. It includes experiential, ritualistic, ideological, intellectual, consequential, creedal, communal, doctrinal, moral, and cultural dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holdcroft|first1=Barbara|title=What is Religiosity?|journal=Catholic Education: A Journal of Inquiry and Practice|date=September 2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=89–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists of religion have observed that the people's beliefs, sense of belonging, and behavior often are not congruent with an individual's actual religious beliefs since there is much diversity in how one can be religious or not.&lt;ref name="chaves" /&gt; Multiple problems exist in measuring religiosity. For instance, variables such as church attendance produce different results when different methods are used such as traditional surveys vs time use surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rossi |first1=Maurizio |last2=Scappini |first2=Ettore |title=Church Attendance, Problems of Measurement, and Interpreting Indicators: A Study of Religious Practice in the United States, 1975-2010 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |date=June 2014 |volume=53 |issue=2 |page=249–267 |doi=10.1111/jssr.12115 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jssr.12115 |publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |issn=0021-8294}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Diversity in an individuals' beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors==

Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have established that "religious congruence" (the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs or that religious beliefs are chronologically linear and stable across different contexts) is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent; like in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture. As examples of religious incongruence he notes, "Observant Jews may not believe what they say in their Sabbath prayers. Christian ministers may not believe in God. And people who regularly dance for rain don’t do it in the dry season."&lt;ref name="chaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaves|first1=Mark|title=SSSR Presidential Address Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date=March 2010|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic studies often show wide diversity of religious beliefs, belonging, and practices in both religious and non-religious populations. For instance, out of Americans who are not religious and not seeking religion: 68% believe in God, 12% are atheists, 17% are agnostics; also, in terms of self-identification of religiosity 18% consider themselves religious, 37% consider themselves as spiritual but not religious, and 42% considers themselves as neither spiritual nor religious; and 21% pray every day and 24% pray once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/files/2011/08/NONES_08.pdf|title=American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population|year=2008|publisher=American Religious Identification Survey|accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew 2012 breakdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-religion/ |title=Religion and the Unaffiliated |work="Nones" on the Rise |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most Nones Believe God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most of the Religiously Unaffiliated Still Keep Belief in God|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/most-of-the-religiously-unaffiliated-still-keep-belief-in-god/|website=Pew Research Center|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global studies on religion also show diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/|website=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Numerous studies have explored the different components of human religiosity (Brink, 1993; Hill &amp; Hood 1999). What most have found is that there are multiple dimensions (they often employ [[factor analysis]]). For instance, Cornwall, Albrecht, Cunningham and Pitcher (1986) identify six dimensions of religiosity based on the understanding that there are at least three components to religious behavior: knowing (cognition in the mind), feeling (effect to the spirit), and doing (behavior of the body). For each of these components of religiosity, there were two cross classifications resulting in the six dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornwall |author2=Albrecht |author3=Cunningham |author4=Pitcher |title=The Dimensions of Religiosity: A Conceptual Model with an Empirical Test|journal=Review of Religious Research|year=1986|volume=27|issue=3|pages=226–244|doi=10.2307/3511418}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cognition
**traditional [[orthodoxy]]
**particularistic orthodoxy
*Effect
**Palpable
**Tangible
*Behavior
**religious behavior
**religious participation

Other researchers have found different dimensions, ranging generally from four to twelve components. What most measures of religiosity find is that there is at least some distinction between religious doctrine, religious practice, and [[spirituality]].

For example{{original research inline|date=February 2011}}, one can accept the truthfulness of the [[Bible]] (belief dimension), but never attend a church or even belong to an organized religion (practice dimension).  Another example is an individual who does not hold orthodox [[Christian]] doctrines (belief dimension), but does attend a [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] [[worship]] service (practice dimension) in order to develop his/her sense of oneness with the [[divinity|divine]] (spirituality dimension).

An individual could disavow all doctrines associated with organized religions (belief dimension), not affiliate with an organized religion or attend religious services (practice dimension), and at the same time be strongly committed to a higher power and feel that the connection with that higher power is ultimately relevant (spirituality dimension). These are explanatory examples of the broadest dimensions of religiosity and may not be reflected in specific religiosity measures.

Most dimensions of religiosity are correlated, meaning people who often attend church services (practice dimension) are also likely to score highly on the belief and spirituality dimensions. But individuals do not have to score high on all dimensions or low on all dimensions; their scores can vary by dimension.

[[Sociologists]] have differed over the exact number of components of religiosity. [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]]'s five-dimensional approach (Glock, 1972: 39) was among the first of its kind in the field of [[sociology of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings 
in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists adapted Glock's list to include additional components (see for example, a  [[Mervin F. Verbit#The Twenty Four-Dimensional Religiosity Measure|six component measure]] by [[Mervin F. Verbit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M. F. (1970). The components and dimensions of religious behavior: Toward a reconceptualization of religiosity. American mosaic, 24, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Küçükcan, T. (2010). Multidimensional Approach to Religion: a way of looking at religious phenomena. Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies, 4(10), 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eskieserler.com/dosyalar/mpdf%20(1135).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==

===Genes and environment===

[[File:Church Attendance and Welfare Spending Graph.png|thumb|350px|National welfare spending vs church attendance in Christian societies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = State Welfare Spending and Religiosity | journal = Comparative Political Studies | first = Anthony | last = Gill |author2=Erik Lundsgaarde  | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/1043463104046694 }}  [http://faculty.washington.edu/tgill/Gill%20Lundsgaarde%20Welfare%20Religion.pdf Free PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The contributions of [[genes]] and [[Natural environment|environment]] to religiosity have been quantified in [[twin study|studies of twins]] (Bouchard ''et al.'', 1999; Kirk ''et al.'', 1999) and sociological studies of welfare, availability, and legal regulations &lt;ref&gt;Nolan, P., &amp; Lenski, G. E. (2010). Human societies: Introduction to macrosociology. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[state religions]], etc.).

Koenig ''et al.'' (2005) report that the contribution of genes to variation in religiosity (called [[heritability]]) increases from 12% to 44% and the contribution of shared (family) effects decreases from 56% to 18% between [[adolescence]] and [[adulthood]].&lt;ref&gt;L. B. Koenig, M. McGue, R. F. Krueger and T. J. Bouchard, Jr. (2005). Genetic and environmental influences on religiousness: findings for retrospective and current religiousness ratings. ''Journal of Personality'', '''73''', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00316.x 471-88]&lt;/ref&gt;

A market-based theory of religious choice and governmental regulation of religion have been the dominant theories used to explain variations of religiosity between societies{{Clarify|date=January 2017}}.  However, Gill and Lundsgaarde (2004) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = State Welfare Spending and Religiosity | journal = Comparative Political Studies | first = Anthony | last = Gill |author2=Erik Lundsgaarde  | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/1043463104046694 }}  [http://faculty.washington.edu/tgill/Gill%20Lundsgaarde%20Welfare%20Religion.pdf Free PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; documented a much stronger correlation between welfare state spending and religiosity.  See "Welfare spending vs Church attendance" diagram on the right.

===Just-world hypothesis===
Studies have found [[Just-world hypothesis|belief in a just world]] to be correlated with aspects of religiousness.&lt;ref&gt;Begue, L. (2002). Beliefs in justice and faith in people: just world, religiosity and interpersonal trust. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32(3), 375-382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurst, J., Bjorck, J., &amp; Tan, S. (2000). Causal attributions for uncontrollable negative events. ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'', 19, 47–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk-aversion===
Several studies have discovered a positive correlation between the degree of religiousness and [[Risk aversion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Risk aversion and religion | journal = Journal of Risk and Uncertainty | first = Charles | last = Noussair |author2=Stefan T. Trautmann|author3=Gijs van de Kuilen|author4=Nathanael Vellekoop  | volume = 47| issue = 2 | pages = 165–183 | year = 2013| doi = 10.1007/s11166-013-9174-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Does local religiosity matter for bank risk-taking? | journal = Journal of Corporate Finance | first = Binay| last = Adhikari|author2=Anup Agrawal| volume = 38|pages = 272–293| year = 2016| doi = 10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1593">'''Remote monitoring and control''' ('''M&amp;C''') systems are designed to control large or complex facilities such as [[factory|factories]], [[power plant]]s, [[network operations center]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[spacecraft]], with some degree of [[automation]].

M&amp;C systems may receive data from [[sensor]]s, [[telemetry]] streams, user inputs, and pre-programmed procedures. The software may send [[telecommand]]s to [[actuators]], computer systems, or other devices.

M&amp;C systems may perform [[closed-loop control]].

With the introduction of [[Industry 4.0]], technologies such as [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]] and [[Machine learning|Machine Learning]] have realized the machine to machine communication, which ultimately have paved the way to automate the monitoring and controlling operations. The two-way communication among devices, which are inter-connected through various protocols, have made it possible to monitor as well as control business operations remotely

Once limited to [[SCADA]] in industrial settings, remote monitoring and control is now applied in numerous fields, including:
* [[Smart grid]]s
* [[Positive train control]]
* [[Structural health monitoring]]
* Pipeline sensors
* Patient monitoring
* Desktop/server monitoring

While this field overlaps with [[Machine to Machine|machine to machine]] communications, the two are not identical.

A '''showroom''' is a large space used to display products or show entertainment.

==Marketing location==
[[Image:Concesionario de Mercedes-Benz, Múnich, Alemania, 2013-03-30, DD 25.JPG|thumb|right|[[Car dealership]] showroom]]
[[File:-01 Kartel showrooms.jpg |thumb|right|[[Kartell]] showroom in  Via Turati, [[Milan]], [[Italy]]]]
A showroom is a large space used to display products for sale, such as [[automotive showroom|automobiles]], [[furniture]], [[Home appliance|appliances]], [[carpet]] or [[apparel]]. It is a [[retail store]] of a company in which products are on sale in a space created by their brand or company. A showroom can also be a space for wholesale buyers to view fashion merchandise for sale in their retail stores.

The world's most famous locations for a showroom, generally in the form of a [[business cluster|cluster]], are the [[Champs Elysees]] in Paris or [[Merchandise Mart]] in Chicago,{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

One of the world's largest showrooms is the {{convert|35000|m2}} BMW showroom in Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;Horatiu Boeriu, ''[http://www.bmwblog.com/2012/02/21/bmw-opens-largest-showroom-worldwide-in-abu-dhabi/ BMW opens largest showroom worldwide in Abu Dhabi]'', BMW blog, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carscoops, ''[http://www.carscoops.com/2012/02/world-largest-bmw-showroom-opens-in-abu.html World's Largest BMW Showroom Opens in Abu Dhabi, Best Selling Model in the M.E. is the 7-Series]'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest collection of showrooms is a {{convert|216000|m2|sing=on}} car showroom in [[Istanbul]] called [[Autopia Europia]].&lt;ref&gt;World Buildings Directory, ''[http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=3023 Autopia Europia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419012922/http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=3023 |date=2014-04-19 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mibz.com, [http://www.mibz.com/tag/worlds-biggest-showroom Autopia Europia, The World’s Biggest Car Dealership, Will Have A Circuit On The Roof] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419025632/http://www.mibz.com/tag/worlds-biggest-showroom |date=2014-04-19 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment venue==
A showroom is a permanent enclosed space used to present a [[performance]].  Sometimes it is customized for a particular show; for example, the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] showroom used for the [[rock opera]] ''[[Starlight Express]]'' was customized by pouring [[concrete]] ramps onto its stage area and in the seating area.

Some showrooms are used daily, while others are only used when a performer is booked to perform. In some cases, a showroom is [[lease]]d to a performer, who then retains all income rather than being paid by the showroom owner.

== Temporary showroom ==
In fashion capitals such as [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Milan]] or [[London]] one can find temporary showrooms. 
These places can be rented on a daily or weekly basis. Some temporary showrooms are managed with the help of [[event management]] agencies. Temporary showrooms can also be [[Pop-up retail|pop-up stores]], which are short-term sales spaces.

==Augmented reality showroom==
Automobile manufacturer [[Ferrari]] has recently introduced [[augmented reality]] technology into their showrooms, to provide customers with a more hands-on approach when purchasing a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoblog.com/2015/04/15/ferrari-augmented-reality-showroom-video/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skretting Aquaculture Research Centre''' A/S (Skretting ARC) was established in 1989, and is the central [[R&amp;D]] unit for the global [[fish]] and [[shrimp]] [[Feeds for farmed fish|feed]] concern [[Skretting]], which is owned by [[Nutreco|Nutreco N.V.]] Nutreco’s head office is in [[Amersfoort]], The Netherlands. Skretting ARC's main objective is to provide research and technical support regarding fish and shrimp feed. Skretting ARC has about 60 manyears of which about 45% have degrees corresponding to MSc or PhD level. It has an international staff representing 13 nationalities. It performs research for all feed companies within Skretting in Europe, North &amp; South America, Asia and Australia. Skretting ARC’  is a legal entity owned 100% by Skretting AS.

== Core competencies ==
Skretting ARC’s core competencies are within fish and shrimp nutrition and health, raw feed materials, feed safety &amp; quality and feed manufacturing processes. Skretting ARC’s facilities include an extensive research station with hatchery and land based tanks with both fresh and seawater trial facilities, a pilot plant for test feed production and innovative process trials and a well-equipped modern laboratory. The research station is designed for running trials with [[Salmonidae|salmonids]] through all life stages with different water qualities (temperature and salinity). Facilities are also adapted for running trials with [[cod]] after [[metamorphosis]]. Main facilities are located within the vicinity of [[Stavanger]], however Skretting also has a trout facility in Italy and is working towards a facility in Asia. Skretting ARC collaborates with several universities and institutes around the world.

== Projects ==
Skretting ARC has participated in several [[Norwegian Research Council]] and [[European Union|EU]]-funded research projects over the years. Its researchers have been authors or co-authors of several scientific publications. Some examples of EU projects are:

A '''space sunshade''' or '''sunshield''' is a [[Umbrella|parasol]] that [[wikt:divert|divert]]s or otherwise reduces some of a star's radiation, preventing them from hitting a spacecraft or planet and thereby reducing its [[insolation]], which results in reduced heating.  Light can be diverted by different methods.  First proposed in 1989, the original space sunshade concept involves putting a large occulting disc, or technology of equivalent purpose at the L1 gravitation point ([[Lagrangian point]]) between the Earth and Sun.  

A sunshade is of particular interest as a [[climate engineering]] method for [[Climate change mitigation|mitigating]] [[global warming]] through [[solar radiation management]].  Heightened interest in such projects reflects the concern that internationally negotiated reductions in carbon emissions may be insufficient to stem climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, John. "The Political Economy of a Planetary Sunshade" Astropolitics: The International Journal of Space Politics and Policy (2018): 16(1):1-10.  Retrieved 3-30-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sunshades could also be used to produce [[space solar power]], acting as [[solar power satellites]]. Proposed shade designs include a single-piece shade and a shade made by a great number of small objects. Most such proposals contemplate a blocking element at the Sun-Earth L1 [[Lagrangian point]].

In 1989 James Early proposed a space-based sun-shade to divert sunlight at the planetary level.  His design involved making a large glass (2000 km) occulter from lunar material and placing at the L1 point.  Issues included the large amount of material needed to make the disc and also the energy to launch it to its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160425-how-a-giant-space-umbrella-could-stop-global-warming|title=How a giant space umbrella could stop global warming|last=Gorvett|first=Zaria|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designs for planetary sunshade==

=== Cloud of small spacecraft ===
One proposed sunshade would be composed of 16&amp;nbsp;trillion small disks at the Sun-Earth L1 [[Lagrangian point]], 1.5 million kilometers above Earth. Each disk is proposed to have a 0.6-meter diameter and a thickness of about 5&amp;nbsp;micrometers. The mass of each disk would be about a gram, adding up to a total of almost 20&amp;nbsp;million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate =2010-11-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a group of small sunshades that blocks 2% of the sunlight, deflecting it off into space, would be enough to halt global warming, giving us ample time to cut our emissions back on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The individual autonomous flyers building up the cloud of sunshades are proposed not to reflect the sunlight but rather to be transparent lenses, deflecting the light slightly so it does not hit Earth.  This minimizes the effect of [[solar radiation pressure]] on the units, requiring less effort to hold them in place at the L1 point.  An optical prototype has been constructed by [[Roger Angel]] with funding from [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|NIAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The remaining solar pressure and the fact that the L1 point is one of [[unstable equilibrium]], easily disturbed by the wobble of the earth due to gravitational effects from the moon, requires the small autonomous flyers to be capable of maneuvering themselves to hold position.  A suggested solution is to place mirrors capable of rotation on the surface of the flyers.  By using the solar radiation pressure on the mirrors as [[solar sail]]s and tilting them in the right direction, the flyer will be capable of altering its speed and direction to keep in position.&lt;ref name = "L1_cooling"&gt;{{cite web

Such a group of sunshades would need to occupy an area of about 3.8 million square kilometers if placed at the L1 point.&lt;ref name = "L1_cooling" /&gt; The deployment of the flyers is an issue that requires new technology.  Large [[railgun]]s or [[coilgun]]s are proposed to fire a capsule containing a million shades into space every 5 minutes for 10 years using 20 separate launch sites.

Even so, it would still take years to launch enough of the disks into [[orbit]] to have any effect.  This means a long [[lead time]].  Roger Angel of the University of Arizona&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Stiles| first=Lori| title=Space sunshade might be feasible in global warming emergency| url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-11/uoa-ssm110306.php| work="Feasibility of cooling the Earth with a cloud of small spacecraft near L1,"| publisher=Eurekalert| accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  presented the idea for a sunshade at the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] in April 2006 and won a [[NASA]] Institute for Advanced Concepts grant for further research in July 2006.

Creating this sunshade in space was estimated to cost in excess of US$5&amp;nbsp;trillion with an estimated lifetime of 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A similar massive level of technological innovation and financial investment could ensure that. But if the planet gets into an abrupt climate crisis that can only be fixed by cooling, it would be good to be ready with some shading solutions that have been worked out."&lt;ref name="L1_cooling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Earth Observatory 2006-11-03"&gt;{{cite press release

===One Fresnel lens===
[[Image:Space lens.png|thumb|right|300px|The basic function of a space lens to mitigate global warming. A 1,000-kilometre diameter lens is sufficient, and much smaller than what is shown in this simplified image. As a [[Fresnel lens]] it would be only a few millimeters thick.]]

Several authors have proposed dispersing light before it reaches the Earth by putting a very large lens in space, perhaps at the [[Lagrangian point#L1|L1]] point between the Earth and the Sun. This plan was proposed in 1989 by J.&amp;nbsp;T. Early.&lt;ref name="Early"&gt;{{Citation

|periodical=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society
|volume=42
|pages=567–569|bibcode = 1989JBIS...42..567E }}. This proposal is also discussed in footnote 23 of {{Citation

|accessdate=2010-10-30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, physicist and science fiction author [[Gregory Benford]] calculated that a [[concave lens|concave]] rotating [[Fresnel lens]] 1000 kilometres across, yet only a few millimeters thick, floating in space at the {{L1}} point, would reduce the solar energy reaching the Earth by approximately 0.5% to 1%.&lt;ref name="Benford1"&gt;See [http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/4/7/41932/19363 Russell Dovey, "Supervillainy: Astroengineering Global Warming] and [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=370 Bill Christensen, "Reduce Global Warming by Blocking Sunlight"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417153949/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=370 |date=2009-04-17 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of such a lens has been disputed. At a science fiction convention in 2004, Benford estimated that it would cost about [[United States dollar|US$]]10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] up front, and another $10&amp;nbsp;billion in supportive cost during its lifespan.&lt;ref name="Benford1"/&gt;

===One diffraction grating===
A similar approach involves placing a very large [[diffraction grating]] (thin wire mesh) in space, perhaps at the [[Lagrangian point#L1|L1]] point between the Earth and the Sun. A proposal for a 3,000 ton diffraction mesh was made in 1997 by [[Edward Teller]], [[Lowell Wood]], and [[Roderick Hyde]],&lt;ref name="Teller1997"&gt;{{Citation

==Spacecraft sunshades==
The [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST) infrared telescope has a layered sunshade to keep the telescope cold.

For spacecraft approaching the sun the sunshade is usually called a heatshield. Notable spacecraft [designs] with heatshields include :
* [[Parker Solar Probe]] (was Solar Probe Plus), launched 2018 (carbon, carbon-foam, carbon sandwich heatshield)
* [[Solar Orbiter]], may launch 2020
* [[Messenger (spacecraft)|Messenger]], orbits Mercury, has a ceramic cloth sunshade
* [[BepiColumbo]], to orbit Mercury, with Optical Solar Reflectors (acting as a sunshade) on the Planetary Orbiter component.

SEB was developed by researchers from [[Sofia University]], [[Bulgaria]] and the [[University of Wollongong]], [[Australia]]. The purpose of the SEB website is to facilitate the community of practice. It is hoped that such a community will help reduce the sense of isolation felt by young special education teachers and other special education stakeholders in rural areas of Bulgaria. The community is also intended to support special education stakeholders who are separated from their support network across busy cities or by the requirements of daily living.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2401">In [[scheduling (disambiguation)|scheduling]], '''tardiness''' is a measure of a delay in executing certain operations and '''earliness''' is a measure of finishing operations before due time. The operations may depend on each other and on the availability of equipment to perform them.

Typical examples include [[Scheduling (production processes)|job scheduling in manufacturing]] and data delivery scheduling in data processing networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2767221 Minimizing tardiness in data aggregation scheduling with due date consideration for single-hop wireless sensor networks], ''Wireless Networks'', Volume 21 Issue 4, May 2015 Pages 1259-1273&lt;/ref&gt;

In manufacturing environment, [[inventory management]] considers both tardiness and earliness undesirable. Tardiness involves backlog issues such as customer compensation for delays and loss of goodwill. Earliness incurs expenses for storage of the manufactured items.&lt;ref&gt;Derya Eren Akyol, G. Mirac Bayhan, [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00170-007-0993-0 Multi-machine earliness and tardiness scheduling problem: an interconnected neural network approach], The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology May 2008, Volume 37, Issue 5, pp 576-588.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical formulations==

In an environment with multiple jobs, let the deadline be &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; and the completion time be &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Then for  job &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; lateness is &lt;math&gt;L_i=C_i-d_i&lt;/math&gt;, earliness is &lt;math&gt;E_i = \max\{0, d_i-C_i\}&lt;/math&gt;, tardiness is  &lt;math&gt;T_i = \max\{0, C_i-d_i\}&lt;/math&gt;. The common [[objective function]]s are &lt;math&gt;C_\max, L_\max, E_\max, T_\max, \sum C_i, \sum L_i, \sum E_i, \sum T_i&lt;/math&gt; or weighted version of these sums, &lt;math&gt;w_iC_\max, w_iL_\max, w_iE_\max, w_iT_\max, \sum w_iC_i, \sum w_iL_i, \sum w_iE_i, \sum w_iT_i&lt;/math&gt;, where every job comes with a weight &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;. The weight is a representation of job cost, priority, etc.

In a large number of cases the problems of optimizing these functions are [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/knust/class/ "Complexity results for scheduling problems"], [[University of Osnabrueck]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6384">The '''Thai Elephant Orchestra''' is a musical ensemble consisting of as many as fourteen [[Thai elephant]]s near [[Lampang]] in Northern [[Thailand]].  The elephants play music, essentially as conducted improvisations, on specially designed heavy-duty [[musical instrument]]s. The orchestra was co-created by elephant conservationist [[Richard Lair]] of the [[National Elephant Institute]]  and the American musical artist and [[neuroscientist]] [[Dave Soldier]].  They have released three CDs on the [[Mulatta Records]] label with an orchestra ranging in size from six to fourteen elephants.  The orchestra currently performs for visitors at the center.

==Background==
It has been noted since ancient times that elephants seem to have an affinity for music.   Performing circus elephants commonly follow musical cues, and early American circuses such as [[Adam Forepaugh]] and [[Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey]] even featured "elephant bands."&lt;ref name=NYT(2000) /&gt;  In the 1950s, German evolutionary biologist [[Bernard Rensch]] found that elephants can distinguish 12 tones on the musical scale and remember simple melodies, even when played on different instruments at various pitches, timbres, and meters.&lt;ref name=NYT(2000)&gt;{{cite news|last=Scigliano|first=Eric|title=Think Tank; A Band With a Lot More to Offer Than Talented Trumpeters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/16/arts/think-tank-a-band-with-a-lot-more-to-offer-than-talented-trumpeters.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 16, 2000|location=Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scientist&gt;{{cite web|last=Flores|first=Graciela|title=When I see an elephant...paint?|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/25148/title/When-I-see-an-elephant---paint-/|publisher=The Scientist|accessdate=21 March 2013|date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An album of music created by elephant musicians was conceived by New York-based musical artist Dave Soldier (a.k.a. [[David Sulzer]], PhD) and elephant expert Richard Lair, who works at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang. [[Traditional Thai music]] is a genre familiar to the elephants, so they chose Thai music scales with a few blues notes. According to Lair, many of the elephants took to their assignment "with gusto".&lt;ref name="PRI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elephant Band : Transcript|url=http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=01-P13-00009&amp;segmentID=11|work=PRI : Living on Earth|publisher=World Media Foundation|accessdate=28 March 2013|location=Air Date: Week of March 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The Thai Elephant Orchestra primarily uses the ''Lanna'' Thai [[Pentatonic scale|five-note scale]], and most instruments are heavy-duty versions of [[traditional Thai musical instruments]]; additional instruments include drums and harmonica.&lt;ref name=Leonardo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soldier|first=Dave|title=Eine Kleine Naughtmusik: How Nefarious Nonartists Cleverly Imitate Music|journal=Leonardo Music Journal|year=2002|volume=12|pages=57–58|url=http://mulatta.org/articles/Soldier_Leonardo.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=25 March 2013|doi=10.1162/096112102762295142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their musical works are of two general types. The first type features the elephants individually improvising on the instruments with the only human interaction being cues as to when to start and stop. The other type is compositional and requires [[mahout]]s to teach or train the elephants to perform human tunes as a [[hocket]], with each elephant playing an individual note on tuned instruments such as [[Angklung|angalung]]s.&lt;ref name=WNYC&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai Elephants on Parade|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/newsounds/2004/oct/12/|work=WNYC|publisher=New York Public Radio|accessdate=28 March 2013|location=New Sounds : Episode #2329|date=October 12, 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728104228/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/newsounds/2004/oct/12/|archivedate=28 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doppelschluessel.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin key]]]]
"'''The Berlin key or how to do words with things'''" is an essay  by sociologist [[Bruno Latour]], that originally appeared as ''La clef de Berlin et autres lecons d'un amateur de sciences'', La Dècouverte, in 1993. "The Berlin key or how to do words with things" was later published   as the first chapter in P.M. Graves-''Brown's Matter, Materiality and Modern Culture''. In the 15-page chapter, written informally in third-person narrative, Latour describes a common object used in Berlin, a "Berlin Key" which is constructed so that after opening leaving one's apartment house, after unlocking the street door  from the inside, one can only retrieve the key from the outside in a manner which locks the door behind oneself; upon entering, after one unlocks the door with the key, one must retrieve it from the inside, again locking the door behind oneself; this prevents leaving the door open but unlocked. The essay  is organized to expose  deftly exposes how many layers of significance a unique key can connote.&lt;ref name=Ryzewski&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryzewski|first=Krista|title=The Berlin Key|url=https://brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute//courses/13things/7444.html|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Latour&gt;{{cite web|last=Latour|first=Bruno|title=The Berlin Key or How to Do Words with Things|url=http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/P-36-Berliner-KEY-GBpdf.pdf|publisher=Routledge|accessdate= 16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the P.M. Graves-Brown version, [[Lydia Davis]] translated the piece into English. Additional editing was completed and illustrations redrawn by PMGB.&lt;ref name=Latour /&gt; The title could have been chosen as a witty word-play off of [[J.L. Austin]]'s ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]''.

Latour argues that while an object's purposefully designed material nature may recommend or permit a highly controlled set of functional purposes, it may also offer a broad range of valuable possibilities.&lt;ref name=Latour /&gt;&lt;ref name=Maycroft&gt;{{cite web|last=Maycroft|first=Neil|title=The objectness of everyday life: disburdenment or engagement?|url=http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/1258/1/Objects_and_Use.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latour uses the Berlin key to show that there are social constraints which force people to do whatever it is that the object makes them do; thus, the object (the Berlin key) is a sign, of sorts, telling the inhabitants to 'lock their doors at night, but never during the day.&lt;ref name=Latour /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ying&gt;{{cite web|last=Ying|first=Jing|title=The Berlin key|url=https://jingalex.wordpress.com/2007/09/20/the-berlin-key/|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;'

Latour discusses the relationship between the social realm and the technological realm.  He asserts that the [[Sociologist]] and the Technologist are "enemy brothers", thinking they will come to an end—the sociologist with the social and the technologist with objects.&lt;ref name=Latour /&gt;

[[Image:Troll A Platform.jpg|right|thumb|Fifteen storey tall continuous [[slip formed]] [[Gravity base structure|support legs]] under the [[Troll A platform|Troll A Oil Platform]] in 1000 ft (303 m).&lt;ref name="NGSD" /&gt; ]]

In large scale oceanic [[civil engineering]], '''vacuum-anchors''' are ocean bottom fasteners used to anchor deep seas oil platforms (example: See [[Troll A platform|Troll A Oil Platform]]) and other [[gravity base structure|gravity base technology]] based structures&lt;ref name="NGSD"&gt;A National Geographic Channel production, documentary 2007(?), rebroadcast 2009-10-02, 12-13:00 hrs EDST (Comcast Cable Television system)&lt;/ref&gt; in the soupy soft bottomed muck found on many oil bearing continental shelves and the world's shallower seas. Gravity based anchor legs flare out forming a wider footprint where they contact the bottom&lt;ref name="NGSD" /&gt; much as the webbed feet of many aquatic animals increase the surface area above the vacuum-anchors which are open ended long cylindrical shaped deep cups&lt;ref name="NGSD" /&gt; with a sealed top end closed by a valve which connects and anchors mechanically to the legs of the gravity based structure. The valve is used to exhaust any gases and liquid which seeks to escape the trapped sea bottom materials entering the open end of the anchor.

Physically, these are the upscaled analog of a tall drinking glass filled with water then turned upside down and secured in place bottom-side-up. When a lifting or sideways force is applied to such a container, the [[weight]] and [[inertia]] of the enclosed mass (The mushy gravel, mud, water, and rock solution of the sea bed) must also be displaced (lifted or moved sideways) which anchors them firmly in place within the surrounding materials of the soft bottom. When lifted, any enclosed material attempting to spill out of the enclosure creates a vacuum, just as does the container in the kitchen sink, giving the anchor their name.

==Examples of usage==
  
The [[marketer]] Matt Bailey described it as "a desire to see something done, but not enough desire to make it happen".&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Matt Bailey, "Viral marketing", excerpt "Analytics 1.0 - A Case of Velleity," found at [http://www.sitelogicmarketing.com/blog/07-analytics-velleity Site Logic marketing website].  Accessed April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern writing===

Matt Bailey expressed an attempt "to bring it back, as it has more relevance now than ever."&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;  He writes that:
{{quote|Velleity is what keeps companies locked in this mindset of reporting useless numbers. Desiring, even expecting to someday have an epiphany of change, but not willing to change the mindset or the culture of locked-in reporting to achieve it. Nor are they willing to ask the hard questions in order to uncover what must be done.|Matt Bailey, marketing writer&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;}}

===In philosophy===

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] describes the velleity of an [[artist]] as a "desire to ''be'' 'what he is able to represent, conceive, and express'...."&lt;ref&gt;
Aaron Ridley, in "Nietzsche, philosophy and the arts," ed. by Salim Kemal, Ivan Gaskell, Daniel W. Conway, at pp. 128-131 (Cambridge University Press, 2002) {{ISBN|0-521-52272-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-52272-4}} (emphasis provided), found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=8GzFg3pH4SIC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=Velleity+%2B+philosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MljPsygceA&amp;sig=SWt2zXpiLVhU9oBymK3jfNIAKQs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TrH4SfCODNOGmQeOj-GYDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPA134,M1 Google Book search]. Accessed April 29, 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Nietzsche championed the [[will to power]], which can be encapsulated{{by whom?|date=November 2012}} as starting with velleity, in his [[free-will theorem]].

Keith David Wyma refers frequently to the "concept of velleity", citing [[Thomas Aquinas]] as a pioneer of introducing the idea into philosophy.&lt;ref name=Wyma&gt;
Keith David Wyma, ''Crucible of reason'', pp. 197, 221, 223, 225, 227 (Rowman and Littlefield 2004).  {{ISBN|978-0-7425-3538-1}}.

===In psychology===

Psychologist Avi Sion writes, "''Many psychological concepts may only be defined and explained with reference to velleity''." (''Emphasis in original''.)&lt;ref name=Sion&gt;Avi Sion, "Volition and allied causal concepts," p. 190 (2004). {{ISBN|978-2-9700091-6-0}}.

Also found at [http://www.thelogician.net/4b_volition/4b_chapter_09.htm The Logician website].  All accessed June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example he cites is that "an ordinarily desirable object can only properly be called 'interesting' or 'tempting' to that [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] at that time, if he manifests some velleity...."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;
He distinguishes between the two types of velleity - "''to do'' something and one ''not to do'' something...."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  Furthermore, he asserts, "The concept of velleity is also important because it enables us to understand the co-existence of conflicting values."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  A person could thus have "double velleity" or "a mix of velleity for something and a volition for its opposite: the latter dominates, of course, but that does not erase the fact of velleity."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;

Kathy Kolbe also lists velleity as a "key concept of [[conation]]."&lt;ref name=Kolbe&gt;See [http://www.kolbe.com/knol/keyConceptsOfConation.htm Kathy Kolbe's website page on Conation].  Accessed June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
