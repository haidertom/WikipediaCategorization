{{Black Power sidebar}}
During their medal ceremony in the [[Estadio Olímpico Universitario|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Mexico City]] on October 16, 1968, [[African Americans|African-American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] each [[Raised fist|raised a black-gloved fist]] during the playing of the US national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]". While on the podium, Smith and Carlos, who had won gold and bronze medals respectively in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metres|200-meter]] running event of the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], turned to face the US flag and then kept their hands raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist [[Peter Norman]] all wore human-rights badges on their jackets.

In his autobiography, ''Silent Gesture'', Smith stated that the gesture was not a "[[Black Power]]" salute but rather a "human rights salute". The demonstration is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |last=Lewis |first=Richard |date=8 October 2006 |title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's [[Peter Norman]] finished second with a time of 20.06&amp;nbsp;seconds, and the US's John Carlos won third place with a time of 20.10&amp;nbsp;seconds. After the race was completed, the three went to the podium for their medals to be presented by [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter]]. The two US athletes received their medals shoeless, but wearing black socks, to represent black poverty.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3535000/3535348.stm |publisher=BBC |title=1968: Black athletes make silent protest |accessdate=9 November 2008 |date=17 October 1968 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mq5SLffC?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3535000/3535348.stm |archivedate=17 January 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith wore a black scarf around his neck to represent black pride, Carlos had his tracksuit top unzipped to show solidarity with all [[blue-collar worker]]s in the US and wore a necklace of beads which he described "were for those individuals that were lynched, or killed and that no-one said a prayer for, that were hung and [[Tarred and feathered|tarred]]."

The famous picture of the event was taken by photographer [[John Dominis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://life.time.com/culture/black-power-salute-tommie-smith-and-john-carlos-at-the-1968-olympics/#1 | publisher=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] | title=Hope and Defiance: The Black Power Salute That Rocked the 1968 Olympics | accessdate=13 November 2013 | date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both US athletes intended to bring black gloves to the event, but Carlos forgot his, leaving them in the Olympic Village. It was Peter Norman who suggested Carlos wear Smith's left-handed glove. For this reason, Carlos raised his left hand as opposed to his right, differing from the traditional Black Power salute.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7674157.stm |publisher=BBC | title=The other man on the podium | accessdate=9 November 2008 | date=17 October 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081020092915/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7674157.stm| archivedate=20 October 2008| deadurl= no | first=Caroline | last=Frost}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'' played, Smith and Carlos delivered the salute with heads bowed, a gesture which became front-page news around the world.

But if I did something bad, then they would say I am a Negro. We are black and we are proud of being black. Black America will understand what we did tonight."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

Tommie Smith stated in later years that "We were concerned about the lack of black assistant coaches. About how [[Muhammad Ali]] got stripped of his title. About the lack of access to good housing and our kids not being able to attend the top colleges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/columnists/erika-smith/2015/03/18/smith-tried-make-moment-movement/24983931/|title=Smith: 'They tried to make it a moment, but it was a movement'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Olympic Committee response ==
[[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) president [[Avery Brundage]] deemed it to be a domestic political statement unfit for the apolitical, international forum the Olympic Games were intended to be. In response to their actions, he ordered Smith and Carlos suspended from the US team and banned from the Olympic Village. When the US Olympic Committee refused, Brundage threatened to ban the entire US track team. This threat led to the expulsion of the two athletes from the Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/September-October-08/On-this-Day--US-Athletes-Give-Black-Power-Salute-on-Olympic-Podium.html On This Day: Tommie Smith and John Carlos Give Black Power Salute on Olympic Podium]. Findingdulcinea.com. Retrieved on 13 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesman for the IOC said Smith and Carlos's actions were "a deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental principles of the Olympic spirit."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Brundage, who was president of the United States Olympic Committee in 1936, had made no objections against [[Nazi salute]]s during the [[1936 Berlin Olympics|Berlin Olympics]]. He argued that the Nazi salute, being a national salute at the time, was acceptable in a competition of nations, while the athletes' salute was not of a nation and therefore unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;"The Olympic Story", editor James E. Churchill, Jr., published 1983 by Grolier Enterprises Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brundage had been accused of being one of the United States' most prominent Nazi sympathisers even after the outbreak of the Second World War,&lt;ref&gt;Documentary "Hitler's Pawn: The Margeret Lambert Story", produced by HBO and Black Canyon Productions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/31/sport/germany-berlin-jewish-olympics-maccabi/index.html|title=Adolf Hitler and the man 'who beat Jesse Owens' - CNN|first=James Masters,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his removal as president of the IOC had been one of the three stated objectives of the Olympic Project for Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XGA7LZuDbbgC Silent Gesture – Autobiography of Tommie Smith]'' (excerpt via [[Google Books]]) – Smith, Tommie &amp; Steele, David, [[Temple University Press]], 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-59213-639-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the official IOC website stated that "Over and above winning medals, the black American athletes made names for themselves by an act of racial protest."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/mexico-1968-summer-olympics Mexico 1968] (official [[International Olympic Committee]] website.

== Aftermath ==
Smith and Carlos were largely ostracized by the US sporting establishment and they were subject to criticism. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on October 25, 1968, wrote: "[[Citius, Altius, Fortius (Olympic motto)|'Faster, Higher, Stronger']] is the motto of the Olympic Games. 'Angrier, nastier, uglier' better describes the scene in Mexico City last week."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/vault/issue/1968-10-25/page/78/|title=The TIME Vault: October 25, 1968|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time1968&gt;{{cite news |title=The Olympics: Black Complaint|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900397,00.html|accessdate=12 August 2012|newspaper=Time|date=25 October 1968|quote="Faster, Higher, Stronger" is the motto of the Olympic Games.

Smith continued in athletics, playing in the [[National Football League|NFL]] with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography.com/people/tommie-smith-9487382 Tommie Smith]. biography.com&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming an assistant professor of physical education at [[Oberlin College]]. In 1995, he helped coach the US team at the World Indoor Championships at [[Barcelona]]. In 1999 he was awarded the California Black Sportsman of the Millennium Award. He is now a public speaker.

Carlos' career followed a similar path. He tied the [[100&amp;nbsp;yard dash]] world record the following year. Carlos also tried professional football, was a 15th round selection in the [[1970 NFL Draft]], but a knee injury curtailed his tryout with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].&lt;ref name="DidingerLyons2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ray Didinger|author2=Robert S.

In 1985, he became a track and field coach at [[Palm Springs High School]]. As of 2012, Carlos works as a counselor at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dobuzinskis|first=Alex|title=Former Olympians: No regrets over 1968 protest|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/21/oly-athl-usa-protest-adv-idUSL2E8IC65M20120721|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=13 December 2012|date=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman, who was sympathetic to his competitors' protest, was criticized by conservatives in the Australian media. [[Julius Patching]], the Australian Chef de Mission, was amused and semi-jokingly told Norman off in private with the words, "They're screaming out for your blood, so consider yourself severely reprimanded.

However Australian officials say he was not picked because he came third in the Australian trials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Norman not shunned by AOC|url=http://corporate.olympics.com.au/news/peter-norman-not-shunned-by-aoc|publisher=Australian Olympic Committee|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part due to a knee injury which severely affected his performance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Ron|title=Peter may have lost team place|url=http://aoc-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/corporate/live/files/dmfile/Peter%20Norman%20-%20Ron%20Carter%20article%20-%20The%20Age%201972.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2016|agency=The Age|date=27 March 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was only cautioned after the 1968 incident, and he had been profiled "one of our finest Olympians". Norman also represented Australia at the [[Athletics at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games|1970 Commonwealth Games]].

When Norman died in 2006, Smith and Carlos were [[pallbearers]] at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin|last=Flanagan|authorlink=Martin Flanagan (journalist)|title=Olympic protest heroes praise Norman's courage|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/olympic-protest-heroes-praise-normans-courage/2006/10/09/1160246069969.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=6 October 2006|accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Australia formally apologized to Norman, with one MP telling Parliament that Norman's gesture "was a moment of heroism and humility that advanced international awareness for racial inequality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewleigh.com/3389|title=Parliament Apologises to Peter Norman|author=|date=|website=andrewleigh.com|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentary films ==
The 2008 [[Sydney Film Festival]] featured a documentary about the protest entitled ''[[Salute (2008 film)|Salute]]''. The film was written, directed and produced by [[Matt Norman (director)|Matt Norman]], a nephew of Peter Norman.&lt;ref name="SydneyFilmFestival_2008_ProgramRevealed_MattNorman_Salute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneyfilmfestival.org/content.asp?id=21&amp;nid=116&amp;p=20|title=2008 Program Revealed!|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=17 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125152931/http://www.sydneyfilmfestival.org/content.asp?id=21&amp;nid=116&amp;p=20 |archivedate=25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2008, [[BBC Four]] broadcast a documentary, ''Black Power Salute'', by Geoff Small, about the protest. In an article, Small noted that the athletes of the British team attending the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]] in Beijing had been asked to sign gagging clauses which would have restricted their right to make political statements but that they had refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/09/olympicgames2008.humanrights |work=The Guardian |location=UK | last=Small | first=Geoff | date=9 July 2008 | title=Remembering the Black Power protest | accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tributes ==
In a 2011 speech to the [[University of Guelph]], Akaash Maharaj, a member of the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]] and head of Canada's [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic equestrian team]], said, "In that moment, Tommie Smith, Peter Norman, and John Carlos became the living embodiments of Olympic idealism. Ever since, they have been inspirations to generations of athletes like myself, who can only aspire to their example of putting principle before personal interest. It was their misfortune to be far greater human beings than the leaders of the IOC of the day."&lt;ref&gt;Speech to the Ontario Equine Center at the University of Guelph, Akaash Maharaj, 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] in Washington, DC also features a statue to honor the athletes' tribute.

=== San Jose ===
In 2005, [[San Jose State University]] honored former students Smith and Carlos with a 22-foot high statue of their protest titled ''Victory Salute'', created by artist [[Rigo 23]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Owen|last=Slot|title=America finally honours rebels as clenched fist becomes salute|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article580095.ece|work=The Sunday Times |location=London |date=19 October 2005|accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A student, Erik Grotz, initiated the project; "One of my professors was talking about unsung heroes and he mentioned Tommie Smith and John Carlos. He said these men had done a courageous thing to advance civil rights, and, yet, they had never been honored by their own school." The statues are located in a central part of the campus at {{coord |37.335495 |-121.882556 |display=inline |name=Olympic Black Power Statue}}, next to Robert D. Clark Hall and Tower Hall.

Those who come to view the statue are allowed to participate by standing on the monument. Peter Norman is not included in the monument so viewers can be in his place; there is a plaque in the empty spot inviting those to "Take a Stand." Norman requested that his space was left empty so visitors could stand in his place and feel what he felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 2: John Carlos, 1968 U.S. Olympic Medalist, On the Response to His Iconic Black Power Salute|url=http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2011/10/12/part_2_john_carlos_1968_olympic_us_medalist_on_the_response_to_his_iconic_black_power_salute|publisher=Democracy Now!|accessdate=8 October 2015|date=12 October 2011|quote=I would like to have a blank spot there and have a commemorative plaque stating that I was in that spot. But anyone that comes thereafter from around the world and going to San Jose State that support the movement, what you guys had in '68, they could stand in my spot and take the picture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bronze figures are shoeless but there are two shoes included at the base of the monument. The right shoe, a bronze, blue Puma, is next to Carlos; while the left shoe is placed behind Smith. The signature of the artist is on the back of Smith's shoe, and the year 2005 is on Carlos's shoe.

The faces of the statues are realistic and emotional. "The statue is made of fiberglass stretched over steel supports with an exoskeleton of ceramic tiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/OLYMPIC-PROTEST-Smith-and-Carlos-Statue-2601229.php|title=SF GATE - Olympic Protest|last=Crumpacker|first=John|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rigo 23 used 3D scanning technology and computer-assisted virtual imaging to take full-body scans of the men. Their track pants and jackets are a mosaic of dark blue ceramic tiles while the stripes of the track suits are detailed in red and white.

=== Sydney mural ===
In Australia, an airbrush mural of the trio on podium was painted in 2000 in the inner-city suburb of [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] in Sydney. Silvio Offria, who allowed the mural to be painted on his house in Leamington Lane by an artist known only as "Donald," said that Norman, a short time before he died in 2006, came to see the mural. "He came and had his photo taken; he was very happy," he said.&lt;ref name=Newtown_10&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/last-stand-for-newtowns-three-proud-people-20100726-10smr.html "Last stand for Newtown's 'three proud people'"] by Josephine Tovey, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 27 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The monochrome tribute, captioned "&lt;small&gt;THREE PROUD PEOPLE MEXICO 68&lt;/small&gt;," was under threat of demolition in 2010 to make way for a rail tunnel&lt;ref name=Newtown_10/&gt; but is now listed as an item of heritage significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meetings.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/council/about-council/meetings/documents/meetings/2012/CSPC/120308/120308_CSPC_ITEM06_ATTACHMENTJ.PDF Heritage Assessment of the Three Proud People mural 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002041030/http://meetings.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/council/about-council/meetings/documents/meetings/2012/CSPC/120308/120308_CSPC_ITEM06_ATTACHMENTJ.PDF |date=October 2, 2013 }}.

=== West Oakland mural ===
In the historically [[African-American neighborhood]] of [[West Oakland, California]] there was a large mural depicting Smith and Carlos on the corner of 12th Street and Mandela Parkway.

Above the life-sized depictions read "Born with insight, raised with a fist" ([[Rage Against the Machine]] lyrics); previously it read "It only takes a pair of gloves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oaklandwiki.org/It_Only_Takes_a_Pair_of_Gloves_Mural It Only Takes a Pair of Gloves Mural]. oaklandwiki.org&lt;/ref&gt; In early February 2015, the mural was razed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bayareaintifada.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/west-oakland-mural-bulldozed/ West Oakland Mural Bulldozed | bayareaintifada]. Bayareaintifada.wordpress.com (3 February 2015). Retrieved on 2015-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The private lot was once a gas station, and the mural was on the outside wall of an abandoned building or shed. The owner wanted to pay respect to the men and the moment but also wanted a mural to prevent tagging. The State was monitoring water contamination levels at this site; the testing became within normal levels "so the state ordered the removal of the tanks, testing equipment, and demolition of the shed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bayareaintifada.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/west-oakland-mural-bulldozed/|title=West Oakland Mural Bulldozed|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
The song "Mr. John Carlos" by the Swedish group [[Nationalteatern]] on their 1974 album ''Livet är en fest'' is about the event and its aftermath.

[[Rage Against the Machine]] used a cropped photo of the salute on the cover art for the "[[Testify (Rage Against the Machine song)|Testify]]" single (2000).  The image has both men wearing shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://go.distance.ncsu.edu/gd203/?p=17750|title=Tropes in Media – The Clinched Fist  -  GD 203|website=go.distance.ncsu.edu}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover art for the single "[[HiiiPoWeR]]" (2011) by American rapper [[Kendrick Lamar]] features a cropped photo of the salute.

The song "Hoarse" (2013) by American rapper [[Earl Sweatshirt]] features the lines "pinnacle of titillating crispate, fists clenched, emulating '68 Olympics".

The music video for "[[The Story of O.J.]]" (2017) by American rapper [[Jay-Z]] features a depiction of the protest.

The song "Shivers" by [[Peter Perrett]], best known as the frontman of The Only Ones, features the lines "The torch of liberty, Tommie Smith's black glove".

The music video for "[[The Space Program]]" (2017) by American Hip-Hop group [[A Tribe Called Quest]] features Pharrell Williams imitating the salute.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5223">'''Changzhou School of Thought''' 常州學派, the [[Changzhou]]-centered influential school of scholarship of the late Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1912). Scholars in this school are best known for their contribution to the [[New Text Confucianism]].

== Ming ==
[[Tang Shunzhi]] 唐順之 (1507-1560), the famous Ming mathematician and advocate of the ancient prose style, is considered the precursor of the school, since his work underlined importance of calendaric studies and mathematics in the [[Han learning|Han scholarship]]. Tang's argument for the "concrete studies" (''shixue''), as well as concern about diluting influence of the Buddhist and Daoist teachings on Confucianism of [[Wang Yangming]] became an important feature of the Changzhou intellectual framework.&lt;ref&gt;Elman,81-84.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tang Shunzhi was married to the grandmother of Zhuang Qiyuan (1559-1633), who compiled genealogies of Tangs and Zhuangs and claimed intellectual affinity to his predecessors. Qiyuan was influenced by Catholicism and [[Diego de Pantoja]] in particular, praising it as superior to Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhuang Qiyuan's sons kept the proclivity for practical knowledge: Zhuang Yinqi (''jinshi'' 1643) reissued a Ming book on children diseases, expanded with his own commentaries; Zhuang Yinghui (''jinshi'' 1628), with help of his brothers and sons, compiled a work on military history, extolling the "Confucian technical expertise".

== Qing ==
By the beginning of Qing, "Changzhou ''shixue''" was distinct from the [[Suzhou]] and [[Yangzhou]] traditions. However, its proponents were less interested in the Han learning, sticking to the [[Cheng-Zhu school|Cheng-Zhu]] orthodoxy as a reliable way to examination success.

In the middle of Qing, however, Changzhou had a plethora of Han learning scholars: [[Sun Xingyan]], [[Hong Liangji]] (1746–1809), [[Huang Jingyan]], [[Zhao Huaiyu]], [[Zhao Yi (scholar)|Zhao Yi]], Li Zhaole (1769-1849). The spread of Han learning was stimulated by [[Lu Wenchao]], a Hangzhou native, who moved to the Changzhou Longcheng Academy after being the head of the Jiyang Academy 暨陽書院 in the nearby Jiangyin in 1790-96.   

Zhuang Youke 莊有可, though largely unknown outside Changzhou,&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 194-5 states that he kept a number of teaching posts around the empire (Hefei and Zhili): it is unclear why this was not conductive to his scholarly popularity.&lt;/ref&gt; was recognized as a fine scholar dealing with the Old text/New text controversy. He was praised for mastery of the [[Shuowen]] dictionary and produced a number works on the ''Change classic'' and the ''Chunqiu''. His support to [[Yan Ruoqu]]-[[Hui Dong]]'s refutation of the Old Text ''Shangshu'' chapters stood in opposition to [[Zhuang Cunyu]]'s politics-bound view: Cunyu held that the ''renxin-Daoxin'' 人心 道心 notion of the "Councils of Yu the Great" chapter was crucially important for the imperial ethics, while the ''Han xue'' proponents, including Youke, interpreted it as a heterodox Buddhist influence on the Confucian doctrine.

Zhuang Cunyu (another prominent native of Changzhou), however, had an intellectual influence other than textological: he was an embodiment of the message that scholarly activity for a Confucian cannot be divorced from the political. Besides, he was the tutor of the younger generations of his lineage, including [[Zhuang Shuzu]] (cousin), [[Zhuang Shoujia]] and [[Liu Fenglu]] (grandsons). Shoujia was instrumental in publishing grandfather's works, restraining from popularization of his own writings.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the diplomatic and scholarly success of Liu Fenglu ([[:zh:劉逢祿|劉逢祿]], 1776—1829) in Beijing, the Changzhou school obtained national fame.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 218-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he persuaded [[Ruan Yuan]] (1764-1849) to include a number of Changzhou-originated studies of classics into the ''Huang Qing jingjie'' 皇清经解.

The new intellectual generation in Chanzhou showed interest in paleography. Zhuang Shoujia, developing the ideas of Shuzu, authored the ''Shi shuming'' (Explication of writing and names), providing a history of ancient calligraphy with etymological (''xungu'') and paleographic (''wenzixue'') insights. Among the sources of his studies, Shoujia used remnants of the [[Xiping Stone Classics]] (Han dynasty). Shuzu's pupil [[Song Xiangfeng]] [[:zh:宋翔風|宋翔風]] (1776-1860) developed specialization in etymology, studying the [[Erya]] disctionary. However, quite in spirit of Zhuang Cunyu, he claimed: "In antiquity, those who studied the Classics did not drown in etymological glosses... Etymologists, if they reach farfetched explanations, and theorists, if they wind up in airy and distant studies, must both be criticized...  if the Tao is not put into effect, then the empire will not be ordered. The blame will fall on no one else but on scholars."&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], '''coherence''' can have several different meanings.

==In personal probability==
When dealing with personal probability assessments, or supposed probabilities derived in nonstandard ways, it is a property of self-consistency across a whole set of such assessments.

===In gambling strategy===
One way of expressing such self-consistency is in terms of responses to various betting propositions, as described in relation to [[coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)]].&lt;ref name=D&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Bayesian decision theory===
The '''coherency principle''' in [[Bayesian decision theory]] is the assumption that personal probabilities follow the ordinary rules for probability calculations (where the validity of these rules corresponds to the self-consistency just referred to) and thus that consistent decisions can be obtained from these probabilities.&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

==In time series analysis==
{{main|Coherence (signal processing)}}

In [[time series analysis]], and particularly in [[frequency spectrum#Spectrum analysis|spectral analysis]], it is used to describe the strength of association between two series where the possible dependence between the two series is not limited to simultaneous values but may include leading, lagged and smoothed relationships.&lt;ref name=E&gt;Everitt, B.S. (2002) The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics, CUP. {{ISBN|0-521-81099-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts here are sometimes known as '''coherency'''&lt;ref name=D/&gt; and are essentially those set out for coherence as for signal processing. However, note that the quantity '''coefficient of coherence''' may sometimes be called the ''squared coherence''.&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1006">'''Conduct books''' are a [[genre]] of books that attempt to educate the reader on [[social norm]]s.  As a genre, they began in the mid-to-late Middle Ages, although antecedents such as ''[[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]]'' (c. 2350 BC) are among the earliest surviving works.  Conduct books remained popular through the 18th century, although they gradually declined with the advent of the [[novel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18827">'''Debt-for-nature swaps''' are financial transactions in which a portion of a [[developing nation]]'s foreign debt is forgiven in exchange for local investments in environmental conservation measures.

==History==
The debt-for-nature swaps concept was first conceived by [[Thomas Lovejoy]] of the [[World Wildlife Fund]] in 1984 as an opportunity to deal with the problems of developing-nation indebtedness and its consequent deleterious effect on the environment.&lt;ref name=Visser&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Visser |first1=Dana R. |first2=Guillermo A. |last2=Mendoza |year=1994 |title=Debt-for-Nature Swaps in Latin America |journal=Journal of Forestry |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=13–6 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;issn=0022-1201&amp;volume=92&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=13&amp;epage=16&amp;aulast=Visser }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[Latin American debt crisis]] that resulted in steep reductions to the environmental conservation ability of highly indebted nations, Lovejoy suggested that ameliorating debt promoting conservation could be done at the same time. Since the first swap occurred between [[Conservation International]] and Bolivia in 1987, many national governments and conservation organizations have engaged in debt-for-nature swaps. Most swaps occur in tropical countries, which contain many [[biodiversity|diverse species]] of flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=Reilly&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reilly |first1=William |year=2006 |chapter=Using International Finance to Further Conservation: The First 15 Years of Debt-for-Nature Swaps |pages=197–214 |chapterurl={{Google books|HuPwt987R7gC|page=197|plainurl=yes}} |title=Sovereign Debt at the Crossroads: Challenges and Proposals for Resolving the Third World Debt Crisis |editor1-first=Chris |editor1-last=Jochnick |editor2-first=Fraser A. |editor2-last=Preston |isbn=978-0-19-803752-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, countries that have engaged in debt-for-nature swaps typically have several threatened or endangered species, experience rapid [[deforestation]], and have relatively stable, often democratic, political systems.&lt;ref name=Deacon&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3147074 |jstor=3147074 |title=The Structure of an Environmental Transaction: The Debt-for-Nature Swap |journal=Land Economics |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |year=1997 |last1=Deacon |first1=Robert T |last2=Murphy |first2=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1987, debt-for-nature agreements have generated over US$1 billion for conservation in developing countries.&lt;ref name=Sheikh&gt;{{cite web |first=Pervaze A. |last=Sheikh |date=March 30, 2010 |title=Debt-for-Nature Initiatives and the Tropical Forest Conservation Act: Status and Implementation |url=https://www.cbd.int/financial/debtnature/g-inventory2010.pdf |publisher=Congressional Research Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The financing mechanism for debt-for-nature swaps is an agreement among the funder(s), the national government of the debtor country, and the conservation organization(s) using the funds.  The national government of the indebted country agrees to a payment schedule on the amount of the debt forgiven, usually paid through the nation’s central bank, in local currency or bonds. The process is shown in Figure 1.
Participation in debt-for-nature swaps has been restricted primarily to countries where the risk of default on debt payments is high.&lt;ref name=Greiner&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2006.07.001 |title=Supporting on-farm biodiversity conservation through debt-for-conservation swaps: Concept and critique |journal=Land Use Policy |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=458–71 |year=2007 |last1=Greiner |first1=Romy |last2=Lankester |first2=Allyson }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these circumstances, the funder can purchase the debt at well below its [[face value]].
[[File:Debt-for-nature.png|thumb|Figure 1: The general mechanics of a debt-for-nature swap.]]

==Types==
In a '''commercial debt-for-nature swap''' or '''three-party debt-for-nature swap''', a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) acts as the funder/donor and purchases debt titles from commercial banks on the [[secondary market]]. Since the late 1980s, organizations such as [[Conservation International]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] have participated in international debt-for-nature swaps. The NGO transfers the debt title to the debtor country, and in exchange the country agrees to either enact certain environmental policies or endow a government bond in the name of a conservation organization, with the aim of funding conservation programs.In total, recorded third-party debt-for-nature swaps have generated nearly US$140 million in conservation funding from 1987-2010 (see Table 1).&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;

'''Bilateral debt-for-nature swaps''' take place between two governments. In a bilateral swap, a creditor country forgives a portion of the public bilateral debt of a debtor nation in exchange for environmental commitments from that country.&lt;ref name=Deacon /&gt; An example of a bilateral swap occurred when the U.S. Government, under the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, forgave a portion of Jamaica's official debt obligations and allowed the payments on the balance to go into national funds that finance environmental conservation. These funds established the Environmental Foundation of Jamaica in 1993. '''Multilateral debt-for-nature swaps''' are similar to bilateral swaps but involve international transactions of more than two national governments. Recorded bilateral and multilateral debt-for-nature swaps have generated nearly US$900 million in total conservation funding from 1987-2010 (see Table 1).&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt; A closely related form of debt swap is a debt-for-efficiency swap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1057/ejdr.2013.34 |title=Financing the Clean Development Mechanism through Debt-for-Efficiency Swaps?

===Funders===
[[Nature Conservancy]], [[Leonardo DiCaprio|Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation]], Oak Foundation and [[Global Environment Facility]] have previously provided funds to pay to the debts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/sdfinance/en/home/solutions/debt-for-nature-swaps.html{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leonardodicaprio.org/ldf-supports-first-ever-debt-for-nature-swap-in-seychelles/{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Debt for nature swaps have often been described as agreements in which all parties benefit and that there are no disadvantages. The benefits to the debtor country, creditor, and conservation organizations are outlined below.

===For debtors===
Through a debt-for-nature swap, a debtor country reduces its total outstanding external debt. The debtor country is able to buy back part of its debt in more favorable terms and pay for conservation initiatives rather than debt service.&lt;ref name="Potier"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0264-8377(91)90034-G |title=Debt-for-nature swaps |journal=Land Use Policy |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=211–3 |year=1991 |last1=Potier |first1=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to higher international purchasing power for the debtor country.&lt;ref name="Cassimon"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.10.001 |title=The pitfalls and potential of debt-for-nature swaps: A US-Indonesian case study |journal=Global Environmental Change |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=93–102 |year=2011 |last1=Cassimon |first1=Danny |last2=Prowse |first2=Martin |last3=Essers |first3=Dennis }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some argue that converting outstanding debts in USD to local currency debts lowers the long-term debt burden on developing countries.&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;&lt;ref name=Greiner /&gt; Additionally, debt-for-nature terms enable long-term planning and funding.&lt;ref name=Greiner /&gt;

If the country is interested in funding conservation, debt-for-nature swaps provide an additional source of funds for that purpose. In contrast to [[debt-for-equity swap]]s, debt-for-nature swaps do not compromise national sovereignty since no property exchange takes place.&lt;ref name=Potier /&gt;

Environmental benefits to the debtor country include but are not limited to:
* promoting [[sustainable development|responsible resource use]]
* helping to preserve [[biodiversity]] 
* maintaining [[ecosystem services]]
* reducing [[deforestation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1573-7861.2011.01245.x |title=Do Commercial Debt-for-Nature Swaps Matter for Forests? A Cross-National Test of World Polity Theory |journal=Sociological Forum |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=381–410 |year=2011 |last1=Shandra |first1=John M |last2=Restivo |first2=Michael |last3=Shircliff |first3=Eric |last4=London |first4=Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment in conservation also demonstrates economic returns. For example, Costa Rica has put debt-for-nature funds to good use in establishing and improving parks and preserves, and it has seen marked improvements in tourism, improved water quality, and increased energy output even in the short term.&lt;ref name=Potier /&gt;

===For creditors===
Creditors see debt-for-nature swaps as a method to rid themselves of high-risk claims. By selling the debt claim, they can re-invest the proceeds from the sale in higher-performing ventures. Creditors faced with low-performance loans may also seek to limit their exposure, that is, to avoid further lending to debtor countries until their loans are serviced.&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt;

===For conservation organizations===
Debt-for-nature agreements are a long-term source of funding for conservation initiatives, so both international organizations acting as donors and local organizations using funds are able to further their goals of conservation. The donor organizations also purchase the debt at a value below its face value and usually redeem it above its market value. In this way, swaps are thought to generate conservation funds at a discount.&lt;ref name=Greiner /&gt;

==Decline==
The decline in the number of debt-for-nature swaps in recent years likely results in part from the higher prices of commercial debt in secondary markets.&lt;ref name=Cassimon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Resor&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Resor |first1=J.P. |year=1997 |title=Debt-for-nature swaps: a decade of experience and new directions for the future |journal=Unasylva |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w3247e/w3247e06.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s and early 1990s, conservation organizations could purchase relatively large debt obligations on the secondary market at highly discounted rates. During this period, conservation organizations and national governments negotiated swaps at a rate of approximately five agreements per year. Since 2000, the number of swap agreements has dropped to about two per year.&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;
Additionally, other agreements for [[debt restructuring]] and cancellation, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, lower a developing country’s debt obligation by much more than the relatively small contribution debt-for-nature swaps make.&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;
Also, debt-for-nature swaps have undergone thorough critique by skeptics; these criticisms may have contributed to the decline of the debt-for-nature financing mechanism.

==Criticism==

===Overstated financial benefits===
Debt-for-nature swaps produce only minor debt reductions and generate far less funding than the face value of the debt purchased in the secondary market.&lt;ref name=Cassimon /&gt; The amount of public debt relieved by debt-for-nature swaps, even in the countries that participate in swaps regularly, accounts for less than 1% of total external debt.&lt;ref name=Didia&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00213624.2001.11506382 |title=Debt-for-Nature Swaps, Market Imperfections, and Policy Failures as Determinants of Sustainable Development and Environmental Quality |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=477–86 |year=2016 |last1=Didia |first1=Dal }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, if the indebted country does not engage in conservation in the absence of a debt-for-nature agreement, the swap may not provide the indebted country a [[welfare economics|social welfare improvement]] or any [[fiscal space]] in the national budget.&lt;ref name=Cassimon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garvie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garvie |first1=Devon A. |year=2002 |title=When are Debt for Nature Swaps Welfare—Improving? |journal=International Review of Economics and Business |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=165–73 |url=http://econ.queensu.ca/faculty/garvie/mini/garviedfns.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the indebted country is still responsible for payment of the debt, albeit to a conservation organization rather than to the creditor. Also, the funds produced through the agreement may replace other forms of aid, debt assistance, or conservation funding.

===Misdirection of funds===
Critics of debt-for-nature swaps argue that they do not generate funds where the needs are greatest.&lt;ref name=Didia /&gt; Early in the history of debt-for-nature swaps, nearly three-quarters of the total funds generated went to Costa Rica, while other countries with needs equal to or exceeding those of Costa Rica did not receive any.&lt;ref name=Kraemer&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107049659300200203 |title=Policy Responses to Tropical Deforestation: Are Debt-for-Nature Swaps Appropriate? |journal=The Journal of Environment &amp; Development |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=41–65 |year=2016 |last1=Kraemer |first1=Moritz |last2=Hartmann |first2=Jörg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil, for example, has had limited involvement in debt-for-nature swaps though it has experienced rapid deforestation.&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;

===Environmental degradation and external debt===
Research has shown that debt relief alone does not spur environmental conservation. Though debt shows a positive correlation with deforestation levels, most researchers believe that highly indebted countries lack political institutions and enforcement structures that would limit [[environmental degradation]].&lt;ref name=Didia /&gt; Heavily indebted countries may engage in high levels of deforestation due to shortsighted policies.&lt;ref name=Bhattarai&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(01)00019-5 |title=Institutions and the Environmental Kuznets Curve for Deforestation: A Crosscountry Analysis for Latin America, Africa and Asia |journal=World Development |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=995–1010 |year=2001 |last1=Bhattarai |first1=Madhusudan |last2=Hammig |first2=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest that the solutions to environmental degradation are effective political institutions, democracy, property rights, and market structures,&lt;ref name=Didia /&gt; and this development theory matches many of the principles of the [[Washington Consensus]]. Others suggest that primarily wealth creation and increased income have a positive impact on environmental conservation.&lt;ref name=Bhattarai /&gt; This approach considers an environmental [[Kuznets curve]], by which environmental degradation increases, reaches a tipping point, then decreases as income or wealth increases.

===Insufficient funding of environmental protection===
Ultimately, the responsibility of conservation lies with the local non-governmental organization implementing the protection measures. Debt-for-nature swaps are only effective when the conservation organizations are respected by local residents, have a good financial management capacity, and have a good relationship with government and other non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=Potier /&gt;&lt;ref name=Resor /&gt;

===Impacts on the poor===
Debt for nature swaps are usually actioned by an indebted nation's elite, not the peasantry who may traditionally have owned or at least used the land in question. Land rights are often expressed in different ways and ownership takes many forms. Some early debt-for-nature swaps tended to overlook the people living on the land set aside for conservation.&lt;ref name=Choudry&gt;{{cite web |last=Choudry |first=Aziz |date=October 2003 |title=Conservation International: Privatizing Nature, Plundering Biodiversity |work=Seedling |url=https://www.grain.org/es/article/entries/406-conservation-international-privatizing-nature-plundering-biodiversity }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent swaps have sought to include local residents, especially indigenous peoples, in the decision making process and the management of lands.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt; Although "seeking" to include does not mean that local residents have been included. Reports of recent debt swap cases in Madagascar, for instance, indicate local resentment towards conservation projects.&lt;ref name=Eurozine&gt;http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2008-02-28-bloch-en.html{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pythagorean proof (1).svg|200px|right|thumb|An example of "beauty in method"—a simple and elegant proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].]]

'''Elegance''' is [[beauty]] that shows unusual [[effectiveness]] and [[simplicity]]. It is frequently used as a standard of [[Taste (sociology)|tastefulness]] particularly in the areas of [[visual design]], [[decorative arts|decoration]], the sciences, and [[Mathematical beauty|the aesthetics of mathematics]]. Elegant things exhibit refined [[wiktionary:grace|grace]] and suggest maturity.

==General concept==
Essential components of the concept include [[simplicity]] and [[consistency]] of [[design]], focusing on the [[Essence|essential]] features of an object. In art of any kind one might also require dignified grace, or restrained beauty of style.

Visual stimuli are frequently considered elegant if a small number of [[color]]s and stimuli are used, emphasizing the remainder.

==In philosophy of science==
In the [[philosophy of science]], there are two concepts referring to two aspects of simplicity. Elegance ([[syntactic simplicity]]) means the number and complexity of hypotheses. [[Occam's razor|Parsimony]] ([[ontological simplicity]]) is the number and complexity of things postulated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==

The [[mathematical proof|proof]] of a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[theorem]] exhibits [[mathematical elegance]] if it is [[Surprise (emotion)|surprisingly]] simple yet effective and constructive; similarly, a [[computer program]] or [[computer algorithm|algorithm]] is elegant if it uses a small amount of code to great effect.&lt;ref name="programming1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sob.apotheon.org/?p=113 |title=ITLOG Import: Elegance |last1= Perrin |first1=Chad |date=16 August 2006 |publisher=Chad Perrin: SOB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="programming2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/12/15.html |title=Elegance |last1=Spolsky |first1=Joel |date=15 December 2006 |publisher=Joel on Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In engineering==

In [[engineering]], a solution may be considered elegant if it uses a non-obvious method to produce a solution which is highly effective and simple. An elegant solution may solve multiple problems at once, especially problems not thought to be inter-related.&lt;ref name="engineering1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzeldes.com/Miscellany/Elegance.htm |title=Ingenious simplicity |last1=Zeldes |first1=Nathan |year=2007 |accessdate=11 October 2011 |publisher=Nathan's Possibly Interesting Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In chemistry==

In [[chemistry]], chemists might look for ''elegance'' in theory and method, in technique and procedure. For example: elegance might comprise creative parsimony and versatility in the utilization of resources, in the manipulation of materials, and in effectiveness in syntheses and analysis.

==In pharmacy==

In [[pharmacy]], elegance in [[formulation]] is important for quality as well as effectiveness in [[dosage form design]], a major component of pharmaceutics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20136">[[File:Exponential.svg|thumb|300px|right|The graph illustrates how exponential growth (green) surpasses both linear (red) and cubic (blue) growth. {{legend|green|Exponential growth}} {{legend|blue|[[Polynomial|Cubic growth]]}} {{legend|red|[[Linear growth]]}}]]

'''Exponential growth''' is exhibited when the [[Rate (mathematics)#Of change|rate of change]]—the change per instant or unit of time—of the value of a mathematical function is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the function's current value, resulting in its value at any time being an [[exponential function]] of time, i.e., a function in which the time value is the exponent.
[[Exponential decay]] occurs in the same way when the growth rate is negative.  In the case of a discrete [[Domain of a function|domain]] of definition with equal intervals, it is also called '''geometric growth''' or '''geometric decay''', the function values forming a [[geometric progression]].  In either exponential growth or exponential decay, the ratio of the rate of change of the quantity to its current size remains constant over time.

The formula for exponential growth of a variable ''x'' at the growth rate ''r'', as time ''t'' goes on in discrete intervals (that is, at integer times 0, 1, 2, 3, ...), is

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = x_0(1+r)^t&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the value of ''x'' at time 0. This formula is transparent when the exponents are converted to multiplication.  For instance, with a starting value of 50 and a growth rate of {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 5% = 0.05}} per interval, the passage of one interval would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05}}; two intervals would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05 × 1.05}}; and three intervals would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05 × 1.05 × 1.05}}.  In this way, each increase in the exponent by a full interval can be seen to increase the previous total by another five percent.  (The order of multiplication does not change the result based on the [[associative property]] of multiplication.)

Since the time variable, which is the input to this function, occurs as the exponent, this is an [[exponential function]].  This contrasts with growth based on a [[power function]], where the time variable is the base value raised to a fixed exponent, such as cubic growth (or in general terms denoted as [[Growth_rate_(group_theory)|polynomial growth]]).

*'''[[Biology]]'''
** The number of [[microorganism]]s in a [[microbiological culture|culture]] will increase exponentially until an essential nutrient is exhausted. Typically the first organism [[cell division|splits]] into two daughter organisms, who then each split to form four, who split to form eight, and so on. Because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate, it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state. However, cells can grow exponentially at a constant rate while remodeling their metabolism  and gene expression.&lt;ref name="SlavovBudnik2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slavov|first1=Nikolai|last2=Budnik|first2=Bogdan A.|last3=Schwab|first3=David|last4=Airoldi|authorlink4=Edoardo Airoldi|first4=Edoardo M.|last5=van Oudenaarden|first5=Alexander|title=Constant Growth Rate Can Be Supported by Decreasing Energy Flux and Increasing Aerobic Glycolysis|journal=Cell Reports|volume=7|issue=3|year=2014|pages=705–714|issn=2211-1247|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.03.057|pmid=24767987|pmc=4049626}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
** A virus (for example [[SARS]], or [[smallpox]]) typically will spread exponentially at first, if no artificial [[immunization]] is available. Each infected person can infect multiple new people.
** [[World population|Human population]], if the number of births and deaths per person per year were to remain at current levels (but also see [[logistic growth]]). For example, according to the [[United States Census Bureau]], over the last 100 years (1910 to 2010), the population of the United States of America is exponentially increasing at an average rate of one and a half percent a year (1.5%). This means that the [[doubling time]] of the American population (depending on the yearly growth in population) is approximately 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Census Data, "U.S. Census Bureau", 20 Dec 2012, Internet Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20121220035511/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Physics]]'''
** [[Avalanche breakdown]] within a [[dielectric]] material. A free [[electron]] becomes sufficiently accelerated by an externally applied [[electrical field]] that it frees up additional electrons as it collides with [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s of the dielectric media. These ''secondary'' electrons also are accelerated, creating larger numbers of free electrons. The resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete [[dielectric breakdown]] of the material.
** [[Nuclear chain reaction]] (the concept behind [[nuclear reactors]] and [[nuclear weapons]]). Each [[uranium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] that undergoes [[Nuclear fission|fission]] produces multiple [[neutron]]s, each of which can be [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] by adjacent uranium atoms, causing them to fission in turn. If the [[probability]] of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape (a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[shape]] and [[mass]] of the uranium), ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and so the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially, in an uncontrolled reaction. "Due to the exponential rate of increase, at any point in the chain reaction 99% of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations. It is a reasonable approximation to think of the first 53 generations as a latency period leading up to the actual explosion, which only takes 3–4 generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq2.html|title=Introduction to Nuclear Weapon Physics and Design|publisher=Nuclear Weapons Archive|last=Sublette|first=Carey|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Positive feedback]] within the linear range of electrical or electroacoustic [[Amplifier|amplification]] can result in the exponential growth of the amplified signal, although [[resonance]] effects may favor some [[component frequencies]] of the signal over others.
* '''[[Economics]]'''
** [[Economic growth]] is expressed in percentage terms, implying exponential growth.
* '''[[Finance]]'''
** [[Compound interest]] at a constant interest rate provides exponential growth of the capital. See also [[rule of 72]].
** [[Pyramid scheme]]s or [[Ponzi scheme]]s also show this type of growth resulting in high profits for a few initial investors and losses among great numbers of investors.
* [[Computer|'''Computer technology''']]
** [[Clock rate|Processing power]] of computers. See also [[Moore's law]] and [[technological singularity]]. (Under exponential growth, there are no singularities. The singularity here is a metaphor, meant to convey an unimaginable future. The link of this hypothetical concept with exponential growth is most vocally made by futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]].)
** In [[computational complexity theory]], computer algorithms of exponential complexity require an exponentially increasing amount of resources (e.g. time, computer memory) for only a constant increase in problem size. So for an algorithm of time complexity 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, if a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 10}} requires 10 seconds to complete, and a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 11}} requires 20 seconds, then a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 12}} will require 40 seconds. This kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes, often between 30 and 100 items (most computer algorithms need to be able to solve much larger problems, up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times, something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm). Also, the effects of [[Moore's Law]] do not help the situation much because doubling processor speed merely allows you to increase the problem size by a constant. E.g. if a slow processor can solve problems of size ''x'' in time ''t'', then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size ''x'' + constant in the same time ''t''. So exponentially complex algorithms are most often impractical, and the search for more efficient algorithms is one of the central goals of computer science today.

==Basic formula==
A quantity ''x'' depends exponentially on time ''t'' if

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=a\cdot b^{t/\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''a'' is the initial value of ''x'',

:&lt;math&gt;x(0)=a\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

the constant ''b'' is a positive growth factor, and ''τ'' is the [[time constant]]—the time required for ''x'' to increase by one factor of ''b'':

:&lt;math&gt;x(t+\tau)=a \cdot b^{\frac{t+\tau}{\tau}} = a \cdot b^{\frac{t}{\tau}} \cdot b^{\frac{\tau}{\tau}} = x(t)\cdot b\, .&lt;/math&gt;

If {{nowrap|''τ'' &gt; 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' &gt; 1}}, then ''x'' has exponential growth. If {{nowrap|''τ'' &lt; 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' &gt; 1}}, or {{nowrap|''τ'' &gt; 0}}  and 0 &lt; {{nowrap|''b'' &lt; 1}}, then ''x'' has [[exponential decay]].

Example: ''If a species of bacteria doubles every ten minutes, starting out with only one bacterium, how many bacteria would be present after one hour?''  The question implies ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''τ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;min.

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=a\cdot b^{t/\tau}=1\cdot 2^{(60\text{ min})/(10\text{ min})}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x(1\text{ hr})= 1 \cdot 2^6 =64.&lt;/math&gt;

After one hour, or six ten-minute intervals, there would be sixty-four bacteria.

Many pairs (''b'',&amp;nbsp;''τ'') of a [[dimensionless]] non-negative number ''b'' and an amount of time ''τ'' (a [[physical quantity]] which can be expressed as the product of a number of units and a unit of time) represent the same growth rate, with ''τ'' proportional to log&amp;nbsp;''b''. For any fixed ''b'' not equal to 1 (e.g. ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time ''τ''. For any non-zero time ''τ'' the growth rate is given by the dimensionless positive number&amp;nbsp;''b''.

Thus the law of exponential growth can be written in different but mathematically equivalent forms, by using a different [[exponentiation|base]].  The most common forms are the following:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = x_0\cdot e^{kt} = x_0\cdot e^{t/\tau} = x_0 \cdot 2^{t/T}
= x_0\cdot \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)^{t/p},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; expresses the initial quantity ''x''(0).

Parameters (negative in the case of exponential decay):
* The ''growth constant'' ''k'' is the [[frequency]] (number of times per unit time) of growing by a factor ''e''; in finance it is also called the logarithmic return,  [[continuous compounding|continuously compounded return]], or [[Compound interest#Force of interest|force of interest]].
* The ''[[e-folding|e-folding time]]'' ''τ'' is the time it takes to grow by a factor ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]''.
* The ''[[doubling time]]'' ''T'' is the time it takes to double.
* The percent increase ''r'' (a dimensionless number) in a period ''p''.
The quantities ''k'', ''τ'', and ''T'', and for a given ''p'' also ''r'', have a one-to-one connection given by the following equation (which can be derived by taking the natural logarithm of the above):

:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{1}{\tau} = \frac{\ln 2}{T} = \frac{\ln \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' = 0 corresponds to ''r'' = 0 and to ''τ'' and ''T'' being infinite.

If ''p'' is the unit of time the quotient ''t''/''p'' is simply the number of units of time. Using the notation ''t'' for the (dimensionless) number of units of time rather than the time itself, ''t''/''p'' can be replaced by ''t'', but for uniformity this has been avoided here. In this case the division by ''p'' in the last formula is not a numerical division either, but converts a dimensionless number to the correct quantity including unit.

A popular approximated method for calculating the doubling time from the growth rate is the [[rule of 70]],
i.e. &lt;math&gt;T \simeq 70 / r&lt;/math&gt;.

{{wide image|doubling_time_vs_half_life.svg|640px|Graphs comparing doubling times and half lives of exponential growths (bold lines) and decay (faint lines), and their 70/''t'' and 72/''t'' approximations. In the [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Doubling_time_vs_half_life.svg SVG version], hover over a graph to highlight it and its complement.}}

==Reformulation as log-linear growth==
If a variable ''x'' exhibits exponential growth according to &lt;math&gt;x(t)=x_0(1+r)^t&lt;/math&gt;, then the log (to any base) of ''x'' [[linear function|grows linearly]] over time, as can be seen by taking [[logarithm]]s of both sides of the exponential growth equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\log x(t) = \log x_0 + t \cdot \log (1+r).&lt;/math&gt;

This allows an exponentially growing variable to be modeled with a [[Nonlinear regression#Linearization|log-linear model]]. For example, if one wishes to empirically estimate the growth rate from intertemporal data on ''x'', one can [[linear regression|linearly regress]] log ''x'' on ''t''.

==Differential equation==
The [[exponential function]] &lt;math&gt;x(t)=x(0) e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[linear differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \!\, \frac{dx}{dt} = kx&lt;/math&gt;

saying that the change per instant of time of ''x'' at time ''t'' is proportional to the value of ''x''(''t''), and ''x''(''t'') has the [[initial value]]
:&lt;math&gt;x(0).&lt;/math&gt;

The differential equation is solved by direct integration:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = kx \\[5pt]
\frac{dx} x &amp; = k\, dt \\[5pt]
\int_{x(0)}^{x(t)} \frac{dx}{x} &amp; = k \int_0^t  \, dt \\[5pt]
\ln \frac{x(t)}{x(0)} &amp; =  kt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

: &lt;math&gt; x(t) =  x(0) e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above differential equation, if {{nowrap|''k'' &lt; 0}}, then the quantity experiences [[exponential decay]].

For a [[nonlinear]] variation of this growth model see [[logistic function]].

==Difference equation==
The [[difference equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = a \cdot x_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;

has solution

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = x_0 \cdot a^t,&lt;/math&gt;

showing that ''x'' experiences exponential growth.

== Other growth rates ==
In the long run, exponential growth of any kind will overtake linear growth of any kind (the basis of the [[Malthusian catastrophe]]) as well as any [[polynomial]] growth, i.e., for all α:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} {t^\alpha \over ae^t} =0.&lt;/math&gt;

There is a whole hierarchy of conceivable growth rates that are slower than exponential and faster than linear (in the long run). See [[Degree of a polynomial#The degree computed from the function values]].

Growth rates may also be faster than exponential. In the most extreme case, when growth increases without bound in finite time, it is called [[hyperbolic growth]]. In between exponential and hyperbolic growth lie more classes of growth behavior, like the [[hyperoperation]]s beginning at [[tetration]], and &lt;math&gt;A(n,n)&lt;/math&gt;, the diagonal of the [[Ackermann function]].

==Limitations of models==
Exponential growth models of physical phenomena only apply within limited regions, as unbounded growth is not physically realistic. Although growth may initially be exponential, the modelled phenomena will eventually enter a region in which previously ignored [[negative feedback]] factors become significant (leading to a [[logistic growth]] model) or other underlying assumptions of the exponential growth model, such as continuity or instantaneous feedback, break down.

==Exponential stories==

===Rice on a chessboard===
{{see also|Wheat and chessboard problem}}
According to an old legend, vizier Sissa Ben Dahir presented an Indian King Sharim with a beautiful, hand-made [[chessboard]]. The king asked what he would like in return for his gift and the courtier surprised the king by asking for one grain of rice on the first square, two grains on the second, four grains on the third etc. The king readily agreed and asked for the rice to be brought. All went well at first, but the requirement for 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; grains on the ''n''th square demanded over a million grains on the 21st square, more than a million million ({{aka}} [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]]) on the 41st and there simply was not enough rice in the whole world for the final squares. (From Swirski, 2006)&lt;ref name=Porritt-2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Porritt|first=Jonathan|title=Capitalism: as if the world matters|year=2005|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|isbn=1-84407-192-8|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[second half of the chessboard]] is the time when an exponentially growing influence is having a significant economic impact on an organization's overall business strategy.

===Water lily===
French children are told a story in which they imagine having a pond with [[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]] leaves floating on the surface. The lily population doubles in size every day and, if left unchecked, it will smother the pond in thirty days killing all the other living things in the water. Day after day, the plant's growth is small and so it is decided that it shall be cut down when the water lilies cover half of the pond. The children are then asked on what day will half of the pond be covered in water lilies.  The solution is simple when one considers that the water lilies must double to completely cover the pond on the thirtieth day.  Therefore, the water lilies will cover half of the pond on the twenty-ninth day. There is only one day to save the pond. (From Meadows ''et al''. 1972)&lt;ref name=Porritt-2005/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5158">In any of several studies that treat the use of [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s—for example, in [[linguistics]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[semiotics]]—the '''extension''' of a concept, idea, or [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] consists of the things to which it applies, in contrast with its [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] or [[intension]], which consists very roughly of the ideas, properties, or corresponding signs that are implied or suggested by the concept in question.

In philosophical [[semantics]] or the [[philosophy of language]], the 'extension' of a concept or expression is the set of things it extends to, or applies to, if it is the sort of concept or expression that a single object by itself can satisfy.  Concepts and expressions of this sort are [[monad (Greek philosophy)|monadic]] or "one-place" concepts and expressions.

So the extension of the word "dog" is the set of all (past, present and future) dogs in the world: the set includes Fido, Rover, [[Lassie]], Rex, and so on.  The extension of the phrase "Wikipedia reader" includes each person who has ever read Wikipedia, including ''you''.

The extension of a whole statement, as opposed to a word or phrase, is defined (since [[Frege]] 1892) as its [[truth value]]. So the extension of "Lassie is famous" is the logical value 'true', since Lassie is famous.

Some concepts and expressions are such that they don't apply to objects individually, but rather serve to relate objects to objects.  For example, the words "before" and "after" do not apply to objects individually—it makes no sense to say "Jim is before" or "Jim is after"—but to one thing in relation to another, as in "The wedding is before the reception" and "The reception is after the wedding".  Such "relational" or "polyadic" ("many-place") concepts and expressions have, for their extension, the set of all sequences of objects that satisfy the concept or expression in question.  So the extension of "before" is the set of all (ordered) pairs of objects such that the first one is before the second one.

== Mathematics ==
In [[mathematics]], the 'extension' of a mathematical concept is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] that is specified by that concept.{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

For example, the extension of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is a set of [[ordered pair]]s that pair up the arguments and values of the function; in other words, the function's graph.  The extension of an object in [[abstract algebra]], such as a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], is the [[underlying set]] of the object. The extension of a set is the set itself. That a set can capture the notion of the extension of anything is the idea behind the [[axiom of extensionality]] in [[axiomatic set theory]].

This kind of extension is used so constantly in contemporary mathematics based on [[set theory]] that it can be called an implicit assumption.

== Computer science ==

In [[computer science]], some [[database]] textbooks use the term 'intension' to refer to the [[logical schema|schema]] of a database, and 'extension' to refer to particular [[Row (database)|instance]]s of a database.

== Metaphysical implications ==

There is an ongoing controversy in [[metaphysics]] about whether or not there are, in addition to actual, existing things, non-actual or nonexistent things.  If there are—if, for instance, there are possible but non-actual dogs (dogs of some non-actual but possible species, perhaps) or nonexistent beings (like Sherlock Holmes, perhaps)—then these things might also figure in the extensions of various concepts and expressions.  If not, only existing, actual things can be in the extension of a concept or expression.  Note that "actual" may not mean the same as "existing".  Perhaps there exist things that are merely possible, but not actual.  (Maybe they exist in other universes, and these universes are other "[[possible worlds]]"—possible alternatives to the actual world.)  Perhaps some actual things are nonexistent.  (Sherlock Holmes seems to be an ''actual'' example of a fictional character; one might think there are many other characters [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] ''might'' have invented, though he actually invented Holmes.)

A similar problem arises for objects that no longer exist.  The extension of the term "Socrates", for example, seems to be a (currently) non-existent object.  [[Free logic]] is one attempt to avoid some of these problems.

== General semantics ==

Some fundamental formulations in the field of [[general semantics]] rely heavily on a valuation of extension over [[intension]]. See for example extension, and the [[#External links|extensional devices]].

The '''Guardian of the Threshold''' is a menacing figure that is described by a number of esoteric teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Madame Blavatsky, ''Isis Unveiled'', 1877&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, “Knowledge of the Higher Worlds”(1904-5),[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/] Online English edition (1947, New York)[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/AP1947/GA010_cover.html] and ''An Outline of Occult Science'' first German edition 1909. Online English edition (1972, New York), chapter 5 [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA013/English/AP1972/GA013_cover.html][http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA013/English/AP1972/GA013_c05-08.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dion Fortune, “The Mystical Qabalah”, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, "The Perfect Matrimony", 1950&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Guardian of the Threshold", often called "dweller on the threshold", indicates a spectral image which is supposed to manifest itself as soon as "the student of the spirit ascends upon the path into the higher worlds of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Franz Hartmann, The Dweller of the Threshold, Reprinted from The Theosophist, Vol. XI 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner,An Outline of Occult Science,Anthroposophic Press 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tommaso Palamidessi]], The Guardians of the Threshold, ed. Archeosofica, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian of the Threshold'' is also the title of the third play (of a tetralogy of ''Mystery Dramas'') written by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in 1912.

==According to theosophy==
The "Dweller of the Threshold" (or "Guardian of the Threshold") is a literary invention of the English mystic and novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], found in his romance ''[[Zanoni]]'' (1842). Shortly after publication of the book, the term gained wide currency in theosophical circles. The Guardian of the Threshold is a spectral figure and is the abstract of the debit and credit book of the individual. "It is the combined evil influence that is the result of the wicked thoughts and acts of the age in which any one may live, and it assumes to each student a definite shape at each appearance, being always either of one sort or changing each time"&lt;ref&gt;Eusebio Urban, Path, December, 1888&lt;/ref&gt; "This Dweller of the Threshold meets us in many shapes. It is the Cerberus guarding the entrance to Hades; the Dragon which St. Michael (spiritual will-power) is going to kill; the Snake which tempted Eve, and whose head will be crushed by the heel of the woman; the Hobgoblin watching the place where the treasure is buried, etc. He is the king of evil, who will not permit that within his kingdom a child should grow up, which might surpass him in power; the Herod before whose wrath the divine child Christ has to flee into a foreign country, and is not permitted to return to his home (the soul) until the king (Ambition, Pride, Vanity, Self-righteousness, etc.) is dethroned or dead."&lt;ref&gt;Franz Hartmann, The Dweller of the Threshold, Reprinted from The Theosophist, Vol. XI 1889&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Max Heindel]], the Dweller on the Threshold must be confronted by every aspirant—usually at an early stage of his progress into the unseen worlds—and is one of the main causes of obsession.&lt;ref&gt;Max Heindel, ''The Web Destiny'', Rosicrucian Fellowship&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Rudolf Steiner's drama==
In [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s play ''The Guardian of the Threshold'', first performed in 1912 and the third in a series of four "Mystery Dramas", the appearance of the Guardian is connected with [[Lucifer]] and [[Ahriman]].[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA014/English/APC1925/GA014-3_contents.html] Steiner explained that the meeting with the Guardian of the Threshold as presented in those dramas was to show that a person (man or woman) who had made the soul clairvoyant, must go back and forth across that threshold and know how to be rightly in the spiritual world on the far side, as well as on this side in the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA147/English/AP1987/SecThr_index.html Rudolf Steiner, ''Secrets of the Threshold'', VII]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
*In the short [[Cthulhu mythos]] novel ''[[The Lurker at the Threshold]]'', the title entity is arguably another name for the same entity.
*[[Van Morrison]] refers to himself as a "Dweller on the Threshold" in the song of that name on the album ''Beautiful Vision''.
*The term "Dweller on the Threshold" is used in television show, ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', towards the conclusion of the series. It is mentioned in the context of the [[Black and White Lodges]] which play a central role in the metaphysical backstory of the series.
*In the novel ''Blood of Amber'' in [[Roger Zelazny]]'s [[Chronicles of Amber]] series, Corwin's son Merlin encounters a being of primal chaos named Scrof which calls itself a Dweller on the Threshold.
*The modern pseudo documentary "The Nightmare" draws reference to The Lurker at the Threshold through an entity known as The Shadowman who visits victims during sleep paralysis.

'''Industrial Dashboard''' is term used to describe the graphical display of manufacturing information. Much like the dashboard in a car, an Industrial Dashboard shows data collected from a multitude of sensors displayed as one quick overview of the general operating situation.

Sometimes used as a verb: Dashboarding. The act of programming to display information about a manufacturing process. “We are in the process of dashboarding the efficiency data from Lathe #3.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dashboards and Dashboarding|url=http://www.logianalytics.com/resources/bi-encyclopedia/dashboards-dashboarding/|website=Logi Analytics|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Industrial Dashboard is the display of data via programming - typically Java Script, Html5, and PHP. The “Dashboard” is referring to the graphics displayed, not the device they are displaying on. For instance - an Industrial Dashboard screen may be displayed on a smart phone and a big screen TV at the same time.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the simplest form, an Industrial Dashboard may show just one metric from a manufacturing process. This might start with a count of product produced from a machine. A more complex approach to Industrial Dashboarding would be a series of “drill down” click points - starting with a dashboard screen showing a summary of production for the whole plant. Various points on that screen would be clickable to drill down into more and more dashboard screens until reaching a dashboard of very detailed data on a single machine or [[Machine Operator Efficiency]] of a single employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Badiru|first1=Adedeji|title=Handbook of Industrial and Systems Engineering|publisher=CRC Press|edition=Second|date=October 11, 2013|at=23.3.3.2, p. 440|asin=B00GM4NT42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several hardware technology approaches to retrieving data from the machinery. The science of interfacing industrial machines is widely referred to as [[Industry_4.0|Industry4.0]] or [[Internet_of_Things|IIoT]] (Industrial Internet of Things). Some industry standards such as [[MTConnect]] are emerging in an attempt make CNC machine tools produce production data in a uniform format to web servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sobel|first1=William|title=Inter-device Connectivity and Foundations of Industrial Internet|url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54011775e4b0bc1fe0fb8494/t/55a95b07e4b0e800df57deec/1437162247275/MTConnectWorkshop_2015_Sobel_InterdeviceAndIIoT.pdf|website=MtConnect.org|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interpersonal Cognitive Behavioral Therapy''' ('''I-CBT''') is a branch of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) that is mainly used to treat [[anxiety disorder|anxiety]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), and [[autism spectrum disorder]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} It was developed by Thomas Cordier of Glastonbury Connecticut, USA (An Introduction to The Interpersonal Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Treatment System: A 21st Century Recipe for Mental Health Treatment Success, T.A. Cordier, 2016).

==Description==
I-CBT seeks to help patients overcome their psychiatric/mental health problems by teaching them — through the utilization of [[emotional intelligence]] (EI) — to dismiss irrational thoughts by helping them to understand and define their emotional states. Emotional intelligence is thought to be a better indicator for success than [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) test scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goleman|first1=Daniel|title=Emotional Intelligence: Why it can Matter More than I.Q.|date=1995|publisher=Bantam|location=New York|isbn=978-0553383713|edition=1st|url=http://www.danielgoleman.info/topics/emotional-intelligence/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Core beliefs===
Clients are also taught to challenge negative core beliefs by challenging assumptions based on these beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beck|first1=Judith S.|title=Cognitive Therapy: Basics and Beyond|date=1995|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1609185046}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment system focuses on the relationship between the patient and provider as a primary source for the patient's improvement. I-CBT also draws on other proven treatment modalities, (e.g., psychodynamic principals and [[group therapy]]) and utilizes [[mindfulness]], [[yoga]], [[art therapy]], and [[social skills]] training to help behaviorally challenged adolescents and adults find calmness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cordier|first1=Dr. Thomas|title=An Introduction To The Interpersonal Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Treatment System: A 21st Century Recipe for Mental Health Treatment Success|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; I-CBT is a structured treatment approach based on a workbook/manual that can be tailored for an individual patient's needs. The program also utilizes the [[Beck Depression Inventory]] (BDI), the [[Beck Anxiety Inventory]] (BAI), and the Beck Youth Inventory (BYI) to help track clients progress, and ensure an effective treatment program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cordier|first1=Dr. Thomas|title=An Introduction To The Interpersonal Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Treatment System: A 21st Century Recipe For Mental Health Treatment Success|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
I-CBT also focuses on treating the family unit as a whole, by including mandatory [[behavioral parent training]] (BPT), to teach good parenting skills, and how to encourage positive behavior/thinking — while discouraging negative behavior/thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cordier|first1=Dr. Thomas|title=An Introduction to the Interpersonal-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Treatment System (I-CBT): A 21st Century Recipe for Mental Health Treatment Success|date=2016|publisher=Nova Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-63483-604-3|page=75|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonidas Carstarphen Dyer''' (June 11, 1871 – December 15, 1957) was an American politician, reformer, [[civil rights activist]], and military officer who served 11 terms in the U.S. Congress as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[Missouri]] from 1911 to 1933.  In 1898, enrolling in the U.S. Army as a private, Dyer served notably in the [[Spanish–American War]]; and was promoted to Colonel at the war's end.

Working as an attorney in St. Louis, Dyer started an anti-[[usury]] campaign and was elected to Congress as a Republican in 1910. As a progressive reformer, Dyer authored an anti-usury law in 1914 that limited excessive loan rates by bank lenders in the nation's capital, then still governed by Congress.&lt;ref name="Morrow"&gt;{{cite news |last=Morrow |first=James B. |title=Usury The Bugbear of the Poor |newspaper=Boston Daily Globe |date=June 21, 1914 |page=SM 10 |location=Boston, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horrified by the race riots in [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]] and [[East Saint Louis]] in 1917 and the high rate of reported [[lynchings]] in the South, in 1918 Dyer was notable for proposing the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]]. In 1920, the Republican Party supported such legislation in its platform from the National Convention. In January 1922, Dyer's bill was passed by the House, which approved it by a wide margin due to "insistent countrywide demand".&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt;  The bill was defeated by the white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] voting bloc of [[Southern United States|the South]] in [[filibusters]] in the Senate in December 1922, in 1923 and 1924.

In 1919, Dyer authored the motor-vehicle theft law, which made transporting stolen automobiles across state lines a federal crime. By 1956, the [[FBI]] reported that the law had enabled the recovery of cars worth more than $212 million.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; In terms of [[Prohibition]], Rep. Dyer voted against various anti-liquor laws, including the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]].

Dyer served in Congress from the [[62nd Congress]] to the [[72nd Congress]]. He was defeated for re-election during the 1930s of the [[Great Depression]]. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s programs to put people to work and extend social welfare during the Depression helped attract voters to Democratic candidates.

==Early life and education==
Dyer was born near Warrenton in [[Warren County, Missouri]], the son of James Coleman Dyer and Martha E. (Camp) Dyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/dyer.html "Index to Politicians: Dyer"], The Political Graveyard, accessed 21 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His father's family had roots in [[Virginia]], where his uncle [[David Patterson Dyer]] was born; he was elected as a Republican Congressman from Missouri (1869–71).&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/families/10445.html "Dyer Family of Virginia"], The Political Graveyard, accessed 22 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonidas attended common schools and [[Central Wesleyan College]]. He studied law at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and was admitted to the bar in 1893.&lt;ref name="bioguide.congress.gov"&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=D000591  Dyer, Leonidas Carstarphen, (1871–1957)], ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress,'' accessed 22 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Served in Spanish–American War==
{{main |Spanish–American War}}
When the [[Spanish–American War]] began, Dyer joined the United States Army and served in combat during the Santiago campaign as a private in 1898.  He was promoted to colonel during the war, and served as a member of the staff of [[Herbert S. Hadley]], future Governor of Missouri.&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt;

==St. Louis attorney and reformer==
{{further |Usury}}
After the war, the young Dyer served as assistant circuit attorney in [[St. Louis]], where he championed an [[usury|anti-usury]] reform campaign that eventually gained national attention.  Dyer successfully represented a railroad clerk who was being charged 34% monthly (''408% annual'') interest on a $100 loan after having paid $480 interest in 14 months.  None of the interest payment to the money lender was used to pay off the [[amortization (business)|principal]]. The money lender, in front of Att. Dyer, tore up the railroad workers loan.  Dyer organized a group of wealthy merchants in St. Louis who through investigations were able to keep interest rates low in Missouri.&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt;

==Congressional career==
[[image:Leonidas C. Dyer Standing.jpg|thumb |250px |Rep. Leonidas C. Dyer from Missouri was elected to Congress in 1910.  Rep. Dyer in 1918 authored the Dyer anti-lynching bill.  Although passed in the House in 1922, the bill was defeated in the Senate by a Southern Democratic [[filibuster]]. Rep. Dyer's motto: "We have just begun to fight."]]
In 1910, Dyer successfully ran and was elected Congressman to the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt; His long career in Congress having begun in 1911, Rep. Dyer was repeatedly re-elected. His time in Congress was briefly interrupted between 1914 and 1915 due to a dispute over 1912 election results, but he was reelected in 1914.

Dyer was defeated for re-election from his district in 1932, 1934 and 1936, and decided to retire from politics. Dyer represented the 12th District of Missouri, which had a majority African-American population. They were disappointed by the Republican failure to pass an anti-lynching bill during the 1920s,&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt; and attracted to Democratic candidates during the [[Great Depression]], after [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had started some of his work and welfare programs.  Dyer followed [[Harry Coudrey]], also a Republican.&lt;ref name="Leonidas Dyer Elected Positions"&gt;Govtrac.us, [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=403694 Leonidas Dryer Elected Positions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-usury law===
Rep. Dyer continued his anti-usury campaign in 1914 by authoring a law that prevented banks from charging excessive interest rates on loans in Washington D.C., which was then governed by Congress.  Rep. Dyer believed that money lenders went after financially vulnerable people, authorizing loan contracts for unnecessary purposes.  Dyer stated that usury was "an ancient moral crime against the poor and helpless."&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt;  He advocated for each state to pass similar anti-usury laws.&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt;

===Advocated postal pneumatic tube system===
{{further |Pneumatic tubes}}
On March 29, 1916, Rep. Dyer spoke before a Senate Committee advocating H.R. 10484, to fund a U.S. Postal [[pneumatic tube]] service in St. Louis.  Under the existing service, U.S. mail was transported by compressed air [[vacuum]] tubes in the St. Louis area.  Dyer asked the committee to extend the pneumatic tube service from 2 to 5 miles; at a cost of $50,000.  According to Dyer, the tube extension would promote business and private citizens in East St. Louis by reducing delivery time 11 hours and 50 minutes. By comparison, the city of Boston had 8 miles of U.S. Postal pneumatic tube service.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Post Offices and Postal Roads United States Senate (March 29, 1916), ''Pneumatic Tube Service'', p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-lynching bill===

====St. Louis riots 1917====

{{further |Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill |Lynching in the United States|Lynching }}
In May 1917, a riot broke out in [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]], where mobs of ethnic white men attacked black workers, [[strikebreakers]] who had been brought in to replace [[American Federation of Labor]] strikers. In July 1917, mob violence broke out in [[East St. Louis]] against blacks, also against a background of competition over jobs. Two white police officers were killed early in the confrontation. In retaliation, ethnic white mobs killed 35 blacks, mutilated the bodies and threw them into the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name="howard"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howard |first1=Marilyn K. |last2=Rucker |first2=Walter C. |last3=Upton |first3=James N. |title=Encyclopedia of American race riots |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |pages=183|isbn=0-313-33301-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; White rioters openly targeted and lynched several blacks.  Those who attempted to stop the lynchings were threatened by the white mob with physical violence.  As blacks fled into St. Louis, white rioters threatened to kill them upon their return. The white Illinois National guard brought into quell the riot, participated in the violence against blacks or did nothing to stop the violence.  One black child was shot and thrown into a burning building, while white prostitutes openly attacked black women. After the riots, of the 134 persons indicted, only 9 whites who were put on trial went to prison while 12 indicted blacks who went to trial were imprisoned. Nearly 1/3 of the total 134 persons indicted were black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lupton |first1=John A. |last2=Rucker |first2=Walter C. |last3=Upton |first3=James N. |title=Encyclopedia of American race riots |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |pages=188–190|isbn=0-313-33301-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conviction rate, mathematically, was more than doubled for blacks then for whites.

Dyer was distressed by such mob violence, with its disregard for the courts and the "rule of law". His district in St. Louis had mostly African-American residents and he wanted to protect his constituents and other citizens. Many people from his district had migrated to St. Louis from [[Southern United States|the South]], in the exodus known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. They settled in St. Louis where industrialization had led to a strong economy and an increase in jobs. The economy had also attracted numerous immigrants from Europe and competition for work was high.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt;  Dyer also knew of the continuing high rate of lynchings, mostly of blacks by whites in [[Southern United States|the South]]. Working with [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] and [[Walter Francis White|Walter White]] of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], who had been working on a national anti-lynching campaign, Dyer helped develop and agreed to sponsor anti-lynching legislation.&lt;ref name="neh"/&gt;  
[[image:Lynching2.jpg|thumb|175px |left |Mob violence and lynching were common against African Americans in the South from the 1890s through the 1920s.]]

====Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill introduced 1918====
Calling for an end to mob violence, on April 1, 1918, Dyer introduced the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]], which would have made lynching a federal crime.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; In his speech, he anticipated some members likely objections about the federal government sponsoring "social" legislation, and noted that lynching violated individuals' rights under the 14th Amendment. In addition, he noted that Congress had passed child labor laws and the Prohibition amendment. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Congress has felt its duty to do these things, why should it not also assume jurisdiction and enact laws to protect the lives of citizens of the United States against lynch law and mob violence? Are the rights of property, or what a citizen shall drink, or the ages and conditions under which children shall work, any more important to the Nation than life itself?&lt;ref name="BAIC"&gt;[http://baic.house.gov/historical-essays/essay.html?intID=5&amp;intSectionID=29 "Anti-Lynching Legislation Renewed"], Historical Essay: ''The Negroes' Temporary Farewell: Jim Crow and the Exclusion of African Americans from Congress, 1887–1929'', ''Black Americans in Congress, US Congress, accessed 5 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Black leaders in the North had insisted that the Republican Party National platform for the presidential election of 1920 include support for anti-lynching legislation. After the election, the black community complained when months passed without Harding's getting a bill introduced and passed by Congress.&lt;ref name="Harvier"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/07/09/107065716.pdf Ernest Harvier, "Political Effect of the Dyer Bill: Delay in Enacting Anti-Lynching Law Diverted Thousands of Negro Votes"], ''New York Times'', 9 July 1922, accessed 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyer introduced a revised version of the bill in the House of Representatives in 1921.  Due to "insistent country-wide demand," it passed on January 22, 1922.&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt; The first such federal legislation to gain House passage in the twentieth century, it would have enabled the federal government to prosecute the crime. Southern authorities seldom did so. In the South, most blacks had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] from 1890–1911 by constitutional changes and discriminatory legislation after southern Democrats regained power in the state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol.17, 2000], accessed 10 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to vote, blacks were disqualified from serving on juries or holding any political office; they had virtually no political power within the official system. In the few cases that came to trial, [[all-white jury|all-white juries]] generally never convicted a white man of lynching a black.

The Republican President [[Warren G. Harding]] spoke in favor of Dyer's anti-lynching bill at an appearance in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Alabama. With high interest in the bill across the country, it passed the House on January 26, 1922, with the help of Liberal Republicans and eight Democratic Representatives, and went on to the Senate. President Harding stated he would sign the bill if it was passed by the Senate&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt;

Proponents of Dyer's anti-lynching bill believed that lynching and mob violence took away African-American citizens' rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. These rights included a speedy and fair trial by an impartial jury. Other citizen rights included the right to be informed of the nature of the crime accused, the ability to have witnesses in the defense's favor, and to be represented by council in court.&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt; Many blacks felt betrayed by the Republicans due to the bill's slow process to the Senate. A silent protest march by many blacks took place in front of the Capital grounds and White House in 1922 while the bill's constitutionality was being contemplated. A protest sign read, "Congress discusses constitutionality while the smoke of burning bodies darkens the heavens."&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt;

====Senate filibuster 1922====
[[image:U.S. Senator Lee Slater Overman.jpg|thumb|175px |right |U.S. Sen. [[Lee Slater Overman]] from North Carolina, Harris &amp; Ewing, 1914.&lt;br&gt; Southern Democratic senators filibustered the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill in December 1922 and twice more to prevent its passage.]]
After Dyer's bill reached the Senate and received a favorable report from the [[Senate Judiciary Committee|Judiciary Committee]], some Republican senators, including most prominently [[William Borah]], an otherwise progressive Senator from [[Idaho]], spoke against it. Borah was concerned about issues of [[state sovereignty]] and believed that the bill was not constitutional.&lt;ref name="neh"&gt;[http://edsitement.neh.gov/lesson-plan/naacp%E2%80%99s-anti-lynching-campaign-1920s#sect-background "Lesson 1: NAACP’s Anti-Lynching Campaign in the 1920s"], ''NAACP's Anti-Lynching Campaigns'', 22 December 2009, Edsitement, National Endowment for the Humanities, accessed 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially concerned about the clause that provided for federal authorities to punish state officials "remiss in the suppression of lynchings."&lt;ref name="NYTCalder"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/05/30/107058655.pdf "Calder Is Friend of Negro, He Insists"], ''New York Times'', 22 May 1922, accessed 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;[http://www.electricprint.com/academic/department/AandL/AAS/ANNOUNCE/vra/lynch/congress/congress1.htm  "Proceedings of the U.S. Senate on June 13, 2005 regarding the "Senate Apology" as Reported in the 'Congressional Record'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322090032/http://www.electricprint.com/academic/department/AandL/AAS/ANNOUNCE/vra/lynch/congress/congress1.htm |date=March 22, 2012 }}, "Part 3, Mr. Craig", at African American Studies, University of Buffalo, accessed 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A prolonged [[filibuster]] by Southern white Democrats prevented consideration of the bill and defeated it. After the Democrats had held up voting on all the national business in the Senate for a week in December 1922 by their filibuster, the Republicans realized they could not overcome the tactic and finally conceded defeat on Dyer's bill.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; Senator [[Lee S. Overman]] of North Carolina told the ''New York Times'' that the "good negroes of the South did not want the legislation for 'they do not need it'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/12/03/109338699.pdf "Filibuster Kills Anti-Lynching Bil"], ''New York Times'', 3 December 1922, accessed 20 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath and legacy====
Following the defeat of his first bill in the Senate in 1922, Dyer tried unsuccessfully two more times to get it passed by the Senate.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; Some of the bill's opponents claimed that the threat of lynching protected white women from sexual advances from black men.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; The studies by the journalist [[Ida B. Wells]] in the late 1890s had shown that black lynch victims were accused or rape or attempted rape only one third of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ida B. Wells, ''Southern Horrors'' (1892)&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the murders of blacks were an extreme form of white extrajudicial punishment and community control, often targeting blacks who were economic competitors with whites, who were trying to advance in society, who were in debt to landowners (settlement season for [[sharecroppers]] was a time of high rates of lynchings in rural areas), or those who failed to "stay in their place".&lt;ref name="whowaslynched"&gt;[http://www.nellpainter.com/cv/articles/32_WhoWasLynched.html Nell Painter, "Who Was Lynched?"], reprinted from ''The Nation'', 11 November 1991, Vol. 253, Issue 16, p. 16, Nell Painter Website, accessed 1 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, according to the Pittsburgh ''Gazette Times'', many Southerners viewed the practice of lynching as a [[sport|sporting event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mississippi's 'Orderly' Lynching |newspaper=The Gazette Times |location=Pittsburgh |date=June 28, 1919 |page=6 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yLZRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m2gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2143%2C4208920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, to gain national support for his anti-lynching bill, which was to be heard again that year in the Senate, Dyer toured the western United States to generate public support. His motto for his anti-lynching campaign was "We have just begun to fight." (This was the statement made famous by [[John Paul Jones]].)  Dyer attracted mixed black and white audiences in [[Denver]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Los Angeles, [[Omaha]], and Chicago.  He thanked the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) for supporting his bill and praised their continuing to publicize the terrible human toll of lynching in the United States. In Chicago, 4000 people attended his anti-lynching rally. Dyer's campaign received positive coverage by the white mainstream press, which helped strengthen an anti-lynching movement in the West.&lt;ref&gt;"Lynching", ''The Crisis'' (July, 1923), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The national attention received by Dyer's anti-lynching bill and speaking campaign may have helped reduce lynchings in the South. Lynchings per year dropped in four years, from 60 in 1918 to 57 in 1922. More significantly, the Great Migration was underway, and black workers by the tens of thousands were leaving the South for Northern and Midwestern industrial cities, for jobs, education, and a chance to escape [[Jim Crow]] laws and violence. By 1934, when the [[Edward Costigan|Costigan]]-[[Robert F. Wagner|Wagner]] anti-lynching bill was introduced, lynchings had dropped to 15 per year.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; In 1935 and 1938, Senator Borah repeated his constitutional arguments against the bill; he added that he believed such legislation was no longer needed, because the rate of lynchings had fallen so dramatically.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt; By 1940, 1.5 million blacks had left the South in the Great Migration. Another five million left from 1940–1970.
 
The political power of the white Democrats in the South came from their having disfranchised most blacks from 1890–1910. The South was essentially a one-party, Democratic region in which only whites voted and held office, well into the 1960s, but Congressional representation was based on the total population. The situation of disfranchisement did not change markedly until passage in the 1960s of federal [[civil rights]] legislation that protected and enforced the constitutional rights of voting and citizenship for African Americans and other minorities.

From 1882–1968, "... nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in Congress, and three passed the House. Seven presidents between 1890 and 1952 petitioned Congress to pass a federal law."&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; None was approved by the Senate because of the powerful opposition of the Southern Democratic voting bloc. In June 2005, through passing a bipartisan resolution sponsored by senators [[Mary Landrieu]] of Louisiana and [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] of Virginia, the US Senate officially apologized for not having passed an anti-lynching law "when it was most needed."&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,159348,00.html Associated Press, "Senate Apologizes for Not Passing Anti-Lynching Laws"], Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-automobile theft law===
In 1919, Rep. Dyer authored an anti-crime law that made transporting stolen cars across state borders a federal crime, to be prosecuted by federal law enforcement.  In 1956, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] said that the law had led to the recovery of 227,752 stolen automobiles worth $212,679,296.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;

===Advocated Philippine independence===
In December 1922, Rep. Dyer had traveled to the [[Philippines]], then a U.S. territory,  according to the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]].  On December 22, Rep. Dyer spoke before the Philippine Senate in [[Manila]], stating that he believed the Philippines would be independent by the next Congress.  Rep. Dyer stated he favored Philippine independence. He said that the US would always "be proud of the Philippines and what we have accomplished here for the [[Filipinos]] and for the American people."&lt;ref&gt;"Sees Philippines Free", ''New York Times'' (December 23, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines were granted commonwealth status in 1935 and finally given independence in 1946.

===Contraband liquor stock===
The [[New York Curb Exchange]] (NYCE) on April 10, 1929, had received a letter written by Rep. Dyer that demanded he be returned money after he had bought and sold at a loss Canadian whiskey company [[Hiram Walker]] stock.  Rep. Dyer contended he did not know that company made liquor, a contraband product in the U.S. during Prohibition and was forced to sell at a loss.  Rep. Dyer believed Hiram Walker and other company liquor stocks had been sold on the NYCE without acknowledgement that these were whiskey companies.&lt;ref name="Congressman"&gt;The Atlanta Constitution (Apr 11, 1929), Congressman Asks Return of Losses On Whisky Stock&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyer had voted against the Prohibition [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]], the [[Volstead Act]], the Volstead Act over-riding Presidential veto, and the Jones law. These laws authorized federal enforcement and essentially prohibited the sale of liquor in the United States.&lt;ref name="Congressman"/&gt; Saint Louis had a large beer-brewing industry, and before Prohibition, Missouri was the second-largest wine-producing state in the country.&lt;ref name="missouriwinecountry.com"&gt;[http://www.missouriwinecountry.com/articles/history/ Brett Dufur, "History of Missouri Wine Industry"], Missouri Wine Country, accessed 19 Oct 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Both industries had been started and developed by German immigrants to the state. Prohibition would seriously damage the economies of Dyer's major city and state.

===Terms and voting record===
Rep. Dyer served 11 terms in office for Missouri's 12th District. During his second term in office, on June 19, 1914 Dyer was suspended from taking his seat in the House of Representatives due to contested voting election returns in 1912 in Missouri's 12th District. According to the ''New York Times'', Dyer had nothing to do with the voting fraud.  The House voted to unseat Dyer, who was active in legislative work, by a 147 to 98 vote.  During the vote to oust Dyer, 22 Representatives voted "present", rather than give a vote for or against. By a 126 to 108 vote to replace Dyer, the House seated a Democrat, [[Michael Joseph Gill|Michael J. Gill]], who took the oath of office.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' (June 20, 1914), "Ballot Frauds Cost Seat"&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill served in the House from June 19, 1914, until March 3, 1915.  He was defeated by Dyer in the 1914 elections.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress,'' [http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000190 Gill, Michael Joseph, (1864–1918)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rep. Dyer's voted 1556 times out of 2,035 Congressional roll calls.  He missed voting 482 times, or 28%, in the Congressional time frame starting on April 5, 1911, and ending on March 1, 1933.&lt;ref name="Leonidas Dyer Elected Positions"/&gt; The two time periods when Rep. Dyer missed voting 80% of the time were April–June 1912, and October–December 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Govtrac.us, [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=403694&amp;tab=votes "Leonidas Dyer Missing Votes"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement from public office==
Dyer ran unsuccessfully for reelection in 1932, 1934 and 1936, during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="bioguide.congress.gov"/&gt; Black voters had been disappointed that the Republicans had failed to deliver on their promise to pass an anti-lynching law, part of the national platform in 1920,&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt; and by President [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]]'s approach to dealing with economic problems. The administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] attracted many voters to Democratic candidates because he was putting people to work through the [[Works Progress Administration]] and providing social aid programs.

After three successive defeats, Dyer retired from politics and returned to private law practice as an attorney.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt;

==Death==
Dyer died in [[St. Louis|Saint Louis, Missouri]] on December 15, 1957, at the age of 86.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;"Ex-Rep. Dyer Dies at 86 in St. Louis", ''The Los Angeles Times'' (Dec 17, 1957), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Dyer was buried in the Oak Grove Cemetery in Saint Louis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12141068 Find a Grave] (2005), ''Leonidas Carstarphen Dyer''&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lingam''' ([[Sanskrit]]: लिङ्गम्, {{IAST3|liGga}}, lit. "sign, symbol or mark"), sometimes referred to as ''linga'' or ''Shiva linga'', is an abstract or [[Aniconism|aniconic]] representation of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity [[Shiva]] in [[Shaivism]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; It is a votary symbol  revered in [[Hindu temple|temples]], smaller shrines, or as [[Swayambhu|self-manifested]] natural objects.&lt;ref name=doh&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=W.J.|title=A dictionary of Hinduism|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780191726705|edition=1st|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198610250.001.0001/acref-9780198610250-e-1458|accessdate=5 January 2016|subscription=yes}}{{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=Jeaneane|title=Hinduism : beliefs and practices|date=1997|publisher=Sussex Acad.

Lingam is additionally found in ancient Sanskrit texts with the meaning of "evidence, proof",&lt;ref name=mmw901/&gt; or in sexual context where it means the "male generative organ, [[phallus]]".&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmw901/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonnefoy1993p38"/&gt; Lingam iconography found at archaeological sites of the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia include simple cylinders set inside a ''yoni'', rounded pillars with carvings such as of one or more ''mukha'' (faces), and anatomically realistic representations of an erect phallus such as at [[Gudimallam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

Lingam, states Monier Monier-Williams, appears in the Upanishads and epic literature, and it means a "mark, sign, emblem, characteristic".&lt;ref name=mmw901&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0901-lAvaNaka.jpg Linga], Monier Monier-Williams, Harvard University Archives, pp. 901-[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0902-liGgakAraNavAda.jpg 902]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lochtefeld390/&gt; Other contextual meanings of the term include "evidence, proof, symptom",&lt;ref name=mmw901/&gt; and "gender, male organ, phallus".&lt;ref name=mmw901/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonnefoy1993p38"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yves Bonnefoy|title=Asian Mythologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4I-FsZCzJEC |year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-06456-7|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also appears in early Indian texts on logic, where an inference is based on a sign (linga), such as "if there is smoke, there is fire" where the linga is the smoke.&lt;ref name=mmw901/&gt; According to James Lochtefeld, it is sometimes "simplistically called a phallic symbol".&lt;ref name=lochtefeld390/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliade332/&gt;&lt;ref name=dasgupta107/&gt; It is a religious symbol in Hinduism representing Shiva as the generative power,&lt;ref name=lochtefeld390&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

The lingam of the [[Shaivism]] tradition is a short cylindrical pillar-like symbol of Shiva, made of stone, metal, gem, wood, clay or disposable material.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/342336/lingam |title= lingam|year =2010|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rao1993p76"/&gt; According to ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', the lingam is a votary aniconic object found in the sanctum of Shiva temples and private shrines that symbolizes [[Shiva]] and is "revered as an emblem of generative power".&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; It often is found within a lipped, disked structure that is an emblem of goddess [[Shakti]] and this is called the ''yoni''. Together they symbolize the union of the feminine and the masculine principles, and "the totality of all existence", states ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; 

According to Rohit Dasgupta, the lingam symbolizes Shiva in Hinduism, and it is also a phallic symbol.&lt;ref name=dasgupta107/&gt; Since the 19th-century, states Dasgupta, the popular literature has represented the lingam as the male sex organ. This view contrasts with the traditional abstract values they represent in Shaivism wherein the lingam-yoni connote the masculine and feminine principles in the entirety of creation and all existence.&lt;ref name=dasgupta107/&gt; According to Wendy Doniger, for many Hindus, the lingam is not a "male sexual organ" but of a spiritual icon and their faith, just like for the Christians the cross is not an "instrument of execution" but a symbol of Christ and the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=503|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, "the cross is thus a sign both of Christ himself and of the faith of Christians. In ceremonial usage, making a sign of the cross may be, according to the context, an act of profession of faith, a prayer, a dedication, or a benediction."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/cross-religious-symbol Cross, religious symbol], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Alex Wayman, given the Shaiva philosophical texts and spiritual interpretations, various works on Shaivism by some Indian authors "deny that the linga is a phallus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alex Wayman| title=O, that Linga!|year = 1987|volume=68|issue=1/4| journal=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute| page=30}}, Quote: "That is why today one will read in various works by Indian on Saivism a denial that the linga is a phallus; and the late Dr. Basham once told the present writer that in all the years of his India contacts he never found any Saivite admitting that the linga is a phallus."&lt;/ref&gt; To the Shaivites, a linga is neither a phallus nor do they practice the worship of erotic penis-vulva, rather the linga-yoni is a symbol of cosmic mysteries, the creative powers and the metaphor for the spiritual truths of their faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alex Wayman| title=O, that Linga!|year = 1987|volume=68|issue=1/4| journal=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute| pages=29-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, the lingam signifies three perfections of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=sivaya subramuniyaswami|title=Dancing with Siva|year=2001|publisher=Himalayan Academy|location=USA|isbn=0945497970|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/dancing-with-siva/web/ch02_01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=September 2018}} The upper oval part of the Shivalingam represent [[Parashiva]] and lower part of the Shivalingam called the pitha represents [[Parashakti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=sivaya subramuniyaswami|title=Dancing with Siva|year=2001|publisher=Himalayan Academy|location=USA|isbn=0945497970|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/dancing-with-siva/web/r7_14.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=September 2018}} In [[Parashiva]] perfection, Shiva is the absolute reality, the timeless, formless and spaceless.

According to Nagendra Singh, some believe linga-worship was a feature of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Indian religion.&lt;ref name=nksingh&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Nagendra Kr.|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism|date=1997|publisher=Centre for International Religious Studies|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788174881687|page=1567|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVyPg9osxG8C&amp;pg=PA1567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeology and Indus valley===
According to Chakrabarti, "some of the stones found in Mohenjodaro are unmistakably phallic stones". These are dated to some time before 2300 BCE. Similarly, states Chakrabarti, the Kalibangan site of Harappa has a small terracotta representation that "would undoubtedly be considered the replica of a modern Shivlinga [a tubular stone]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDAlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39|title=Hindu Images and Their Worship with Special Reference to Vaisnavism: A Philosophical-theological Inquiry|last=Lipner|first=Julius J.|authorlink=Julius J.

Another postage stamp sized item found and called the ''Pashupati seal'', states Doniger, has an image with a general resemblance with Shiva and "the Indus people may well have created the symbolism of the divine phallus", but given the available evidence we cannot be certain, nor do we know that it had the same meaning as some currently project them to might have meant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=485-502|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Indologist [[Asko Parpola]], "it is true that Marshall's and Mackay's hypotheses of linga and yoni worship by the Harappans has rested on rather slender grounds, and that for instance the interpretation of the so-called ring-stones as yonis seems untenable".&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt; He quotes Dales 1984 paper, which states "with the single exception of the unidentified photography of a realistic phallic object in Marshall's report, there is no archaeological evidence to support claims of special sexually-oriented aspects of Harappan religion".&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt; However, adds Parpola, a re-examination at Indus Valley sites suggest that the Mackay's hypothesis cannot be ruled out because erotic and sexual scenes such as ithyphallic males, naked females, a human couple having intercourse and trefoil imprints have now been identified at the Harappan sites.&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt; The "finely polished circular stand" found by Mackay may be yoni although it was found without the linga. The absence of linga, states Parpola, maybe because it was made from wood which did not survive.&lt;ref name=aparpola1985/&gt;

===Mahabharata===
According to Doniger, the ''Mahabharata'' is the first ancient Hindu text where the ''lingam'' is "unequivocally designating the sexual organ of Shiva".&lt;ref name=doniger491/&gt; Chapter 10.17 of the ''Mahabharata'' also refers to the word ''sthanu'' in the sense of an "inanimate pillar" as well as a "name of Shiva, signifying the immobile, ascetic, desexualized form of the ''lingam''", as it recites the legend involving [[Shiva]], [[Brahma]] and [[Prajapati]].&lt;ref name=doniger491/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=Freud's Mahabharata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hhnDwAAQBAJ |year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-087834-4|pages=123-124, footnote 179}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mythology weaves two polarities, one where the lingam represents the potentially procreative phallus (fertile lingam) and its opposite "a pillar-like renouncer of sexuality" (ascetic lingam), states Doniger.&lt;ref name=doniger491/&gt;

===Puranas===
The ''[[Shiva Purana]]'' describes the origin of the lingam, known as Shiva-linga, as the beginning-less and endless cosmic pillar (''[[Stambha]]'') of fire, the cause of all causes.&lt;ref name="Chaturvedi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaturvedi|title=Shiv Purana|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|isbn=978-81-7182-721-3|pages=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bchgql0em9YC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=shiva+purana#v=onepage&amp;q=column&amp;f=false|edition=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Shiva is pictured as emerging from the lingam{{snd}}the cosmic pillar of fire{{snd}}proving his superiority over the gods [[Brahma]] and [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="british museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/s/stone_statue_of_shiva_as_lingo.aspx|title=Stone statue of Shiva as Lingodbhava|last=Blurton|first=T.

There is persuasive evidence in later Sanskrit literature, according to Doniger, that the early Indians associated the lingam icon with the male sexual organ.&lt;ref name=doniger493&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=493-498|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 11th-century Kashmir text ''Narmamala'' by Kshemendra on satire and fiction writing explains his ideas on parallelism with divine lingam and human lingam in a sexual context. Various Shaiva texts, such as the ''Skanda Purana'' in section 1.8 states that all creatures have the signs of Shiva or Shakti through their ''lingam'' (male sexual organ) or ''pindi'' (female sexual organ).&lt;ref name=doniger493/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

A part of the literature corpus regards ''lingam'' to be sexual and the phallus of Shiva, while another group of texts does not. Sexuality in the former is inherently sacred and spiritual, while the latter emphasizes the ascetic nature of Shiva and renunciation to be spiritual symbolism of ''lingam''. This tension between the pursuit of spirituality through householder lifestyle and the pursuit of renunciate sannyasi lifestyle is historic, reflects the different interpretations of the lingam and what lingam worship means to its devotees. It remains a continuing debate within Hinduism to this day, states Doniger.&lt;ref name=doniger493/&gt; To one group, it is a part of Shiva's body and symbolically ''saguna'' Shiva (he in a physical form with attributes). To the other group, it is an abstract symbol of ''nirguna'' Shiva (he in the universal Absolute Reality, formless, without attributes).&lt;ref name=doniger493/&gt; In Tamil Shaiva tradition, for example, the common term for lingam is ''kuRi'' or "sign, mark" which is nonsexual.&lt;ref name=doniger493/&gt; Similarly, in [[Lingayatism]] tradition, the lingam is a spiritual symbol and "was never said to have any sexual connotations", according to Doniger.&lt;ref name=donigerp498/&gt; To some Shaivites, it symbolizes the axis of the universe.&lt;ref name="Bayly2003p55"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Bayly|title=Saints, Goddesses and Kings: Muslims and Christians in South Indian Society, 1700-1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fxqtx8SflEsC|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89103-5|pages=129–130 with footnote 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Linga also appears in Buddhist and Jaina literature, where it means "sign, evidence" in one context, or "subtle body" with sexual connotations in another.&lt;ref name=wayman1987&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alex Wayman| title=O, that Linga!|year = 1987|volume=68|issue=1/4| journal=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute| pages=17, 22-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Examples of this usage include the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra|Lankavatara sutra]]'' in Buddhism, and Sukhlalji's ''bhasya'' on ''[[Tattvarthasutra|Tattvartha sutra]]'' in Jainism.&lt;ref name=wayman1987/&gt;}}

===Muslim rule===
After the 11th-century invasion of the subcontinent by Islamic armies, the iconoclast Muslims considered the lingam to be idolatrous representations of the male sexual organ. They took pride in destroying as many lingams and Shiva temples as they could, reusing them to build steps for mosques, in a region stretching from Somanath (Gujarat) to Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh) to Chidambaram (Tamil Nadu), states Doniger.&lt;ref name=donigerp498&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=498-499|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mehrdad Shokoohy|title=Muslim Architecture of South India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=InklyjG57csC&amp;pg=PA17 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-49984-5|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalist literature===
The colonial era Orientalists and Christian missionaries, raised in the Victorian mold where sex and sexual imagery were a taboo subject, were shocked by and were hostile to the lingam-yoni iconography and reverence they witnessed.&lt;ref name=dasgupta107&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Penis|page=107| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bHytBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107 |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield|author= Rohit Dasgupta| editor=Michael Kimmel, Christine Milrod, Amanda Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas T.

The British in general, who were of course Victorian in every sense of the word, regarded the Hindus, as they regarded most colonized people of color, as simultaneously oversexed and impotent, and the British presence had a negative effect on the self-perception that Hindus had of their own bodies (Nandy 1983). For, still reeling from the onslaught of the Muslim campaigns against lingams, the Hindus who worked with and for the British internalized their colonizers' scorn."&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th and early 20th-century colonial and missionary literature described lingam-yoni, and related theology as obscene, corrupt, licentious, hyper-sexualized, puerile, impure, demonic and a culture that had become too feminine and dissolute.&lt;ref name=dasgupta107/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramos2017p56"&gt;{{cite book|author=Imma Ramos|title=Pilgrimage and Politics in Colonial Bengal: The Myth of the Goddess Sati|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRhdDgAAQBAJ |year=2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-84000-2|pages=56–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh B.

Vivekananda called for the revival of the Mother Goddess as a feminine force, inviting his countrymen to "proclaim her to all the world with the voice of peace and benediction".&lt;ref name="Ramos2017p56"/&gt;

According to Wendy Doniger, the terms lingam and yoni became explicitly associated with human sexual organs in the western imagination after the widely popular first ''Kamasutra'' translation by Sir Richard Burton in 1883.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500/&gt; In his translation, even though the original Sanskrit text does not use the words lingam or yoni for sexual organs, and almost always uses other terms, Burton adroitly avoided been viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by avoiding the use of words such as penis, vulva, vagina and other direct or indirect sexual terms in the Sanskrit text to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500/&gt; This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to "anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away."&lt;ref name=doniger2011p500&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=500-502|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar Orientalist literature of the Christian missionaries and the British era, states Doniger, stripped all spiritual meanings and insisted on the Victorian vulgar interpretation only, which had "a negative effect on the self-perception that Hindus had of their own bodies" and they became "ashamed of the more sensual aspects of their own religious literature".&lt;ref name=doniger2011p505&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wendy Doniger| title= God's Body, or, The Lingam Made Flesh: Conflicts over the Representation of the Sexual Body of the Hindu God Shiva| journal= Social Research|volume =78| number=2|year= 2011|publisher=  The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=499-505|jstor=23347187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary Hindus, states Doniger, in their passion to spiritualize Hinduism and for their Hindutva campaign have sought to sanitize the historic earthly sexual meanings, and insist on the abstract spiritual meaning only.&lt;ref name=doniger2011p505/&gt;

==Iconography and worship==
The traditional lingam rituals in major Shiva temples includes offerings of flowers, grass, dried rice, fruits, leaves, water and a milk bath.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Priests chant hymns, while the devotees go the sanctum for a ''[[darshana]]'' followed by a clockwise circumambulation of the sanctum.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; On the sanctum walls, typically are reliefs of Dakshinamurti, Brahma and Vishnu. Often, near the sanctum are other shrines, particularly for Shakti (Durga), Ganesha and Murugan (Kartikeya). In the Hindu tradition, special pilgrimage sites include those where natural lingams are found in the form of cylindrical rocks or ice or rocky hill. These are called ''Svayambhuva'' lingam, and about 70 of these are known on the Indian subcontinent, the most significant being one in Kashi ([[Varanasi]]) followed by Prayaga, Naimisha and Gaya.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rao1993p81"&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

According to [[Shaiva Siddhanta]], the linga is the ideal substrate in which the worshipper should install and worship the five-faced and ten-armed Sadāśiva, the form of Shiva who is the focal divinity of that school of Shaivism.&lt;ref name="GoodallEtAl"&gt;Dominic Goodall, Nibedita Rout, R.

==The principles==

Littlewood stated the principles in his 1944 ''Lectures on the Theory of Functions''
&lt;ref&gt;

{{quote|There are three principles, roughly expressible in the following terms: Every ([[measurable set|measurable]]) set is nearly a finite sum of intervals; every function (of class ''L''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;) is nearly [[Continuous function|continuous]]; every [[Limit of a sequence|convergent]] sequence of functions is nearly [[uniformly convergent]].}}

The first principle is based on the fact that the [[inner measure]] and [[outer measure]] are equal for measurable sets, the second is based on [[Lusin's theorem]], and the third is based on [[Egorov's theorem]].

==Example==

Littlewood's three principles are quoted in several real analysis texts, for example Royden,&lt;ref name="Royden"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Royden&lt;ref&gt;Royden (1988), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; gives the [[bounded convergence theorem]] as an application of the third principle. The theorem states that if a uniformly bounded sequence of functions converges pointwise, then their integrals on a set of finite measure converge to the integral of the limit function. If the convergence were uniform this would be a trivial result, and Littlewood's third principle tells us that the convergence is almost uniform, that is, uniform outside of a set of arbitrarily small measure. Because the sequence is bounded, the contribution to the integrals of the small set can be made arbitrarily small, and the integrals on the remainder converge because the functions are uniformly convergent there.

[[File:Modus ponens logical form.jpg|thumb|This logical argument utilizing [[modus ponens]] makes use of three statements in logical form expressed in simplified English.]]
{{Hatnote|This article is about the term as used in logic. For the linguistics term, see [[Logical form (linguistics)]].}}
{{Redirect|Argument structure|the possible complements of a verb in linguistics|verb argument}}
In  [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]], a '''logical form''' of a [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic]] expression is a precisely-specified [[Semantics|semantic]] version of that expression in a [[formal system]]. Informally, the logical form attempts to formalize a possibly [[Ambiguity (syntax)|ambiguous]] statement into a statement with a precise, unambiguous logical interpretation with respect to a formal system. In an ideal [[formal language]], the meaning of a logical form can be determined unambiguously from [[syntax]] alone. Logical forms are semantic, not syntactic constructs; therefore, there may be more than one [[string (computer science)|string]] that represents the same logical form in a given language.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, CUP 1999, pp. 511–512&lt;/ref&gt;

The logical form of an [[argument]] is called the '''argument form''' or ''test form'' of the argument.

==History==
The importance of the concept of form to logic was already recognized in ancient times. [[Aristotle]], in the [[Prior Analytics]], was probably the first to employ variable letters to represent valid inferences. Therefore, [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]] claims that the introduction of variables was 'one of Aristotle's greatest inventions'.

According to the followers of Aristotle like [[Ammonius Hermiae|Ammonius]], only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, and not those given in concrete terms.  The concrete terms ''man'', ''mortal'', etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders 'A', 'B', 'C', which were called the 'matter' (Greek ''hyle'', Latin ''materia'') of the argument.

The term "logical form" itself was introduced by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1914, in the context of his program to formalize natural language and reasoning, which he called [[philosophical logic]]. Russell wrote: "Some kind of knowledge of logical forms, though with most people it is not explicit, is involved in all understanding of discourse. It is the business of philosophical logic to extract this knowledge from its concrete integuments, and to render it explicit and pure."
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SsY9g_DDA9MC&amp;pg=PA53 Russell, Bertrand. 1914(1993). Our Knowledge of the External World: as a field for scientific method in philosophy. New York: Routledge. p. 53]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PreyerPeter2002"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Gerhard Preyer |editor2=Georg Peter |title=Logical form and language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ioVFUN8yd9QC&amp;pg=PA54 |year=2002 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-924555-0 |page=54 |chapter=What is logical form? |author=Ernie Lepore |author2=Kirk Ludwig}} [http://www.indiana.edu/~socrates/papers/What%20is%20Logical%20Form.pdf preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of argument form ==
To demonstrate the important notion of the ''form'' of an argument, substitute letters for similar items throughout the sentences in the original argument.
;Original argument
:All humans are mortal.
:Socrates is human.
:Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
;Argument form
:All ''H'' are ''M''.
:''S'' is ''H''.
:Therefore, ''S'' is ''M''.

All we have done in the ''Argument form'' is to put 'H' for 'human' and 'humans', 'M' for 'mortal', and 'S' for 'Socrates'; what results is the ''form'' of the original argument. Moreover, each individual sentence of the ''Argument form'' is the ''sentence form'' of its respective sentence in the original argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurley|first=Patrick J.|title=A concise introduction to logic|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|location=Belmont, Calif.|year=1988|isbn=0-534-08928-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of argument form==
Attention is given to argument and sentence form, because ''form is what makes an argument [[Validity (logic)|valid]] or [[cogency|cogent]]''. All logical form arguments are either inductive or deductive. Inductive logical forms include inductive generalization, statistical arguments, causal argument, and arguments from analogy. Common deductive argument forms are hypothetical syllogism, categorical syllogism, argument by definition, argument based on mathematics, argument from definition. The most reliable forms of logic are [[modus ponens]], [[modus tollens]], and chain arguments because if the premises of the argument are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Bassham, Gregory | title=Critical thinking : a student's introduction | publication-date=2012 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | edition=5th | isbn=978-0-07-803831-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two invalid argument forms are [[affirming the consequent]] and [[denying the antecedent]]. 

;Affirming the consequent
:All dogs are animals.
:Coco is an animal.
:Therefore, Coco is a dog.

;Denying the antecedent
:All cats are animals.
:Missy is not a cat.
:Therefore, Missy is not an animal.

A logical [[argument]], seen as an [[ordered set]] of sentences, has a logical form that [[compositionality|derives]] from the form of its constituent sentences; the logical form of an argument is sometimes called argument form.&lt;ref name="BeallBeall2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

It consists of stripping out all spurious grammatical features from the sentence (such as gender, and passive forms), and replacing all the expressions specific to ''the subject matter'' of the argument by [[schematic variable]]s.  Thus, for example, the expression 'all A's are B's' shows the logical form which is common to the sentences 'all men are mortals', 'all cats are carnivores', 'all Greeks are philosophers' and so on.

==Logical form in modern logic==

The fundamental difference between modern formal logic and traditional, or Aristotelian logic, lies in their differing analysis of the logical form of the sentences they treat:  
*On the traditional view, the form of the sentence consists of (1) a subject (e.g., "man") plus a sign of quantity ("all" or "some" or "no"); (2) the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], which is of the form "is" or "is not"; (3) a predicate (e.g., "mortal"). Thus: 'all men are mortal'. The logical constants such as "all", "no" and so on, plus sentential connectives such as "and" and "or" were called [[syncategorematic]] terms (from the Greek ''kategorei'' – to predicate, and ''syn'' – together with). This is a fixed scheme, where each judgment has a specific quantity and copula, determining the logical form of the sentence. 
*The modern view is more complex, since a single judgement of Aristotle's system involves two or more logical connectives. For example, the sentence "All men are mortal" involves, in term logic, two non-logical terms "is a man" (here ''M'') and "is mortal" (here ''D''): the sentence is given by the judgement ''A(M,D)''. In [[predicate logic]], the sentence involves the same two non-logical concepts, here analyzed as &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and the sentence is given by &lt;math&gt;\forall x. (m(x) \rightarrow d(x))&lt;/math&gt;, involving the logical connectives for [[universal quantification]] and [[material conditional|implication]]. 

The more complex modern view comes with more power. On the modern view, the fundamental form of a simple sentence is given by a recursive schema, like natural language and involving [[logical connective]]s, which are joined by juxtaposition to other sentences, which in turn may have logical structure. Medieval logicians recognized the [[problem of multiple generality]], where Aristotelian logic is unable to satisfactorily render such sentences as "Some guys have all the luck", because both quantities "all" and "some" may be relevant in an inference, but the fixed scheme that Aristotle used allows only one to govern the inference. Just as linguists recognize recursive structure in natural languages, it appears that logic needs recursive structure.

[[File:Decree of Pixodaros.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Decree of [[Pixodaros]]'' in the Lycian script]]

The '''Lycian alphabet''' was used to write the [[Lycian language]]. It was an extension of the Greek alphabet, with half a dozen additional letters for sounds not found in Greek. It was largely similar to the [[Lydian alphabet|Lydian]] and the [[Phrygian alphabet]]s.

==The alphabet==

The Lycian alphabet&lt;ref&gt;Adiego (2007) page 764.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1986) pages 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt; contains letters for 29 sounds. Some sounds are represented by more than one symbol, which is considered one "letter". There are six vowel letters, one for each of the four oral vowels of Lycian, and separate letters for two of the four nasal vowels. Nine of the Lycian letters do not appear to derive from the Greek alphabet.

The word '''magnificence''' comes from the Latin “magnum facere”, which means to do something great. The Latin word draws on the Greek “megaloprépeia”. This noun conveys the meaning of doing something great which is fitting or seemly to the circumstance. Magnificence is a philosophical, aesthetic and socio-economic notion deeply rooted in Western culture since [[classical antiquity]]. It regards the greatness of actions, courage, excellence, honour, generosity, and splendour of lifestyles of noble purposes.

==Magnificence in Classical Antiquity==

===Plato===
[[Plato]] offered the first philosophical interpretation of the concept of magnificence. He separated ''megalopsychía'' ([[magnanimity]]) from ''megaloprépeia'' (magnificence), which had been synonymous in [[archaic Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;John Cook Wilson. “Μεγαλοπρεπεια and μεγαλοψυχια”, ''Arist. Classical Review'', 4, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Gauthier, ''Magnanimité. L’idéal de la grandeur dans la philosophie païenne et dans la théologie chrétienne''. Bibliothèque thomiste, XXVIII, Paris: Vrin, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnificence is the special quality in Plato's conception of the [[philosopher-king]], as presented in the fifth and sixth books of [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']]. Only those with a philosophical and educational temperament understand the difference between good and evil. The philosopher is magnificent, gracious, the friend of truth, justice, courage and temperance, has an excellent memory, and learns easily (487 a2-8).&lt;ref&gt;Linda Rabieh. Plato and the virtue of courage. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006: 155.&lt;/ref&gt; When perfected by age and education this magnificent being is the type of person to whom the state must be entrusted.

===Herodotus and Xenophon===
The historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]] proposed a social and economic interpretation of magnificence. They used the term to describe the donation of private money and property to support public works or communal needs. In [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[History of the Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] societies this was a widespread custom. Affluent citizens holding public positions were expected to use their own money for a wide range of activities which were deemed important by their communities.

In the [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']], Herodotus gives various examples of magnificence, such as that of [[Polycrates]] (3, 123, 1); the [[Scythian]]s' magnificent festivity of the goddess [[Cybele]] (4, 7, 3); [[Amyntas I of Macedon|Amyntas]]'s invitation to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] to feast and be entertained by him with great generosity and displays of friendship (5, 18); [[Clisthenes]]'s sumptuous treatment of his daughter's suitors when seeking a good marriage for her (6, 128).

Xenophon, in his treatise ''[[Oeconomicus]]'' introduces magnificence within the meaning of wealth and social obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Cozzo, ''Le passioni economiche nella Grecia antica'', Palermo, Sellerio, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the phenomenon of [[evergetism]] (as outlined by [[Paul Veyne]]), affluent citizens are called upon to offer many costly sacrifices such as building all sorts of public works, such as fortifications, war boats, temples, or amphitheatres; supplying an army with all the equipment and provisions it needed; offering entertainment and shows; hosting prominent foreign guests and regaling them with lavish hospitality. Even fellow-citizens must be plied by them with all sorts of nice things. Magnificence is thus connected with liberality, high lifestyles, and wealth. [[Critobulus]], says [[Socrates]] in the dialogue, is called upon to be magnificent in order to live up to his reputation as an affluent citizen. All these deeds give public honour to the wealthy citizens and the entire city. Xenophon extends magnificence to women.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]], “Magnificenza e mondo classico”. ''Ágalma. Rivista di studi culturali e di estetica'', 5: 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Mania, the widow of Zenis, the governor of [[Aeolis]], not only convinced the Persian satrap Pharnabazus to appoint her as the new governess, but excelled in her military, political and economic duties, never lacking in magnificence whenever it was required (''[[Hellenica#Xenophon's Hellenica|Hellenica]]'', III, 10-13).

===Aristotle===
In his ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'' and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] offers a philosophical, [[ethical]], and [[aesthetic]] interpretation of magnificence which exerted an extensive influence throughout the following centuries.

In the fourth book of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'', magnificence is described as the ethical virtue linked to money: "it is a fitting expenditure involving largeness of scale" (IV, 2, 1122a 23). However, Aristotle insists that the type of expenditure must be appropriate to the circumstance. Hence, not every type of action requires the same degree of expense. Thus, Aristotle, like Plato, consolidates the separation of the virtues of magnificence and magnanimity. Drawing on Xenophon, however, he dignifies the economic aspect of a great expenditure by turning it into an ethical virtue.

With Aristotle, magnificence also acquires an aesthetic dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah F. Maclaren,  “Magnificenza e mondo classico”. ''Ágalma. Rivista di studi culturali e di estetica'', 5: 2003: 43&lt;/ref&gt; It becomes an art in itself, requiring that one understands what type of expenditure is needed and does so tastefully. A magnificent man knows that the expenditure should be large, but appropriate to who is actually spending, the circumstance, and the object of the expense. The Aristotle scholar [[W. D. Ross]] suggested that in this conception magnificence turns out to be mainly a matter of aesthetic good taste.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross, Aristotle. (1923). New introduction. London: Routledge, 1995, 6th edition: 144&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic role that magnificence acquired with Aristotle exerted a profound influence on [[rhetoric]], the arts, [[architecture]] and [[art criticism]].

===Cicero and Rome===
[[Cicero]] introduced the ethic of magnificence to [[ancient Roman]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] civilization. In his youthful work on rhetoric, ''[[De inventione]]'', he writes that magnificence is "the consideration and management of important and sublime matters with a certain wide seeing and splendid determination of mind" (II, Liv, 163). Thus Cicero fused the Greek and Roman traditions, transforming the Greek view of magnificence into a Roman concept. The Latin word ''magnificentia'' comes from the expression ''magnum facere'', which literally means "to do something great". In Cicero's formulation, it refers to the greatness of the task, the intention to realize it, and the determination to carry it through. Cicero’s seminal interpretation of magnificence influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiæ]]'' over a thousand years later.

===Magnificence in Ancient Rome===
Magnificence took on very Roman characteristics. In ancient Rome, it is a [[Res publica|public]] phenomenon connected to the institutions, political power and the Roman state. The magnificence of the buildings, roads,  public buildings and festivals was under the control of the [[aedile]]s. Furthermore, magnificence has nothing to do with [[wikt:luxury|luxury]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]], “Lusso, spreco, magnificenza”, ''Ágalma. Rivista di studi culturali e di estetica'', 2, 2002: 43-62&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it reflects a system of [[Roman Republic|republican]] values and [[Virtus (virtue)|virtues]] embraced by the traditionalist Roman oligarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Emanuele Narducci, ''Modelli etici e società. Un’idea di Cicerone'', Pisa, Giardini, 1989: 226-265&lt;/ref&gt; When Cicero claims that "the Roman people loathe private luxury (''luxuriam'') but they love public magnificence (''magnificentiam'')" (''Pro Murena'', 76), he is making an explicit reference to a political system which was being undermined by a new generation of politicians. Whereas luxury represented the use of wealth to serve personal satisfaction, magnificence rested on traditional republican values based on respect for an appropriate relationship between private and public life.

===Rhetoric, Demetrius and art criticism===
In classical rhetoric, magnificence is one of the models of the [[Grand style (rhetoric)|grand]] or elevated style. However the most important work on magnificence in the classical world is ''On Style'' (''Perì hermēnēías'') written by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]] probably in the first century B.C. Demetrius gives a technical description of the typical features of the elevated style.&lt;ref&gt;Demetrius. ''On style''. Translated by William Rhys Roberts, 1902&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Thucydides]] and the poet [[Sappho]] are presented as the leading exponents of this style. Demetrius’s treatise did not gain the same success as [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]’s ''[[On the Sublime]]''. Although magnificence and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] both belong to the grand style, there are significant differences between them. Magnificence insists more on formal correctness and stylistic [[Gravitas|solemnity]]. Whereas the sublime inspires awe, veneration, loss of rationality, ecstasy and [[pathos]], the magnificent aims to impress without causing fear or indignation.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Schenkeveld,  ''Studies in Demetrius On Style''. Amsterdam: Adolf M. Hakkert: 1964: 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand style of magnificence also entered terminological discourse of ancient Greek art criticism. Indeed, the Greeks drew on rhetorical terminology to describe and evaluate sculpture, painting and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome J. Pollitt, ''The Ancient View of Greek Art: Criticism, History and Terminology''. New Haven-London: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Magnificence is applied to works of art which express grandeur and other lofty features.

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the grand style of magnificence can be appreciated in works such as the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue of Zeus]] by [[Phidias]] and [[Zeuxis]]’s painting of Zeus enthroned.

===Vitruvius and the magnificence of Roman architecture===
In his monumental ''[[De architectura]]'', [[Vitruvius]] analyzed both the artistic-aesthetic and the philosophical-ethical aspects of the concept and enshrined magnificence in [[classical architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]],  “Magnificenza e mondo classico.” Agalma 5 (2003): 113-125&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixth book, Vitruvius argues that the client (public or private) is magnificent, because the beauty of a building depends on its cost (6, 8, 9). The materials employed should be of the best quality and the most beautiful, which means that they are usually the most expensive. Thus, for Vitruvius magnificence is not only a typical artistic and aesthetic feature of architecture, but is also connected to the social and political [[Auctoritas|prestige]] of the client. Architecture becomes the means by which a public or private sponsor of a building can display his [[Dignitas (Roman concept)|honour]].

It is no surprise that ancient Romans granted such importance to public architecture: even the ancient historians and geographers celebrated the Romans’ ability to create buildings that were not only useful, but also beautiful and magnificent. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] states that the three greatest examples of magnificent Roman architecture were the [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], the [[Roman roads|roads]] and the [[Cloaca Maxima|sewage system]] (''Roman Antiquities'' 3, 67, 5). [[Strabo]] (''[[Geographica]]'', V, 3, 8) and [[Livy]] (''[[Ab urbe condita libri|History of Rome]]'', 1, 38, 5-6; 39; 44) celebrate the hygienic functions of the aqueducts and the ''cloacae''. Pliny the Elder provides a moving description of the engineering skills used to rebuild Rome's great sewage system, the  ''Cloaca Maxima'', which is still in use today (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 36, 104-105).

==Magnificence in the Middle Ages==

===Thomas Aquinas===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] left one of the most significant [[mediaeval]] interpretations of the concept of magnificence, drawing on the Graeco-Roman tradition and blending it with [[Christian]] precepts. He brings together the pagan idea of human magnificence with the [[Christianity and Judaism|Jewish-Christian]] mentality, according to which mankind should always be reverent towards God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]],  ''La magnificenza e il suo doppio. Il pensiero estetico di Giovanni Battista Piranesi''. Milan: Mimesis 2005: 9-12&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'' magnificence is a virtue that belongs to God, which can also be shared by men (''Summa'', IIa IIae q. 134 art. 1). Aquinas adopts Cicero’s definition of magnificence, highlighting how it consists in doing great things. Magnificence belongs to the virtue of fortitude, or courage, because it regards the undertaking of great things and actions, and persevering even when circumstances can make their realization arduous (''Summa'', IIa IIae q. 134 art. 1-4).

===Dante Alighieri===
[[Dante]], drawing on Aquinas, regards magnificence as a divine virtue connected to God’s grandeur and perfection.  Then, following the traditions of Aristotle and Aquinas, Dante classifies magnificence as the fourth virtue "which regulates great expenditures, in administering them and setting limits to their size" (''[[Convivio]]'' IV, XVII, 5).

With the advent of the [[Renaissance Italy|Renaissance in Italy]], magnificence underwent a deep transformation, drawing on this cultural movement which supported the rebirth of both classical culture and urban centres. The idea of magnificence and its representation had profound implications for Renaissance society in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]], ''La magnificenza e il suo doppio. Il pensiero estetico di Giovanni Battista Piranesi''. Milan: Mimesis, 2005 13-23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnificence as a civic virtue===
Magnificence acquires new vitality within the process of renewal of Italian cities as cultural and political centres. Magnificence thus reflects the transformation of traditional political structures and epitomizes the flourishing of a new type of civic culture based on virtues which diverged from the previous [[feudal]] values. A novel idea of human excellence emerged which was seen as distinct from the medieval aristocratic privileges connected to birth and rank. [[Marsilio Ficino]] in his work ''De virtutibus morabilus'' (1457) claims magnificence is the virtue par excellence, because it expresses God’s greatness. [[Cristoforo Landino]] in ''De vera nobilitate'' (1487) describes magnificence as an aspect of fortitude. The new idea of nobility emphasizes deeds and works realized by men whose behaviour is primarily governed by the cultivation of such virtues, rather than merely by noble blood and aristocratic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Teresa Liaci, Ed. ''Cristoforo Landino. De vera nobilitate''. Florence: Olschki, 1970: 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnificence and patronage in Renaissance Italy===
By the first half of the 15th century, magnificence had already become a well-known and highly practiced virtue in [[Renaissance]] Italy. It concerned the custom of wealthy citizens spending large sums of money on building projects and to [[patronage]] of architecture and the arts. In Florence, [[Cosimo de' Medici]] (the founder of the [[Medici]] dynasty) was actively involved in practising the virtue of magnificence from the 1430s onwards and many other ruling families and distinguished citizens followed suit all over Italy.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Fraser Jenkins, “Cosimo de’ Medici’s Patronage of Architecture and the Theory of Magnificence”, ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', 33, 1970: 162-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Howard,  “Preaching Magnificence in Renaissance Florence.” ''Renaissance Quarterly'' 61.2, (2008): 325-369.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorenzo de’ Medici]] gained the title “magnificent” due to his support to [[Renaissance humanism|humanist scholars]] and artists, establishing one of the most sophisticated courts in Italy. Magnificence regains its ancient splendour also as an aspect of works of architecture and art. The rediscovery of ancient [[rhetoric]] and the pre-eminence given to [[Vitruvius]] throughout the Renaissance influenced not only patrons’ tastes, but also those of the architects and artists who were commissioned to create magnificent masterpieces that would give fame to the both themselves and the entire town. In the ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'', [[Leon Battista Alberti]] draws on both the philosophical and aesthetic concepts of magnificence. Many Italian Renaissance architects and artists applied magnificence both in their artworks and in their writings. Antonio Averlino, known as [[Filarete]], [[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Andrea Palladio]] extolled the philosophical and aesthetic aspects of magnificence. Magnificence, however, is not only a practice engaged in by distinguished citizens, princes, popes, architects and artists, but is also analyzed by humanist scholars. In [[Naples]], the humanist and poet [[Giovanni Pontano]] wrote a philosophical and ethical treatise ''De magnificentia'' (1498). Magnificence was connected with the employment of wealth on behalf of the [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] kings and aristocracy, and their lifestyles. Pontano’s ''De magnificentia'' and his other philosophical treatises on the use of wealth and the role of the prince probably anticipated the courtier’s ethic and the doctrine of how to behave appropriately, which would find the most mature expression in 16th-century Italian literature thanks to [[Baldassare Castiglione]]’s ''[[Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528) and [[Giovanni Della Casa]]’s ''[[Il Galateo]]'' (1558).

==Magnificence in the eighteenth century==

===Giovanni Battista Piranesi===
During the 18th century Italy had become one of the main destinations of the Grand Tour visitors, who came from Northern Europe to study and admire Italian art and architecture, and also to absorb classical culture. With Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778), magnificence received one of its final interpretations in the Italian cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]],  ''La magnificenza e il suo doppio. Il pensiero estetico di Giovanni Battista Piranesi''. Milan: Mimesis, 2005: 30-45&lt;/ref&gt; Universally known as the etcher of the ''Prisons'' and the ''Views'' of Roman monuments, Piranesi was an eclectic personality, who pursued a wide range of interests. Giovanni Battista Piranesi had a prominent role within the Graeco-Roman debate. In this controversy Piranesi supported the superiority of the architects and designers of the Roman Empire and demonstrated the indigenous roots of Roman culture, arguing that the Romans had been influenced more by the Etruscans than the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;John Wilton-Ely, The Mind and Art of Giovanni Battista Piranesi. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In his polemical treatise ''Della Magnificenza ed Architettura de’ Romani'' (''Concerning the Magnificence and Architecture of the Romans'') (1761) Piranesi draws on the entire heritage of the philosophical, ethical, economic and artistic aspects of the notion. He controversially conceives magnificence as a virtue which was shared by the entire ancient Roman population. Furthermore, he argues that the Romans used the most advanced technical and hydraulic skills, and the finest materials available. They excelled in public buildings and proved they were better at them than the Greeks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2869">'''Manan''' is a name and a word with meanings in various languages.

== Gaelic ==
'''Manan''' (Man-án, also spelled Mannan) is a name with Gaelic roots. Manan is "'''a new beginning '''" or "'''morning '''", a "'''new day'''" or "'''opportunity'''". It insinuates a positive feeling towards an opportunity, or fresh start.

According to a popular legend in Irish folklore, ''"The Giant Boulder"'' - the name of the hero in the story was '''Manan'''.  '''Manan''' saved the Irish village from destruction by positioning a giant boulder blocking the sea, preventing the town's inhabitants from drowning; that village later called every clan leader by the honorary name of '''Manan''', and it stands for honor, strength, and greatness.

== Sanskrit ==
'''Manan''' ({{indic|lang=sa|indic=मनन|trans=manana|defaultipa=mənənə}}; {{indic|lang=hi|indic=मनन|trans=manan|defaultipa=mənən}}) means '''deep thought''', '''contemplation''', or '''profound reflection'''. The root of the word is '''man''' ([[Sanskrit]] मन) — the mind — i.e., the faculty that produces thoughts and feelings.

In [[Vedanta]] group of Hindu philosophical traditions (see, for instance, {{Harvnb|Paranjpe|1998|p=173}}), there are three steps to self-realization: (1) "[[Shravana (hearing)|shravana]]" i.e., careful listening to the teaching of the [[Vedanta]], (2) "'''manana'''" i.e., repeatedly and deeply reflecting on or contemplating what is learned from those teachings, and (3) "[[nididhyasana]]" i.e., becoming completely absorbed in contemplation that no other thought enters the mind.

The Sanskrit derived Manan is a relatively uncommon name given to males in India.

== Tamil ==
Mannan means "king" or "leader"
in Tamil.

== Persian ==
The name Manan can also be of Persian background and is given to males. Manan's meaning encompasses the ideas of conscience, mind, and soul.  It insinuates the qualities of thoughtfulness, sensitivity, and consideration. The name apparently also means fun-loving, naughty, and joyous as well as disciplined and righteous. A "Manan" would not agree with or appreciate wrongdoing, unmannered persons.

== Arabic ==
Manan or Mannan is a name that is also found in Islam; it's an Arabic name. Generally, this is not used alone, as it's preceded by names like Abdul etc. (Abdul Manan or Abdul Mannan, means Slave of the God), it is so because Manan is one of God's names, hence the name Abdul Manan is given.

{{Semiotics}}

In [[semiotics]], the '''meaning''' of a sign is its place in a [[sign relation]], in other words, the set of roles that it occupies within a given sign relation.  

This statement holds whether ''sign'' is taken to mean a ''sign type'' or a ''sign token''.  Defined in these global terms, the meaning of a sign is not in general analyzable with full exactness into completely localized terms, but aspects of its meaning can be given approximate analyses, and special cases of sign relations frequently admit of more local analyses.

Two aspects of meaning that may be given approximate analyses are the ''connotative relation'' and the ''denotative relation''.  The connotative relation is the relation between signs and their interpretant signs.  The denotative relation is the relation between signs and objects. An arbitrary association exists between the ''signified'' and the ''signifier.''
For example, a US salesperson doing business in [[Etiquette in Japan|Japan]] might interpret [[silence]] following an offer as rejection, while to Japanese negotiators silence means the offer is being considered. This difference in interpretations represents a difference in: semiotics

==Triadic relation==
The triadic (three part) model of the sign separates the meaning of a sign into three distinct components:

1.The representamen, which is the medium, or ‘sign vehicle’,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Summer 2013|title = Peirce's Theory of Signs|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/peirce-semiotics/|date = 2013-01-01|first = Albert|last = Atkin|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which the sign is represented. For example, this could be written/spoken words, a photograph, or a painting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Semiotics: The Basics|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|publisher = Routledge|year = 2002|isbn = 0-415-35111-1|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.The interpretant, or what is meant by the sign &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

3. The object, or that to which the sign refers &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Together, these three components generate [[semiosis]]. For example, an exclamation mark can be broken down into these components. The representamen is the exclamation mark itself, the interpretant is the idea of excitement or an elevated volume of speech, and the object is the actual excitement or elevated volume of speech to which it refers.
While it might appear that the latter two are the same, the subtle difference lies in the fact that the interpretant refers to the idea of something, and the object is the thing itself.

The representamen component of the sign can be further broken down into three categories, which are icon, index, and symbol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These denote the degree of abstraction from the object to which they refer. A symbol, which is the most abstract, does not resemble or bear any physical relation to the thing that it represents in any way. For example, a peace sign has no relation to peace aside from its social construction as a symbol that represents it. An icon is slightly less abstract, and resembles to some degree the thing that it represents, and bears some physical likeness to it. A good example of this would be a painted portrait. An index is the least arbitrary category of representamen, and has a definite physical tie to that which it represents. This could be something like a weather vane blowing in the wind indicating that it is windy out, or smoke, which indicates a fire.

The triadic model of the sign was proposed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]]. In contradistinction to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s dyadic model, which assumed no material referent, Peirce's model assumes that in order for a sign to be meaningful, it must refer to something external and cannot be self-contained, as it is for Saussure. Thus, Peirce's model includes the addition of an 'object'. The ‘representamen’ and ‘interpretant’ components of the triadic model are comparable to Saussure’s dyadic model of the sign, which breaks down into signifier and signified.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1899">The '''Michigan Leadership Studies''' were the well-known series of leadership studies that commenced at the [[University of Michigan]] in the 1950s by [[Rensis Likert]], with the objective of identifying the principles and types of leadership styles that led to greater productivity and enhanced job satisfaction among workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Boje, D. |year=2000|title=The Isles Leadership: The Voyage of the Behaviorists|work=The Leadership Box|publisher=Northern Michigan State University|url=https://business.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/338/behaviors.htm#katz_michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies identified two broad leadership styles – an employee orientation and a production orientation. They also identified three critical characteristics of effective leaders – task-oriented behavior, relationship-oriented behavior and participative leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/michigan-leadership-studies.asp | title=Michigan Leadership Studies | work=Investopedia | accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies concluded that an employee orientation rather than a production orientation, coupled with general instead of close supervision, led to better results. The Michigan leadership studies, along with the Ohio State University studies that took place in the 1940s, are two of the best-known behavioral leadership studies and continue to be cited to this day.

== Literature ==
{{Hinduism}}
Ancient and medieval era Indian literature on ''Mitahara'' are of two categories – one relates to philosophical discussion of moderate diet and proper nutrition,&lt;ref name=svatmaram /&gt; the other category relate to details about ''Aharatattva'' ([[dietetics]]).&lt;ref name=ray&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/CarakaSamhitaAScientificSynopsis/CarakaSamhita_priyadaranjanRay#page/n25/mode/2up Caraka Samhita] Ray and Gupta, National Institute of Sciences, India, pages 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; The former category include the Upanishads and Sutras that discuss why virtuous self-restraint is appropriate in matters of food, while the latter include [[Samhita]]s that discuss what and when certain foods are suitable. A few texts such as Hathayoga Pradipika combine both.&lt;ref name=tts /&gt;

=== The virtue of mitahara ===
''Mitahara'' is discussed in [[Shandilya Upanishad|Śāṇḍilya Upanishad]],&lt;ref name="KN Aiyar 1914 pages 173-176" /&gt; as well as by Svātmārāma.&lt;ref name=svatmaram&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hatha Yoga Pradipika|author=Svātmārāma|author2=Pancham Sinh |publisher = Forgotten Books|edition= 5|year=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sBFttVx6ukC|isbn=  978-1-60506-637-0|page=14|quote=&lt;br /&gt;Quote - अथ यम-नियमाः&lt;br /&gt; अहिंसा सत्यमस्तेयं बरह्यछर्यम कश्हमा धृतिः &lt;br /&gt; दयार्जवं मिताहारः शौछम छैव यमा दश}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorenzen|first1=David|title=The Kāpālikas and Kālāmukhas|date=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01842-6|pages=186–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merging with Śiva: Hinduism's contemporary metaphysics |last= Subramuniya |publisher= Himalayan Academy Publications|year= 2003|location= |isbn=  978-0-945497-99-8 |page=155 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JupkNVxfwHgC |accessdate=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the [[yamas]] (virtuous self restraints) discussed in ancient Indian texts. The other nine [[yamas]] are [[Ahiṃsā]] (अहिंसा): Nonviolence, [[Satya]] (सत्य): truthfulness, [[Asteya]] (अस्तेय): not stealing, [[Brahmacharya]] (ब्रह्मचर्य): celibacy and not cheating on one’s spouse, [[Forgiveness#Hinduism|Kṣamā]] (क्षमा): forgiveness,&lt;ref name=ss&gt;Stuart Sovatsky (1998), Words from the Soul: Time East/West Spirituality and Psychotherapeutic Narrative, State University of New York, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3949-4}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhrti|Dhṛti]] (धृति): fortitude, [[Compassion#Hinduism|Dayā]] (दया): compassion,&lt;ref name=ss /&gt; [[Ārjava]] (आर्जव): sincerity, non-hypocrisy, and [[Shaucha|Śauca]] (शौच): purity, cleanliness.

Some of the earliest ideas behind ''Mitahara'' trace to ancient era [[Taittiriya Upanishad]], which in various hymns discusses the importance of food to healthy living, to the cycle of life,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/taittiriyaupanis00sankiala#page/396/mode/2up Annamaya Kosa] Taittiriya Upanishad, Anuvaka II, pages 397-406&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to its role in one's body and its effect on Self ([[Brahman]], Atma, Spirit).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/taittiriyaupanis00sankiala#page/740/mode/2up Realization of Brahman] Taittiriya Upanishad, Anuvaka II &amp; VII, pages 740-789; This is extensively discussed in these chapters; Illustrative quote - "Life, verily, is food; the body the food-eater" (page 776)&lt;/ref&gt; The Upanishad, states Stiles,&lt;ref&gt;M Stiles (2008), Ayurvedic Yoga Therapy, Lotus Press, {{ISBN|978-0-940985-97-1}}, pages 56-57&lt;/ref&gt; notes “from food life springs forth, by food it is sustained, and in food it merges when life departs”.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] includes verses on ‘‘mitahara’’ in Chapter 6. It states in verse 6.16 that a yogi must neither eat too much nor too little, neither sleep too much nor too little.&lt;ref name=pt&gt;Paul Turner (2013), FOOD YOGA – Nourishing Body, Mind &amp; Soul, 2nd Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-9850451-1-1}}, page 164&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding and regulating one’s established habits about eating, sleeping and recreation is suggested as essential to the practice of yoga in verse 6.17.&lt;ref name=pt /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Knapp, The Heart of Hinduism: The Eastern Path to Freedom, Empowerment and Illumination, {{ISBN|978-0-595-35075-9}}, page 284&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ancient text, in a South Indian language, ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]]'' states moderate diet as a virtuous life style. This text, written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the Tamil [[Veda]], discusses eating habits and its role in a healthy life (Mitahara), dedicating Chapter 95 of Book 7 to it.&lt;ref name=gutenberg /&gt; ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' states in verses 943 through 945, “eat in moderation, when you feel hungry, foods that are agreeable to your body, refraining from foods that your body finds disagreeable”. Tiruvalluvar also emphasizes overeating has ill effects on health, in verse 946, as “the pleasures of health abide in the man who eats moderately. The pains of disease dwell with him who eats excessively.”&lt;ref name=gutenberg&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/eng_95.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227204124/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/eng_95.htm |date=2014-12-27 }} see Chapter 95, Book 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/tirukkural-tirukkural/oclc/777453934?referer=di&amp;ht=edition Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by V.V.R. Aiyar, Tirupparaithurai : Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval era Sanskrit texts such as Dasakumara Charita and [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] discuss ''Mitahara''. For example, Hatha Yoga Pradipika verse 1.57 states the importance of ‘‘mitihara’’, as
{{quote|
&lt;nowiki&gt;ब्रह्मचारी मिताहारी तयागी योग-परायणः |  अब्दादूर्ध्वं भवेद्सिद्धो नात्र कार्या विछारणा ||&lt;/nowiki&gt;

A brahmachari, practicing mitahara (moderate diet) and [[tyaga]] (renunciation, solitude), devoted to yoga achieves success in his enquiry and effort within half a year.|Hathayoga Pradipika|1.57&lt;ref name=tts&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/hathayogapradipika/hatha_yoga_pradipika#page/n45/mode/2up Hathayoga Pradipika] Brahmananda, Adyar Library, The Theosophical Society, Madras India (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Verses 1.57 through 1.63 of the critical edition of Hathayoga Pradipika suggests that taste cravings should not drive one’s eating habits, rather the best diet is one that is tasty, nutritious and likable as well as sufficient to meet the needs of one’s body and for one’s inner self.&lt;ref name=ksj /&gt; It recommends that one must “eat only when one feels hungry” and “neither overeat nor eat to completely fill the capacity of one’s stomach; rather leave a quarter portion empty and fill three quarters with quality food and fresh water”.&lt;ref name=ksj&gt;KS Joshi, Speaking of Yoga and Nature-Cure Therapy, Sterling Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1-84557-045-3}}, page 65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Verses 1.59 to 1.61 of Hathayoga Pradipika suggests ‘‘mitahara’’ regimen of a yogi avoids foods with excessive amounts of sour, salt, bitterness, oil, spice burn, unripe vegetables, fermented foods or alcohol. The practice of ''Mitahara'', in Hathayoga Pradipika, includes avoiding stale, impure and [[Tamas (philosophy)|tamasic]] foods, and consuming moderate amounts of fresh, vital and [[Sattva|sattvic]] foods.&lt;ref name=srosen /&gt;

=== Dietectics and mitahara ===
[[Charaka Samhita]] and [[Sushruta Samhita]] are among the two largest surviving compendium on nutrition and diet that have survived from ancient and medieval periods of India.&lt;ref name=ray /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/englishtranslati00susruoft#page/n3/mode/2up Sushruta Samhita] KKL Bhishagratna, Vol 2, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt; Caraka Samhita emphasizes the need to plan and understand the role of diet in health, across Chapters 5, 6, 25, 26 and 27. In verse 25.31, it states "wholesome diet promotes health and growth, unwholesome diet is the most important cause of diseases". In verses 25.38-39, Caraka Samhita classifies foods into groups based on its source and taste, then categorizes them into nutritive and harmful. In Chapters 26 and 27, it suggests that the same food can be nutritive in small amounts while harmful in large amounts or if cooked improperly or if eaten together with foods its lists. Food, claims Caraka Samhita, must be tailored to needs of one's body, state of one's health, climate, season, habits and personal palatability and needs.&lt;ref name=ray /&gt; In the spirit of Mitahara, in Chapter 5, it insists even light, easily digested and nutritious food should be consumed in moderation and should not be consumed in excess of bodily requirements. In Chapter 6, Caraka Samhita recommends that food should be tailored to the season, with rich and fatty foods being beneficial in winter, while light soups, fruits and acidulated drinks more suited for summers. In verses 6.6-7, it suggests that the diet should be planned and nourishing foods consumed in rotation, tailored to one's health condition and personal needs.&lt;ref name=ray /&gt;

As with Caraka Samhita, the other large compendium on health – Sushruta Samhita – includes many chapters on the role of diet and personal needs of an individual. In Chapter 10 of Sushruta Samhita, for example, the diet and nutrition for pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children are described.&lt;ref&gt;KKL Bhishagratna, [https://archive.org/stream/englishtranslati00susruoft#page/216/mode/2up Chapter X, Sushruta Samhita], Vol 2, Calcutta, page 216-238&lt;/ref&gt; It recommends milk, butter, fluid foods, fruits, vegetables and fibrous diets for expecting mothers along with soups made from ''jangala'' (wild) meat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/englishtranslati00susruoft#page/216/mode/2up Sushruta Samhita] KKL Bhishagratna, Vol 2, Calcutta, page 217&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, vegetarian diets are preferred and recommended in the Samhitas; however, for those recovering from injuries, growing children, those who do high levels of physical exercise, and expecting mothers, Sutrasthanam's Chapter 20 and other texts recommend carefully prepared meat. Sushruta Samhita also recommends a rotation and balance in foods consumed, in moderation. For this purposes, it classifies foods by various characteristics, such as taste. In Chapter 42 of Sutrasthanam, for example, it lists six tastes – ''madhura'' (sweet), ''amla'' (acidic), ''lavana'' (saline), ''katuka'' (pungent), ''tikta'' (bitter) and ''kashaya'' (astringent). It then lists various sources of foods that deliver these tastes and recommends that all six tastes (flavors) be consumed in moderation and routinely, as a habit for good health.&lt;ref&gt;KKL Bhishagratna, [https://archive.org/stream/englishtranslati01susruoft#page/384/mode/2up Sutrasthanam, Chapter XLII] Sushruta Samhita, Vol 1, Calcutta, page 385-393&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related concepts ==
The concept of ''Mitahara'' is discussed in over 30 different ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=svb&gt;SV Bharti (2001), Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: With the Exposition of Vyasa, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|978-8120818255}}, Appendix I, pages 672-680&lt;/ref&gt; However, some texts use a different word and concept for the idea of "moderate diet and paying attention to what one eats and drinks". For example, Shivayoga Dipika uses the term ''Niyatāshana'' (planned, regulated eating), while Dattatreya Samhita uses ''Laghrāhāra'' (eating lightly, small portions of diverse foods).&lt;ref name=svb /&gt;

'''The Offences Against the Person Act 1828''' (9 Geo. 4 c. 31) (also known as Lord Lansdowne's Act) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. It consolidated provisions in the law related to [[offences against the person]] (an expression which, in particular, includes offences of violence) from a number of earlier [[statutes]] into a single Act. It was part of the criminal law reforms known collectively as "[[Peel's Acts]]", passed with the objective of simplifying the law.  Among the laws it replaced was clause XXXVI of the [[Magna Carta]], the first time any part of the Magna Carta was repealed, and the [[Buggery Act 1533]]. It also abolished the crime of [[petty treason]].

The Act only applied to [[England and Wales]] (then described as England). A similar statute was passed for Ireland the following year (10 Geo. 4 c. 34).

A number of the Act's provisions were repealed and replaced by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1837]]. The death penalty for shooting, stabbing, cutting or wounding with intent (s.12), and for post-[[quickening]] abortions (s.13) under this Act was abolished by [[repeal]] of those sections by section 1 of the 1837 Act (sections 12 and 13 of this act were replaced by sections 4 and 6 of the 1837 Act, respectively).

The death penalty for rape (s.16) and [[carnal knowledge]] of a girl under ten (s.17) was abolished by amendment of those sections by section 3 of the [[Substitution of Punishments of Death Act 1841]]. Section 18 made provision in relation to proof of carnal knowledge.

The Act was wholly replaced by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].

Under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1828, several sections pertained to the crime of rape. The penalty for being convicted of rape was still death, and remained so until 1841. The Act also made it a felony punishable by death to carnally know a girl under the age of ten. Carnally knowing a girl over the age of ten and under the age of twelve was a [[misdemeanor]] punishable with imprisonment with the option of [[Penal labour|hard labor]] for a term to be determined by the court.  

The Act also affirmed that proof of penetration was sufficient to reach the conclusion that one person had had carnal knowledge of another; before the 1828 statute, victims of rape had to prove that the perpetrator [[Ejaculation|ejaculated]]. Historian [[Anna Clark (historian)|Anna Clark]] has argued that medical experts used ejaculation as proof of rape because it was tangible evidence that reduced the need for a victim's testimony.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Clark also contends that requiring proof of ejaculation allowed judges and magistrates to ask victims humiliating and explicit questions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} By changing the definition of carnal knowledge from ejaculation to proof of penetration, the 1828 act made it a little easier for victims to prosecute their rapists.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Records show that from 1828 to 1841, 63 defendants accused of rape were tried at the [[Old Bailey]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Of those 63 defendants, 16 were found guilty and 12 were sentenced to death. Three had their sentenced reduced to imprisonment, and one had his judgment respited altogether.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The Act and its focus on interpersonal violence also had the effect of increasing formal accusations of [[domestic violence]], by reducing the stigma surrounding such activity and diminishing judicial delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.branchcollective.org/?ps_articles=lisa-surridge-on-the-offenses-against-the-person-act-1828|last=Surridge|first=Lisa|title=On the Offenses Against the Person Act, 1828|website=www.branchcollective.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4886">'''Operational availability''' in [[systems engineering]] is a measurement of how long a system has been available to use when compared with how long it should have been available to be used.

==Definition==
Operational availability is a management concept that evaluates the following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/OPNAV.aspx|title=Opnav Instruction 4790.7: Maintenance Policy for United States Navy Ships|publisher=US Navy Operations|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215134909/http://doni.daps.dla.mil/OPNAV.aspx|archivedate=2013-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Diagnostic down time
* Criticality
* Fault isolation down time
* Logistics delay down time
* Corrective maintenance down time

Any failed item that is not corrected will induce operational failure. &lt;math&gt;A_o&lt;/math&gt; is used to evaluate that risk. Operational failure is unacceptable in any situation where the following can occur.
* Capital equipment loss
* Injury or loss of life
* Sustained failure to accomplish mission

In military acquisition, operational availability is used as one of the [[Key Performance Parameters]] in requirements documents, to form the basis for decision support analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url =  https://doni.documentservices.dla.mil/Directives/03000%20Naval%20Operations%20and%20Readiness/03-00%20General%20Operations%20and%20Readiness%20Support/3000.12A.pdf
| title = OPNAVINST 3000.12A, Operational Availability Handbook
| publisher = US Navy
| date = 2 Sep 2003
| accessdate = 29 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Aircraft systems, ship systems, missile systems, and space systems have a large number of failure modes that must be addressed with limited resources.

Formal reliability modeling during development is required to prioritize resource allocation before operation begins. Estimated failure rates and logistics delay are used to identify the number of forward positioned spare parts required to avoid excessive down time. This is also used to justify the expense associated with redundancy.

Formal availability measurement is used during operation to prioritize management decisions involving upgrade resource allocation, manpower allocation, and spare parts planning.

== Principle ==

Operational availability is used to evaluate the following performance characteristic.

For a system that is expected to be available constantly, the below operational availability figures translate to the system being unavailable for approximately the following lengths of time (when all outages during a year are added together):

:&lt;math&gt; A_o = 0.9 \approx 877 \ hours \ down \ time \ per \ year&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A_o = 0.99 \approx 87 \ hours \ down \ time \ per \ year&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A_o = 0.999 \approx 8 \ hours \ down \ time \ per \ year&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A_o = 0.9999 \approx 52 \ minutes \ down \ time \ per \ year&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A_o = 0.99999 \approx 5 \ minutes \ down \ time \ per \ year&lt;/math&gt;

The following data is collected for maintenance actions while in operation to prioritize corrective funding.
* Diagnostic down time is required to identify the amount of time spent perform maintenance when [[fault reporting]] does not support [[condition-based maintenance]].
* Criticality identifies level of risk associated with loss of mission, injury or loss of life, and capitol equipment.
* Fault isolation down time is required to identify the amount of time spent locating a failure.
* Logistics delay down time is required to identify the amount of time required to obtain replacement parts or software.
* Corrective maintenance down time is required to identify the amount of time required to install and reconfigure replacement parts and software.

This data is applied to the [[reliability block diagram]] to evaluate individual availability reduction contributions using the following formulas.

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{D} = \left( \frac{ Total \ Time }{Total \ Time + Diagnostic \ Down \ Time } \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{FI} = \left( \frac{ Total \ Time }{Total \ Time + Fault \ Isolation \ Down \ Time } \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{L} = \left( \frac{ Total \ Time }{Total \ Time + Logistics \ Down \ Time } \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{C} = \left( \frac{ Total \ Time }{Total \ Time + Corrective \ Down \ Time } \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Redundant items do not contribute to availability reduction unless all of the redundant components fail simultaneously.

Operational availability is the overall availability considering each of these contributions.

:&lt;math&gt;A_o = A_{o}^{D} \times A_{o}^{FI} \times A_{o}^{L} \times A_{o}^{C}&lt;/math&gt;

On March 5, 2013, '''Parrish Dennison''' was shot and killed by [[Albuquerque Police Department|Albuquerque police]] officers Perdue, Dedler and Aragon. Dennison was suspected of being one of three people attempting to sell a stolen banjo from the robbery of a local music store. Police fired on Dennison after they alleged that he pointed out a revolver on them. Dennison's mother, Charlotte Ingraham asserts that footage from a helicopter camera shows otherwise. Police video from after the shooting shows Dennison on the ground with a gun in his hand. Since the incident Dennison’s family has filed a lawsuit for a wrongful death. The shooting was ruled as justified by the [[Bernalillo County, New Mexico|Bernalillo County]] District Attorney's Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cruz|first1=Megan|title=Family files wrongful death over 2013 police involved shooting|url=http://www.koat.com/news/family-files-wrongful-death-lawsuit-over-2013-policeinvolved-shooting/31623136|accessdate=5 May 2015|agency=KOAT Albuquerque|publisher=KOAT Albuquerque|date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A witness to the incident says that Dennison did not point a gun at officers before the shooting, and that Dennison tried to break through a window but bounced off before police fired upon him. The witness said, "He never once pointed the gun at them, nothing… He just hit that window and just bounced back and then boom, boom, boom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Velasquez|first1=Anna|title=Witness: Man didn't point gun at cops before shooting|url=http://www.koat.com/news/new-mexico/albuquerque/Witness-Man-didn-t-point-gun-at-cops-before-shooting/19219550|accessdate=5 May 2015|agency=KOAT Albuquerque|publisher=KOAT Albuquerque|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Passive fluency''' is where a person can [[Fluency|fluently]] read and audibly understand a [[language]] whilst not having the ability to fluently speak or write the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Leap | first= W. | date= 1988 | title= Indian language renewal | journal= Human Organization | publisher= | volume= 47 | issue= 4 | pages= 283–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive fluency is often brought about by being raised in one language (which becomes the person's passive language) and being schooled in another language (which becomes the person's native language).&lt;ref name = "basham"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Basham | first = Charlotte | last2 = Fathman | first2 = Ann | date = 19 December 2008 | title = The Latent Speaker: Attaining Adult Fluency in an Endangered Language | journal = International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 577–597 | doi = 10.1080/13670050802149192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are passively fluent in a language are often [[latent speakers]] who were raised in an environment where the language was spoken but did not become native speakers.&lt;ref name = "basham" /&gt;

==Language Attitudes regarding "Passive Bilinguals"==
A more common term for this phenomenon is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues that there has been a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual', where people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judges not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare, and the fluency of a bilingual in his/ her languages is domain- specific: it depends on what they need the languages for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosjean|first1=François|title=Bilingual : Life and Reality|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Massachusetts|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language, despite the fact that there are social (extralinguistic) factors underlying their different competencies.

==A Need for Passive Bilinguals in Basque Country==
Karlos Cid Abasolo discusses that passive bilingualism would be a minimum requirement for the co- official status of Basque and Spanish to become a working reality. As there are currently many monolingual Spanish speakers, and no monolingual Basque speakers, there is not yet a situation where an individual fluent in Basque could speak in his/ her mother tongue, regardless of the domain, circumstance  or interlocutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasolo|first1=Karlos Cid|title=Bilingüísmo, monolingüísmo y sesquilingüismo en la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca|journal=Revista de Filología Románica|date=2009|volume=26|pages=229–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perception''' (from the [[Latin]] ''perceptio'') is the organization, identification, and interpretation of [[sense|sensory]] [[information]] in order to represent and understand the presented information, or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel |title=Psychology |year=2011 |publisher = Worth Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All perception involves signals that go through the [[nervous system]], which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the [[Sensory nervous system|sensory system]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein5"&gt;Goldstein (2009) pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; For example, vision involves [[photon|light]] striking the [[retina]] of the [[eye]], smell is mediated by [[Olfactory system#Peripheral|odor molecules]], and [[hearing]] involves [[sound wave|pressure waves]].

Perception is not only the passive receipt of these signals, but it's also shaped by the recipient's [[Perceptual learning|learning]], [[memory]], [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]], and [[attention]].&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010" /&gt;

Perception can be split into two processes, &lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=Douglas A. |title = Essentials of Psychology |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rd77N0KsLVkC&amp;pg=PA123 |accessdate=25 March 2011 |date=5 March 2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-90693-3 |pages=123–124 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170102091148/https://books.google.com/books?id=rd77N0KsLVkC&amp;pg=PA123 |archivedate=2 January 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) processing the sensory input, which transforms these low-level information to higher-level information (e.g., extracts shapes for object recognition), (2) processing which is connected with a person's concepts and expectations (or knowledge), restorative and selective mechanisms (such as [[attention]]) that influence perception.

Perception depends on complex functions of the nervous system, but subjectively seems mostly effortless because this processing happens outside conscious awareness. &lt;ref name="Goldstein5" /&gt;

Since the rise of [[experimental psychology]] in the 19th century, [[perceptual psychology|psychology's understanding of perception]] has progressed by combining a variety of techniques.&lt;ref name="mind_perception"&gt;[[Richard Gregory|Gregory, Richard]]. "Perception" in Gregory, Zangwill (1987) pp.&amp;nbsp;598–601.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychophysics]] quantitatively describes the relationships between the physical qualities of the sensory input and perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustav Fechner|Gustav Theodor Fechner]]. Elemente der Psychophysik. Leipzig 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sensory neuroscience]] studies the neural mechanisms underlying perception. Perceptual systems can also be studied [[computation]]ally, in terms of the information they process. [[Philosophy of perception|Perceptual issues in philosophy]] include the extent to which sensory qualities such as sound, smell or color exist in objective reality rather than in the mind of the perceiver.&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt;

Although the senses were traditionally viewed as passive receptors, the study of [[illusion]]s and [[ambiguous image]]s has demonstrated that the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously attempt to make sense of their input.&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt; There is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of [[hypothesis]] testing, analogous to [[science]], or whether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary.&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt;

The [[perceptual system]]s of the [[brain]] enable individuals to see the world around them as stable, even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and rapidly varying. Human and animal brains are structured in a [[cognitive module|modular way]], with different areas processing different kinds of sensory information. Some of these modules take the form of [[Sensory Maps|sensory maps]], mapping some aspect of the world across part of the brain's surface. These different modules are interconnected and influence each other. For instance, [[taste]] is strongly influenced by smell.&lt;ref name="DeVereCalvert2010_33" /&gt;

== Process and terminology ==
&lt;!-- linked from disambiguation: update or define {{Anchor|Process and terminology}} if changed --&gt;
The process of perception begins with an object in the real world, termed the ''distal stimulus'' or ''distal object''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5"/&gt; By means of light, sound or another physical process, the object stimulates the body's sensory organs. These sensory organs transform the input energy into neural activity—a process called ''transduction''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pomerantz" /&gt; This raw pattern of neural activity is called the ''proximal stimulus''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5"/&gt; These neural signals are transmitted to the brain and processed.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5" /&gt; The resulting mental re-creation of the distal stimulus is the ''percept''.

An example would be a shoe. The shoe itself is the distal stimulus. When light from the shoe enters a person's eye and stimulates the retina, that stimulation is the proximal stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.learner.org/discoveringpsychology/07/e07glossary.html |title = Sensation and Perception |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510081956/http://www.learner.org/discoveringpsychology/07/e07glossary.html |archivedate = 10 May 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of the shoe reconstructed by the brain of the person is the percept. Another example would be a telephone ringing. The ringing of the telephone is the distal stimulus. The sound stimulating a person's auditory receptors is the proximal stimulus, and the brain's interpretation of this as the ringing of a telephone is the percept. The different kinds of sensation such as warmth, sound, and taste are called ''[[stimulus modality|sensory modalities]]''.&lt;ref name="pomerantz"&gt;Pomerantz, James R. (2003): "Perception: Overview". In: Lynn Nadel (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, London: Nature Publishing Group, pp.&amp;nbsp;527–537.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WillisCoggeshall2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=William D. |last2=Coggeshall |first2=Richard E. |title=Sensory Mechanisms of the Spinal Cord: Primary afferent neurons and the spinal dorsal horn |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uqnKCewO2voC&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=25 March 2011 |date=31 January 2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-306-48033-1 |page = 1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162356/http://books.google.com/books?id=uqnKCewO2voC&amp;pg=PA1 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Jerome Bruner]] has developed a model of perception. According to him, people go through the following process to form opinions:&lt;ref name="Alan"&gt;Alan S. &amp; Gary J. (2011). Perception, Attribution, and Judgment of Others. Organizational Behaviour: Understanding and Managing Life at Work,  Vol. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

# When we encounter an unfamiliar target, we are open to different informational cues and want to learn more about the target.
# In the second step, we try to collect more information about the target. Gradually, we encounter some familiar cues which help us categorize the target.
# At this stage, the cues become less open and selective. We try to search for more cues that confirm the categorization of the target. We also actively ignore and even distort cues that violate our initial perceptions. Our perception becomes more selective and we finally paint a consistent picture of the target.

According to [[Alan Saks]] and [[Gary Johns]], there are three components to perception.&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt;

# The Perceiver, the person who becomes aware about something and comes to a final understanding. There are 3 factors that can influence his or her perceptions: experience, motivational state and finally emotional state. In different motivational or emotional states, the perceiver will react to or perceive something in different ways. Also in different situations he or she might employ a "perceptual defence" where they tend to "see what they want to see".
# The Target. This is the person who is being perceived or judged. "Ambiguity or lack of information about a target leads to a greater need for interpretation and addition."
# The Situation also greatly influences perceptions because different situations may call for additional information about the target.

Stimuli are not necessarily translated into a percept and rarely does a single stimulus translate into a percept. An ambiguous stimulus may be translated into multiple percepts, experienced randomly, one at a time, in what is called ''[[multistable perception]]''. And the same stimuli, or absence of them, may result in different percepts depending on subject's culture and previous experiences. Ambiguous figures demonstrate that a single stimulus can result in more than one percept; for example the [[Rubin vase]] which can be interpreted either as a vase or as two faces. The percept can bind sensations from multiple senses into a whole. A picture of a talking person on a television screen, for example, is bound to the sound of speech from speakers to form a percept of a talking person. "'''Percept'''" is also a term used by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz' ''Monadology''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bergson]], [[Deleuze]], and [[Guattari]]&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari's ''What is Philosophy?''&lt;/ref&gt; to define perception independent from perceivers.

==Reality==
In the case of visual perception, some people can actually see the percept shift in their [[mind's eye]].&lt;ref name=Wettlaufer2003&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wettlaufer | first = Alexandra K. | year = 2003 | title = In the mind's eye : the visual impulse in Diderot, Baudelaire and Ruskin, pg. 257 | isbn = 90-420-1035-5 | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, who are not [[Picture thinking|picture thinkers]], may not necessarily perceive the 'shape-shifting' as their world changes. The 'esemplastic' nature has been shown by experiment: an [[ambiguous image]] has multiple interpretations on the perceptual level.

This confusing ambiguity of perception is exploited in human technologies such as [[camouflage]], and also in biological [[mimicry]], for example by [[European peacock|European peacock butterflies]], whose wings bear [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] that birds respond to as though they were the eyes of a dangerous predator.

There is also evidence that the brain in some ways operates on a slight "delay", to allow nerve impulses from distant parts of the body to be integrated into simultaneous signals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104183551 The Secret Advantage Of Being Short] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521081301/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104183551 |date=21 May 2009 }} by Robert Krulwich. ''All Things Considered'', NPR. 18 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perception is one of the oldest fields in psychology. The oldest quantitative laws in psychology are [[Weber-Fechner law|Weber's law]] – which states that the smallest noticeable difference in stimulus intensity is proportional to the intensity of the reference – and [[Weber-Fechner law|Fechner's law]] which quantifies the relationship between the intensity of the physical stimulus and its perceptual counterpart (for example, testing how much darker a computer screen can get before the viewer actually notices). The study of perception gave rise to the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] school of psychology, with its emphasis on [[Holism|holistic]] approach.

===Constancy===
{{main article|Subjective constancy|}}
''Perceptual constancy'' is the ability of perceptual systems to recognize the same object from widely varying sensory inputs.&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"/&gt;{{rp|118–120}}&lt;ref name="AtkinsonAtkinson1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Rita L.|last2=Atkinson|first2=Richard C.|last3=Smith|first3=Edward E.|title=Introduction to psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nw54PwAACAAJ|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=March 1990|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=978-0-15-543689-3|pages=177–183|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162907/http://books.google.com/books?id=Nw54PwAACAAJ|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, individual people can be recognized from views, such as frontal and profile, which form very different shapes on the retina. A coin looked at face-on makes a circular image on the retina, but when held at angle it makes an elliptical image.&lt;ref name="eop_constancy" /&gt; In normal perception these are recognized as a single three-dimensional object. Without this correction process, an animal approaching from the distance would appear to gain in size.&lt;ref name="Sonderegger1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sonderegger |first=Theo |title = Psychology |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UUrCHiSb_QsC&amp;pg=PA45 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |date=16 October 1998 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-8220-5327-9 |pages=43–46 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162741/http://books.google.com/books?id=UUrCHiSb_QsC&amp;pg=PA45 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enc_constancy" /&gt; One kind of perceptual constancy is ''[[color constancy]]'': for example, a white piece of paper can be recognized as such under different colors and intensities of light.&lt;ref name="enc_constancy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldstein|first=E.

The brain compensates for this, so the speed of contact does not affect the perceived roughness.&lt;ref name="enc_constancy" /&gt; Other constancies include melody, odor, brightness and words.&lt;ref name="Roeckelein2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Roeckelein |first=Jon E. |title = Elsevier's dictionary of psychological theories |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1Yn6NZgxvssC&amp;pg=PA126 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-51750-0 |page=126 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162549/http://books.google.com/books?id=1Yn6NZgxvssC&amp;pg=PA126 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These constancies are not always total, but the variation in the percept is much less than the variation in the physical stimulus.&lt;ref name="enc_constancy" /&gt; The perceptual systems of the brain achieve perceptual constancy in a variety of ways, each specialized for the kind of information being processed&lt;ref name="Yantis2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yantis|first=Steven|title=Visual perception: essential readings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpGvYSTk9gYC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=24 March 2011|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-86377-598-7|page=7|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162254/http://books.google.com/books?id=GpGvYSTk9gYC&amp;pg=PA7|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with [[phonemic restoration effect|phonemic restoration]] as a notable example from hearing.

===Grouping===
{{main article|Principles of grouping}}

[[File:Gestalt closure.svg|right|thumb|Law of Closure. The human brain tends to perceive complete shapes even if those forms are incomplete.]]

The ''principles of grouping'' (or ''Gestalt laws of grouping'') are a set of principles in [[psychology]], first proposed by [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologists]] to explain how humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects. Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to [[perceive]] patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are [[Principles of grouping|organized into six categories]]: ''proximity, similarity, closure, good continuation, common fate'' and ''good form''.

The principle of ''proximity'' states that, all else being equal, perception tends to group stimuli that are close together as part of the same object, and [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] that are far apart as two separate objects. The principle of ''similarity'' states that, all else being equal, perception lends itself to seeing stimuli that physically resemble each other as part of the same object, and stimuli that are different as part of a different object. This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects based on their [[visual]] texture and resemblance. The principle of ''closure'' refers to the mind's tendency to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete picture in our minds is missing. For example, if part of a shape's border is missing people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps. The principle of ''good continuation'' makes sense of stimuli that overlap: when there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each as a single uninterrupted object. The principle of ''common fate'' groups stimuli together on the basis of their movement. When visual elements are seen moving in the same direction at the same rate, perception associates the movement as part of the same stimulus. This allows people to make out moving objects even when other details, such as color or outline, are obscured. The principle of ''good form'' refers to the tendency to group together forms of similar shape, pattern, [[color]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Peter O. (2006): ''Psychology'', 5th ed., New York: Worth, p. 281. {{ISBN|978-0-7167-0617-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|chapterurl=http://www.sinauer.com./wolfe/chap4/gestaltF.htm|chapter=Gestalt Grouping Principles|publisher=Sinauer Associates|year=2008|edition=2nd|title=Sensation and Perception|first1=Jeremy M.|last1=Wolfe|first3=Dennis M.|last3=Levi|first2=Keith R.|last2=Kluender|first5=Rachel S.|last5=Herz|first6=Roberta L.|last6=Klatzky|first4=Linda M.|last4=Bartoshuk|first7=Susan J.|last7=Lederman|isbn=978-0-87893-938-1|pages=78, 80|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723150836/http://www.sinauer.com/wolfe/chap4/gestaltF.htm|archivedate=23 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (2009). pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|ref=harv|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Psychological Terms|first=J.

===Contrast effects===
{{main article|Contrast effect}}

A common finding across many different kinds of perception is that the perceived qualities of an object can be affected by the qualities of context. If one object is extreme on some dimension, then neighboring objects are perceived as further away from that extreme. "Simultaneous contrast effect" is the term used when stimuli are presented at the same time, whereas "successive contrast" applies when stimuli are presented one after another.&lt;ref name="Corsini2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corsini|first=Raymond J.|title=The dictionary of psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uxnglHzYaoC&amp;pg=PA219|accessdate=24 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-58391-328-4|page=219|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162655/http://books.google.com/books?id=0uxnglHzYaoC&amp;pg=PA219|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of experience==
{{main article|Perceptual learning}}

With experience, [[organism]]s can learn to make finer perceptual distinctions, and learn new kinds of categorization. Wine-tasting, the reading of X-ray images and music appreciation are applications of this process in the [[human]] sphere. [[Research]] has focused on the relation of this to other kinds of [[learning]], and whether it takes place in peripheral [[sensory perception|sensory]] systems or in the brain's processing of sense information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sumner|first=Meghan|title=The Effect of Experience on the Perception and Representation of Dialect Variants|work=Journal of Memory and Language|publisher=Elsevier Inc., 2009 |accessdate=3 June 2015 |url = http://web.stanford.edu/~sumner/Publications/2009_Sumner_JML.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202011511/http://web.stanford.edu/~sumner/Publications/2009_Sumner_JML.pdf |archivedate=2 February 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Empirical]] [[research]] show that specific practices (such as [[yoga]], [[mindfulness]], [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]], [[meditation]], Daoshi and other mind-body disciplines) can modify human perceptual modality. Specifically, these practices enable perception skills to switch from the external (exteroceptive field) towards a higher ability to focus on internal signals ([[proprioception]]). Also, when asked to provide verticality judgments, highly self-transcendent [[yoga]] practitioners were significantly less influenced by a misleading visual context. Increasing self-transcendence may enable yoga practitioners to optimize verticality judgment tasks by relying more on internal (vestibular and proprioceptive) signals coming from their own body, rather than on exteroceptive, visual cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fiori| first1=Francesca |last2=David|first2=Nicole |last3=Aglioti|first3=Salvatore Maria|title=Processing of proprioceptive and vestibular body signals and self-transcendence in Ashtanga yoga practitioners|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |date=2014|volume=8 |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00734|url=http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/Abstract.aspx?s=537&amp;name=human_neuroscience&amp;ART_DOI=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of motivation and expectation==
{{main article|Set (psychology)}}
A ''perceptual set'', also called ''perceptual expectancy'' or just ''set'' is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way.&lt;ref name="Weiten2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Weiten|first=Wayne|title=Psychology: Themes and Variations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&amp;pg=PT193|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=17 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60197-5|page=193|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163032/http://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&amp;pg=PT193|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of how perception can be shaped by "top-down" processes such as drives and expectations.&lt;ref name="CoonMitterer2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coon|first1=Dennis|last2=Mitterer|first2=John O.|title=Introduction to Psychology: Gateways to Mind and Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=29 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59911-1|pages=171–172|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162432/http://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&amp;pg=PA171|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses.&lt;ref name="Sonderegger1998"/&gt; They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Malcolm|last2=Heyes|first2=Steve|title=Beginning Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=2 December 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-832821-6|pages=24–27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163023/http://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&amp;pg=PA24|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as "sael". Subjects who were told to expect words about animals read it as "seal", but others who were expecting boat-related words read it as "sail".&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt;

Sets can be created by [[motivation]] and so can result in people interpreting ambiguous figures so that they see what they want to see.&lt;ref name="CoonMitterer2008"/&gt; For instance, how someone perceives what unfolds during a sports game can be biased if they strongly support one of the teams.&lt;ref name="BlockYuker2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=J.

They were told that either a number or a letter would flash on the screen to say whether they were going to taste an orange juice drink or an unpleasant-tasting health drink. In fact, an ambiguous figure was flashed on screen, which could either be read as the letter B or the number 13. When the letters were associated with the pleasant task, subjects were more likely to perceive a letter B, and when letters were associated with the unpleasant task they tended to perceive a number 13.&lt;ref name="Weiten2008"/&gt;

Perceptual set has been demonstrated in many social contexts. People who are primed to think of someone as "warm" are more likely to perceive a variety of positive characteristics in them, than if the word "warm" is replaced by "cold".{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} When someone has a reputation for being funny, an audience is more likely to find them amusing.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt; Individual's perceptual sets reflect their own personality traits. For example, people with an aggressive personality are quicker to correctly identify aggressive words or situations.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt;

One classic psychological experiment showed slower reaction times and less accurate answers when a deck of [[playing cards]] reversed the color of the [[Suit (cards)|suit]] symbol for some cards (e.g. red spades and black hearts).&lt;ref&gt;"On the Perception of Incongruity: A Paradigm" by Jerome S. Bruner and Leo Postman. ''Journal of Personality'', 18, pp. 206-223. 1949.

Philosopher [[Andy Clark]] explains that perception, although it occurs quickly, is not simply a bottom-up process (where minute details are put together to form larger wholes). Instead, our brains use what he calls '[[predictive coding]]'. It starts with very broad constraints and expectations for the state of the world, and as expectations are met, it makes more detailed predictions (errors lead to new predictions, or [[learning]] processes). Clark says this research has various implications; not only can there be no completely "unbiased, unfiltered" perception, but this means that there is a great deal of feedback between perception and expectation (perceptual experiences often shape our beliefs, but those perceptions were based on existing beliefs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html|title= Predictive Coding|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131205173145/http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html|archivedate= 5 December 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Indeed, predictive coding provides an account where this type of feedback assists in stabilizing our inference-making process about the physical world, such as with perceptual constancy examples.

==Theories==

===Perception as direct perception===
[[Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitive theories]] of perception assume there is a poverty of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. This (with reference to perception) is the claim that [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] are, by themselves, unable to provide a unique description of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, James V. (2012): "[https://books.google.com/books?id=HZf6AQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Vision and Brain: How we perceive the world]", Cambridge, MIT Press, pp. 155-178.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensations require 'enriching', which is the role of the mental model. A different type of theory is the perceptual [[Ecological psychology|ecology]] approach of [[James J. Gibson]]. Gibson rejected the assumption of a [[poverty of stimulus]] by rejecting the notion that perception is based upon sensations&amp;nbsp;– instead, he investigated what information is actually presented to the perceptual systems. His theory "assumes the existence of stable, unbounded, and permanent stimulus-information in the [[ambient optic array]]. And it supposes that the visual system can explore and detect this information. The theory is information-based, not sensation-based."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J. (2002): "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f594/23f1a766380ff945fc401b976618a2b2a92a.pdf A Theory of Direct Visual Perception]". In: Alva Noë/Evan Thompson (Eds.), ''Vision and Mind. Selected Readings in the Philosophy of Perception'', Cambridge, MIT Press, pp. 77–89.&lt;/ref&gt; He and the psychologists who work within this [[paradigm]] detailed how the world could be specified to a mobile, exploring organism via the lawful projection of information about the world into energy arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sokolowski|first=Robert|title=Phenomenology of the Human Person|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521717663|pages=199–200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NIEJt5afhwgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925011659/https://books.google.com/books?id=NIEJt5afhwgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=25 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Specification" would be a 1:1 mapping of some aspect of the world into a perceptual array; given such a mapping, no enrichment is required and perception is [[direct perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Robert J.|title=James Gibson's Passive Theory of Perception: A Rejection of the Doctrine of Specific Nerve Energies|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=December 1976|volume=37|issue=2|pages=218–233|url=http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/richards/James%20Gibson's%20Passive%20Theory%20of%20Perception.pdf|doi=10.2307/2107193|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613180128/http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/richards/James%20Gibson's%20Passive%20Theory%20of%20Perception.pdf|archivedate=13 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception-in-action===
An ecological understanding of perception derived from Gibson's early work is that of "perception-in-action", the notion that perception is a requisite property of animate action; that without perception, action would be unguided, and without action, perception would serve no purpose. Animate actions require both perception and motion, and perception and movement can be described as "two sides of the same coin, the coin is action". Gibson works from the assumption that singular entities, which he calls "invariants", already exist in the real world and that all that the perception process does is to home in upon them. A view known as [[Constructive perception|constructivism]] (held by such philosophers as [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]]) regards the continual adjustment of perception and action to the external input as precisely what constitutes the "entity", which is therefore far from being invariant.&lt;ref&gt;Consciousness in Action, S. L. Hurley, illustrated, Harvard University Press, 2002, 0674007964, pp. 430–432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glasersfeld considers an "invariant" as a target to be homed in upon, and a pragmatic necessity to allow an initial measure of understanding to be established prior to the updating that a statement aims to achieve. The invariant does not and need not represent an actuality, and Glasersfeld describes it as extremely unlikely that what is desired or [[fear processing in the brain|feared]] by an organism will never suffer change as time goes on. This [[social constructionist]] theory thus allows for a needful evolutionary adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995), ''Radical Constructivism: A Way of Knowing and Learning,'' London: RoutledgeFalmer; Poerksen, Bernhard (ed.) (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8-_EsHHxHYcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Certainty of Uncertainty: Dialogues Introducing Constructivism],'' Exeter: Imprint Academic; Wright. Edmond (2005). ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A mathematical theory of perception-in-action has been devised and investigated in many forms of controlled movement, and has been described in many different species of organism using the [[General Tau Theory]]. According to this theory, tau information, or time-to-goal information is the fundamental 'percept' in perception.

===Evolutionary psychology (EP) and perception===
Many philosophers, such as Jerry Fodor, write that the purpose of perception is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide action.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; For example, they say, depth perception seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 4, pp. 81–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitness.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Perception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt;

Scientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Sound waves provide useful information about the sources of and distances to objects, with larger animals making and hearing lower-frequency sounds and smaller animals making and hearing higher-frequency sounds.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that were significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists claim that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain suffer from the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces (prospagnosia).&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; EP suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt;

===Closed-loop perception===
Here perception is proposed to be a dynamic motor-sensory closed-loop process in which information flows through the environment and the brain in continuous loops&lt;ref name="Dewey1"&gt; Dewey, J.

==Physiology==
{{main article|Sensory system}}
A ''sensory system'' is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing [[sense|sensory]] information. A sensory system consists of [[sensory receptor]]s, [[neural pathway]]s, and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception. Commonly recognized sensory systems are those for [[vision (sense)|vision]], [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[somatic sensation]] (touch), [[taste]] and [[olfaction]] (smell). It has been suggested that the immune system is an overlooked sensory modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bedford|first=F. L. | year = 2011 | title = The missing sensory modality: the immune system | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 40 | issue = 10| pages = 1265–1267 | doi = 10.1068/p7119|pmid=22308900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, senses are [[transducers]] from the physical world to the realm of the mind.

The [[receptive field]] is the specific part of the world to which a receptor organ and receptor cells respond. For instance, the part of the world an eye can see, is its receptive field; the light that each [[Rod cell|rod]] or [[Cone cell|cone]] can see, is its receptive field.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb &amp; Whishaw: ''Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Receptive fields have been identified for the [[visual system]], [[auditory system]] and [[somatosensory system]], so far.
Research attention is currently focused not only on external perception processes, but also to "Interoception", considered as the process of receiving, accessing and appraising internal bodily signals. Maintaining desired physiological states is critical for an organism’s well being and survival. Interoception is an iterative process, requiring the interplay between perception of body states and awareness of these states to generate proper self-regulation. Afferent sensory signals continuously interact with higher order cognitive representations of goals, history, and environment, shaping emotional experience and motivating regulatory behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Farb N. |author2=Daubenmier J. |author3=Price C.

==Types==

===Vision===
{{main article|Visual perception}}

In many ways, vision is the primary human sense. Light is taken in through each eye and focused in a way which sorts it on the retina according to direction of origin. A dense surface of photosensitive cells, including rods, cones, and [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells]] captures information about the intensity, color, and position of incoming light. Some processing of texture and movement occurs within the neurons on the retina before the information is sent to the brain. In total, about 15 differing types of information are then forwarded to the brain proper via the optic nerve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Eye Smarter than Scientists Believed: Neural Computations in Circuits of the Retina | first1=Tim|last1=Gollisch|first2=Markus|last2=Meister | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages=150–164 | date= 28 January 2010 | journal = Neuron | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.12.009| pmid=20152123| pmc=3717333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound===
[[File:Anatomy of the Human Ear en.svg|thumb|right|Anatomy of the human ear. (The length of the auditory canal is exaggerated in this image)]]
{{main article|Hearing (sense)}}
Hearing (or ''audition'') is the ability to perceive [[sound]] by detecting [[vibration]]s. Frequencies capable of being heard by humans are called [[Audio frequency|audio]] or ''sonic''. The range is typically considered to be between 20&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml | title = Frequency Range of Human Hearing | work = The Physics Factbook | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090921163910/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml | archivedate = 21 September 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequencies higher than audio are referred to as [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]], while frequencies below audio are referred to as [[infrasound|infrasonic]]. The [[auditory system]] includes the [[ear|outer ears]] which collect and filter sound waves, the [[ear|middle ear]] for transforming the sound pressure ([[impedance matching]]), and the [[ear|inner ear]] which produces neural signals in response to the sound. By the ascending [[auditory pathway]] these are led to the [[primary auditory cortex]] within the [[temporal lobe]] of the human brain, which is where the auditory information arrives in the [[cerebral cortex]] and is further processed there.

Sound does not usually come from a single source: in real situations, sounds from multiple sources and directions are superimposed as they arrive at the ears. Hearing involves the computationally complex task of separating out the sources of interest, often estimating their distance and direction as well as identifying them.&lt;ref name="eop_constancy" /&gt;

===Touch===
{{main article|Haptic perception}}

''Haptic perception'' is the process of recognizing objects through touch. It involves a combination of [[somatosensory]] perception of patterns on the skin surface (e.g., edges, curvature, and texture) and [[proprioception]] of hand position and conformation. People can rapidly and accurately identify three-dimensional objects by touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klatzky|first1=R. L.|last2=Lederman|first2=S. J.|last3=Metzger|first3=V. A. |year=1985 |title=Identifying objects by touch: An "expert system." |journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics |issue = 4 |pages=299–302 |doi=10.3758/BF03211351 |volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves exploratory procedures, such as moving the fingers over the outer surface of the object or holding the entire object in the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lederman|first1=S. J.|last2=Klatzky|first2=R. L. |year=1987 |title=Hand movements: A window into haptic object recognition |journal=Cognitive Psychology |issue=3 |pages=342–368 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(87)90008-9 |volume=19 |pmid=3608405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haptic perception relies on the forces experienced during touch.&lt;ref name=Robles-de-la-torre2001&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Robles-de-la-torre | first1 = Gabriel | last2 = Hayward | first2 = Vincent | year = 2001 | title = Force can overcome object geometry in the perception of shape through active touch | journal = Nature | pmid = 11473320 | volume = 412 | issue = 6845 | pages = 445–448 | doi = 10.1038/35086588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson defined the haptic system as "The sensibility of the individual to the world adjacent to his body by use of his body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=J.J. |year=1966 |title=The senses considered as perceptual systems. |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-313-23961-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson and others emphasized the close link between haptic perception and body movement: haptic perception is active exploration. The concept of haptic perception is related to the concept of [[extended physiological proprioception]] according to which, when using a tool such as a stick, perceptual experience is transparently transferred to the end of the tool.

===Taste===
{{main article|Taste}}

Taste (or, the more formal term, ''gustation'') is the ability to perceive the [[flavor]] of substances including, but not limited to, [[food]]. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called ''[[taste bud]]s'', or ''gustatory calyculi'', concentrated on the upper surface of the [[tongue]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dNhFLnc6NRkC&amp;lpg=PA201 Human biology (Page 201/464)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102150409/https://books.google.com/books?id=dNhFLnc6NRkC&amp;lpg=PA201 |date=2 January 2017 }} Daniel D.

{{main article|Social perception}}
''Social perception'' is the part of perception that allows people to understand the individuals and groups of their social world, and thus an element of [[social cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith, D. M. Mackie (2000). ''Social Psychology''. Psychology Press, 2nd ed., p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speech====
{{main article|Speech perception}}
[[File:Spectrogram of I owe you.png|right|thumb|Though the phrase "I owe you" can be heard as three distinct words, a [[spectrogram]] reveals no clear boundaries.]]
''Speech perception'' is the process by which spoken languages are heard, interpreted and understood. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how human listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand spoken language. The sound of a word can vary widely according to words around it and the tempo of the speech, as well as the physical characteristics, [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] and mood of the speaker. Listeners manage to perceive words across this wide range of different conditions. Another variation is that [[reverberation]] can make a large difference in sound between a word spoken from the far side of a room and the same word spoken up close. Experiments have shown that people automatically compensate for this effect when hearing speech.&lt;ref name="eop_constancy"&gt;{{cite book|first=Brian C.

The process of perceiving speech begins at the level of the sound within the auditory signal and the process of [[Hearing (sense)|audition]]. The initial auditory signal is compared with visual information — primarily lip movement — to extract acoustic cues and phonetic information. It is possible other sensory modalities are integrated at this stage as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Lawrence D.|last=Rosenblum | editor1-first=David|editor1-last=Pisoni|editor2-first=Robert|editor2-last=Remez | chapter = Primacy of Multimodal Speech Perception | page = 51 | title = The Handbook of Speech Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EwY15naRiFgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22Primacy+of+Multimodal+Speech+Perception%22&amp;ots=0OZ7x69V2R&amp;sig=EqQJlEfphDzrJA32aI1DD4Ku50I#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Primacy%20of%20Multimodal%20Speech%20Perception%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This speech information can then be used for higher-level language processes, such as word recognition.

Speech perception is not necessarily uni-directional. That is, higher-level language processes connected with [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], or [[semantics]] may interact with basic speech perception processes to aid in recognition of speech sounds.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} It may be the case that it is not necessary and maybe even not possible for a listener to recognize phonemes before recognizing higher units, like words for example. In one experiment, Richard M. Warren replaced one phoneme of a word with a cough-like sound. His subjects restored the missing speech sound perceptually without any difficulty and what is more, they were not able to identify accurately which phoneme had been disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren|first=R. M. |year=1970 |title=Restoration of missing speech sounds |journal=Science |volume=167 |pages=392–393 |doi=10.1126/science.167.3917.392 |pmid=5409744 |issue=3917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Faces====
{{main article|Face perception}}
''Facial perception'' refers to cognitive processes specialized for handling human faces, including perceiving the identity of an individual, and facial expressions such as emotional cues.

====Social touch====
{{main article | Somatosensory system#Neural processing of social touch}}
The somatosensory cortex encodes incoming sensory information from receptors all over the body. [[Affective touch]] is a type of sensory information that elicits an emotional reaction and is usually social in nature, such as a physical human touch. This type of information is actually coded differently than other sensory information. Intensity of affective touch is still encoded in the primary somatosensory cortex, but the feeling of pleasantness associated with affective touch activates the anterior cingulate cortex more than the primary somatosensory cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data shows that increased blood oxygen level contrast (BOLD) signal in the anterior cingulate cortex as well as the prefrontal cortex is highly correlated with pleasantness scores of an affective touch. Inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex inhibits the perception of affective touch intensity, but not affective touch pleasantness. Therefore, the S1 is not directly involved in processing socially affective touch pleasantness, but still plays a role in discriminating touch location and intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27225773 | doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1130-15.2016 | pmc=4879201 | volume=36 | title=Encoding of Touch Intensity But Not Pleasantness in Human Primary Somatosensory Cortex | journal=J Neurosci | pages=5850–60 | last1 = Case | first1 = LK | last2 = Laubacher | first2 = CM | last3 = Olausson | first3 = H | last4 = Wang | first4 = B | last5 = Spagnolo | first5 = PA | last6 = Bushnell | first6 = MC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other senses===
{{main article|Sense}}
Other senses enable perception of body balance, acceleration, gravity, position of body parts, temperature, pain, time, and perception of internal senses such as suffocation, gag reflex, intestinal distension, fullness of rectum and urinary bladder, and sensations felt in the throat and lungs.

[[File:USS Nimitz in Victoria Canada 036.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Aircraft carrier]]s such as the [[USS Nimitz (CVN-68)|USS ''Nimitz'']] play an important role in power projection.]]
'''Power projection''' (or '''force projection''') is a term used in [[military science|military]] and [[political science]] to refer to the capacity of a [[Sovereign state|state]] "to apply all or some of its elements of national power — political, economic, informational, or military — to rapidly and effectively deploy and sustain forces in and from multiple dispersed locations to respond to crises, to contribute to [[deterrence theory|deterrence]], and to enhance regional stability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dictionary of Military Terms |author=US Department of Defense |location=New York |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |year=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVgtAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT957&amp;lpg=PT957&amp;dq=%22power+projection%22+jp3-35&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x3krT4mpDt&amp;sig=e7uSp58DYS2dB-cPtHLZglqaCGY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cRHgVLnjC8HZoASWnoKYCA&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22power%20projection%22%20jp3-35&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ability is a crucial element of a state's [[Power in international relations|power]] in [[international relations]]. Any state able to direct its military forces outside the limited bounds of its territory might be said to have ''some'' level of power projection capability, but the term itself is used most frequently in reference to militaries with a worldwide reach (or at least significantly broader than a state's immediate area). Even states with sizable [[hard power]] assets (such as a large [[standing army]]) may only be able to exert limited [[regional power|regional influence]] so long as they lack the means of effectively projecting their power on a global scale. Generally, only a select few states are able to overcome the [[military logistics|logistical]] difficulties inherent in the [[Military deployment|deployment]] and direction of a modern, mechanized military force.

While traditional measures of power projection typically focus on [[hard power]] assets (tanks, soldiers, aircraft, naval vessels, etc.), the developing theory of [[soft power]] notes that power projection does not necessarily have to involve the active use of military forces in [[combat]]. Assets for power projection can often serve dual uses, as the deployment of various countries' militaries during the [[humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] illustrates. The ability of a state to project its forces into an area may serve as an effective diplomatic lever, influencing the decision-making process and acting as a potential [[deterrence theory|deterrent]] on other states' behavior.

==History==

Early examples of power projection includes Roman dominance of Europe: the ability to project power is tied to the ability to innovate and field such innovations. Roman engineering innovations such as machines ([[pile driver]]), concrete, aqueducts and modern roads provided the footing for an economic engine that powered a military that was unmatched in its day. Examples of Roman power projection include Julius Caesar building the [[Caesar's Rhine bridges|Rhine bridge]] in 10 days to demonstrate the ability to march its 40000 troops as it sees fit: the local inhabitants enjoyed the natural protection of the river and fled when this natural protection was overcome. Although Rome is far from the center of modern-power, its influence can be seen in the architecture of modern capitols around the world (domes, arches, columns). The demonstration of an extraordinary innovative military capability will signal power and when properly applied terminate conflicts summarily.

During the [[Ming treasure voyages]] in the 15th century, the Chinese treasure fleet was heavily militarized to exercise power projection around the Indian Ocean and thereby promote its interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wang |first1=Yuan-kang |title=Responding To China's Rise: US and EU Strategies |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-10033-3 |chapter=The Myth of Chinese Exceptionalism: A Historical Perspective on China’s Rise| pages=59–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The modern ability to project power and exert influence on a global scale can be tied to innovations stemming from the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the associated modernizations in technology, communications, [[finance]] and [[bureaucracy]]; this finally allowed the state to create unprecedented amounts of wealth and to effectively marshal these resources to exert power over long distances.

The first such industrial-technological power was the [[British Empire]] in the 19th century. As a maritime power, its strength and ability to project power to further its interests lay in the [[Royal Navy]]. A worldwide system of [[naval base]]s and [[coaling station]]s, a large logistical bureaucracy to oversee shipbuilding, the supply of coal, food, water, and sailors, and an industrial base for the manufacture and technological enhancement of the [[Naval fleet|fleet]] were among the essential ingredients for this capability. During the [[First Opium War]] (1839–42), it was this capacity that enabled a British expeditionary force of 15 [[barracks ship]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, 4 steam-powered [[gunboats]] and 25 smaller boats with 4,000 marines to successfully defend its interests 6,000 miles from the fleet's home port.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{London Gazette|pages=2990–2991|issue=19930|date=15 December 1840}}&lt;/ref&gt; The era of [[gunboat diplomacy]] that this inaugurated was an exercise in Western power projection, and was normally used in the defence of commercial and political interests.

[[File:King Tewodros II.png|thumb|A [[John Tenniel]] in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' showing [[Britannia]] threatening the Abyssinian Emperor [[Tewodros II]] over his imprisonment of several missionaries and British government representatives]]
The Anglo-French [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] sent to shore up the [[Ottoman Empire]] against Russian aggression during the [[Crimean War]] (1853–56) was one of the first examples of a planned expeditionary power-projection campaign. It was the first campaign to use modern technology, including steam-powered warships and [[telegraph]] communications.

Another illustrative example of industrial power projection, was the punitive [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]] in 1868 as a retaliation against Emperor [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia]]'s imprisonment of several missionaries and British government representatives. The expeditionary force sent was a tremendous logistical and technological challenge at the time. Commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Sir Robert Napier]] of the [[Bombay Army]], [[military intelligence]] was used to estimate the required size of the army and the difficulties of traversing the inhospitable terrain.

A force of over 30,000 was shipped from [[British India]] to [[Zula]] on the [[Red Sea]] on a fleet of more than 280 [[steam ship]]s, while an advance detachment of [[engineer]]s built a large port with two piers, warehouses and a lighthouse, and constructed a 20-mile-long railway towards the interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorehead|first=Alan|title=The Blue Nile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_DsNWK_RkYC|publisher=New York: Harper and Row|year=1972|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; A road was also built for the artillery to be moved along with the help of [[elephant]]s. After three months of trekking, the British force repelled an Ethiopian attack and bombarded the fortress of [[Amba_Mariam|Magdala]] into submission; Tewodros committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenson, ''Survival'', p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBZBWQo3whQC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power|last=Ferguson |first= Niall|year=2008|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–05, the [[Japan]]ese destruction of the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Imperial Russian Navy's]] Pacific Fleet demonstrated [[Imperial Russia]]'s inability to project force in the [[Far East|East]]. This immediately diminished Russia's diplomatic sway in that region. At the same time, Russia's western armies became less credible, as [[mobilization]] exposed organizational flaws and threw the western armies into chaos. This led analysts in Europe, such as [[German Empire|German]] [[Chief of staff (military)|chief of staff]] Count [[Alfred von Schlieffen]], to conclude that Russia would prove inept at projecting force in Europe, thus demoting Russia in European diplomatic relations.

Many other actions can be considered projections of force. The 19th century is full of incidents such as the 1864 [[Bombardment of Kagoshima]] and the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. More recently, the [[Falklands War]] provided an example of the [[United Kingdom]]'s ability to project force far from home. Other recent examples of power projection include the U.S.-led [[Invasion of Iraq]] and the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]]. The ability of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], the British [[Royal Navy]], and the [[French Navy]] to deploy large numbers of ships for long periods of time away from home are notable projection abilities.

==Elements==
[[Image:Gulf War C-5A reserve aircraft.jpg|thumb|The cargo hold and intercontinental flight capabilities of the [[C-5 Galaxy]] make it a major asset for deploying military equipment around the globe.]]
The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] defines power projection as the "ability of a nation to apply all or some of its elements of national power—political, economic, informational, or military—to rapidly and effectively deploy and sustain forces in and from multiple dispersed locations to respond to crises, to contribute to deterrence, and to enhance regional stability".&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"&gt;United States Department of Defense. ''J1-02: Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms.'' [http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/p/04211.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"/&gt;

As distance between a fighting force and its headquarters increases, [[Command and control (military)|command and control]] inevitably becomes more difficult. Modern-day power projection often employs high-tech communications and [[information technology]] to overcome these difficulties, a process sometimes described as the "[[Revolution in Military Affairs]]".

While a few long-range [[weapon]]s such as the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) are capable of projecting deadly force in their own right, it is [[military logistics]] that is at the heart of power projection. The ability to integrate [[naval]] and [[air force]]s with land [[army|armies]] as part of [[joint warfare]] is a key aspect of effective power projection; [[airlift]] and [[sealift]] capabilities facilitate the deployment of [[soldier]]s and [[weapon]]s to a distant [[theater (warfare)|theater of war]].

The [[carrier strike group|aircraft carrier strike group]], [[strategic bomber]], [[ballistic missile submarine]], and [[strategic airlift]]er are all examples of power projection platforms. Military units designed to be [[Light infantry|light]] and mobile, such as [[airborne forces]] ([[paratrooper]]s and [[air assault]] forces) and [[amphibious assault]] forces, are utilized in power projection. [[Forward basing]] is another method of power projection, which, by pre-positioning military units or stockpiles of arms at strategically located [[military base]]s outside a country's territory, reduces the time and distance needed to [[mobilization|mobilize]] them.

==Types==
Scholars have disaggregated military power projection into nine different categories based on political goals and level of force. Four of these employ "soft" military power (securing [[sea lane]]s of communication, [[non-combatant]] evacuation, [[humanitarian]] response, and [[peacekeeping]]) and the rest are primarily concerned with "hard" military power ([[wikt:show the flag|show the flag]], compellence/deterrence, punishment, armed intervention, and conquest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ladwig III|first1=Walter C.|title=India and Military Power Projection: Will the Land of Gandhi Become a Conventional Great Power?|journal=Asian Survey|date=November–December 2010|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1162–1183|doi=10.1525/as.2010.50.6.1162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soft power===
{{Main|Soft power}}
Examples of soft power projection include:

* Securing sea lanes of communication: the protection of shipping lanes from attack by hostile states or irregular threats.
* Non-combatant evacuation operations: the evacuation of citizens or friendly third-country civilians from a foreign country when they are endangered by war or civil unrest.
* Humanitarian response: the use of military forces abroad to assist in the aftermath of a natural disaster.
* Peacekeeping: military operations designed to support diplomatic efforts to reach a long-term political settlement to an ongoing dispute.

===Hard power===
{{Main|Hard power}}
Examples of hard power projection include:

* Showing the flag: the symbolic deployment of military forces to a region for the purposes of demonstrating political interest, resolve, or willingness to take more forceful military action.
* Compulsion/deterrence: the use of the threat of military force against another state to either induce it into or dissuade it from pursuing a given policy. In this form, power projection acts as a diplomatic tool, attempting to influence the decision-making process of foreign actors.
* Punishment: the punitive use of force against another state in response to their pursuit of a given policy.
* Armed intervention: the movement of military forces into another nation’s territory for the purposes of influencing the internal affairs of the target country short of outright conquest.
* Conquest: the offensive use of military assets to forcibly occupy territory controlled or claimed by another state.

In [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[philosophy of language]], the '''principle of compositionality''' is the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. This principle is also called '''Frege's principle''', because [[Gottlob Frege]] is widely credited for the first modern formulation of it. However, the idea appears already among [[India]]n philosophers of grammar such as [[Yaska|Yāska]], and also in [[Plato]]'s work such as in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
Besides, the principle was never explicitly stated by Frege,&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, Francis Jeffry. 2001. Did Frege believe Frege’s principle? ''Journal of Logic, Language, and Information'' 10:87–114.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was arguably already assumed by [[George Boole]]&lt;ref&gt;Boole, G. (1854). ''An investigation of the laws of thought: on which are founded the mathematical theories of logic and probabilities''. Walton and Maberly.&lt;/ref&gt; decades before Frege’s work.

==Overview==
The principle of compositionality states that in a meaningful sentence, if the [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] parts are taken out of the sentence, what remains will be the rules of composition. Take, for example, the sentence "Socrates was a man". Once the meaningful lexical items are taken away—"Socrates" and "man"—what is left is the pseudo-sentence, "S was a M". The task becomes a matter of describing what the connection is between S and M.

It is frequently taken to mean that every operation of the [[syntax]] should be associated with an operation of the semantics that acts on the meanings of the constituents combined by the syntactic operation. As a guideline for constructing semantic theories, this is generally taken, as in the influential work on the philosophy of language by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], to mean that every construct of the syntax should be associated by a clause of the [[T-schema]] with an operator in the semantics that specifies how the meaning of the whole expression is built from constituents combined by the syntactic rule. In some general mathematical theories (especially those in the tradition of [[Montague grammar]]), this guideline is taken to mean that the interpretation of a language is essentially given by a [[homomorphism]] between an algebra of syntactic representations and an algebra of semantic objects.

The principle of compositionality also exists in a similar form in the [[Denotational semantics#Compositionality|compositionality of programming languages]].

== Critiques ==

The principle of compositionality has been the subject of intense debate. Indeed, there is no general agreement as to how the principle is to be interpreted, although there have been several attempts to provide formal definitions of it. (Szabó, 2012)

Scholars are also divided as to whether the principle should be regarded as a factual claim, open to [[empirical]] testing; an [[Logical truth|analytic truth]], obvious from the nature of language and meaning; or a [[methodology|methodological]] principle to guide the development of theories of syntax and semantics. The Principle of Compositionality has been attacked in all three spheres, although so far none of the criticisms brought against it have been generally regarded as compelling. Most proponents of the principle, however, make certain exceptions for [[idiomatic]] expressions in natural language. (Szabó, 2012)

Further, in the context of the philosophy of language, the principle of compositionality does not explain all of meaning. For example, you cannot infer [[sarcasm]] purely on the basis of words and their composition, yet a phrase used sarcastically means something completely different from the same phrase uttered straightforwardly. Thus, some theorists argue that the principle has to be revised to take into account linguistic and extralinguistic [[Context principle|context]], which includes the tone of voice used, common ground between the speakers, the intentions of the speaker, and so on. (Szabó, 2012)

{{Jainism}}
[[Jainism]] emphasises that '''ratnatraya''' (triple gems of Jainism) — the right faith (''Samyak Darshana''), right knowledge (''Samyak Gyana'') and right conduct (''Samyak Charitra'') — constitutes the path to liberation. These are known as the triple gems (or jewels) of Jainism and hence also known as ''Ratnatr
== The Path to liberation ==
The very first ''sloka'' (aphorism) of the Sacred [[Jain text]], [[Tattvartha sutra]] reads:{{quote|Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct (together) constitute the path to liberation.|Tattvārthasūtra (1-1){{sfn|Jain|2011|p=2}}}}

Ācārya [[Pujyapada]] writes in ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'' (translated by Prof. S.A. Jain):{{quote|Perfect release from all karmas is liberation. The path to liberation is the method by which it can be attained. The singular ‘path’ is used in order to indicate that all the three together constitute the path to liberation. This controverts the views that each of these singly constitutes a path. Hence it must be understood that these three— right faith, right knowledge and right conduct — together constitute the direct path to liberation.{{sfn|S. A. Jain|1992|p=4}}}}

== The Three Jewels ==
[[File:MahaveeJi.jpg|thumb|The three [[Shikhara|shikhar]] (top) of a [[Jain temple]] represents ''Ratnatraya'' (three jewels)]]

=== Right Faith ===
[[File:Jain flag.jpg|thumb|In [[Jain flag]], three dots above ''swastika'' represents ''Ratnatraya'' ]]
[[File:Samyak Darsana Chart.jpg|thumb|300px|Chart showing Samyak Darsana as per Tattvarthasutra]]

Acharya [[Umaswami]] has written in ''Tattvārthasūtra'' that '''Tattvarthasraddhanam Samyak-darshanam''' (1-2),&lt;ref name=TS&gt;Tattvartha Sutra&lt;/ref&gt; which means "Belief in substances ascertained as they are is right faith."{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=2}}

These seven substances also called ''[[Tattva (Jainism)|tattva]]'' are:{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=7}}-
#'''''jīva'''''- the [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] which is characterized by consciousness.
#'''''ajīva'''''- the non-soul
#''[[Asrava|āsrava]]'' – inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul.
#bondage ([[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]])- mutual intermingling of the soul and ''karmas''
#''[[Samvara]]'' (stoppage)– obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Nirjara]]''– gradual dissociation of karmic matter from the soul
#''[[moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]'' (liberation)- complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul)

Many disciplines of knowledge are developed based on certain fundamental givens, or axioms.  For example, [[Euclidean geometry]] is an [[axiomatic system]], in which all [[theorems]] ("true statements given the axioms") are derived from a finite number of axioms. [[Special theory of relativity]] bases itself on one of the fundamental principles called "The Principle of Invariant Light Speed".  It takes it as given that light in vacuum propagates with the constant speed in terms of any system of inertial coordinates, regardless of the state of motion of the light source. These seven fundamental concepts, provide the metaphysical structure of [[Jain philosophy]].&lt;ref name=MehtaTU&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.ibiblio.org/jainism/database/BOOK/arhat.doc |title= Path of Arhat - A Religious Democracy |author= Mehta, T.U |volume = 63 |publisher = Pujya Sohanalala Smaraka Parsvanatha Sodhapitha |year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the human state of existence, right faith acquired from destruction as well as from destruction-cum- subsidence. An intelligent conviction and profound faith in the essential nature of the soul, of matter, and of their mutual relationships, actions and reactions, is a necessary condition for launching upon the path of liberation.&lt;ref name=JyotiPrasad&gt;Jyoti Prasad Jain Dr. Essence of Jainism, Shuchita Publications, Varanasi, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Jainism declares that a person with the right faith will have spiritual calmness (''Prasanna''), desire for liberation from the endless birth-life-death cycles (''Samvega''), without any attachment or aversion to anything (''Nirveda''), kindness (''Anukampa''), and belief in the ''tattvas'' (fundamental principles) described just above (''āstika'').

=== Right knowledge ===
Jain texts mention that knowledge is of five kinds – sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge, clairvoyance, telepathy, and omniscience.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=5}} Out of these, sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge and clairvoyance may also be erroneous knowledge.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=13}} Most of our knowledge is sensory-based (''mati'') and based on recorded knowledge developed by our ancestors in the form of books, articles, papers and other medium (''sruta''). Jain philosophers also include knowledge acquired directly without any medium. This is achieved by removing the karmic veil on the soul.
*A person who sees objects illuminated by coloured light may not be able to judge the true colour of the objects. However, the same person viewing these objects illuminated by sunlight will see the true nature of their colours, without difficulty. Similarly, proper knowledge is essential to provide the right guidance to the soul in its journey towards spiritual uplifting.
*The Jain theory of knowledge is a highly developed one based on comprehensive apprehension of reality in multitude of view points and relativity.&lt;ref name=JyotiPrasad/&gt;
*[[Anekantavada]], which literally means search of truth from different points of view, is the application of the principle of equality of souls in the sphere of thought. It is a jain philosophical standpoint just as there is the Advaitic standpoint of Sankara and the standpoint of the Middle Path of the Buddhists.&lt;ref name=Ramjee&gt;Singh Ramjee Dr. Jaina Perspective in Philosophy and Religion,Pujya Sohanalala Smaraka Parsvanatha Sodhapitha, Faridabad, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This search leads to understanding and toleration of different and even conflicting views.  When this happens, prejudices subside and the tendency to accommodate increases.  The theory of [[Anekanta]] is therefore a unique experiment of non-violence at the root.&lt;ref name=MehtaTU/&gt;
*A derivation of this principle is the doctrine of [[Syadvada]] which highlights that every view is relative to its view point. For example, an object may seem heavy when carried on planet earth, yet lightweight when carried on the moon, where gravity is different.  It is a matter of our daily experience that the same object which gives pleasure to us under certain circumstances becomes boring under different situations.  Nonetheless relative truth is undoubtedly useful as it is a stepping stone to the ultimate realisation of reality.  The theory of [[Syadvada]] is based on the premise that every proposition is only relatively true.  It all depends on the particular aspect from which we approach that proposition. Jains therefore developed a logic that encompasses sevenfold predication so as to assist in the construction of proper judgement about any proposition.
*[[Syadvada]] provides Jainas with a systematic methodology to explore the real nature of reality and consider the problem in a non-violent way from different perspectives. This process ensures that each statement is expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions, and thus it is known as theory of conditioned predication. These seven propositions are described as follows:
::1.Syād-asti — "in some ways it is"
::2.Syād-nāsti — "in some ways it is not"
::3.Syād-asti-nāsti — "in some ways it is and it is not"
::4.Syād-asti-avaktavya — "in some ways it is and it is indescribable"
::5.Syād-nāsti-avaktavya — "in some ways it is not and it is indescribable"
::6.Syād-asti-nāsti-avaktavya — "in some ways it is, it is not and it is indescribable"
::7.Syād-avaktavya — "in some ways it is indescribable"

*This means, no model of reality is absolute including religious/spiritual/philosophical concepts.  However, each model provides insight into the working of the universe that are useful within the bounds of its framework and therefore useful under certain conditions.

=== Right conduct ===

Right conduct is the application of the knowledge developed, so as to exercise control over our inner desires and reach a stage where there is no attachment or aversion.

Right conduct includes:{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=57}}
* Five kinds of spiritual purity
# ''[[Sāmāyika]]'' (equanimity),
# penalties for faults arising from inadvertence, or negligence, on account of which one loses equanimity,
# refraining from ''himsa'' (injury),
# control of passions, and
# contemplation of one's own soul

* Observance of [[Mahavrata]]s (five major vows) and seven supplementary vows.

The interesting aspect is that on this path there is a place for every one from the beginner to the most advanced seekers. Further, it encompasses all aspects of human life, namely social, personal, economic and spiritual leading to integrated development of the individual.

== Right Faith and Right Knowledge ==
Right view and right knowledge are inter-dependent. For instance, when the clouds disappear, both the heat and the light of the sun are manifested simultaneously. Similarly, when right faith is attained by the soul owing to the subsidence, destruction or destruction- cum-subsidence of faith-deluding karmas, right sensory knowledge and right scriptural knowledge are attained by the soul
at the same time by the removal of wrong sensory and wrong scriptural knowledge.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=4}}

== Right Knowledge and Right Conduct ==
Right Knowledge must be accompanied by Right conduct which is necessary for the destruction of karmic bonds.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=182}} Without it there is no release from the cycle of transmigration, i.e., repeated births and deaths. Just like the light from millions of lamps is of no avail to a blind person, studying scriptures alone is of no use to a person who does not apply them.

=== Stages on the Path to liberation ===
{{main|gunasthana}}
[[File:Fourteen stages.JPG|thumb|Fourteen stages on the Path to liberation]]
Jainism acknowledges that the soul advances to its liberated stage in various steps, called ''Gunasthana''. Jain literature describes these states in detail. The following provides a concise summary on the various statuses of soul on its journey to spiritual advancement.

;Awakening - Developing right view
#Lowest stage with ignorance, delusion, and with intense attachments and aversions.  This is the normal condition of all souls involved in the ''samsara'', and is the starting point of spiritual evolution.
#Indifference to reality with occasional vague memory of spiritual insight.
#Fleeting moments of curiosity towards understanding reality.
#Awareness of reality with trust developed in the right view, combined with willingness to practice self-discipline. The soul may be able to subdue the four passions, namely anger, pride, deceit and greed.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=119}}

;Developing right view and discipline
5. The soul now begins to observe some of the rules of right conduct with a view to perfecting itself.  With the discipline of introductory or minor vows, the soul starts on the process of climbing the spiritual ladder.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Major vows taken up with firm resolve to control passions.  There may be failures due to lack of full control over passions or carelessness.

;Developing self discipline and knowledge
7. Intense practice of vows assisted in better self-control and virtually replaced carelessness with spiritual vigilance and vigor.&lt;br /&gt;
8. Closer to perfect self-control over actions, higher control over mind, thought and passions with the soul ready for reduction of the effects of conduct-deluding karma.&lt;br /&gt;
9. Higher control over removal of passions, and elimination of conduct-deluding karma begins.&lt;br /&gt;
10. Complete elimination of all passions except for subtle degree of attachment.

;Gaining absolute knowledge and bliss
11. Suppressed passions and lingering conduct-deluding karma may rise to drag the soul to lower stages; fleeting experiences of equanimity.&lt;br /&gt;
12. This is the point of no return. All passions as well as conduct-deluding karma are eliminated.  Permanent internal peace achieved.  No new bondage from this point onwards.&lt;br /&gt;
13. All inimical karma destroyed. Omniscience achieved and Arihant stage reached. However the perfected soul is still trapped in the physical body (with right knowledge attained).&lt;br /&gt;
14. This is the last stage on the Path, and is followed by the soul's destruction of the ''aghātiā karmas''. Those who pass this stage are called ''siddha'' and become fully established in Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=121}}

'''Religious terrorism''' is [[terrorism]] carried out based on motivations and goals that may have a predominantly religious character or influence.

In the modern age, after the decline of ideas such as the [[divine right of kings]] and with the rise of [[nationalism]], terrorism has more often been based on [[anarchism]], and [[revolutionary]] politics. Since 1980, however, there has been an increase in terrorist activity motivated by [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Bruce|title=The Confluence of International and Domestic Trends in Terrorism|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=9|issue=2|pages=1–15|date=Summer 1997|doi=10.1080/09546559708427399}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name=Hoffman1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Bruce|title=Inside Terrorism|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-231-11469-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185–99}}

Former [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Warren Christopher]] has said that terrorist acts in the name of ''religion and ethnic identity'' have become "one of the most important security challenges we face in the wake of the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref name=Juerg&gt;{{cite book|last=Juergensmeyer|first=Mark|title=Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence|publisher=University of California Press|year=2004|isbn=0-520-24011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}  However, the political scientists [[Robert Pape]] and [[Terry Nardin]],&lt;ref name=Nardin/&gt; the social psychologists M. Brooke Rogers and colleagues,&lt;ref name=RogersEtAl&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = M. Brooke | display-authors = etal   | date = Jun 2007 | title = The Role of Religious Fundamentalism in Terrorist Violence: A Social Psychological Analysis | url = | journal = Int Rev Psychiatry | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 253–62 | doi = 10.1080/09540260701349399 | pmid = 17566903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sociologist and religious studies scholar [[Mark Juergensmeyer]] have all argued that religion should only be considered one incidental factor and that such terrorism is primarily geopolitical.

==Definition==
According to Juergensmeyer, religion and [[violence]] have had a symbiotic relationship since before the [[Crusades]] and even since before the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name=Juerg/&gt; He defines  religious terrorism as consisting of acts that terrify, the definition of which is provided by the witnesses – the ones terrified – and not by the party committing the act; accompanied by either a religious motivation, justification, organization, or world view.&lt;ref name=Juerg/&gt;{{rp|4–10}}  Religion is sometimes used in combination with other factors, and sometimes as the primary motivation. Religious terrorism is intimately connected to current forces of [[geopolitics]].

[[Bruce Hoffman]] has characterized modern religious terrorism as having three traits:
* The perpetrators must use religious scriptures to justify or explain their violent acts or to gain recruits.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Bruce Hoffman; "A Conversation with Bruce Hoffman and Jeffrey Goldberg" pp. 29–35 in ''Religion, Culture, And International Conflict: A Conversation'', edited by Michael Cromartie. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005 {{ISBN|0-7425-4473-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clerical figures must be involved in leadership roles.&lt;ref name=Hoffman1999/&gt;{{rp|90}}
* Perpetrators use [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] images of destruction to justify the acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Arquilla|editor-first=John|editor2-last=Hoffman|editor2-first=Bruce|editor3-last=Jenkins|editor3-first=Brian Michae|editor4-last=Lesser|editor4-first=Ian O.|editor5-last=Ronfeldt|editor5-first=David|editor6-last=Zanini|editor6-first=Michele|title=Countering the New Terrorism|publisher=RAND|year=1999|location=Santa Monica, CA|isbn=0-8330-2667-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19–20}}

==Martyrdom and suicide terrorism==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
Important symbolic acts such as the blood sacrifice link acts of violence to religion and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dingley|first=James|last2=Kirk-Smith|first2=Michael|title=Symbolism and Sacrifice in Terrorism|journal=Small Wars &amp; Insurgencies|volume=13|issue=1|pages=102–28|date=Spring 2002|doi=10.1080/714005406}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Suicide terrorism]], [[self-sacrifice]], or [[martyrdom]] has throughout history been organized and perpetrated by groups with both political and religious motivations.&lt;ref&gt;Matovic, Violeta, ''Suicide Bombers: Who's Next'', Belgrade, The National Counter Terrorism Committee, {{ISBN|978-8690830923}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian tradition has a long history of heterodoxical and heretical groups which stressed self-immolative acts and scholarship has to some degree linked this to modern political groups such as the [[Irish Republican Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean Farrell Moran, "Patrick Pearse and Patriotic Soteriology: The Irish Republican Tradition and the Sanctification of Political Self-Immolation," in ''The Irish Terrorism Experience'', edited by Yonah Alexander and Alan O'Day, Aldershot, Dartmouth Press, 1991. {{ISBN|978-1855212107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide terrorism or martyrdom is efficient, inexpensive, easily organized, and extremely difficult to counter, delivering maximum damage for little cost. The shocking nature of a suicide attack also attracts public attention.  Glorifying the culture of martyrdom benefits the terrorist organization and inspires more people to join the group. According to one commentator, retaliation against suicide attacks increases the group's sense of victimization and commitment to adhere to doctrine and policy. This process serves to encourage martyrdom, and so suicide terrorism, self-sacrifice, or martyrdom represent "value for money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madsen|first=Julian|title=Suicide Terrorism: Rationalizing the Irrational|journal=Strategic Insights|volume=3|issue=8|date=August 2004|url=http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/2004/aug/madsenAUG04.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511111831/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/2004/aug/madsenAUG04.pdf|archivedate=2009-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Pape, a political scientist who specializes in suicide terrorism, has made a case for secular motivations and reasons as being the foundations of most suicide attacks, which are often labelled as "religious".&lt;ref name=Pape/&gt;

==Financing==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
Terrorism activities worldwide are supported through not only the organized systems that teach holy war as the highest calling, but also through the legal, illegal, and often indirect methods financing these systems; these sometimes use organizations, including [[charities]], as fronts to mobilize or channel sources and funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raphaeli|first=Nimrod|title=Financing of Terrorism: Sources, Methods and Channels|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=15|issue=4|pages=59–82|date=October 2003|doi=10.1080/09546550390449881}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charities can involve the provision of [[aid]] to those in need, and [[oblation]]s or charitable offerings are fundamental to nearly all religious systems, with sacrifice as a furtherance of the custom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Firth|first=Raymond|authorlink=Raymond Firth|title=Offering and Sacrifice: Problems of Organization|journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|volume=93|issue=1|pages=12–24|date=January–June 1963|doi=10.2307/2844331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the concept==
[[Robert Pape]] compiled the first complete database of every documented suicide bombing from 1980–2003. He argues that the news reports about [[suicide attack]]s are profoundly misleading – "There is little connection between [[suicide terrorism]] and [[Islamic fundamentalism]], or any one of the world's religions". After studying 315 suicide attacks carried out over the last two decades, he concludes that suicide bombers' actions stem from political conflict, not religion.&lt;ref name=Pape&gt;{{cite book|last=Pape|first=Robert A.|authorlink=Robert Pape|title=[[Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism]]|publisher=Random House|year=2005|location=New York City, NY|isbn=1-4000-6317-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael A. Sheehan]] stated in 2000, "A number of terrorist groups have portrayed their causes in religious and cultural terms. This is often a transparent tactic designed to conceal political goals, generate popular support and silence opposition."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sheehan [http://www.brookings.edu/events/2000/0210terrorism.aspx Lecture: "A Foreign Policy Event Terrorism: The Current Threat"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102214803/http://www3.brookings.edu/events/2000/0210terrorism.aspx |date=2007-11-02 }}, The Brookings Institution, 10 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry Nardin wrote, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A basic problem is whether religious terrorism really differs, in its character and causes, from political terrorism... defenders of religious terrorism typically reason by applying commonly acknowledged moral principles... But the use (or misuse) of moral arguments does not in fact distinguish religious from nonreligious terrorists, for the latter also rely upon such arguments to justify their acts... political terrorism can also be symbolic... alienation and dispossession... are important in other kinds of violence as well. In short, one wonders whether the expression 'religious terrorism' is more than a journalistic convenience".&lt;ref name=Nardin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nardin|first=Terry|title=Review: Terror in the Mind of God|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=63|issue=2|pages=683–84|date=May 2001|jstor=2691794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor [[Mark Juergensmeyer]] wrote, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...religion is not innocent. But it does not ordinarily lead to violence. That happens only with the coalescence of a peculiar set of circumstances – political, social, and ideological – when religion becomes fused with violent expressions of social aspirations, personal pride, and movements for political change."&lt;ref name=Juerg/&gt;{{rp|10}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
and 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whether or not one uses 'terrorist' to describe violent acts depends on whether one thinks that the acts are warranted. To a large extent the use of the term depends on one's world view: if the world is perceived as peaceful, violent acts appear to be terrorism. If the world is thought to be at war, violent acts may be regarded as legitimate. They may be seen as preemptive strikes, as defensive tactics in an ongoing battles, or as symbols indicating to the world that it is indeed in a state of grave and ultimate conflict."&lt;ref name=Juerg/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Resistance, Politics, and the American Struggle for Independence, 1765–1775''''' is a book that examines the role of nonviolent struggle in the period before the [[American Revolution]]. Edited by Walter H. Conser, Jr., Ronald M. McCarthy, [[David J. Toscano]] and [[Gene Sharp]], the book was published in the United States in 1986. It argues that the [[Stamp Act]] resistance and other campaigns from 1765 to 1775 were fundamental for shaping the outcome of the struggle for American independence, and were not merely a "prelude" to armed conflict.

Nonviolent resistance was at the heart of these campaigns, but key features of this nonviolence have been largely neglected by historians. To fill this perceived gap, the book provides a sustained narrative of the 1765–1775 resistance, followed by a set of interpretive essays aimed to provoke further discussion and inquiry. Six hypothetical explanations are offered for why the colonists shifted to military struggle, despite the considerable success of nonviolent struggle.
Reviews have appeared in several historical and legal journals.&lt;ref name=mills88/&gt;&lt;ref name=ireland88/&gt;&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;

==Origins==
''Resistance, Politics, and the American Struggle for Independence, 1765–1775'' (''RPASI''), claims that most historians of [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial America]] have treated the events of 1765–1775 as merely a "prelude"&lt;ref name=rpasi&gt;{{cite book

to the [[American Revolutionary War|US Revolutionary War]]. Events such as the resistance to the [[Stamp Act]] and [[Townshend Acts]] are typically treated as "not significant in themselves."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|ix}}
This book, however

{{Quote|questions this assumption and suggests that these forms of resistance&amp;mdash;primarily nonviolent ones&amp;mdash;pursued by the American colonists from 1765 to 1775 were of fundamental importance themselves for the outcome of the struggle for independence, shaping the growth of new political, economic, and social institutions which could sustain truly independent self-government.&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|ix}}}}

In their preface, the editors state that their interest in the historical period covered in ''RPASI'' began in the 1970s, when they were studying [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent action]] as a pragmatic tool of civilian struggle. In their work, they
{{Gene Sharp}}

{{Quote|discovered a large number of events in [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonial history]] - [[boycott]]s, nonimportation, noncooperation, and [[protest]] demonstrations of many kinds - all of which could be described as examples of nonviolent action [and] the incidence and success... seemed so significant that we were surprised that the subject had received so little attention. Although many scholars have described the decade in great detail, the richness and importance of the nonviolent activity was lost because of their emphasis on a seemingly inevitable rush toward war.&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|ix}}}}

[[File:SamuelAdamsSmall.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=.35|alt=Samuel Adams portrait closeup|&amp;ldquo;I beseech you... to avoid Blood and Tumult.... Nothing can ruin us but our Violence.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;[[Samuel Adams]], 1774.&lt;ref name=samadams1774&gt;Quoted on page v of ''RPASI''. In a letter from [[Samuel Adams]] to  James Warren, 21 May 1774.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Indeed, "researchers often look throughout the length of a period for evidence of what they regard as its inevitable outcome... for example... for the roots of war.... In the process, they... may ignore the contributions of alternative means to the outcome."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}} An example is that "[[Samuel Adams]], whom many... associate with the tactics of violence, issued numerous statements prior to [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] opposing the use of armed force"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}} (see quote at left).

The book project was originally conceived due to recognition by co-editor [[Gene Sharp]], a leading scholar of nonviolent struggle, that the American colonists had "employed the techniques of nonviolent resistance" &lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|xi}} in their struggle against Great Britain.&lt;ref name=sharpthank&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The preface states that Sharp "has been unfailingly helpful in the other editors' attempt to understand the significance of these actions and has been centrally responsible for placing this work within the context of contemporary Anglo-American scholarship. Editors Conser, McCarthy, and [[David J. Toscano|Toscano]] wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge their great debt to [[Gene Sharp]] and his efforts to make the work as complete and rigorous as possible|''RPASI'', p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The book was sponsored by [[Harvard University]]'s Center for International Affairs, and by the [[Albert Einstein Institution]],&lt;ref&gt;"A book from the Program on Nonviolent Sanctions in Conflict and Defense, Center for International Affairs, [[Harvard University]] and the [[Albert Einstein Institution]]" (''RPASI'', p. ii).&lt;/ref&gt; both led by Sharp. 
The editors claim that the book "if read carefully, is likely to spark scholarly controversy and argument," and that they "believe that such debate can clarify the issues... and enhance the understanding of this critical decade in our history."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|x}}

''Resistance, Politics, and the American Struggle for Independence, 1765-1775'' contains 14 chapters that are intended to "relate integrally to one another and provide a complete narrative of the period [of 1765-1775]."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|x}} These chapters are listed in the table at right.

After the first introductory chapter, the next 7 chapters contain the book's "narrative section,"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}} which focuses on describing the struggles from 1765 to 1775 chronologically, using the "terminology of the day,"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}} and only "rarely [making] use of the term &amp;lsquo;nonviolent action.&amp;rsquo;"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}}
The book's final 6 chapters are analytical, offering interpretations of the decade's events. These chapters address questions raised in the narrative section, and also suggest areas for future research.

Basic concepts are introduced in Chapter 1, which gives an overview of the three main resistance campaigns of 1765 to 1775 opposing the [[Stamp Act of 1765|Stamp Act]] of 1765, the [[Townsend Acts]] of 1767, and the [[Intolerable Acts|Coercive Acts]] of 1774. Nonviolent action is described as a technique that operates to bring about change through serving to "manipulate the shared social, cultural, economic and political system in which the opposing parties engage in conflict."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|15}} Citing Sharp's ''[[Politics of Nonviolent Action]]'', they divide methods of nonviolent action into the three categories of ''nonviolent protest and persuasion'', ''noncooperation'', and ''nonviolent intervention''. Nonviolent action succeeds by "rendering the opponent's sources of power unusable, unworkable, and uncontrollable,"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|16}} through mechanisms that may include conversion, accommodation, or "nonviolent coercion [that] occurs when an opponent is forced against his or her will to grant the actionists' demands."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|16}}

{{Quote|The most dramatic use of nonviolent intervention on the part of the colonists is found in their creation of new governmental bodies such as the provincial congresses and conventions. By receiving overwhelming support from the populace, these extralegal bodies and their local counterparts effectively replaced the Crown's established government in the colonies.&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|15}}}}

The editors argue (Ch. 1) that previous scholarship has overlooked "the degree to which the colonists used a kind of 'weapons system' that operated without force of arms or violence in trying to compel the British government to change its policies."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|4}} Viewed from this angle, commercial resistance (nonimportation) is analyzed closely (Ch. 9). It is apparent that the colonists' skill in applying the methods of nonviolent struggle "improved greatly over the decade," as did the "intellectual underpinnings"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|19}} of their resistance (Chs. 10, 11).

Still, at the close of the decade, the nonviolent movement was abandoned in favor of military resistance, and the editors discuss six alternative hypothetical explanations for why this shift occurred (Ch. 12; see table at right). The hypothetical explanations are not meant as mutually exclusive, but as "avenues for fruitful inquiry."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|453}} Indeed,

{{Quote|The editors believe that definitive conclusions are premature at this time and await the future efforts of skillful scholars sensitive to the issues raised in this volume. What actually went on in the "minds and hearts" of the colonists... will always be difficult to assess [but] the historical record is present for serious examination.&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|453}}}}

[[John Adams]] (quoted above right), who lived through and helped lead the independence struggle, claimed that "The revolution was... substantially effected before hostilities commenced."&lt;ref name=johnadams1815/&gt; McCarthy (Ch. 14) argues that "independence in many of the colonies had essentially been achieved prior to the commencement of military hostilities at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]]."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|20}}

In the ''[[Journal of Southern History]]'', Mills wrote of ''RPASI'' that "Although the work covers familiar ground, the approach is fresh and the treatment is stimulating. The interpretative theme is certain to provoke debate."&lt;ref name=mills88/&gt;{{rp|314}}
He added that "The criticisms one might make of this study are cosmetic (e.g., the considerable variations in the sizes of several chapters) rather than substantive."&lt;ref name=mills88/&gt;{{rp|314}}

In the ''[[Journal of American History]]'', Ireland commended the historical essays as shedding light on important aspects of the American Revolution, stating that "having them collected together in one place is useful."&lt;ref name=ireland88/&gt;{{rp|242}} He was critical of most chapters by the editors as "much less valuable,"&lt;ref name=ireland88/&gt;{{rp|242}} and came away feeling "that I have missed the point, or that there is no point here of any great moment for a historian."&lt;ref name=ireland88/&gt;{{rp|243}}

In ''Law and History Review'', Roeber wrote that ''RPASI'' "includes stimulating essays by ten authors, four British,"&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;{{rp|164}} and

{{Quote|The British contributors... present an image of British domestic tactics of resistance, and ministerial policy on the use of the military that is quite striking.... an impressive documentation of what one might call an eighteenth-century British ethic of restraint, both on the part of aggrieved complainants, and authorities faced with fractious subjects.&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;{{rp|164}}}}

But in the American colonial frontier, "military tactics were acknowledged by all to be more vicious than those employed in European conflicts."&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;{{rp|165}} Thus, for Roeber, "One comes away from this rich and stimulating series of essays with the disturbing sense that Americans had, at the very time of the Republic's founding, been swept up on a tide of violent resistance that fit with their colonial frontier experience."&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;{{rp|165}}

Mills wrote that "One can hope that the challenge to conduct more research into the period from 1774 to 1775 and the shift from nonviolent to violent action will be heeded."&lt;ref name=mills88/&gt;{{rp|314}}

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Rod of Asclepius''' ({{lang-el|Ράβδος του Ασκληπιού}}, {{transl|el|Rábdos tou Asklipioú}}; Unicode symbol: '''⚕'''),&lt;ref name="unicode"&gt;{{unichar|2695|STAFF OF AESCULAPIUS|note=See also [[caduceus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''[https://www.google.co.za/search?q=rod+of+asclepius&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT2pTZ3_veAhWKzKQKHezqBvcQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=973#imgrc=CrWmxxrn0CZnsM: Staff of Asclepius]''' (sometimes also spelled '''Asklepios''' or '''Aesculapius''') and as the '''asklepian''',&lt;ref name=AIM&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilcox |first=Robert A |author2= Whitham, Emma M |title= The symbol of modern medicine: why one snake is more than two |date= 15 April 2003 |url= http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/138/8/673 |journal= Annals of Internal Medicine |accessdate=2007-06-15 |doi= 10.7326/0003-4819-138-8-200304150-00016 |volume= 138 |pages= 673–7 |pmid= 12693891}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a serpent-entwined rod wielded by the Greek god [[Asclepius]], a deity associated with healing and medicine. The symbol has continued to be used in modern times, where it is associated with medicine and health care, yet frequently confused with the staff of the god [[Hermes]], the [[caduceus]]. Theories have been proposed about the Greek origin of the symbol and its implications.

==Greek mythology and Greek society==
The 'Rod of Asclepius' takes its name from the Greek god [[Asclepius]], a deity associated with healing and medicinal arts in Greek mythology. Asclepius' attributes, the snake and the staff are sometimes depicted separately in antiquity, and are combined in this symbol.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 2.26.1–28.1 (here translated by Jones) 2nd A.D.: "The image of Asklepios is, in size, half as big as Zeus Olympios at Athens, and is made of ivory and gold. An inscription tells us that the artist was Thrasymedes, a Parian, son of Arignotos. The god is sitting on a seat grasping a staff; the other hand he is holding above the head of the serpent."&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous temple of Asclepius was at [[Epidaurus]] in north-eastern [[Peloponnese]]. Another famous healing temple (or [[asclepeion]]) was located on the island of [[Kos]], where [[Hippocrates]], the legendary "father of medicine", may have begun his career. Other asclepieia were situated in [[Trikala]], [[Gortys]] (in Arcadia), and [[Pergamum]] in [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]].

In honor of Asclepius, a particular type of non-venomous snake was often used in healing rituals, and these snakes&amp;nbsp;– the [[Aesculapian snake]]s&amp;nbsp;– crawled around freely on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. These snakes were introduced at the founding of each new temple of Asclepius throughout the classical world. From about 300 BCE onwards, the cult of Asclepius grew very popular and pilgrims flocked to his healing temples (Asclepieia) to be cured of their ills. Ritual purification would be followed by offerings or sacrifices to the god (according to means), and the supplicant would then spend the night in the holiest part of the sanctuary&amp;nbsp;– the abaton (or adyton). Any dreams or visions would be reported to a priest who would prescribe the appropriate therapy by a process of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Sigerist. Chapter 3, ''Religious medicine: Asclepius and his cult'', p. 63ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Some healing temples also used sacred dogs to lick the wounds of sick petitioners.&lt;ref name="farnell"&gt;Farnell, Chapter 10, "The Cult of Asklepios" (pp. 234–279)&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Hippocratic Oath]] began with the invocation "I swear by Apollo the Physician and by Asclepius and by Hygieia and Panacea and by all the gods ..."&lt;ref name="farnell" /&gt;

The serpent and the staff appear to have been separate symbols that were combined at some point in the development of the Asclepian cult.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Lock, John M. Last, George Dunea,'' The Oxford Illustrated Companion To Medicine'', 2001, p261 "In early statues of Asclepius the rod and serpent were represented separately."&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of the serpent has been interpreted in many ways; sometimes the shedding of skin and renewal is emphasized as symbolizing rejuvenation,&lt;ref&gt;"Asklepios' reptile was a healing creature: in ancient mythology the snake, whose skin was shed and rejuvenated, symbolized eternity and restoration of life and health" Albert R. Jonsen, ''The New Medicine and the Old Ethics'', Harvard University Press, 1990, p122; this interpretation was current in Antiquity, as can be seen in an account of Apollodorus: "your marvel at the serpent curling around him and say that it is the symbol of the healing art, because just as the serpent sloughs the skin of old age, so the medical art releases from illness." (in E. Edelstein and L. Edelstein (eds.), ''Asclepius: A Collection and Interpretation of the Testimonies'', Baltimore, 1945, p12)&lt;/ref&gt; while other assessments center on the serpent as a symbol that unites and expresses the dual nature of the work of the physician, who deals with life and death, sickness and health.&lt;ref&gt;"[...] the ancient conception of the serpent as the embodiment of the mystery of one absolute life of the earth, which entails a continual dying and resurrection [...] the combination of corruption and salvation, of darkness and light, of good and evil in the Asklepian symbol." Jan Schouten, ''The Rod and Serpent of Asklepios'', Symbol of Medicine, 1967, p2&lt;/ref&gt; The ambiguity of the serpent as a symbol, and the contradictions it is thought to represent, reflect the ambiguity of the use of drugs,&lt;ref&gt;Albert R. Jonsen, ''The New Medicine and the Old Ethics'', Harvard University Press, 1990, p122-123&lt;/ref&gt; which can help or harm, as reflected in the meaning of the term ''pharmakon'', which meant "drug", "medicine", and "poison" in ancient Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Henry E. Sigerist, A History of Medicine, Oxford University Press, 1987, p27-28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Snake oil|Products deriving from the bodies of snakes]] were known to have medicinal properties in ancient times, and in ancient Greece, at least some were aware that snake venom that might be fatal if it entered the bloodstream could often be imbibed. Snake venom appears to have been 'prescribed' in some cases as a form of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Kelhoffer, ''Miracle and Mission'', Mohr Siebeck, 2000, p438-439 "[...] it was known, at least by some people in antiquity, that a snake's venom is not harmful if imbibed, but rather only if it enters directly into a person's blood stream. For example, the first-century CE historian Lucan writes that the younger Cato, when leading his troops through Libya during the Roman Civil War, informed his men about this very point [...] 'The poison of snakes is only deadly when mixed with the blood; their venom is in their bite, and they threaten death with their fangs. There is no death in the cup.'" He also mentions an account of Cornelius Celsus (first century CE) "'For a serpent's poison, like certain hunter's poisons..., does no harm when swallowed, but only in a wound'". "Likewise, Galen relates a rather peculiar healing by Asclepius involving viper's venom. The god appeared to a wealthy man in Pergamum and prescribed 'that he should drink every day of the drug produced from the vipers and should anoint the body from the outside.' [...] The elder Philostratus describes a similar practice of 'the wise Asclepiads,' who 'heal the bites of venomous creatures... using the virus itself as a cure of many diseases.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff has also been variously interpreted. One view is that it, like the serpent, "conveyed notions of resurrection and healing", while another (not necessarily incompatible) is that the staff was a walking stick associated with itinerant physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Menez, ''The Subtle Beast, Snakes From Myth to Medicine'', 2003, p14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucius Annaeus Cornutus|Cornutus]], a Greek philosopher probably active in the first century CE, in the ''Theologiae Graecae Compendium'' (Ch. 33) offers a view of the significance of both snake and staff:
{{quote|Asclepius derived his name from healing soothingly and from deferring the withering that comes with death. For this reason, therefore, they give him a serpent as an attribute, indicating that those who avail themselves of medical science undergo a process similar to the serpent in that they, as it were, grow young again after illnesses and slough off old age; also because the serpent is a sign of attention, much of which is required in medical treatments. The staff also seems to be a symbol of some similar thing. For by means of this it is set before our minds that unless we are supported by such inventions as these, in so far as falling continually into sickness is concerned, stumbling along we would fall even sooner than necessary.&lt;ref name=Edelstein&gt;{{cite book|author1=Emma J. Edelstein |author2=Ludwig Edelstein |title=Asclepius: Collection and Interpretation of the Testimonies|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801857694|page=13|date=February 27, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In any case the two symbols certainly merged in antiquity as representations of the snake coiled about the staff are common. It has been claimed that the snake wrapped around the staff was a species of rat snake, ''[[Elaphe longissima]]'', the Aesculapian snake.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald David Hart, Martin St. J. Forrest, ''Asclepius: The God of Medicine'', 2000, p42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories===
[[File:Dracunculus medinensis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Using a matchstick to wind up and remove a ''Dracunculus medinensis'' worm from the leg of a human]]

Some commentators have interpreted the symbol as a direct representation of traditional treatment of [[dracunculiasis]], the [[Guinea worm]] disease.&lt;ref name=Despommier&gt;[[Dickson Despommier]], ''People, Parasites, and Plowshares: Learning from Our Body's Most Terrifying Invaders'', [[Columbia University Press]], 2016 (first edition in 2013), pages 147-163 (chapter 7 on ''[[Dracunculus medinensis]]''), {{ISBN|9780231161954}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The worm emerges from painful ulcerous blisters. The blisters burn, causing the patient to immerse the affected area in water to cool and soothe it. The worm senses the temperature change and discharges its larvae into the water. The traditional treatment was to slowly pull the worm out of the wound over a period of hours to weeks and wind it around a stick.&lt;ref name=Despommier/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Blayney |first=Keith |title= The Caduceus vs. the Staff of Asclepius |origyear= Sep 2002 |url= http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/138/8/673 |journal= Alternative Journal of Nursing |date= July 2007 |issue=14 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern treatment may replace the stick with a piece of sterile gauze but is otherwise largely identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Management of Guinea Worm Disease (GWD)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/guineaworm/treatment.html|publisher=Centers of Disease Control|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See also the article on [[Nehustan]] which discusses the incident in the biblical Book of Numbers, where the Nehushtan (or Nohestan) (Hebrew: נחושתן or נחש הנחושת) was a bronze serpent on a pole which God told Moses to erect to protect the Israelites who saw it from dying from the bites of the "fiery serpents" which God had sent to punish them for speaking against God and Moses.  King Hezekiah later instituted a religious iconoclastic reform and destroyed "the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and it was called Nehushtan". (2 Kings 18:4)  Many bible students have made the connection between the Rod of Asclepius and the Nehustan, where the stick and serpent were put together in the biblical incident of mass healing. Possibly this was the reason the ancients started to use the snake in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prakash|first1=M|last2=Johnny|first2=JC|title=Things you don’t learn in medical school: Caduceus|journal=J Pharm Bioallied Sci|year=2015|number=77 (Suppl 1)|pages=S49–S50|doi=10.4103/0975-7406.155794|pmc=4439707|pmid=26015747|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-propelled particles''' (SPP), also referred to as '''self-driven particles,''' are terms used by physicists to describe [[autonomous agent]]s, which convert energy from the environment into directed or persistent motion. Natural systems which have inspired the study and design of these particles include walking, swimming or flying animals. Other biological systems include bacteria, cells, algae and other micro-organisms. Generally, self-propelled particles often refer to artificial systems such as robots or specifically designed particles such as swimming [[Janus particles|Janus colloids]], [[nanomotors]] and walking grains. In the case of directed propulsion, which is driven by a chemical gradient, this is referred to as [[chemotaxis|chemotaxis,]] observed in biological systems, e.g. bacteria quorum sensing and ant pheromone detection, and in synthetic systems, e.g. bimetallic nanorods and enzyme molecule chemotaxis. 

==Overview==
Self-propelled particles interact with each other, which can lead to the emergence of collective behaviours. These collective behaviours mimic the self-organization observed with the flocking of birds, the swarming of bugs, the formation of sheep herds, etc.

To understand the ubiquity of such phenomena, physicists have developed a number of self-propelled particles models. These models predict that self-propelled particles share certain properties at the group level, regardless of the type of animals (or artificial particles) in the swarm.&lt;ref name="Buhl et al" /&gt;  It has become a challenge in theoretical physics to find minimal statistical models that capture these behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toner | first1 = J. | last2 = Tu | first2 = Y. | last3 = Ramaswamy | first3 = S. | year = 2005 | url = http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/3397/1/A89.pdf | title = Hydrodynamics and phases of flocks | journal = [[Annals of Physics]] | volume = 318 | issue = 170 | doi = 10.1016/j.aop.2005.04.011 | pages = 170–244 | bibcode=2005AnPhy.318..170T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bertin et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bertin | first1 = E. | last2 = Droz | first2 = M. | last3 = Grégoire | first3 = G. | year = 2009 | arxiv = 0907.4688 | title = Hydrodynamic equations for self-propelled particles: microscopic derivation and stability analysis | journal = [[Journal of Physics A]] | volume = 42 | issue = 44 | page = 445001 | doi = 10.1088/1751-8113/42/44/445001 |bibcode = 2009JPhA...42R5001B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Li et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Li|first1 = Y.

== Examples ==

=== Biological systems ===
Most animals can be seen as SPP: they find energy in their food and exhibit various locomotion strategies, from flying to crawling. The most prominent examples of collective behaviours in these systems are fish schools, birds flocks, sheep herds, human crowds. At a smaller scale, cells and bacteria can also be treated as SPP.

=== Artificial systems ===
[[File:AuPtnanomotor.jpg|thumb|An example of a SPP: a gold-platinum nanorod which undergoes self-propulsion in hydrogen peroxide due to self-electrophoretic forces.|400x400px]]

There is a distinction between wet and dry systems. In the first case the particles "swim" in a surrounding fluid; in the second case the particles  "walk" on a substrate. 

Active colloidal particles, dubbed [[Nanomotor|nanomotors]], are the prototypical example of wet SPP. [[Janus particles]] are colloidal particles with two different sides, having different physical or chemical properties. This [[symmetry breaking]] allows, by properly tuning the environment (typically the surrounding solution), for the motion of the Janus particle. For instance, the two sides of the Janus particle can induce a local gradient of, temperature, electric field, or concentration of chemical species. This induces motion of the Janus particle along the gradient through, respectively, [[thermophoresis]], [[electrophoresis]] or [[diffusiophoresis]]. Because the Janus particles consume energy from their environment (catalysis of chemical reactions, light absorption, etc.), the resulting motion constitutes an irreversible process and the particles are out of equilibrium.  
* The first example of an artificial SPP on the nano or micron scale was a gold-platinum bimetallic nanorod developed by [[Ayusman Sen|Sen]] and Mallouk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Catalytic Nanomotors:  Autonomous Movement of Striped Nanorods|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja047697z|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|date = 2004-10-01|issn = 0002-7863|pages = 13424–13431|volume = 126|issue = 41|doi = 10.1021/ja047697z|first = Walter F.|last = Paxton|first2 = Kevin C.|last2 = Kistler|first3 = Christine C.|last3 = Olmeda|first4 = Ayusman|last4 = Sen|first5 = Sarah K.|last5 = St. Angelo|first6 = Yanyan|last6 = Cao|first7 = Thomas E.|last7 = Mallouk|first8 = Paul E.|last8 = Lammert|first9 = Vincent H.|last9 = Crespi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a solution of hydrogen peroxide, this "nanomotor" would exhibit a catalytic oxidation-reduction reaction, thereby inducing a fluid flow along the surface through self-diffusiophoresis.

* Another Janus SPP was developed by coating half of a polystyrene bead with platinum. These were used to direct the motion of catalytic motors when they were close to a solid surface. These systems were able to move the active colloids using geometric constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Das|first=Sambeeta|last2=Garg|first2=Astha|last3=Campbell|first3=Andrew I.|last4=Howse|first4=Jonathan|last5=Sen|first5=Ayusman|last6=Velegol|first6=Darrell|last7=Golestanian|first7=Ramin|last8=Ebbens|first8=Stephen J.|date=2015-12-02|title=Boundaries can steer active Janus spheres|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms9999|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/ncomms9999|issn=2041-1723|pmc=4686856|pmid=26627125|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E8999D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walking grains are a typical realization of dry SPP: The grains are milli-metric disks sitting on a vertically vibrating plate, which serves as the source of energy and momentum. The disks have two different contacts ("feet") with the plate, a hard needle-like foot in the front and a large soft rubber foot in the back. When shaken, the disks move in a preferential direction defined by the polar (head-tail) symmetry of the contacts.  This together with the vibrational noise result in a persistent random walk.&lt;ref&gt;Deseigne J., Dauchot O. and Chaté H. (2010) [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.098001 "Collective motion of vibrated polar disks"]. ''Physical review letters'', '''105''' (9):098001. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.098001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typical collective behaviour ==
Typical [[collective motion]] generally includes the formation of self-assembled structures, such as clusters and organized assemblies. 

The prominent and most spectacular emergent large scale behaviour observed in assemblies of SPP is directed [[collective motion]]. In that case all particles move in the same direction. On top of that, spatial structures can emerge such as bands, vortices, asters, moving clusters.

Another class of large scale behaviour, which does ''not'' imply directed motion is either the spontaneous formation of clusters or the separation in a gas-like and a liquid-like phase, an unexpected phenomenon when the SPP have purely repulsive interaction. This phase separation has been called Motility Induced Phase Separation (MIPS).

== Examples of modelling ==

The modeling of SPP was introduced in 1995 by [[Tamás Vicsek]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Vicsek1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vicsek | first1 = T. | last2 = Czirok | first2 = A. | last3 = Ben-Jacob | first3 = E. | last4 = Cohen | first4 = I. | last5 = Shochet | first5 = O. | year = 1995 | arxiv = cond-mat/0611743 | title = Novel type of phase transition in a system of self-driven particles | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 75 | pages = 1226–1229 | url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0611743 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1226 | issue = 6 | bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1226V | pmid=10060237}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a special case of the [[Boids]] model introduced in 1986 by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reynolds | first = C.W. | year = 1987 | title = Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model | journal = Computer Graphics | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 25–34 | doi = 10.1145/37401.37406 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.103.7187 | isbn = 0897912276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case the SPP are point particles, which move with a constant speed. and adopt (at each time increment) the average direction of motion of the other particles in their local neighborhood up to some added noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Czirók | first1 = A. | last2 = Vicsek | first2 = T. | year = 2006 | arxiv = cond-mat/0611742 | title = Collective behavior of interacting self-propelled particles | journal = [[Physica A]] | volume = 281 | pages = 17–29 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-4371(00)00013-3 | bibcode=2000PhyA..281...17C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jadbabaie2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jadbabaie | first1 = A. | last2 = Lin | first2 = J. | last3 = Morse | first3 = A.S. | year = 2003 | title = Coordination of groups of mobile autonomous agents using nearest neighbor rules | journal = IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 988–1001 | doi = 10.1109/TAC.2003.812781 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.128.5326 | postscript = &amp;nbsp;– }} convergence proofs for the SPP model.&lt;/ref&gt;{{External media

Simulations demonstrate that a suitable "nearest neighbour rule" eventually results in all the particles swarming together, or moving in the same direction. This emerges, even though there is no centralised coordination, and even though the neighbours for each particle constantly change over time (see the interactive simulation in the box on the right).&lt;ref name="Vicsek1995"/&gt;

Since then a number of models have been proposed, ranging from the simples so called Active Brownian Particle to highly elaborated and specialized models aiming at describing specific systems and situations. Among the important ingredients in these models, one can list 
* Self-propulsion: in the absence of interaction, the SPP speed converges to a prescribed constant value
* Body interactions: the particles can be considered as points (no body interaction) like in the Vicsek model. Alternatively one can include an interaction potential, either attractive or repulsive.  This potential can be isotropic or not to describe spherical or elongated particles.
* Body orientation:  for those particles with a body-fixed axis, one can include additional degrees of freedom to describe the orientation of the body. The coupling of this body axis with the velocity is an additional option.
* Aligning interaction rules: in the spirit of the Vicsek model, neighboring particles align their velocities. An other possibility is that they align their orientations.
One can also include effective influences of the surrounding; for instance the nominal velocity of the SPP can be set to depend on the local density, in order to take into account crowding effects.

===Marching locusts===
Young [[desert locust]]s are solitary and wingless [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]]. If food is short they can gather together and start occupying neighbouring areas, recruiting more locusts. Eventually they can become a marching army extending over many kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Uvarov | first = B. P. | year = 1977 | series = Grasshopper and locust: a handbook of general acridology | volume = II | title = Behaviour, ecology, biogeography, population dynamics | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be the prelude to the development of the vast flying adult locust swarms which devastate vegetation on a continental scale.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Symmons | first1 = P.M. | last2 = Cressman | first2 = K. | year = 2001 | url = http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/common/ecg/347_en_DLG1e.pdf | title = Desert locust guidelines: Biology and behaviour | publisher = [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] | location = Rome }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key predictions of the SPP model is that as the [[population density]] of a group increases, an abrupt transition occurs from individuals moving in relatively disordered and independent ways within the group to the group moving as a highly aligned whole.&lt;ref name="Huepe and Aldana"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huepe | first1 = A. | last2 = Aldana | first2 = M. | year = 2004 | url = http://lims.mech.northwestern.edu/~lynch/IGERT499/huepe-PRL2004.pdf | title = Intermittency and clustering in a system of self-driven particles | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 92 | issue = 16 | page = 168701 [4 pages] | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.168701 | bibcode=2004PhRvL..92p8701H | pmid=15169268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the case of young desert locusts, a trigger point should occur which turns disorganised and dispersed locusts into a coordinated marching army. When the critical population density is reached, the insects should start marching together in a stable way and in the same direction.

In 2006, a group of researchers examined how this model held up in the laboratory. Locusts were placed in a circular arena, and their movements were tracked with computer software. At low densities, below 18 locusts per square metre, the locusts mill about in a disordered way. At intermediate densities, they start falling into line and marching together, punctuated by abrupt but coordinated changes in direction. However, when densities reached a critical value at about 74 locusts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the locusts ceased making rapid and spontaneous changes in direction, and instead marched steadily in the same direction for the full eight hours of the experiment (see video on the left). This confirmed the behaviour predicted by the SPP models.&lt;ref name="Buhl et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buhl | first1 = J. | last2 = Sumpter | first2 = D. J. T. | last3 = Couzin | first3 = D. | last4 = Hale | first4 = J. J. | last5 = Despland | first5 = E. | last6 = Miller | first6 = E. R. | last7 = Simpson | first7 = S.

In the field, according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], the average density of marching bands is 50 locusts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (50 million locusts/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), with a typical range from 20 to 120 locusts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;{{rp|29}} The research findings discussed above demonstrate the dynamic instability that is present at the lower locust densities typical in the field, where marching groups randomly switch direction without any external perturbation. Understanding this phenomenon, together with the switch to fully coordinated marching at higher densities, is essential if the swarming of desert locusts is to be controlled.&lt;ref name="Buhl et al"/&gt;

===Bird landings===
[[File:The flock of starlings acting as a swarm. - geograph.org.uk - 124593.jpg|thumb|right|Flocks of birds can abruptly change their direction in unison, and then, just as suddenly, make a unanimous group decision to land&lt;ref name="Bhattacharya"/&gt;]]
Swarming animals, such as ants, bees, fish and birds, are often observed suddenly switching from one state to another. For example, birds abruptly switch from a flying state to a landing state. Or fish switch from schooling in one direction to schooling in another direction. Such state switches can occur with astonishing speed and synchronicity, as though all the members in the group made a unanimous decision at the same moment. Phenomena like these have long puzzled researchers.&lt;ref name="medicalnewstoday"&gt;{{cite pressrelease | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/201411.php | title = Self-Propelled Particle System Improves Understanding Of Behavioral Patterns | publisher = [[Medical News Today]] | date = 18 Sep 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Bhattacharya and Vicsek used an SPP model to analyse what is happening here. As a paradigm, they considered how flying birds arrive at a collective decision to make a sudden and synchronised change to land. The birds, such as the starlings in the image on the right, have no decision-making leader, yet the flock know exactly how to land in a unified way. The need for the group to land overrides deviating intentions by individual birds. The particle model found that the collective shift to landing depends on perturbations that apply to the individual birds, such as where the birds are in the flock.&lt;ref name= "Bhattacharya"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhattacharya | first1 = K. | last2 = Vicsek | first2 = T. | year = 2010 | arxiv = 1007.4453 | title = Collective decision making in cohesive flocks |bibcode = 2010NJPh...12i3019B |doi = 10.1088/1367-2630/12/9/093019 | volume=12 | journal=New Journal of Physics | pages=093019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is behaviour that can be compared with the way that sand avalanches, if it is piled up, before the point at which symmetric and carefully placed grains would avalanche, because the fluctuations become increasingly non-linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Somfai | first1 = E. | last2 = Czirok | first2 = A. | last3 = Vicsek | first3 = T. | year = 1994 | title = Power-law distribution of landslides in an experiment on the erosion of a granular pile | journal = [[Journal of Physics A|Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General]] | volume = 27 | issue = 20 | pages = L757–L763 | doi = 10.1088/0305-4470/27/20/001 | bibcode = 1994JPhA...27L.757S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Our main motivation was to better understand something which is puzzling and out there in nature, especially in cases involving the stopping or starting of a collective behavioural pattern in a group of people or animals ... We propose a simple model for a system whose members have the tendency to follow the others both in space and in their state of mind concerning a decision about stopping an activity. This is a very general model, which can be applied to similar situations."&lt;ref name="Bhattacharya"/&gt; The model could also be applied to a swarm of unmanned [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], to initiating a desired motion in a crowd of people, or to interpreting group patterns when stock market shares are bought or sold.&lt;ref name="himalayantimes"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Bird+flock+decision-making+revealed&amp;NewsID=257752 | title = Bird flock decision-making revealed | work = [[Himalayan Times]] | date = 2010-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sexual revolution''', also known as a time of '''sexual liberation''', was a [[social movement]] that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality and [[interpersonal relationship]]s throughout the [[United States]] and subsequently, the wider world, from the 1960s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name=allyn&gt;Allyn, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] outside of traditional [[heterosexual]], monogamous relationships (primarily [[marriage]]).&lt;ref&gt;Escoffier, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The normalization of [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], [[public nudity]], [[pornography]], [[premarital sex]], [[homosexuality]], and alternative forms of sexuality, and the legalization of [[abortion]] all followed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Germaine Greer]] and [[The Female Eunuch]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx |title=Abc-Clio |publisher=Greenwood.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709181001/http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formative factors==
[[File:Pouring-water-for-wet-tshirt.jpg|thumb|Youngsters participating in [[Wet T-shirt contest]] during [[Spring break]], USA]]

The term "sexual revolution" has been used since at least the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;The term appeared as early as 1929; the book ''Is Sex Necessary?'' by Thurber &amp; White, has a chapter titled ''The Sexual Revolution: Being a Rather Complete Survey of the Entire Sexual Scene''.&lt;br/&gt;
According to [[w:ru:Душенко, Константин Васильевич|Konstantin Dushenko]], the term was in use in Russia in 1925. {{cite web|url=http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/87856.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504082655/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/87856.html |archivedate=2008-05-04 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some early commentators{{examples|date=September 2018}} believed the period of 1960–1980 was in fact the second such revolution in America, with the first during the [[Roaring Twenties]] after [[World War I]]. Indicators of non-traditional sexual behavior (e.g., gonorrhea incidence, births out of wedlock, and births to teenagers) began to rise dramatically in the mid to late 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Andrew|date=2013|title=The Wages of Sin: How the Discovery of Penicillin Reshaped Modern Sexuality|url=|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=42 | issue = 1 |pages=5–13|via=|doi=10.1007/s10508-012-0018-4|pmid=23054260}}&lt;/ref&gt; It{{what|date=September 2018}} brought about profound shifts in attitudes{{whose|date=November 2018}} toward women's sexuality, homosexuality, pre-marital sexuality, and the freedom of sexual expression.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Psychologists and scientists such as [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Alfred Kinsey]] influenced the changes.{{cn|date=September 2018}} As well, changing mores were both stimulated by and reflected in literature and films, and by the social movements of the period, including the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the women's movement, and the gay rights movement.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;  The counterculture contributed to the awareness of radical cultural change that was the social matrix of the sexual revolution.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}}

The sexual revolution was initiated by those who shared a belief in the detrimental impact of sexual repression, a view that had previously been argued by [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and the [[surrealism|Surrealist movement]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} 

The counterculture wanted to explore the body and mind, and free the personal self from the moral and legal sexual confines of modern America, as well as from 1940s-50s morals in general.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Slack, "Liberalism Radicalized: The Sexual Revolution, Multiculturalism, and the Rise of Identity Politics," {{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/08/liberalism-radicalized-the-sexual-revolution-multiculturalism-and-the-rise-of-identity-politics |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002014520/http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/08/liberalism-radicalized-the-sexual-revolution-multiculturalism-and-the-rise-of-identity-politics |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual revolution of the 1960s was grew from a conviction that the erotic should be celebrated as a normal part of life and not repressed by family, industrialized sexual morality, religion and the state.&lt;ref name="America Divided"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isserman|first=Maurice|title=America Divided|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-976506-5|pages=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the [[The Pill|birth control pill]] in 1960 gave women access to easy and reliable [[contraception]]. Another likely cause was a vast improvement in [[obstetrics]], greatly reducing the number of women who died due to childbearing, thus increasing the [[life expectancy]] of women. A third, more indirect cause was the large number of children born in the 1940s and early 1950s all over the western world—the '[[Baby Boom Generation]]'--many of whom would grow up in relatively prosperous and safe conditions, within a middle class on the rise and with better access to education and entertainment than ever before. By their demographic weight and their social and educational background they came to trigger a shift in society towards more permissive and informalized attitudes.

The discovery of penicillin led to significant reductions in [[syphilis]] mortality, which, in turn, spurred an increase in non-traditional sex during the mid to late 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/did-penicillin-kickstart-sexual-revolution |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005104342/http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/did-penicillin-kickstart-sexual-revolution |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an increase in sexual encounters between unmarried adults.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Callum G.

===The Freudian school===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
[[Sigmund Freud]] of [[Vienna]] believed human behavior was motivated by unconscious [[drive theory|drives]], primarily by the [[libido]] or "Sexual Energy". Freud proposed to study how these unconscious drives were [[Psychological repression|repressed]] and found expression through other cultural outlets. He called this therapy "[[psychoanalysis]]".

While Freud's ideas were sometimes ignored or provoked resistance within Viennese society, his ideas soon entered the discussions and working methods of anthropologists, artists and writers all over Europe, and from the 1920s in the United States. His conception of a primary [[libido|sexual drive]] that would not be ultimately curbed by law, education or standards of decorum spelled a serious challenge to [[Victorian morality|Victorian prudishness]], and his theory of [[psychosexual development]] proposed a model for the development of sexual orientations and desires; children emerged from the [[Oedipus complex]], a sexual desire towards their parent of the opposite sex. The idea of children having their parents as their early sexual targets was particularly shocking to Victorian and early 20th century society.

According to Freud's theory, in the earliest stage of a child's psychosexual development, the [[oral stage]], the mother's breast became the formative source of all later [[erotic]] sensation. Much of his research remains widely contested by professionals in the field, though it has spurred critical developments in the humanities.

[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] Freud scholars [[Otto Gross]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]] (who famously coined the phrase "Sexual Revolution") developed a sociology of sex in the 1910s to 1930s in which the animal-like competitive reproductive behavior was seen as a legacy of ancestral human evolution reflecting in every social relation, as per the freudian interpretation, and hence the liberation of sexual behavior a mean to social revolution.

==The role of mass media==
===Mead's ''Coming of Age in Samoa''===
{{Main|Margaret Mead|Coming of Age in Samoa}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The publication of anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]]'s ''Coming of Age in Samoa'' brought the sexual revolution to the public scene, as her thoughts concerning sexual freedom pervaded academia. Published in 1928, Mead's [[ethnography]] focused on the psychosexual development of Samoan adolescent children on the island of [[Samoa]]. She recorded that their adolescence was not in fact a time of "storm and stress" as Erikson's stages of development suggest, but that the sexual freedom experienced by the adolescents actually permitted them an easy transition from childhood to adulthood. Mead called for a change in suppression of sexuality in America, and her work directly resulted in the advancement of the sexual revolution in the 1930s.

Mead's findings were later criticized by anthropologist [[Derek Freeman]], who investigated her claims of promiscuity and conducted his own ethnography of Samoan society.

===Kinsey and Masters and Johnson===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Alfred&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Kinsey]] published two surveys of modern sexual behaviour. In 1948 Alfred&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Kinsey and his co-workers, responding to a request by female students at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] for more information on human sexual behavior, published the book ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual behaviour in the Human Male]]''. They followed this five years later with ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual behaviour in the Human Female]]''. These books began a revolution in social awareness of, and public attention given to, human sexuality.

It is said that [[public morality]] severely restricted open discussion of sexuality as a human characteristic, and specific sexual practices, especially sexual behaviours that did not lead to procreation. Kinsey's books contained studies about controversial topics such as the frequency of homosexuality, and the sexuality of minors aged two weeks to fourteen years. Scientists working for Kinsey reported data which led to the conclusion that people are capable of sexual stimulation from birth. Furthermore, Kinsey's method of researching sexuality differs significantly from today's methods. Kinsey would watch his research subjects engage in sexual intercourse, sometimes engaging with his subjects as well. He would also encourage his research team to do the same, and encouraged them to engage in intercourse with him, too.

These books laid the groundwork for [[Masters and Johnson]]'s life work. A study called ''Human Sexual Response'' in 1966 revealed the nature and scope of the sexual practices of young Americans.

===The ''Playboy'' culture===
[[File:New York Playboy Club Bunnies aboard USS Wainwright (DLG-28) c1971.jpg|thumb|[[Playboy Bunnies]] aboard US Navy ship ([[USS Wainwright (CG-28)|USS ''Wainwright'']] (CG-28)), 1971]]

In 1953, Chicago resident [[Hugh Hefner]] founded [[Playboy]], a magazine which aimed to target males between the ages of 21 and 45.&lt;ref name=hefsex /&gt; The coverpage and nude centerfold in the first edition featured [[Marilyn Monroe]], then a rising [[sex symbol]].&lt;ref name=marilyn&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=rvwH7euUccIC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=marilyn%20playboy&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=playboy&amp;f=false|page = 75|author = Les Harding|title = They Knew Marilyn Monroe: Famous Persons in the Life of the Hollywood Icon|isbn = 9780786490141|date = 2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pictures were taken when Monroe was an unknown struggling actress and she received $50 for the photo shoot. The photographs were published without her consent and she received no further compensation from Playboy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/01/554854492/marilyn-monroe-helped-hugh-hefner-but-not-by-choice|title=Marilyn Monroe Helped Hugh Hefner, But Not By Choice|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Featuring cartoons, interviews, short fiction, Hefner "Playboy Philosophy" and - most crucially - half-naked female "Playmates" posing provocatively, the magazine became immensely successful.&lt;ref name=hefsex /&gt;  In 1960, Hefner decided to expand his enterprise and opened the first [[Playboy Club]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name=hefsex /&gt;  The private clubs, which expanded in numbers throughout the 1960s, offered relaxation for its members, who were waited on by [[Playboy Bunny|Playboy Bunnies]].&lt;ref name=hefsex /&gt;  While Hefner claimed his company contributed to America's more liberal attitude towards sex,&lt;ref name=hefsex&gt;{{cite book|last=Farber|first=David|title=The 1960s Chronicles|publisher=Legacy Publishing|isbn=141271009X|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; others believe he simply exploited it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a12500409/hugh-hefner-legacy/|title=Hugh Hefner Didn't Start the Sexual Revolution—He Profited from It|last=Valenti|first=Jessica|date=September 28, 2017|work=Marie Claire|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotic novels===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
In the United States in the years 1959 through 1966, bans on three books with explicit erotic content were challenged and overturned. This also occurred in the United Kingdom starting with the 1959&amp;nbsp;Obscene Publications Act and reaching a peak with the LCL&amp;nbsp;court case.

Prior to this time, a patchwork of regulations (as well as local customs and vigilante actions) governed what could and could not be published. For example, the [[United States Customs Service]] banned [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by refusing to allow it to be imported into the United States. The [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' carried great weight among Catholics and amounted to an effective and instant boycott of any book appearing on it. Boston's [[Watch and Ward Society]], a largely Protestant creation inspired by [[Anthony Comstock]], made "[[banned in Boston]]" a national by-word.

In 1959 [[Grove Press]] published an unexpurgated version of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[D.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;Lawrence]]. The [[United States Postal Service|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Post Office]] confiscated copies sent through the mail. Lawyer [[Charles Rembar]] sued the New York City Postmaster, and won in New York and then on federal appeal.

[[Henry Miller]]'s 1934 novel, ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', had explicit sexual passages and could not be published in the United States; an edition was printed by the [[Obelisk Press]] in Paris and copies were smuggled into the United States. ({{As of|2003}}, used book dealers asked $7,500 and more for copies of this edition.) In 1961 Grove Press issued a copy of the work, and dozens of booksellers were sued for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court's]] 1964 decision in ''Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein''.

In 1963 Putnam published [[John Cleland]]'s 1750&amp;nbsp;novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]''. This was the turning point, because [[Charles Rembar]] appealed a restraining order against it all the way to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court and won. In ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts]]'', 383&amp;nbsp;U.S.&amp;nbsp;413, the court ruled that sex was "a great and mysterious motive force in human life", and that its expression in literature was protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

===Nonfiction===
Only books primarily appealing to "prurient interest" could be banned. In a famous phrase, the court said that obscenity is "utterly without redeeming social importance"—meaning that, conversely, any work with redeeming social importance was not obscene, even if it contained isolated passages that could "deprave and corrupt" some readers. This decision was especially significant, because, of the three books mentioned, ''Fanny Hill'' has by far the largest measure of content that seems to appeal to prurient interest, and the smallest measures of [[literary merit]] and "redeeming social importance". Whereas an expurgated version of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' had actually once been published, no expurgated version of ''Fanny Hill'' had ever been. By permitting the publication of ''Fanny Hill'', the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court set the bar for any ban so high that Rembar himself called the 1966&amp;nbsp;decision "the end of obscenity".

The court decisions that legalised the publication of ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' had an even more important effect: freed from fears of legal action, nonfiction works about sex and sexuality started to appear more often.

In 1962, [[Helen Gurley Brown]] published ''[[Sex and the Single Girl]]: The Unmarried Woman's Guide to Men, Careers, the Apartment, Diet, Fashion, Money and Men.'' The title itself would have been unthinkable a decade earlier. (In 1965 she went on to transform ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine into a life manual for young career women.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}})

In 1969 [[Terry Garrity|Joan Garrity]], identifying herself only as "J.", published ''[[The Sensuous Woman|The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman]]'', with information on exercises to improve the dexterity of one's tongue and how to have anal sex.

The same year saw the appearance of Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[David Reuben (sex author)|David Reuben's]] book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]''. Despite the dignity of Reuben's medical credentials, this book was light-hearted in tone.

In 1970 the Boston Women's Health Collective published ''Women and Their Bodies'' (which became far better known a year later under its subsequent title ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]''). Not an erotic treatise or sex manual, the book nevertheless included frank descriptions of sexuality, and contained illustrations that could have caused legal problems just a few years earlier.

[[Alex Comfort]]'s ''[[The Joy of Sex]]: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making'' appeared in 1972. In later editions though, Comfort's libertinism was tamed as a response to [[AIDS]].

In 1975 [[Will McBride (photographer)|Will McBride's]] ''Zeig Mal!'' ([[Show Me!]]), written with psychologist Helga Fleichhauer-Hardt for children and their parents, appeared in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic. Appreciated by many parents for its frank depiction of pre-adolescents discovering and exploring their sexuality, it scandalised others and eventually it was pulled from circulation in the United States and some other countries. It was followed in 1989 by ''Zeig Mal Mehr!'' ("Show Me More!").

These books had a number of things in common. They were factual and, in fact, educational. They were available to a mainstream readership. They were stacked high on the tables of discount bookstores, they were book club selections, and their authors were guests on late-night talk shows. People were seen reading them in public.

Earlier books such as ''What Every Girl Should Know'' ([[Margaret Sanger]], 1920) and ''A Marriage Manual'' (Hannah and Abraham Stone, 1939) had broken the silence in which many people, women in particular, had grown up in.

By the 1950s, in the United States, it had become rare for women to go into their wedding nights not knowing what to expect. But the open discussion of sex as pleasure, and descriptions of sexual practices and techniques, was revolutionary. There were practices which, perhaps, some had heard of. But many adults did not know for sure whether they were realities, or fantasies found only in pornographic books.

The Kinsey report revealed that these practices were, at the very least, surprisingly frequent. These other books asserted, in the words of a 1980&amp;nbsp;book by Dr.&amp;nbsp;Irene Kassorla, that ''Nice Girls Do — And Now You Can Too''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Television===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Television, the new mass communication device of the age, along with other media outlets such as radio and magazines, could broadcast information in a matter of seconds to millions of people, while only a few wealthy people would control what millions could watch. Some modern historians have theorized that these media outlets helped to spread new ideas, which were considered radical. The struggles, skirmishes and rhetorical confrontations happening in the course of these movements also became directly visible to ordinary people in a way they would never have been before; the sense of involvement in a social and sexual shift happening in the present could rapidly win new converts and spread discussions afield. The counterculture of the 1960s was becoming well known through radio, newspapers, TV, books, music and other media by the end of the 1960s.

===Pornographic film===
In 1969, ''[[Blue Movie]]'', directed by [[Andy Warhol]], was the first [[pornographic|adult erotic film]] depicting explicit [[sex]] to receive wide theatrical release in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="NYT-19690722"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review - Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231190855/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |archivedate=December 31, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WS-2002-2005"&gt;{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=Blue Movie (1968) |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |date=2005 |work=WarholStars.org |accessdate=December 29, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230082332/http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |archivedate=December 30, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19690810"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

By the mid-1970s and through the 1980s, newly won sexual freedoms were being exploited by big businesses looking to capitalize on an increasingly permissive society, with the advent of public and hardcore [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bannon |first=Ann |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1560255250/ref=sib_dp_pt/104-9728303-1778302#reader-link/ |title=Sexual Revolution (9781560255253): Jeffrey Escoffier, Fred W.

==Modern revolutions==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
The [[Industrial Revolution]] during the nineteenth century and the growth of [[science]] and [[technology]], [[medicine]] and [[health care]], resulted in better [[contraceptives]] being manufactured. Advances in the manufacture and production of [[rubber]] made possible the design and production of [[condom]]s that could be used by hundreds of millions of men and women to prevent [[pregnancy]] at little cost. Advances in [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], and [[biology]], and human [[physiology]] led to the discovery and perfection of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|first oral contraceptives]], popularly known as "the Pill." 

All these developments took place alongside and combined with an increase in world [[literacy]] and decline in religious observance. Old values such as the biblical notion of "be fruitful and multiply" were cast aside as people continued to feel alienated from the past and adopted the lifestyles of progressive modernizing cultures.

Another contribution that helped bring about this modern revolution of sexual freedom were the writings of [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], who took the philosophy of [[Karl Marx]] and similar philosophers.

When speaking of sexual revolution, historians&lt;ref&gt;The First Sexual Revolution: The Emergence of Male Heterosexuality in Moderm America. By Kevin White (New York: New York University Press: 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; make a distinction between the first and the second sexual revolution. In the first sexual revolution (1870–1910), to caucasians, Victorian morality lost its universal appeal. However, it did not lead to the rise of a "permissive society". Exemplary for this period is the rise and differentiation in forms of regulating sexuality.

"[[No-fault divorce|No-fault]]" unilateral [[divorce]] became legal and easier to obtain in many countries during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

The women's movement redefined sexuality, not in terms of simply pleasing men but recognizing women's sexual satisfaction and sexual desire. "[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]]" by [[Anne Koedt]] illustrates an understanding of a women's sexual anatomy, arguing  against Freud's "assumptions of women as inferior appendage to man, and her consequent social and psychological role."&lt;ref name="Vaginal Orgasm"&gt;{{cite web|last=Koedt |first=Anne |title=The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |accessdate=16 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106211856/http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |archivedate=6 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women's movement was able to develop lesbian feminism, freedom from heterosexual act, and freedom from reproduction. Feminist [[Betty Friedan]] published the [[Feminine Mystique]] in 1963, concerning the many frustrations women had with their lives and with separate spheres which established a pattern of inequality.

[[File:CDFrontInsert.FreedomToLove.Pride.WDC.31May2009.jpg|thumb|1997 [[LGBT]] poster, New York City]]
The [[Gay Rights Movement]] started when the [[Stonewall Riots]] of 1969 crystallized a broad grass-roots mobilization. New gay liberationist gave political meaning to "coming out" by extending the psychological-personal process into public life. During the 1950s the most feared thing of the homosexual culture was "coming out", the homosexual culture of the 1950s did everything they could to help keep their sexuality a secret from the public and everyone else in their lives, but Alfred Kinsey's research on homosexuality alleged that 39% of the unmarried male population had had at least one homosexual experience to orgasm between adolescence and old age.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt; The "coming out" phenomenon helped mobilize people to live full-time as a homosexual, they no longer had to live in secret. They no longer had to sneak around and occasionally receive the sexual attention that they desire or force themselves into a heterosexual relationship in which they had no interest, and was full of lies. [[Brad Gooch]] wrote in the "Golden Age of Promiscuity" that the gay male community finally had reached a rich culture of "easy sex", sex without commitment, obligation or long-term relationships.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}}

==Feminism and sexual liberation==
{{npov-section|date=September 2018}}
Coinciding with [[second-wave feminism]] and the [[women's liberation movement]] initiated in the early 1960s, the sexual liberation movement was aided by feminist ideologues in their mutual struggle to challenge traditional ideas regarding [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]] and [[queer]] sexuality. Elimination of undue favorable bias towards men and objectification of women as well as support for women's right to choose her sexual partners free of outside interference or judgement were three of the main goals associated with sexual liberation from the feminist perspective. Since during the early stages of feminism, women's liberation was often equated with sexual liberation rather than associated with it. Many feminist thinkers believed that assertion of the primacy of sexuality would be a major step towards the ultimate goal of women's liberation, thus women were urged to initiate sexual advances, enjoy sex and experiment with new forms of sexuality.&lt;ref name="Ending Female Sexual Oppression"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hooks|first=Bell|title=Feminist Theory, From Margin To Centre|year=1984|publisher=South End Press classics|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-89608-613-5|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist movements insisted and focused on the sexual liberation for women, both physical and psychological. The pursuit of sexual pleasure for women was the core ideology, which subsequently was to set the foundation for female independence. Although whether or not sexual freedom should be a feminist issue is currently a much-debated topic,&lt;ref name="Ending Female Sexual Oppression" /&gt; the feminist movement overtly defines itself as the movement for social, political, and economic equality of men and women.&lt;ref name="What is Feminism"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baumgardner and Richards|title=What Is Feminism|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/whatisfem.htm|accessdate=27 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406000204/http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/whatisfem.htm|archivedate=6 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist movements are also involved the fight against sexism and since sexism is a highly complex notion,&lt;ref name="Sexism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cudd|first=Ann|title=Feminist Theory A Philosophical Anthology|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-1660-2|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to separate the feminist critique toward sexism from its fight against sexual oppression.

The feminist movement has helped create a social climate in which LGBT people and women are increasingly able to be open and free with their sexuality,&lt;ref name="Ending Female Sexual Oppression 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hooks|first=Bell|title=Feminist Theory, From Margin To Centre|year=1984|publisher=South End Press classics|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-89608-613-5|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enabled a spiritual liberation of sorts with regards to sex. Rather than being forced to hide their sexual desires or feelings, women and LGBT people have gained and continue to gain increased freedom in this area.  Consequently, the feminist movement to end sexual oppression has and continues to directly contribute to the sexual liberation movement.

Nevertheless, among many feminists, the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]], had been largely gained by men at women's expense.&lt;ref name="Willis 1984 121"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willis|first=Ellen|author-link=Ellen Willis|title=Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism |journal=Social Text |volume=9/10: The 1960s without Apology |year=1984|page=121|jstor=466537|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[Anticlimax (book)|[Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution]]'', [[Sheila Jeffreys]] asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism.&lt;ref name="Zoftig 1982 88"&gt;{{citation | last = Zoftig | first = Sarah | contribution = Coming out | editor-last = SAMOIS | editor-link = Samois | title = Coming to power: writings and graphics on lesbian S/M: S/M, a form of eroticism based on a consenual exchange of power | page = 88 | publisher = Alyson Publications | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1982 | isbn = 9780932870285 | edition = 2nd | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vance 1992 302"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vance | first = Carole S. | title = Pleasure and danger: exploring female sexuality | page = 302 | publisher = Pandora Press  | location = London New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780044408673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{citation | last = Egerton | first = Jane | contribution = Sheila Jeffreys | editor-last = Gilbert | editor-first = Harriett | editor-link = Harriett Gilbert | title = The sexual imagination from Acker to Zola: a feminist companion | page = 133 | publisher = Jonathan Cape | location = London | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780224035354 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denfeld 1995 35"&gt;{{citation | last = Denfeld | first = Rene | author-link = Rene Denfeld | contribution = The antiphallic campaign: male bashing and sexual politics | editor-last = Denfeld | editor-first = Rene | editor-link = Rene Denfeld | title = The new Victorians: a young woman's challenge to the old feminist order | pages = 35 | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | location = St Leonards, New South Wales | year = 1995 | isbn = 9781863737890 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[feminist sex wars]] broke out due to disagreements [[Feminist views on pornography|on pornography]], [[Feminist views on prostitution|on prostitution]], and [[Feminist views on BDSM|on BDSM]], as well as [[Feminist views on sexuality|sexuality in general]].


==Contraception==
As [[birth control]] became widely accessible, men and women began to have more choice in the matter of having children than ever before. The 1916 invention of thin, disposable [[latex]] [[condom]]s for men led to widespread affordable condoms by the 1930s; the demise of the [[Comstock laws]] in 1936 set the stage for promotion of available effective contraceptives such as the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] and [[cervical cap]]; the 1960s introduction of the [[IUD]] and [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]] for women gave a sense of freedom from [[barrier contraception]]. The opposition of Churches (e.g.&amp;nbsp;''[[Humanae vitae]]'') led to parallel movements of [[secularization]] and exile from religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/0725/1216917534395.html |title=Fri, Jul 25, 2008 - 'Humanae Vitae' birth control ban set off a wave of dissent |publisher=The Irish Times |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2011-11-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122234704/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/0725/1216917534395.html |archivedate=2011-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women gained much greater access to birth control in the "girls world" decision in 1965, in the 1960s and 1970s the birth control movement advocated for the legalization of abortion and large scale education campaigns about contraception by governments.

==United Kingdom==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Influenced by and exposed to the revolution in America, the UK had a similar, though smaller experience.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the new generation growing up after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] had grown tired of the rationing and austerity of the 1940s and 1950s and the Victorian values of their elders, so the 1960s were a time of rebellion against the fashions and social [[mores]] of the previous generation.

An early inkling of changing attitudes came in 1960, when the government of the day tried unsuccessfully to prosecute [[Penguin Books]] for obscenity, for publishing the [[D. H. Lawrence]] novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'', which had been banned since the 1920s for what was considered racy content. The prosecution counsel [[Mervyn Griffith-Jones]] famously stood in front of the jury and asked, in his closing statement: "Is it a book you would wish your wife or servants to read?" When the case collapsed, the novel went on to become a bestseller, selling two&amp;nbsp;million copies.

The Pill became available free of charge on the [[National Health Service]] in the 1960s, at first restricted to married women, but in 1968 its availability was extended to all women.

In 1967, laws prohibiting abortion and male homosexuality were repealed, although the age of consent for homosexual men was set at 21, in contrast to the heterosexual age of consent of 16. This is how it stayed until 1994, when the male homosexual age of consent was lowered to 18, and then equalised at 16 in 2001. Also in 2001, lesbian sex was recognised in British law for the first time ever, with an age of consent of 16.

==Free love==
{{Main|Free love}}
Beginning in [[San Francisco]] in the mid-1960s, a new culture of "[[free love]]" emerged, with thousands of young people becoming "[[hippies]]", inspired by [[India]]n culture, who preached the power of love and the beauty of sex as part of ordinary life. This is part of a [[counterculture]] that continues to exist. By the 1970s, it was socially acceptable for colleges to permit co-ed housing.

Free love continued in different forms throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, but its more assertive manifestations ended abruptly (or at least disappeared from public view) in the mid-1980s when the public first became aware of [[AIDS]], a deadly sexually-transmitted disease.

==Explicit sex on screen and stage==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
Swedish filmmakers like [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Vilgot Sjöman]] contributed to sexual liberation with sexually themed films that challenged conservative international standards. The 1951 film ''[[Hon dansade en sommar]]'' (''She Danced One Summer AKA One Summer of Happiness'') (directed by [[Arne Mattsson]]) starring [[Ulla Jacobsson]] and [[Folke Sundquist]] was notable in this regard for depicting explicit nudity, including nude bathing in a lake.

This film, as well as Bergman's ''[[Sommaren med Monika]]'' (''The Summer with Monika'', 1951) and ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|Tystnaden]] (The Silence'', 1963), caused an international uproar, not least in the United States, where the films were charged with violating standards of decency. Vilgot Sjöman's film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'', also created waves of international outcry, but it was very popular in the United States. Another of his films, ''[[491 (film)|491]]'', highlighted homosexuality among other things. ''[[Language of Love|Kärlekens språk]]'' (''The Language of Love'') was an informative documentary about sex and sexual techniques that featured the first real act of sex in a mainstream film, and inevitably it caused intense debate around the world.

From these films the concept (or catchphrase) of "Swedish sin" (licentiousness and seductive nudity) developed, even though Swedish society in the 1950s was still fairly conservative regarding sex, and the international concept of Swedish sexuality was and is largely exaggerated. The image of "hot love and cold people" emerged. Sexual liberalism was seen as part of the modernization process that, by breaking down traditional borders, would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Carl |last1=Marklund |title=Hot Love and Cold People. Sexual Liberalism as Political Escapism in Radical Sweden |year=2009 |journal=NORDEUROPAforum |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=83–101 |url=http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2009-1/marklund-carl-83/XML/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217062419/http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2009-1/marklund-carl-83/XML/ |archivedate=2012-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These films caused debate there as well. The films eventually progressed the public's attitude toward sex, especially in Sweden and other northern European countries, which today tend to be more sexually liberal than others. In Sweden and nearby countries at the time, these films, by virtue of being made by directors who had established themselves as leading names in their generation, helped delegitimize the idea of habitually demanding that films should avoid overtly sexual subject matter. It proved hard to question the seriousness of purpose of Bergman, Sjöman and others, and in their wake a consciously permissive and questioning attitude to sex, nudity and "difficult" subject matter in film - and on TV - became the new standard framework.

Explicit sex on screen and [[frontal nudity]] of men and women on stage became acceptable in many Western countries, as the twentieth century drew towards its close. Special places of entertainment offering [[striptease]] and [[lap dancing]] proliferated, and limits to 'acceptable' dress in pop/rock music and at [[discotheque]]s and live music festivals, especially open-air festivals ever since the flower-power generation and [[Woodstock]] (1969), became very vague, both among performers and in the audiences or attendee crowd. The rich use of [[crossdressing]] and [[androgyne|androgynous]] attributes and clothes in rock and pop stage costumes and even references to this in song lyrics, to express sexual, fashion or literary themes is also notable, from the [[Velvet Underground]] (in [[Lou Reed]]'s lyrics) and the [[glam rock]] wave and onward. All of this persists in the early 21st century.

In many Western countries, nudity is used as a part of artistic or erotic performance, such as in nude [[body painting]], [[sex show]], [[striptease]], [[Neo-Burlesque]], and in adult-only public events like [[Folsom Street Fair]], [[Nudes-A-Poppin']], [[Fantasy Fest]], etc.

==Normalization of pornography==
{{Further|History of pornography|Golden Age of Porn}}
Sexual character is closely linked with developments in technology, and the somewhat more open and commercial circulation of pornography was a new phenomenon at the time of the sexual revolution. Pornography operated as a form of "cultural critique" insofar as it transgresses societal conventions. [[Manuel Castells]] claims that the online communities, which emerged (from the 1980s) around early bulletin board systems originated from the ranks of those who had been part of the counterculture movements and alternative way of life emerging out of the sexual revolution.&lt;ref name=Pronography&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garlick |first=Steve |title=A New Sexual Revolution? Critical Theory, Pornography, and the Internet |journal=Canadian Review of Sociology |date=August 2011 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=221–239 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01264.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01264.x/abstract |accessdate=14 December 2012 |pmid=22214041 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319215111/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01264.x/abstract |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lynn Hunt]] points out that early modern "pornography" (18th century) is marked by a "preponderance of female narrators", that the women were portrayed as independent, determined, financially successful (though not always socially successful and recognized) and scornful of the new ideals of female virtue and domesticity, and not objectifications of women's bodies as many view pornography today. The sexual revolution was not unprecedented in identifying sex as a site of political potential and social culture. It was suggested during the sexual revolution that the interchangeability of bodies within pornography had radical implications for gender differences and that they could lose their meaning or at least redefine the meaning of gender roles and norms.&lt;ref name=Pronography /&gt; Porn had portrayed sexual activity honestly and bluntly in fiction, on stage and in movies. It could reinforce the crudest stereotypes of sex roles, standards of beauty, and power dynamics or educate about human desire.

In 1971 ''[[Playboy]]'' stopped airbrushing pubic hair out of its centerfold picture spreads; this new addition caused the magazine to hit its all-time peak circulation of more than seven million copies in 1972 and men started having more choices when it came to magazines.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

In 1972 ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' became a popular movie for heterosexual couples. The movie played all over America and was the first porn movie to earn a gross of a million dollars.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

The fact that [[pornography]] was less stigmatised by the end of the 1980s, and more mainstream movies depicted [[sexual intercourse]] as entertainment, was indicative of how normalised sexual revolution had become in society. Magazines depicting nudity, such as the popular ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazines, won some acceptance as mainstream journals, in which public figures felt safe expressing their fantasies.

Feminists have offered mixed responses to pornography. Some figures in the [[feminist]] movement, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], challenged the depiction of women as objects in these pornographic or "urban men's" magazines. Other feminists such as [[Betty Dodson]] went on to found the [[pro-sex feminist]] movement in response to anti-pornography campaigns.
In India, an organization named Indians For Sexual Liberties is advocating the legalization of the porn business in India. The organization's founder, Laxman Singh, questioned the reasoning behind deeming as illegal the depiction of legal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-freedom-parade-at-Jantar-Mantar-this-weekend/articleshow/12616275.cms |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230150423/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-freedom-parade-at-Jantar-Mantar-this-weekend/articleshow/12616275.cms |archivedate=2016-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premarital sex==
[[Premarital sex]], which had been heavily stigmatised for some time became more widely accepted during the sexual revolution. The increased availability of [[birth control]] (and the quasi-legalisation of [[abortion]] in some places) helped reduce the chance that pre-marital sex would result in unwanted children. By the mid-1970s the majority of newly married American couples had experienced sex before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis and facts about how technological advance in contraception changed the cost/benefit analysis for engaging in premaritial sex, see Fernández-Villaverde, Greenwood, and Guner (2014) "From Shame to Game in One Hundred Years: An Economic Model of the Rise in Premarital Sex and its De-Stigmitization," ''[[Journal of the European Economic Association]]'', '''12''' (1): 25-61. The research is summerized in this video: {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR366Gq-5Sg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026114212/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR366Gq-5Sg |archivedate=2015-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central part of the sexual revolution was the development of relationships between unmarried adults, which resulted in earlier sexual experimentation reinforced by a later age of marriage. The counterculture and the [[new left]] were the source of this later age of marriage. Americans were attending colleges and rebelling against their parents' ideals, which caused them to marry later in age, if at all. This meant that on average, Americans were becoming more sexually experienced before they entered into monogamous relationships. The increasing divorce rate and the decreasing stigma attached to divorce during this era also contributed to sexual experimentation.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;  By 1971, more than 75% of Americans thought that premarital sex was okay, a threefold increase from the 1950s, and the number of unmarried Americans aged twenty to twenty-four more than doubled from 1960 to 1976. Americans were becoming less and less interested in getting married and settling down and less interested in monogamous relationships. In 1971, 35% of the country said they thought marriage was obsolete.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

The idea of marriage being out-of-date came from the new development of casual sex between Americans. With the development of the birth control pill and the legalization of abortion in 1973, there was little threat of unwanted children out of wedlock. Also, during this time every sexually transmitted disease was treatable; there was no incurable bacterial STDs, no AIDS.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

Swinger clubs were organizing in places ranging from the informal suburban home to disco-sized emporiums that promised a smorgasbord of sexual possibilities and free mouthwash. In New York City in 1977, Larry Levenson opened [[Plato's Retreat]] it was probably the closest that heterosexual America has ever gotten to the sexual frenzy of gay bathhouses. The retreat was eventually shut down in 1985 because of the constant hassle from public health authorities.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

==Politics of sex==
[[Politics]] in the United States has become intertwined with sexually related issues, called the "politics of sex".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} A differing view of abortion pitted [[pro-life]] activists against [[pro-choice]] activists.

Women and men who lived with each other without marriage sought "[[palimony]]" equal to the [[alimony]].{{sfn|Abidin|2007|p=}} Teenagers assumed their right to a sexual life with whomever they pleased, and bathers fought to be topless or nude at beaches.{{sfn|Abidin|2007|p=}}

==Criticism==
Fraenkel (1992) believes that the "sexual revolution", that the West supposedly experienced in the late 1960s, is indeed a misconception and that sex is not actually enjoyed freely, it is just observed in all the fields of culture; that is a kind of taboo behavior technically called "[[repressive desublimation]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Marcuse]] (1964) pp.59, 75–82&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[radical feminists]], the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]], had been largely gained by men at women's expense.&lt;ref name="Willis 1984 121"/&gt; In ''[[Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution]]'', [[Sheila Jeffreys]] asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism.&lt;ref name="Zoftig 1982 88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vance 1992 302"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denfeld 1995 35"/&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[feminist sex wars]] broke out due to disagreements [[Feminist views on pornography|on pornography]], [[Feminist views on prostitution|on prostitution]], and [[Feminist views on BDSM|on BDSM]], as well as [[Feminist views on sexuality|sexuality in general]].

==Backlash==

Allyn argues that the sexual optimism of the 1960s waned with the economic crises of the 1970s, the massive commercialization of sex, increasing reports of child exploitation, disillusionment with the counter-culture and the New Left, and a combined left-right backlash against sexual liberation as an ideal. The discovery of herpes escalated anxieties rapidly and set the stage for the nation's panicked response to AIDS.&lt;ref name=allyn /&gt;

Although the rate of teenage sexual activity is hard to record, the prevalence of [[teenage pregnancy]] in developed nations such as Canada and the UK have seen a steady decline since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexualityandu.ca/resource-library/statistics/teen-pregnancy-rates |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930135322/http://www.sexualityandu.ca/resource-library/statistics/teen-pregnancy-rates |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8340988/Teenage-pregnancies-at-lowest-level-since-1980s.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Martin | last=Beckford | title=Teenage pregnancies at lowest level since 1980s | date=2011-02-23 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627003556/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8340988/Teenage-pregnancies-at-lowest-level-since-1980s.html | archivedate=2012-06-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1991 there were 61.8 children born per 1,000 teenage girls in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23940">The '''simply typed lambda calculus''' (&lt;math&gt;\lambda^\to&lt;/math&gt;), a form
of [[type theory]], is a [[typed lambda calculus|typed interpretation]] of the [[lambda calculus]] with only one [[type constructor]]: &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; that builds [[function type]]s. It is the canonical and simplest example of a typed lambda calculus.  The simply typed lambda calculus was originally introduced by [[Alonzo Church]] in 1940 as an attempt to avoid paradoxical uses of the [[untyped lambda calculus]], and it exhibits many desirable and interesting properties.

The term ''simple type'' is also used to refer to extensions of the simply typed lambda calculus such as [[cartesian product|products]], [[coproduct]]s or [[natural number]]s ([[Dialectica interpretation|System T]]) or even full [[recursion]] (like [[Programming language for Computable Functions|PCF]]). In contrast, systems which introduce polymorphic types (like [[System F]]) or [[dependent type]]s (like the [[LF (logical framework)|Logical Framework]]) are not considered ''simply typed''.  The former, except full recursion, are still considered  ''simple'' because the [[Church encoding]]s of such structures can be done using only &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; and suitable type variables, while polymorphism and dependency cannot.

== Syntax ==

In this article, we use &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; to range over types. Informally, the ''function type'' &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; refers to the type of functions that, given an input of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, produce an output of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
By convention, &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; associates to the right: we read &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to\tau\to\rho&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to(\tau\to\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

To define the types, we begin by fixing a set of ''base types'', &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. These are sometimes called ''atomic types'' or ''type constants''. With this fixed, the syntax of types is:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau ::= \tau \to \tau \mid T \quad \mathrm{where} \quad T \in B&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, &lt;math&gt;B = \{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt;, generates an infinite set of types starting with &lt;math&gt;a,b,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;a \to a,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;a \to b,b\to b,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;b\to a,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; a \to (a \to a),\ldots,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;(b\to a) \to (a\to b), \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

We also fix a set of ''term constants'' for the base types. For example, we might assume a base type &lt;tt&gt;nat&lt;/tt&gt;, and the term constants could be the natural numbers. In the original presentation, Church used only two base types: &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; for "the type of propositions" and &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; for "the type of individuals". The type &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; has no term constants, whereas &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; has one term constant. Frequently the calculus with only one base type, usually &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;, is considered.

The syntax of the simply typed lambda calculus is essentially that of the lambda calculus itself.  We write &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt; to denote that the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  The term syntax, in BNF, is then:

:&lt;math&gt;e ::= x \mid \lambda x\mathbin{:}\tau.e \mid e \, e \mid c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a term constant.

That is, ''variable reference'', ''abstractions'', ''application'', and ''constant''.  A variable reference &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is ''bound'' if it is inside of an abstraction binding &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  A term is ''closed'' if there are no unbound variables.

Compare this to the syntax of untyped lambda calculus:

:&lt;math&gt;e ::= x \mid \lambda x.e \mid e \, e&lt;/math&gt;

We see that in typed lambda calculus every function (''abstraction'') must specify the type of its argument.

== Typing rules ==

To define the set of well typed lambda terms of a given type, we will define a typing relation between terms and types.  First, we introduce ''typing contexts'' or ''[[typing environment]]s'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,\Delta,\dots&lt;/math&gt;, which are sets of typing assumptions.  A ''typing assumption'' has the form &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, meaning &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''typing relation'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash e\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; indicates that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is a term of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in context &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''well-typed'' (having type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;).  Instances of the typing relation are called ''typing judgements''.  The validity of a typing judgement is shown by providing a ''typing derivation'', constructed using [[type rules|typing rules]] (wherein the premises above the line allow us to derive the conclusion below the line).  Simply-typed lambda calculus uses these rules:

{| align="center" cellpadding="9"
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{x\mathbin{:}\sigma \in \Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash x\mathbin{:}\sigma} }&lt;/math&gt; (1)
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{c \text{ is a constant of type } T}{\Gamma\vdash c\mathbin{:}T}}&lt;/math&gt; (2)
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma,x\mathbin{:}\sigma\vdash e\mathbin{:}\tau}{\Gamma\vdash (\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~e)\mathbin{:}(\sigma \to \tau)}}&lt;/math&gt; (3)
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e_1\mathbin{:}\sigma\to\tau\quad\Gamma\vdash e_2\mathbin{:}\sigma}{\Gamma\vdash e_1~e_2\mathbin{:}\tau}}&lt;/math&gt; (4)
|}

In words,
# If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in the context, we know that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.
# Term constants have the appropriate base types.
# If, in a certain context with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; having type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, then, in the same context without &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt;.
# If, in a certain context, &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;e_1~e_2&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples of closed terms, ''i.e.'' terms typable in the empty context, are:
*For every type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, a term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\tau.x\mathbin{:}\tau\to\tau&lt;/math&gt; (identity function/I-combinator),
*For types &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\tau&lt;/math&gt;, a term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.\lambda y\mathbin{:}\tau.x\mathbin{:}\sigma \to \tau \to \sigma&lt;/math&gt; (the K-combinator), and
*For types &lt;math&gt;\tau,\tau',\tau''&lt;/math&gt;, a term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\tau\to\tau'\to\tau''.\lambda y\mathbin{:}\tau\to\tau'.\lambda z\mathbin{:}\tau.x z (y z) : (\tau\to\tau'\to\tau'')\to(\tau\to\tau')\to\tau\to\tau''&lt;/math&gt; (the S-combinator).
These are the typed lambda calculus representations of the basic combinators of [[combinatory logic]].

Each type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is assigned an order, a number &lt;math&gt;o(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;. For base types, &lt;math&gt;o(T)=0&lt;/math&gt;; for function types, &lt;math&gt;o(\sigma\to\tau)=\mbox{max}(o(\sigma)+1,o(\tau))&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, the order of a type measures the depth of the most left-nested arrow. Hence:

: &lt;math&gt;o(\iota \to \iota \to \iota) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;o((\iota \to \iota) \to \iota) = 2&lt;/math&gt;

== Semantics ==

=== Intrinsic vs. extrinsic interpretations ===

Broadly speaking, there are two different ways of assigning meaning to the simply typed lambda calculus, as to typed languages more generally, sometimes called ''intrinsic'' vs. ''extrinsic'', or ''[[Alonzo Church|Church]]-style'' vs. ''[[Haskell Curry|Curry]]-style''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first = John | last = Reynolds | author-link=John_C._Reynolds
| publisher = Cambridge University Press
| location = Cambridge, England
| title=Theories of Programming Languages
| year=1998
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An intrinsic/Church-style semantics only assigns meaning to well-typed terms, or more precisely, assigns meaning directly to typing derivations.  This has the effect that terms differing only by type annotations can nonetheless be assigned different meanings.  For example, the identity term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{int}.~x&lt;/math&gt; on integers and the identity term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{bool}.~x&lt;/math&gt; on booleans may mean different things.  (The classic intended interpretations
are the identity function on integers and the identity function on boolean values.)
In contrast, an extrinsic/Curry-style semantics assigns meaning to terms regardless of typing, as they would be interpreted in an untyped language.  In this view, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{int}.~x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{bool}.~x&lt;/math&gt; mean the same thing (''i.e.'', the same thing as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.~x&lt;/math&gt;).

The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic semantics is sometimes associated with the presence or absence of annotations on lambda abstractions, but strictly speaking this usage is imprecise.  It is possible to define a Curry-style semantics on annotated terms simply by ignoring the types (''i.e.'', through [[type erasure]]), as it is possible to give a Church-style semantics on unannotated terms when the types can be deduced from context (''i.e.'', through [[type inference]]).  The essential difference between intrinsic and extrinsic approaches is just whether the typing rules are viewed as defining the language, or as a formalism for verifying properties of a more primitive underlying language.  Most of the different semantic interpretations discussed below can be seen through either a Church or Curry perspective.

=== Equational theory ===

The simply typed lambda calculus has the same [[equational theory]] of βη-equivalence as [[Untyped lambda calculus#Reduction|untyped lambda calculus]], but subject to type restrictions.  The equation for [[beta reduction]]
:&lt;math&gt;(\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~t)\,u =_{\beta} t[x:=u]&lt;/math&gt;
holds in context &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,x\mathbin{:}\sigma \vdash t\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash u\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, while the equation for [[eta reduction]]
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~t\,x =_\eta t&lt;/math&gt;
holds whenever &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash t\!:\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does not appear free in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Operational semantics ===

Likewise, the [[operational semantics]] of simply typed lambda calculus can be fixed as for the untyped lambda calculus, using [[call by name]], [[call by value]], or other [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]].  As for any typed language, [[type safety]] is a fundamental property of all of these evaluation strategies.  Additionally, the [[strong normalization]] property [[Simply typed lambda calculus#Important results|described below]] implies that any evaluation strategy will terminate on all simply typed terms.

=== Categorical semantics ===
The simply typed lambda calculus (with  &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence) is the [[internal language]] of [[Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs), as was first observed by [[Joachim Lambek|Lambek]].  Given any specific CCC, the basic types of the corresponding lambda calculus are just the [[object (category theory)|objects]], and the terms are the [[morphism]]s. Conversely, every simply typed lambda calculus gives a CCC whose objects are the types, and morphisms are equivalence classes of terms.

To make the correspondence clear, a [[type constructor]] for the [[Cartesian product]] is typically added to the above.  To preserve the [[product (category theory)|categoricity of the Cartesian product]], one adds [[type rule]]s for ''pairing'', ''projection'', and a ''unit term''. Given two terms &lt;math&gt;s\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the term &lt;math&gt;(s,t)&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma\times\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  Likewise, if one has a term &lt;math&gt;u\mathbin{:}\tau_1\times\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;, then there are terms &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(u)\mathbin{:}\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2(u)\mathbin{:}\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;\pi_i&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the projections of the Cartesian product. The ''unit term'', of type 1, is written as &lt;math&gt;()&lt;/math&gt; and vocalized as 'nil', is the [[final object]].  The equational theory is extended likewise, so that one has
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_1(s\mathbin{:}\sigma,t\mathbin{:}\tau) = s\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_2(s\mathbin{:}\sigma,t\mathbin{:}\tau) = t\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\pi_1(u\mathbin{:}\sigma\times\tau) , \pi_2(u\mathbin{:}\sigma\times\tau)) =u\mathbin{:}\sigma\times\tau&lt;/math&gt;  
:&lt;math&gt;t\mathbin{:}1 = ()&lt;/math&gt;
This last is read as "''if t has type 1, then it reduces to nil''".

The above can then be turned into a category by taking the types as the [[object (category theory)|objects]]. The [[morphism]]s &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to\tau&lt;/math&gt; are [[equivalence class]]es of pairs &lt;math&gt;(x\mathbin{:}\sigma, t\mathbin{:}\tau)&lt;/math&gt; where ''x'' is a variable (of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) and ''t'' is a term (of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;), having no free variables in it, except for (optionally) ''x''. Closure is obtained from [[currying]] and [[apply|application]], as usual.

More precisely, there exist [[functor]]s between the category of Cartesian closed categories, and the category of simply-typed lambda theories.

It is common to extend this case to [[closed monoidal category|closed symmetric monoidal categories]] by using a [[linear type system]]. The reason for this is that the CCC is a special case of the closed symmetric monoidal category, which is typically taken to be the [[category of sets]].  This is fine for laying the foundations of [[set theory]], but the more general [[topos]] seems to provide a superior foundation.

=== Proof-theoretic semantics ===

The simply typed lambda calculus is closely related to the implicational fragment of propositional [[intuitionistic logic]], i.e., [[minimal logic]], via the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]]: terms correspond precisely to proofs in [[natural deduction]], and [[Type inhabitation|inhabited types]] are exactly the [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] of minimal logic.

== Alternative syntaxes ==

The presentation given above is not the only way of defining the syntax of the simply typed lambda calculus.  One alternative is to remove type annotations entirely (so that the syntax is identical to the untyped lambda calculus), while ensuring that terms are well-typed via [[Hindley–Milner type inference]].  The inference algorithm is terminating, sound, and complete: whenever a term is typable, the algorithm computes its type.  More precisely, it computes the term's [[principal type]], since often an unannotated term (such as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.~x&lt;/math&gt;) may have more than one type (&lt;math&gt;\mathtt{int} \to \mathtt{int}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{bool} \to \mathtt{bool}&lt;/math&gt;, etc., which are all instances of the principal type &lt;math&gt;\alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;).

Another alternative presentation of simply typed lambda calculus is based on '''bidirectional type checking''', which requires more type annotations than Hindley–Milner inference but is easier to describe.  The [[type system]] is divided into two judgments, representing both ''checking'' and ''synthesis'', written &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Leftarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Rightarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; respectively.  Operationally, the three components &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are all ''inputs'' to the checking judgment &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Leftarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the synthesis judgment &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Rightarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; only takes &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; as inputs, producing the type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; as output.  These judgments are derived via the following rules:
{| align="center" cellpadding="9"
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{x\mathbin{:}\sigma \in \Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash x \Rightarrow \sigma} }&lt;/math&gt; [1]
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{c \text{ is a constant of type } T}{\Gamma\vdash c \Rightarrow T}}&lt;/math&gt; [2]
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma,x\mathbin{:}\sigma\vdash e\Leftarrow \tau}{\Gamma\vdash \lambda x.~e \Leftarrow \sigma \to \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [3]
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e_1\Rightarrow \sigma\to\tau\quad\Gamma\vdash e_2\Leftarrow\sigma}{\Gamma\vdash e_1~e_2 \Rightarrow \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [4]
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e \Rightarrow \tau}{\Gamma\vdash e\Leftarrow \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [5]
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e \Leftarrow \tau}{\Gamma\vdash (e\mathbin{:}\tau)\Rightarrow \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [6]
|}
Observe that rules [1]–[4] are nearly identical to rules (1)–(4) above, except for the careful choice of checking or synthesis judgments.  These choices can be explained like so:
# If &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is in the context, we can synthesize type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
# The types of term constants are fixed and can be synthesized.
# To check that &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.~e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; in some context, we extend the context with &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and check that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; synthesizes type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; (in some context), and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; checks against type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (in the same context), then &lt;math&gt;e_1~e_2&lt;/math&gt; synthesizes type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
Observe that the rules for synthesis are read top-to-bottom, whereas the rules for checking are read bottom-to-top.  Note in particular that we do '''not''' need any annotation on the lambda abstraction in rule [3], because the type of the bound variable can be deduced from the type at which we check the function. Finally, we explain rules [5] and [6] as follows:
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To check that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, it suffices to synthesize type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; checks against type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, then the explicitly annotated term &lt;math&gt;(e\mathbin{:}\tau)&lt;/math&gt; synthesizes &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Because of these last two rules coercing between synthesis and checking, it is easy to see that any well-typed but unannotated term can be checked in the bidirectional system, so long as we insert "enough" type annotations.  And in fact, annotations are needed only at β-redexes.

== General observations ==

Given the standard semantics, the simply typed lambda calculus is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]: that is, well-typed terms always reduce to a value, i.e., a &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction.  This is because recursion is not allowed by the typing rules: it is impossible to find types for [[fixed-point combinator]]s and the looping term &lt;math&gt;\Omega = (\lambda x.~x~x) (\lambda x.~x~x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Recursion can be added to the language by either having a special operator &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{fix}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;of type &lt;math&gt;(\alpha \to \alpha) \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt; or adding general [[recursive type]]s, though both eliminate strong normalization.

Since it is strongly normalising, it is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]] whether or not a simply typed lambda calculus program halts: in fact, it ''always'' halts. We can therefore conclude that the language is ''not'' [[Turing complete]].

== Important results ==

* Tait showed in 1967 that &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-reduction is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]. As a corollary &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]]. Statman showed in 1977 that the normalisation problem is not [[elementary recursive]], a proof which was later simplified by Mairson (1992). A purely semantic normalisation proof (see [[normalisation by evaluation]]) was given by Berger and Schwichtenberg in 1991.
* The [[unification (computing)|unification]] problem for &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence is undecidable. Huet showed in 1973 that 3rd order unification is undecidable and this was improved upon by Baxter in 1978 then by Goldfarb in 1981 by showing that 2nd order unification is already undecidable. A proof that higher order matching (unification where only one term contains existential variables) is decidable was announced by Colin Stirling in 2006, and a full proof was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stirling|first1=Colin|title=Decidability of higher-order matching|journal=Logical Methods in Computer Science|date=22 July 2009|volume=5|issue=3|pages=1–52|doi=10.2168/LMCS-5(3:2)2009|arxiv=0907.3804|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* We can encode [[natural number]]s by terms of the type &lt;math&gt;(o\to o)\to(o \to o)&lt;/math&gt; ([[Church numeral]]s). Schwichtenberg showed in 1976 that in &lt;math&gt;\lambda^\to&lt;/math&gt; exactly the extended [[polynomial]]s are representable as functions over Church numerals; these are roughly the polynomials closed up under a conditional operator. 
* A ''full model'' of &lt;math&gt;\lambda^\to&lt;/math&gt; is given by interpreting base types as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and function types by the set-theoretic [[function space]]. Friedman showed in 1975 that this interpretation is [[Completeness (logic)|complete]] for &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence, if the base types are interpreted by infinite sets. Statman showed in 1983 that &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence is the maximal equivalence which is ''typically ambiguous'', i.e. closed under type substitutions (''Statman's Typical Ambiguity Theorem''). A corollary of this is that the ''finite model property'' holds, i.e. finite sets are sufficient to distinguish terms which are not identified by &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence.
* Plotkin introduced logical relations in 1973 to characterize the elements of a model which are definable by lambda terms. In 1993 Jung and Tiuryn showed that a general form of logical relation (Kripke logical relations with varying arity) exactly characterizes lambda definability. Plotkin and Statman conjectured that it is decidable whether a given element of a model generated from finite sets is definable by a lambda term (''Plotkin–Statman conjecture''). The conjecture was shown to be false by Loader in 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7650">In [[design of experiments]], '''single-subject design''' or '''single-case research design''' is a research design most often used in applied fields of psychology, education, and human behavior in which the subject serves as his/her own control, rather than using another individual/group. Researchers use single-subject design because these designs are sensitive to individual organism differences vs group designs which are sensitive to averages of groups. Often there will be large numbers of subjects in a research study using single-subject design, however—because the subject serves as their own control, this is still a single-subject design.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cooper, J.O. |author2=Heron, T.E. |author3=Heward, W.L. |title=Applied Behavior Analysis |edition=2nd |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-142113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These designs are used primarily to evaluate the effect of a variety of interventions in applied research.&lt;ref&gt;Kazdin p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
The following are requirements of single-subject designs:&lt;ref&gt;Kazdin, pp. 103–10&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Continuous assessment:''' The behavior of the individual is observed repeatedly over the course of the intervention. This ensures that any treatment effects are observed long enough to convince the scientist that the treatment produces a lasting effect.
* '''Baseline assessment:''' Before the treatment is implemented, the researcher is to look for behavioral trends. If a treatment reverses a baseline trend (e.g., things were getting worse as time went on in the baseline but the treatment reversed this trend) then this is powerful evidence suggesting (though not proving) a treatment effect. 
* '''Variability in data:''' Because behavior is assessed repeatedly, the single-subject design allows the researcher to see how consistently the treatment changes behavior over time. Large-group statistical designs do not typically provide this information because repeated assessments are not usually taken and the behavior of individuals in the groups are not scrutinized; instead, group means are reported.

==Phases within single-subject design==
* '''Baseline''': this phase is one in which the researcher collects data on the dependent variable without any intervention in place.  
* '''Intervention''': this phase is one in which the researcher introduces an independent variable (the intervention) and then collects data on the dependent variable.
* '''Reversal''': this phase is one in which the researcher removes the independent variable (reversal) and then collects data on the dependent variable.

It is important that the data are stable (steady trend and low variability) before the researcher moves to the next phase. Single-subject designs produce or approximate three levels of knowledge: (1) descriptive, (2) correlational, and (3) causal.&lt;ref&gt;Tripodi, T. (1998). ''A Primer on Single-Subject Design for Clinical Social Workers.'' Washington, DC: National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flexibility of the design==
Single-subject designs are preferred because they are highly flexible and highlight individual differences in response to intervention effects.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, C.K. (1986). Flexibility of Single-subject Experimental Designs. Part III: Using Flexibility to Design or Modify Experiments. ''The Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders'', 51(3), 214–25&lt;/ref&gt; In general, single-subject designs have been shown to reduce interpretation bias for counselors when doing therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, D.J. &amp; Tai, W. (2001). Reducing Biases in Clinical Judgment with Single-Subject Treatment Design. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2(3), 196–206 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of data==
In order to determine the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable, the researcher will graph the data collected and visually inspect the differences between phases. If there is a clear distinction between baseline and intervention, and then the data returns to the same trends/level during reversal, a functional relation between the variables is inferred.&lt;ref&gt;Backman, C.L. &amp; Harris, S.R. (1999). Case Studies, Single-Subject Research, and N of 1 Randomized Trials. Comparisons and Contrasts. ''American Journal of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation'', 78(2), 170–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, visual inspection of the data demonstrates results that statistical tests fail to find.&lt;ref&gt;Bobrovitz, C.D. &amp; Ottenbacher, K.J. (1998). Comparison of Visual Inspection and Statistical Analysis of Single-Subject Data in Rehabilitation Research. ''Journal of Engineering and Applied Science'', 77(2), 94–102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nishith, P.; Hearst, D.E.; Mueser, K.T. &amp; Foa, E. (1995). PTSD and Major Depression: Methodological and Treatment Considerations in a Single-Case Design. ''Behavior Therapy'', 26(2), 297–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers utilizing single-subject design begin with ''graphic analysis''. During the baseline, data are repeatedly collected and then graphed on the behavior of interest. This provides a visual representation of the subject's behavior before application of the intervention. It is critical that several (three to five is often recommended&lt;ref&gt;Alberto, P.A. &amp; Troutman, A.C. (2006). ''Applied behavior analysis for teachers (7th ed.)''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;) data points are collected during baseline to allow the researcher to describe the effects on the target behavior during intervention.

In interpreting, the general strategy of all single-subject research is to use the subject as their own control. Experimental logic argues that the subject's baseline behavior would match its behavior in the intervention phase unless the intervention does something to change it. This logic then holds to rule out confound, one needs to replicate. It is the within-subject replication and allows for the determination of functional relationships. Thus the goal is:
* Demonstration
* Verification
* Replication

==Limitations==
Research designs are traditionally preplanned so that most of the details about to whom and when the intervention will be introduced are decided prior to the beginning of the study. However, in single-subject designs, these decisions are often made as the data are collected.&lt;ref&gt;Kazdin, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are no widely agreed-upon rules for altering phases, so—this could lead to conflicting ideas as to how a research experiment should be conducted in single-subject design.

The major criticism of single-subject designs are:
* '''Carry-over effects''': Results from the previous phase carry-over into the next phase.
* '''Order effects''': The ordering (sequence) of the intervention or treatment affects what results.
* '''Irreversibility''': In some withdrawal designs, once a change in the independent variable occurs, the dependent variable is affected. This cannot be undone by simply removing the independent variable.
* '''Ethical problems''': Withdrawal of treatment in the withdrawal design can at times present ethical and feasibility problems.

==History==
Historically, single-subject designs have been closely tied to the [[experimental analysis of behavior]] and [[applied behavior analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazdin, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terrorism''' is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror among masses of people; or fear to achieve a religious or political aim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fortna |first1=Virginia Page |title=Do Terrorists Win?

According to the [[Global Terrorism Database]] maintained by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, have been recorded from 2000 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Terrorism Index 2015 |url=http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2015.pdf |publisher=Institute for Economics and Peace |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Etmologically, the word terror is derived from the [[Latin]] verb ''Tersere'', which later becomes ''Terrere''. The latter form appears in European languages as early as the 12th century; its first known use in French is the word ''terrible'' in 1160. By 1356 the word ''terreur'' is in use. ''Terreur'' is the origin of the [[Middle English]] term ''terrour'', which later becomes the modern word "terror".&lt;ref name=jf /&gt;

== Historical background ==
{{Main|Reign of Terror}}

[[File:JacobinVignette03.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.6|Seal of the [[Jacobin]] Club: 'Society of the Jacobins, Friends of Freedom and Equality'.]]
The term ''terroriste'', meaning "terrorist", is first used in 1794 by the French philosopher [[François-Noël Babeuf]], who denounces [[Maximilien Robespierre]]{{'}}s [[Jacobin]] regime as a dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Princeton University Press |last=Palmer |first=R.R. |title=The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800 |chapter=The French Directory Between Extremes |date=2014 |jstor=j.ctt5hhrg5.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kellner&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/17405900410001674515 |issn=1740-5904 |eissn=1740-5912 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=41–64 |last=Kellner |first=Douglas |title=9/11, spectacles of terror, and media manipulation: A critique of Jihadist and Bush media politics |journal=Critical Discourse Studies |date=April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years leading up to the Reign of Terror, the [[Brunswick Manifesto]] threatened Paris with an "exemplary, never to be forgotten vengeance: the city would be subjected to military punishment and total destruction" if the royal family was harmed, but this only increased the Revolution's will to abolish the monarchy.&lt;ref name=duncan /&gt; Some writers attitudes about [[French Revolution]] grew less favorable after the French monarchy was abolished in 1792. During the [[Reign of Terror]], which began in July 1793 and lasted thirteen months, Paris was governed by the Committee of Public safety who oversaw a regime of mass executions and public purges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4725-0912-3 |last=Crawford |first=Joseph |title=Gothic Fiction and the Invention of Terrorism: The Politics and Aesthetics of Fear in the Age of the Reign of Terror |date=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the French Revolution, ancient philosophers wrote about [[tyrannicide]], as tyranny was seen as the greatest political threat to Greco-Roman civilization. [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval philosophers]] were similarly occupied with the concept of tyranny, though the analysis of some theologians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] drew a distinction between usurpers, who could be killed by anyone, and legitimate rulers who abused their power — the latter, in Aquinas' view, could only be punished by a public authority. [[John of Salisbury]] was the first medieval Christian scholar to defend tyrannicide.&lt;ref name=jf&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=271–288 |last=Fine |first=Jonathan |title=Political and Philological Origins of the Term 'Terrorism' from the Ancient Near East to Our Times |journal=Middle Eastern Studies |date=2010 |jstor=20720662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars today trace the origins of the modern tactic of terrorism to the Jewish [[Sicarii Zealots]] who attacked Romans and Jews in 1st century [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. They follow its development from the Persian [[Order of Assassins]] through to 19th-century anarchists. The "Reign of Terror" is usually regarded as an issue of etymology. The term terrorism has generally been used to describe violence by non-state actors rather than government violence since the 19th-century [[Anarchism in France|Anarchist Movement]].&lt;ref name=duncan&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=3–21 |last=Ken Duncan |title=A Blast from the Past Lessons from a Largely Forgotten Incident of State-Sponsored Terrorism |journal=Perspectives on Terrorism |date=2011 |jstor=26298499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = OUP Oxford| isbn = 978-0-19-154198-8| last = Houen| first = Alex| title = Terrorism and Modern Literature: From Joseph Conrad to Ciaran Carson| date = 2002-09-12 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-135-16595-6| last = Thackrah| first = John Richard| title = Dictionary of Terrorism| date = 2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1795, [[Edmund Burke]] used the word "Terrorists" in a description of the new [[French Directory|French government called 'Directory']]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Burke]] – To The Earl Fitzwilliam (Christmas, 1795.) In: [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/burke-select-works-of-edmund-burke-vol-3 Edmund Burke, ''Select Works of Edmund Burke, vol. 3 (Letters on a Regicide Peace)'' (1795)]. Retrieved 10 July 2017. &lt;br /&gt;This Internet version contains two, mingled, indications of page numbers: one with single brackets like [260], one with double brackets like [ [309] ]. Burke lengthily introduces his view on 'this present [[French Directory|Directory government]]', and then writes on page [ [359] ]: "Those who arbitrarily erected the new building out of the old materials of their own [[National Convention|Convention]], were obliged to send for an Army to support their work. (…) At length, after a terrible struggle, the Troops prevailed over the Citizens. (…) This power is to last as long as the Parisians think proper. (…) [315] To secure them further, they have a strong corps of [[irregular military|irregulars]], ready armed. Thousands of those Hell-hounds called Terrorists, whom they had shut up in Prison on their last Revolution, as the Satellites of Tyranny, are let loose on the people. (…)"&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At length, after a terrible struggle, the [Directory] Troops prevailed over the Citizens (…) To secure them further, they have a strong corps of [[irregular military|irregulars]], ready armed.

There are over 109 different definitions of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Arie W 2006 pp. 45-48"&gt;Arie W. Kruglanski and Shira Fishman Current Directions in Psychological Science Vol. 15, No. 1 (Feb., 2006), pp. 45–48&lt;/ref&gt; American political philosopher [[Michael Walzer]] in 2002 wrote: "Terrorism is the deliberate killing of innocent people, at random, to spread fear through a whole population and force the hand of its political leaders".&lt;ref name=Walzer /&gt; [[Bruce Hoffman]], an American scholar, has noted that

It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism. Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside Terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[C.A.J. Coady]] has written that the question of how to define terrorism is "irresolvable" because "its natural home is in polemical, ideological and propagandist contexts".&lt;ref name=teichman&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 64| issue = 250| pages = 505–517| last = Jenny Teichman| title = How to Define Terrorism| journal = Philosophy|date = 1989| jstor = 3751606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French historian {{ill|Sophie Wahnich|fr|Sophie Wahnich|vertical-align=sup}} distinguishes between the [[revolutionary terror]] of the French Revolution and the terrorists of the September 11 attacks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Revolutionary terror is not terrorism. To make a moral equivalence between the Revolution's year II and September 2001 is historical and philosophical nonsense . . . The violence exercised on 11 September 2001 aimed neither at equality nor liberty. Nor did the preventive war announced by the president of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wahnich |first=Sophie |date=2016 |title=In Defence of the Terror: Liberty or Death in the French Revolution |page=108 |publisher=Verso |edition=Reprint |isbn=978-1-78478-202-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scurr |first=Ruth |date=17 August 2012 |title=In Defence of the Terror: Liberty or Death in the French Revolution by Sophie Wahnich – review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/17/defence-terror-french-wahnich-review |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Experts disagree about "whether terrorism is wrong by definition or just wrong as a matter of fact; they disagree about whether terrorism should be defined in terms of its aims, or its methods, or both, or neither; they disagree about whether or not states can perpetrate terrorism; they even disagree about the importance or otherwise of ''terror'' for a definition of ''terrorism''."&lt;ref name=teichman /&gt;

===State terrorism===
Alternatively, responding to developments in modern warfare, [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and [[Jonathan Friedman]] distinguish between state terrorism against [[non-combatant]]s and state terrorism against [[combatant]]s, including '[[Shock and Awe]]' tactics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shock and Awe" as a subcategory of "rapid dominance" is the name given to massive intervention designed to strike terror into the minds of the enemy. It is a form of state-terrorism. The concept was however developed long before the Second Gulf War by Harlan Ullman as chair of a forum of retired military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=2006 |last1=James |first1=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |last2=Friedman |first2=Jonathan |title=Globalization and Violence, Vol. 3: Globalizing War and Intervention |url=https://www.academia.edu/3587732 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London |page=xxx}}; and {{Cite book |last1=Nairn |first1=Tom |last2=James |first2=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |title=Global Matrix: Nationalism, Globalism and State-Terrorism |url=https://www.academia.edu/1642325 |year=2005 |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United Nations===
In November 2004, a [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] report described terrorism as any act "intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act".&lt;!-- ''(Note that this report does not constitute [[international law]])'' --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN Reform |publisher=United Nations |date=21 March 2005 |url=https://www.un.org/unifeed/script.asp?scriptId=73 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427012107/http://www.un.org/unifeed/script.asp?scriptId=73 |archivedate=27 April 2007 |access-date=2008-07-11 |quote=The second part of the report, entitled "Freedom from Fear backs the definition of terrorism–an issue so divisive agreement on it has long eluded the world community–as any action "intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[international community]] has been slow to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding definition of this crime. These difficulties arise from the fact that the term "terrorism" is politically and emotionally charged.&lt;ref name="Hoffman-1998-p32"&gt;Hoffman (1998), p. 32, See review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html Inside Terrorism].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://icct.nl/publication/radicalisation-de-radicalisation-counter-radicalisation-a-conceptual-discussion-and-literature-review/ |title=Radicalisation, De-Radicalisation, Counter-Radicalisation: A Conceptual Discussion and Literature Review |date=27 March 2013 |publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT) | access-date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Angus Martyn, briefing the Australian parliament, stated,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the United Nations attempts to define the term floundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self-determination.&lt;ref name=Martyn&gt;Angus Martyn, [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm The Right of Self-Defence under International Law-the Response to the Terrorist Attacks of 11 September], Australian Law and Bills Digest Group, Parliament of Australia Web Site, 12 February 2002. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216134913/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm |date=16 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These divergences have made it impossible for the United Nations to conclude a [[Definition of terrorism#Proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism|Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]] that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz-Paniagua (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&amp;lpg=PR4 ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997–2005''], p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The international community has adopted a series of [[Definition of terrorism#The sectoral approach|sectoral conventions]] that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities.

Since 1994, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.&lt;ref&gt;1994 United Nations Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annex to UN General Assembly resolution 49/60, "Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism", of December 9, 1994, [https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/49/a49r060.htm UN Doc. A/Res/60/49].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===U.S. law===
Various legal systems and government agencies use different [[Anti-terrorism legislation|definitions of terrorism in their national legislation]].

U.S. Code Title 22 Chapter 38, Section 2656f(d) defines terrorism as:
"Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2656f |title=22 U.S. Code §&amp;nbsp;2656f – Annual country reports on terrorism |website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2331 defines "international terrorism" and "domestic terrorism" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the Code, entitled "Terrorism":

"International terrorism" means activities with the following three characteristics:

Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
Appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.

===Media spectacle===
A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]], underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:

{{quote|Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols). Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization. The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience(s) in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states.&lt;ref name=Bockstette2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bockstette, Carsten |year=2008 |title=Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques |issue=20 |url=http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf |accessdate=2009-01-01 |journal=George C. Marshall Center Occasional Paper Series |issn=1863-6039 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Terrorists also attack national symbols, which may negatively affect a government, while increasing the prestige of the given [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist group]] or its ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Juergensmeyer |first=Mark |title=Terror in the Mind of God |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2000 |pages=125–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political violence===

{{See also|Controversies about labeling terrorism}}
Having the moral charge in our vocabulary of 'something morally wrong', the term 'terrorism' is often used to abuse or denounce opposite parties, either governments or non-state-groups.&lt;ref name=Sinclair /&gt;&lt;ref name=JR.White /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heryant /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruthven /&gt;&lt;ref name=Walzer /&gt;

Those labeled "terrorists" by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such, and typically use other terms or terms specific to their situation, such as [[separatist]], [[freedom fighter]], liberator, [[revolutionary]], [[vigilante]], [[Insurgent|militant]], paramilitary, [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]], [[rebellion|rebel]], patriot, or any similar-meaning word in other languages and cultures. [[Jihad]]i, [[mujaheddin]], and [[fedayeen]] are similar Arabic words that have entered the English lexicon. It is common for both parties in a conflict to describe each other as terrorists.&lt;ref name=tws11janbcvc&gt;{{cite news |author1=Paul Reynolds |author2=quoting David Hannay |author3=Former UK ambassador |title=UN staggers on road to reform |quote=This would end the argument that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=BBC News |date=14 September 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4244842.stm|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On whether particular terrorist acts, such as killing non-combatants, can be justified as the lesser evil in a particular circumstance, philosophers have expressed different views: while, according to David Rodin, [[utilitarian]] philosophers can (in theory) conceive of cases in which the evil of terrorism is outweighed by the good that could not be achieved in a less morally costly way, in practice the "harmful effects of undermining the convention of non-combatant immunity is thought to outweigh the goods that may be achieved by particular acts of terrorism".&lt;ref name="Robin"&gt;Rodin, David (2006). "Terrorism". In E. Craig (Ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the non-utilitarian philosophers, [[Michael Walzer]] argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case: when "a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non-combatants, then it is morally entitled to do so".&lt;ref name="Robin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=tws11jannmllk&gt;{{cite news |author=Peter Steinfels |title=Beliefs; The just-war tradition, its last-resort criterion and the debate on an invasion of Iraq |quote=For those like Professor Walzer who value the just-war tradition as a disciplined way to think about the morality of war&amp;nbsp;... |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1 March 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/01/us/beliefs-just-war-tradition-its-last-resort-criterion-debate-invasion-iraq.html?pagewanted=1|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Inside Terrorism'' [[Bruce Hoffman]] offered an explanation of why the term ''terrorism'' becomes distorted:
{{quote|On one point, at least, everyone agrees: ''terrorism'' is a pejorative term. It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. 'What is called terrorism,' Brian Jenkins has written, 'thus seems to depend on one's point of view. Use of the term implies a moral judgment; and if one party can successfully attach the label ''terrorist'' to its opponent, then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint.' Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization ''terrorist'' becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism.&lt;ref name=tws11jant5r4&gt;{{cite news |author=Bruce Hoffman |authorlink=Bruce Hoffman |title=Inside Terrorism |quote=Google cached copy |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-11468-0 |page=32 |year=1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html |access-date=2010-01-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416230530/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html |archivedate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tws11jant5r555&gt;{{cite news |author=Bruce Hoffman |authorlink=Bruce Hoffman |title=Inside Terrorism |newspaper=The New York Times |year=1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tws11jangbbjj&gt;{{cite news |author=Raymond Bonner |title=Getting Attention: A scholar's historical and political survey of terrorism finds that it works |quote=''Inside Terrorism'' falls into the category of 'must read,' at least for anyone who wants to understand how we can respond to international acts of terror. |newspaper=The New York Times: Books |date=1 November 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/01/reviews/981101.01bonnert.html|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some groups, when involved in a "liberation" struggle, have been called "terrorists" by the Western governments or media.

Sometimes, states that are close allies, for reasons of history, culture and politics, can disagree over whether or not members of a certain organization are terrorists.

According to the contemporary Jewish-Roman historian [[Josephus]], after the [[Zealotry]] rebellion against Roman rule in Judea, when some prominent Jewish collaborators with Roman rule were killed,&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Bruce. ''Inside Terrorism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1988. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''.

''Inside Terrorism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1988. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "terrorism" itself was originally used to describe the actions of the [[Jacobin Club]] during the "[[Reign of Terror]]" in the [[French Revolution]]. "Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible", said Jacobin leader [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. In 1795, [[Edmund Burke]] denounced the Jacobins for letting "thousands of those hell-hounds called Terrorists&amp;nbsp;... loose on the people" of France.

In January 1858, Italian patriot [[Felice Orsini]] threw three bombs in an attempt to assassinate French Emperor [[Napoleon III]].&lt;ref name="Crenshaw38"&gt;Crenshaw, Martha, ''Terrorism in Context'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight bystanders were killed and 142 injured.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw38" /&gt; The incident played a crucial role as an inspiration for the development of the early terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw38" /&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
Depending on the country, the political system, and the time in history, the types of terrorism are varying.

In early 1975, the [[National Institute of Justice|Law Enforcement Assistant Administration]] in the United States formed the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals. One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was titled ''Disorders and Terrorism'', produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H. H. A. Cooper, Director of the Task Force staff.

The Task Force defines terrorism as "a tactic or technique by means of which a violent act or the threat thereof is used for the prime purpose of creating overwhelming fear for coercive purposes".  It classified disorders and terrorism into six categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/39469NCJRS.pdf |title=Disorders and Terrorism |website=National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals |date=1976 |pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[File:US Army Humvee attacked.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army Humvee destroyed by a [[car bomb]], Baghdad, [[Iraq]] in 2006.]]--&gt;
* '''Civil disorder''' – A form of collective violence interfering with the [[peace]], security, and normal functioning of the community.
* '''Political terrorism''' – [[Violence|Violent]] criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate [[fear]] in the community, or substantial segment of it, for political purposes.
* '''Non-Political terrorism''' – Terrorism that is not aimed at political purposes but which exhibits "conscious design to create and maintain a high degree of fear for [[coercion|coercive]] purposes, but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective".
* '''Quasi-terrorism''' – The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient. It is not the main purpose of the quasi-terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism, but the quasi-terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quasi-terrorism |url=https://mukkulreddy.wordpress.com/types-of-terrorism/quasi-terrorism/ |website=Mukkulreddy.wordpress.com|access-date= 2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Types of Terrorism |url=http://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/types-of-terrorism/ |publisher=Crime Museum|access-date= 2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TERRORISM |url=http://www.earthdash.org/more_info/terrorism.html |publisher=Earth Dashboard|access-date= 2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the fleeing [[felony|felon]] who takes [[hostage]]s is a quasi-terrorist, whose methods are similar to those of the genuine terrorist but whose purposes are quite different.
* '''Limited political terrorism''' – Genuine political terrorism is characterized by a [[revolutionary]] approach; limited political terrorism refers to "acts of terrorism which are committed for [[ideology|ideological]] or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the [[Sovereign state|state]]".
* '''Official or state terrorism''' – "referring to nations whose rule is based upon [[fear]] and [[oppression]] that reach similar to terrorism or such proportions". It may also be referred to as '''Structural Terrorism''' defined broadly as terrorist acts carried out by governments in pursuit of political objectives, often as part of their foreign policy.

Other sources have defined the typology of terrorism in different ways, for example, broadly classifying it into '''domestic terrorism''' and '''international terrorism''', or using categories such as vigilante terrorism or insurgent terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terrorism and homeland security: an introduction with applications |author=Philip P. Purpura |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-7506-7843-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ItzwLVo8DwC&amp;pg=PA17 |pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way the typology of terrorism may be defined:&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Rex A. ''Who Becomes a Terrorist and Why: The 1999 Government Report on Profiling Terrorists'', Federal Research Division, The Lyons Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Scheider, Jim Davis, ''Avoiding the abyss: progress, shortfalls and the way ahead in combatting the WMD threat'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009 p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Political terrorism'''
** '''Sub-state terrorism'''
*** Social revolutionary terrorism
*** Nationalist-separatist terrorism
*** Religious extremist terrorism
**** Religious fundamentalist Terrorism
**** New religions terrorism
*** [[Right-wing terrorism]]
*** [[Left-wing terrorism]]
****[[Communist terrorism]]
** '''[[State-sponsored terrorism]]'''
** '''[[State terrorism|Regime or state terrorism]]'''
* '''Criminal terrorism'''
* '''Pathological terrorism'''

== Motivations of terrorists ==
As well as there being no one agreed definition of terrorism, there is a similar lack of consensus regarding the causes - or motivations behind - terrorism. Numerous studies have identified certain behavioural and situational characteristics that are common, and perhaps causal, to the consequence of terrorism, specific analysis of case studies have lead to suggested motivations to individual historical acts.

A report conducted by Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert on behalf of The Department of security of UK highlights the vast discrepencies between individual cases of terrorism recorded. To begin with, 43% of lone wolf terrorism is motivated by religious beliefs. The same report indicates that just less than a third (31.9%) have pre-existing mental health disorders, while many more are found to have these problems upon arrest. At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution, a further 26.1% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases. 40.2% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event. 19.3% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others, while 14.3% experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault.

==== Intimidation ====
Attacks on 'collaborators' are used to intimidate people from cooperating with the state in order to undermine state control. This strategy was used in Ireland, in [[Kenya]], in [[Algeria]] and in [[Cyprus]] during their independence struggles. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==== International Attention ====
This strategy was used by [[Al-Qaeda]] in [[September 11 attacks|its attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]] in the United States on September 11, 2001. These attacks are also used to draw international attention to struggles that are otherwise unreported, such as the [[Dawson's Field hijackings|Palestinian airplane hijackings in 1970]] and the [[1975 Dutch train hostage crisis]].

==== Local/internal social standing ====
Abrahm suggests that terrorist organizations do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Abrahm"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abrahms |first=Max |title=What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and Counterterrorism Strategy |journal=[[International Security]] |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=86–89 |date=March 2008 |url=http://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/publications/what_terrorists_really_want_terrorist_motives_and_counterterrorism_strategy |format=PDF 1933 [[Kilobyte|KB]] |issn=0162-2889 |accessdate=2008-11-04 |doi=10.1162/isec.2008.32.4.78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives, which are often murky and undefined.&lt;ref name="Abrahm" /&gt;

==== Cultural tolerance of violence ====
Additionally, Michael Mousseau shows possible relationships between the type of economy within a country and ideology associated with terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mousseau |first1=Michael |title=Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror |journal=International Security |date=2002 |volume=27 |issue=3 |doi=10.1162/01622880260553615 |pages=5–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many terrorists have a history of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/06/many-terrorists-first-victims-are-their-wives-were-not-allowed-talk-about Many terrorists' first victims are their wives – but we're not allowed to talk about that] ''[[New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Perceived illegitimacy of the State ====
Some terrorists like [[Timothy McVeigh]] were motivated by revenge against a state for its actions against its citizens.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==== Religious beliefs/zealotry ====
According to Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert on behalf of The Department of security of UK, 43% of lone wolf terrorism is motivated by religious beliefs. The same report indicates that Just less than a third (31.9%) have pre-existing mental health disorders, while many are found to have these problems upon arrest. At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution, a further 26.1% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases. 40.2% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event. Many were chronically unemployed and consistently struggled to hold any form of employment for a significant amount of time. 19.3% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others, while 14.3% experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault. 
&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==== Mental Health ====
Ariel Merari, a psychologist who has studied the psychological profiles of suicide terrorists since 1983 through media reports that contained biographical details, interviews with the suicides’ families, and interviews with jailed would-be suicide attackers, concluded that they were unlikely to be psychologically abnormal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Merari |first1=Ariel |title="Psychological Aspects of Suicide Terrorism," in Bruce Bongar et al., Psychology of Terrorism. |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to economic theories of criminal behaviour, Scott Atran found that suicide terrorists exhibit none of the socially dysfunctional attributes - such as fatherless, friendless, jobless situations - or suicidal symptoms. By which he means, they do not kill themselves simply out of hopelessness or a sense of 'having nothing to lose'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Atran |first1=Scott |title=Mishandling Suicide Terrorism |journal=The Washington Quarterly |date=2004 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=67–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nationalism ====
Although a common factor in terrorism is a strong religious belief there are other factors such as cultural, social and 
political that wholly preclude religion. For example, the drive behind these Chechen terrorists are quite distinct and unique from others. Many of the Chechens considered themselves secular freedom fighters, nationalist insurgents seeking to establish an independent secular state of Chechnya. Although a distinction should be made between national Chechen terrorists and non-Chechen fighters who have adopted the idea from abroad. Few Chechen fighters fought for the jihads whereas most of the non-Chechen fighters did (Janeczko, 2014)
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Janeczko |first1=Matthew |title='Faced with death, even a mouse bites': Social and religious motivations behind terrorism in Chechnya |date=19 Jun 2014 |pages=428–456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Financial support for family ====
Another factor are perceived assurances of financial stability for the actor's families, that they are given when they join a terrorist organization or complete an attempt of terror. An extra grant is provided for the families of suicide bombers.&lt;ref name="Arie W 2006 pp. 45-48"/&gt;

== Democracy and domestic terrorism ==
{{POV section|date=March 2017}}
{{disputed section|date=March 2017}}

However, one study suggests that [[suicide terrorism|suicide attacks]] may be an exception to this general rule.{{irrelevant citation|date=March 2017|reason=see talk}} Evidence regarding this particular method of terrorism reveals that every modern suicide campaign has targeted a democracy–a state with a considerable degree of political freedom.&lt;ref name=tws11janbhhj&gt;{{cite news |author=Bruce Hoffman |title=The Logic of Suicide Terrorism |quote=The terrorists appear to be deliberately homing in on the few remaining places where Israelis thought they could socialize in peace. |publisher=The Atlantic |date=June 2003 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200306/hoffman |access-date=2010-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001000500/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200306/hoffman |archivedate=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline|date=March 2017}}{{verify quote|date=March 2017}} The study suggests that concessions awarded to terrorists during the 1980s and 1990s for suicide attacks increased their frequency.{{example needed|date=March 2017}}{{dubious|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Robert A.

While a democratic nation espousing [[civil liberties]] may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes, an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma: whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem; or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties.&lt;ref name=tws11janetrr&gt;{{cite news |author=Rick Young |title=PBS Frontline: 'Spying on the Home Front' |quote=...&amp;nbsp;we and Frontline felt that it was important to look more comprehensively at the post-9/11 shift to prevention and the dilemma we all now face in balancing security and privacy. |publisher=''PBS: Frontline'' |date=16 May 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/05/03/DI2007050301142.html|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, [[homegrown terrorism]] has started to be seen as a greater threat, as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden.&lt;ref name="Hayden"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jordy |last=Yager |title=Former intel chief: Homegrown terrorism is a devil of a problem |publisher=thehill.com |date=25 July 2010 |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/110759-former-intel-chief-homegrown-terrorism-is-a-devil-of-a-problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma, some social theorists would conclude, may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist(s); namely, to delegitimize the state and cause a systematic shift towards anarchy via the accumulation of negative sentiments towards the state system.&lt;ref&gt;shabad, goldie and francisco jose llera ramo.

According to the [[Global Terrorism Index]] by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], [[religious extremism]] has overtaken [[Separatism|national separatism]] and become the main driver of terrorist attacks around the world. Since 9/11 there has been a five-fold increase in deaths from terrorist attacks. The majority of incidents over the past several years can be tied to groups with a religious agenda. Before 2000, it was nationalist separatist terrorist organizations such as the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and Chechen rebels who were behind the most attacks. The number of incidents from nationalist separatist groups has remained relatively stable in the years since while religious extremism has grown. The prevalence of Islamist groups in [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Syria]] is the main driver behind these trends.&lt;ref name=arnett&gt;{{cite news |author=George Arnett |title=Religious extremism main cause of terrorism, according to report |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 November 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/nov/18/religious-extremism-main-cause-of-terrorism-according-to-report|access-date= 22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the terrorist groups that have been most active since 2001 are [[Boko Haram]], [[Al Qaeda]], the [[Taliban]] and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]. These groups have been most active in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. 80% of all deaths from terrorism occurred in one of these five countries.&lt;ref name=arnett /&gt;

Anglo-Israelism held the view that Jews were descendants of ancient [[Israelites]] who had never been lost. By the 1930s, the movement had been infected with [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], and eventually [[Christian Identity]] theology diverged from traditional [[British Israelism|Anglo-Israelism]], and developed what is known as the [[Serpent seed|"two seed"]] theory.&lt;ref name=adlci /&gt; According to the two-seed theory, the Jewish people are descended from [[Cain]] and the serpent (not from [[Shem]]).&lt;ref name=adlci /&gt; The white European seedline is descended from the "lost tribes" of Israel. They hold themselves to "God's laws", not to "man's laws", and they do not feel bound to a government that they consider run by Jews and the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]].&lt;ref name=adlci /&gt;

[[Israel]] has also had problems with [[Jewish religious terrorism]]. [[Yigal Amir]] assassinated Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in 1995. For Amir, killing Rabin was an exemplary act that symbolized the fight against an illegitimate government that was prepared to cede Jewish Holy Land to the Palestinians. {{sfn|Spaaij|2012|page=68}}

== Perpetrators ==
The [[perpetrator]]s of acts of terrorism can be individuals, groups, or states. According to some definitions, clandestine or semi-clandestine state actors may also carry out terrorist acts outside the framework of a state of war. However, the most common image of terrorism is that it is carried out by small and secretive [[Covert cell|cells]], highly motivated to serve a particular cause and many of the most deadly operations in recent times, such as the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London underground bombing]], [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] and the [[2002 Bali bombing]] were planned and carried out by a close clique, composed of close friends, family members and other strong social networks. These groups benefited from the free flow of information and efficient [[telecommunications]] to succeed where others had failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sageman |first=Mark |title=Understanding Terror Networks |publisher=U. of Pennsylvania Press |year=2004 |location=Philadelphia, PA |pages=166–67 |isbn=978-0-8122-3808-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, much research has been conducted to distill a terrorist profile to explain these individuals' actions through their psychology and socio-economic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://icct.nl/publication/personal-characteristics-of-lone-actor-terrorists/ |title=Personal Characteristics of Lone-Actor Terrorists |date=29 February 2016 |author1=Prof. Dr. Edwin Bakker |author2=Jeanine de Roy van Zuijdewijn |access-date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like Roderick Hindery, have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists. Some security organizations designate these groups as ''violent non-state actors''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} A 2007 study by economist [[Alan B. Krueger]] found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background (28% vs. 33%) and more likely to have at least a high-school education (47% vs. 38%). Another analysis found only 16% of terrorists came from impoverished families, vs. 30% of male Palestinians, and over 60% had gone beyond high school, vs. 15% of the populace.A study into the poverty-stricken conditions and whether or not,terrorists are more likely to come from here,show that people who grew up in these situations tend to show aggression and frustration towards others. This theory is largely debated for the simple fact that just because one is frustrated,does not make them a potential terrorist.&lt;ref name="Arie W 2006 pp. 45-48"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Superfreakonomics: global cooling, patriotic prostitutes, and why suicide bombers should buy life insurance |author1=Steven D.

Groups not part of the state apparatus of in opposition to the state are most commonly referred to as a "terrorist" in the media.

According to the Global Terrorism Database, the most active terrorist group in the period 1970 to 2010 was [[Shining Path]] (with 4,517 attacks), followed by [[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]] (FMLN), [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), [[Basque Fatherland and Freedom]] (ETA), [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC), [[Taliban]], [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], [[New People's Army]], [[National Liberation Army of Colombia]] (ELN), and [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.start.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/publications/br/ETACeasefires.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State sponsors ===
{{Main|State-sponsored terrorism}}
A state can sponsor terrorism by funding or harboring a terrorist group. Opinions as to which acts of violence by states consist of state-sponsored terrorism vary widely. When states provide funding for groups considered by some to be terrorist, they rarely acknowledge them as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.trackingterrorism.org/article/state-sponsored-terrorism |title=State Sponsored Terrorism |publisher=trackingterrorism.org|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

If States abused their power, they should be judged against international conventions dealing with [[war crime]]s, [[international human rights law]], and [[international humanitarian law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2002/SC7276.doc.htm |title=Addressing Security Council, Secretary-General Calls on Counter-Terrorism Committee To Develop Long-Term  Strategy To Defeat Terror |publisher=Un.org |access-date=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former United Nations [[Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] has said that it is "time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'.

State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts committed by governmental agents or forces. This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of [[Political Science]] Michael Stohl cites the examples that include the German [[The Blitz|bombing of London]], the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]], the British and American [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|firebombing of Dresden]], and the U.S. [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during [[World War II]]. He argues that "the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents." He also cites the [[first strike]] option as an example of the "terror of coercive diplomacy" as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using [[nuclear weapon]]s in "crisis management" and he argues that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II. In this analysis, state terrorism exhibited as a form of [[foreign policy]] was shaped by the presence and use of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], and the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this behavior by the state .&lt;ref name="tws11jangbhh"&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael Stohl |title=The Superpowers and International Terror |publisher=International Studies Association, Atlanta |date=1 April 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael Stohl |title=Terrible beyond Endurance?

[[State-sponsored terrorism|State sponsors]] have constituted a major form of funding; for example, [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] and other groups considered to be terrorist organizations, were funded by the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="ncua" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tws11jan4r67"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jeremy Lott |title=Tripped Up |quote=and before the Soviet Union fell, terrorist organizations were funding themselves through subsidies from Communist governments |publisher=Reason Magazine |date=6 October 2004 |url=http://reason.com/archives/2004/10/06/tripped-up|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stern Gang]] received funding from [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] officers in Beirut to undermine the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Aims and activities of the Stern Group in Palestine |journal=Research and Analysis Branch |volume=2717 |issue=R &amp; N |date=1 December 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]] has created and nurtured terrorist groups as policy for achieving tactical objectives against its neighbours, especially [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/5779916/Pakistani-president-Asif-Zardari-admits-creating-terrorist-groups.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |title=Pakistani president Asif Zardari admits creating terrorist groups | access-date= |first=Dean |last=Nelson |date=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorist groups usually methodically plan attacks in advance, and may train participants, plant undercover agents, and raise money from supporters or through [[organized crime]]. Communications occur through modern [[telecommunications]], or through old-fashioned methods such as [[courier]]s. There is also concern about terrorist attacks employing [[weapons of mass destruction]].

Terrorism is a form of [[asymmetric warfare]], and is more common when direct [[conventional warfare]] will not be effective because forces vary greatly in power.&lt;ref name=tws11jan1q21q&gt;{{cite news |title=Hackers warn high street chains |quote=That's the beauty of asymmetric warfare. You don't need a lot of money, or an army of people. |publisher=BBC News |date=25 April 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7366995.stm|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large-scale, unresolved political conflict. The type of conflict varies widely; historical examples include:
* [[Secession]] of a territory to form a new sovereign state or become part of a different state
* Dominance of territory or resources by various [[ethnic groups]]
* Imposition of a particular form of government
* Economic deprivation of a population
* Opposition to a domestic government or occupying army
* Religious fanaticism

== Responses ==
[[File:1080 Poisoning Scare At New World in Wellington.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Sign notifying shoppers of increased surveillance due to a perceived increased risk of terrorism]]
Responses to terrorism are broad in scope. They can include re-alignments of the [[political spectrum]] and reassessments of [[value system|fundamental values]].

Specific types of responses include:
* [[Anti-terrorism legislation|Targeted laws, criminal procedures, deportations, and enhanced police powers]]
* [[Target hardening]], such as locking doors or adding traffic barriers
* Preemptive or reactive military action
* Increased intelligence and surveillance activities
* Preemptive humanitarian activities
* More permissive interrogation and detention policies

The term "[[counter-terrorism]]" has a narrower connotation, implying that it is directed at terrorist actors.

According to a report by Dana Priest and William M. Arkin in [[The Washington Post]], "Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/a-hidden-world-growing-beyond-control/ |title=A hidden world, growing beyond control |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=19 July 2010 |first1=Dana |last1=Priest |first2=William |last2=Arkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

America's thinking on how to defeat radical Islamists is split along two very different schools of thought. Republicans, typically follow what is known as the Bush Doctrine, advocate the military model of taking the fight to the enemy and seeking to democratize the Middle East. Democrats, by contrast, generally propose the law enforcement model of better cooperation with nations and more security at home.&lt;ref name=ankony1&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "A New Strategy for America's War on Terrorism", ''Patrolling'' magazine, 75th Ranger Regiment Association, Winter 2011, 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction of the ''U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual'', Sarah Sewall states the need for "U.S. forces to make securing the civilian, rather than destroying the enemy, their top priority. The civilian population is the center of gravity—the deciding factor in the struggle.... Civilian deaths create an extended family of enemies—new insurgent recruits or informants––and erode support of the host nation." Sewall sums up the book's key points on how to win this battle: "Sometimes, the more you protect your force, the less secure you may be.... Sometimes, the more force is used, the less effective it is.... The more successful the counterinsurgency is, the less force can be used and the more risk must be accepted.... Sometimes, doing nothing is the best reaction."&lt;ref&gt;Sewall, Sarah, introduction to ''The U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy, often termed "courageous restraint", has certainly led to some success on the Middle East battlefield, yet it fails to address the central truth: the terrorists we face are mostly homegrown.&lt;ref name=ankony1 /&gt;

=== Terrorism research ===
Terrorism research, also called terrorism and counter-terrorism research, is an interdisciplinary academic field which seeks to understand the causes of terrorism, how to prevent it as well as its impact in the broadest sense. Terrorism research can be carried out in both military and civilian contexts, for example by research centres such as the British [[Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence]], the [[Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies]], and the [[International Centre for Counter-Terrorism]] (ICCT). There are several academic journals devoted to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tinnes |first1=J |year=2013 |title=100 Core and Periphery Journals for Terrorism Research |url=http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/258 |journal=Perspectives on Terrorism |volume=7 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International agreements ===
One of the agreements that promote the international legal anti-terror framework is the Code of Conduct Towards Achieving a World Free of Terrorism that was adopted at the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2018. The Code of Conduct was initiated by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Its main goal is to implement a wide range of international commitments to counter terrorism and establish a broad global coalition towards achieving a world free of terrorism by 2045. The Code was signed by more than 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=70 countries sign Counter-Terrorism Code initiated by Kazakhstan |url=https://www.inform.kz/en/70-countries-sign-counter-terrorism-code-initiated-by-kazakhstan-says-president_a3450890 |website=inform.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mass media ==

[[File:Plakat La Terroriste.jpg|thumb|''La Terroriste'', a 1910 poster depicting a female member of the [[Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party]] throwing a bomb at a Russian official's car.|left]]
Mass media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media. Some consider this to be manipulation and exploitation of the media.&lt;ref&gt;The Media and Terrorism: A Reassessment [[Paul Wilkinson (professor)|Paul Wilkinson]]. ''Terrorism and Political Violence'', Vol. 9, No. 2 (Summer 1997), pp. 51–64 Published by Frank Cass, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet has created a new channel for groups to spread their messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://icct.nl/publication/responding-to-cyber-jihad-towards-an-effective-counter-narrative/ |title=Responding to Cyber Jihad: Towards an Effective Counter Narrative |date=31 March 2015 |author=Dr. Bibi van Ginkel |publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT) | access-date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has created a cycle of measures and counter measures by groups in support of and in opposition to terrorist movements. The United Nations has created its own online counter-terrorism resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |title=Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee |access-date=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass media will, on occasion, censor organizations involved in terrorism (through self-restraint or regulation) to discourage further terrorism. However, this may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media. Conversely [[James F. Pastor]] explains the significant relationship between terrorism and the media, and the underlying benefit each receives from the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terrorism &amp; Public Safety Policing: Implications of the Obama Presidency |author=Pastor, James F. |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4398-1580-9 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcome of terrorist groups ==

[[File:RANDterroristGpsEnd2006.svg|thumb|upright=2|How terrorist groups end (n = 268): The most common ending for a terrorist group is to convert to nonviolence via negotiations (43 percent), with most of the rest terminated by routine policing (40 percent).  Groups that were ended by military force constituted only 7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;The researchers found 648 terrorist groups active between 1968 and 2006.  Of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006 (Jones and Libicki, 2008, p. 19)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Jones and Libicki (2008) created a list of all the terrorist groups they could find that were active between 1968 and 2006.  They found 648.  of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Libicki (2008, p. 19)&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ones that ended, 43 percent converted to nonviolent political actions, like the [[Good Friday Agreement|Irish Republican Army]] in Northern Ireland.  Law enforcement took out 40 percent.  Ten percent won.  Only 20 groups, 7 percent, were taken out by military force.

Forty-two groups became large enough to be labeled an insurgency; 38 of those had ended by 2006.  Of those, 47 percent converted to nonviolent political actors.  Only 5 percent were taken out by law enforcement.   26 percent won.  21 percent succumbed to military force.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Libicki (2008, p. 101, Table 5.4)&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and Libicki concluded that military force may be necessary to deal with large insurgencies but are only occasionally decisive, because the military is too often seen as a bigger threat to civilians than the terrorists.  To avoid that, the [[rules of engagement]] must be conscious of [[collateral damage]] and work to minimize it.

Another researcher, Audrey Cronin, lists six primary ways that terrorist groups end:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cronin |first1=Audrey Kurth |title=How Terrorism Ends: Understanding the Decline and Demise of Terrorist Campaigns |date=2009 |publisher=Princeton U. Pr |isbn=978-0-691-13948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Capture or killing of a group's leader. (Decapitation).
# Entry of the group into a legitimate political process. (Negotiation).
# Achievement of group aims. (Success).
# Group implosion or loss of public support. (Failure).
# Defeat and elimination through brute force. (Repression).
# Transition from terrorism into other forms of violence. (Reorientation).

== Databases ==
The following terrorism databases are or were made publicly available for research purposes, and track specific acts of terrorism:
* [[Global Terrorism Database]], an open-source database by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2015 with more than 150,000 cases.
* [[MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base]]
* [[Worldwide Incidents Tracking System]]
* [[Tocsearch]] (dynamic database)
The following public report and index provides a summary of key global trends and patterns in terrorism around the world
* [[Global Terrorism Index]], produced annually by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]]

* [[Human Security Gateway]]

The following terrorism databases are maintained in secrecy by the United States Government for intelligence and counter-terrorism purposes:
* [[Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment]]
* [[Terrorist Screening Database]]

Jones and Libicki (2008) includes a table of 268 terrorist groups active between 1968 and 2006 with their status as of 2006:  still active, splintered, converted to nonviolence, removed by law enforcement or military, or won.  (These data are not in a convenient machine-readable format but are available.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3148">'''The Global 100''' Index is a ranking of the world's most [[sustainable]] corporations. The list is compiled by Toronto-based media and investment advisory firm, [[Corporate Knights]] (CK).

Each year, the latest iteration of the index is announced at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Switzerland.

As at December 31, 2013 the Global 100 has outperformed its benchmark, the [[MSCI]] All Country World Index by 3.21%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corporateknights.com/article/corporate-knights-announces-latest-additions-its-widely-followed-global-100-index-world-econ&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Global 100 was created by Corporate Knights Magazine in 2005. The goal of creating the index was to devise a methodology to quantitatively compare and rank the world’s largest public companies.

==Methodology==

The Global 100 uses a purely quantitative methodology to determine inclusion in the ranking. The Global 100 starting universe automatically considers all firms with a market capitalization of at least US$2 billion. The firms are then put through numerous screenings to test for key information, including; overall sustainability disclosure rate and sustainability disclosure rate versus [[Global Industry Classification Standard|GICS]] sector peers, a financially based Piotroski [[F-score]] to ensure financial stability, and fines, penalties or settlements paid out by the company for sustainability related violations. Companies in the GICS sub-industry categories of tobacco and those engaged primarily in defence are eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;http://global100.org/methodology/&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial screening process culminates in the Global 100 shortlist. At this point, companies are compared on priority key performance indicators (KPIs), according to GICS sector. Priority indicators are chosen based on the percentage of firms in the sector who disclose the indicator. If less than 10% disclose, than the indicator will not be considered a priority KPI for that sector. There are a maximum of 12 KPIs used in the ranking, they are:

* Energy Productivity
* Carbon Productivity
* Water Productivity
* Waste Productivity
* Innovation Capacity
* Percentage Tax Paid
* CEO to Average Worker Pay
* Pension Fund Status
* Safety Performance
* Employee Turnover
* Leadership Diversity
* Clean Capitalism Pay Link

Each KPI is weighted equally and companies are given an overall percentage score. Failure to disclose a priority KPI will result in a zero, thus severely punishing firms for [[non-disclosure]].

==Accolades==
The Global 100 Index has been recognized as a leader in transparency and industry best practices for sustainability rankings, according to SustainAbility’s Rate the Raters project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainability.com/projects/rate-the-raters#projtab-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Torcuato di Tella Institute''' is a [[non-profit]] foundation organized for the promotion of [[Argentine culture]].

==Overview==
The di Tella Foundation and its institute were created on July 22, 1958, the tenth anniversary of the death of industrialist and arts patron [[Torcuato di Tella]]. Funding for the project, organized by his sons, Torcuato and [[Guido di Tella]], was raised using the United States model of corporate financing, as well as by the donation of 10% of the [[Siam di Tella]] corporation's [[public stock]]. Its objective was initially limited to an arts program revolving primarily around the display of the di Tella family's private collections, which prominently included works by [[Henry Moore]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Jackson Pollock]].&lt;ref name=ditella&gt;[http://html.rincondelvago.com/instituto-di-tella.html Instituto Di Tella: Promoción del arte. Experimentación audiovisual. Investigación y financiación artística {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The board of the foundation consisted of family members, though the institute was directed by a board that included academics and intellectuals from outside the family. Guido di Tella would serve as president, and the post of director of the institute was offered to Enrique Oteiza, whose family were leading [[Pampas]]-area landowners. The foundation also received funding in the form of grants from the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation]]s, after which the modest initiative expanded into [[Argentine culture#Cinema and theatre|theater]] and [[Argentine music|music]], and grew to become the most significant cultural institution in Buenos Aires of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;

The institute continued to influence prevailing trends in the history of Argentine culture, however, and it adopted and advanced a [[modernist]] trend in various artistic disciplines. Its audiovisual center, established in 1960, and directed by Roberto Villanueva, premiered with a play, ''El Desatino'' (''The Folly''). The production's scenery backdrops were projected through slides, and introduced audiences to [[Nacha Guevara]] and [[Les Luthiers]]. This format would be promoted in subsequent years for its ability to broadcast material through compact and portable media in a way that would stimulate a network of local groups active in the cultural field.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt; 
[[File:Instituto di Tella.bmp|thumb|left|210px|The Torcuato di Tella Institute at Florida Street during its heyday in the 1960s]]

Following its establishment, the di Tella art collection was transferred to the foundation, and [[Jorge Romero Brest]] hosted a free show at the [[Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires)|National Museum of Fine Arts]], which the leading local art critic directed. The activities were transferred to a small office in the Museum of Fine Arts in August 1960, and this was followed by an annual award for national and international artists, many of which sold their works to the di Tella collection. As part of the awards program, the winners were awarded scholarships covering study abroad and an exhibition of works in a North American or European gallery. Growing local interest in [[Latin American art]] was accompanied by an initiative to show the di Tella collection across the Argentine hinterland, for which a minibus was purchased in 1963; the experiment, however, ended the following year, when the vehicle crashed in a rural [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]] road.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;
[[File:La Menesunda.jpg|thumb|210px|Patrons venture into ''La Menesunda'', Marta Minujín's famed 1965 "[[happening]]" at the institute.]]
 
An initiative by Guido di Tella led to the institute's relocation into a modern, newly completed [[Florida Street]] building in August 1963. The offices were rented by SIAM di Tella at the northern end of Florida Street, near [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]], a busy pedestrian intersection in the upscale [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] district that could attract larger audiences. The building was refurbished with the addition of three stage theatres, and interiors designed to be inviting, with a floor-to-ceiling glass panel façade featuring publicity photos taken by Humberto Rivas, and a large lobby. The modern, air-conditioned building was propitious for exhibits and artistic events year-round. Its café, like the gallery, was staffed by attendants who wore no uniforms, and allowed patrons to smoke and take photographs at their leisure.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;

Founded by [[classical music|classical]] composer [[Alberto Ginastera]], CLAEM (the Latin American Center for Advanced Musical Studies) was made part of the institute in 1962, yielding numerous productions of [[dodecaphonic]], [[electronic music|electronic]], and [[acoustic music]]; CLAEM attracted prominent international guest lecturers such as [[Aaron Copland]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]]. A visual arts center (CAV) was also inaugurated at the new address. Directed by Romero Brest, CAV became the leading Buenos Aires center for the display and promotion for [[avant-garde]] creations. CAV introduced art patrons to sculptors [[Juan Carlos Distéfano]], [[Julio Le Parc]], and [[Clorindo Testa]], as well as painters [[Romulo Macció]], [[Luis Felipe Noé]], [[Jorge de la Vega]], [[Ernesto Deira]], [[Antonio Seguí]], and [[conceptual art]]ists such as [[Edgardo Giménez]] and [[Marta Minujín]]. The latter garnered interest after earning the institute's first National Award in 1964, and became known for her "[[happening]]s." Erotic in some aspects, and provocative to conservative local audiences, her early di Tella Institute events included ''Eróticos en technicolor'' and the interactive ''Revuélquese y viva'' (''Roll Around in Bed and Live''). She then joined Rubén Santantonín in 1965 to create ''La Menesunda'' (''Mayhem''), where participants were asked to go through sixteen chambers, each separated by a human-shaped entry. Led by [[neon]] lights, groups of eight visitors would encounter rooms with television sets at full blast, couples making love in bed, a cosmetics counter (complete with an attendant), a dental office from which dialing an oversized rotary phone was required to leave, a walk-in freezer with dangling fabrics (suggesting sides of beef), and a mirrored room with [[black light]]ing, falling confetti, and the scent of frying food. The use of advertising throughout suggested the influence of [[pop art]] in Minujín's "mayhem." &lt;ref name=clarin2&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/06/conexiones/t-1008529.htm ''Clarín'' (7/6/2005) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Le Parc - by Juan Carlos Distéfano.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Cover designed by Juan Carlos Distéfano for the institute's 1967 exhibition of Julio Le Parc's refracted photography]]

Already established as the leading local center for [[pop art]], the di Tella Institute also became a forum for art as political commentary. This was dramatized by what became the center's most contentious display, sculptor [[León Ferrari]]'s  ''La civilización occidental y cristiana'' (''Western-Christian Civilization''), in October 1965. The work displays [[Christ]] [[crucifixion|crucified]] not by the traditional [[Christian cross|cross]]; but by a [[fighter aircraft|fighter plane]], as a symbolic protest against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argentinaxplora.com/activida/arte/ditella/ditell.htm Argentina Xplora: El Instituto di Tella {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Experiencia Instituto Di Tella.jpg|thumb|210px|An "experience" at the di Tella, where experimental theatre became a 'happening' for hapless audiences.]]

A turn of historical events in 1966 proved detrimental to the institute, and to [[freedom of expression]], when the civilian administration of President [[Arturo Illia]] was deposed on June 28 by the [[Argentine Armed Forces]], and was replaced with the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]]. Moderate in comparison with many of his counterparts in other Latin American nations, Onganía was, however, a member of the right-wing [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] power group, [[Opus Dei]], and as such, found many of the developments in Argentine culture during the 1960s offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison, Robert. ''Their Kingdom Come: Inside the Secret World of Opus Dei''. St. Martin's Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing his distaste for modern culture was Luis Margaride, whom he named head of the [[Policía Federal Argentina|Federal District Police]], and who would be remembered for his crusades against nightclubs, long hair, and miniskirts.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Martin. ''Dossier Secreto''. Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing a government policy backdrop such as this, numerous avant-garde artists (and others, [[Noche de los Bastones Largos|particularly in academia]]) left Argentina, many never to return.&lt;ref name=crawley&gt;Crawley, Eduardo. ''A House Divided: Argentina 1880-1980''. St. Martin's Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-styled ''mazanana loca'' (''city block of madness''), the center's agenda remained active initially, and this new era was marked by the advent of the "Experience"{{spaced ndash}}a fusion of the more controversial happenings with [[experimental theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/1998/suple/radar/mayo/98-05-24/nota2_a.htm ''Página/12'' (5/24/1998) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in audiences and contributions, as well as the Siam di Tella Corporation's own, mounting financial problems, led to the curtailment of most of its activities by 1969, however. The Ford Foundation continued to support the institute, though these grants were contractually limited to social studies. The director, Enrique Oteiza, and two leading board members, [[Jorge Sábato]] and [[Roberto Cortés Conde]], resigned, and in May 1970, the famed Florida Street center hosted its last exhibition, a theatrical production by [[Marilú Marini]]. The foundation was bankrupt, and only the sale in 1971 of numerous works from its collection of [[Gothic art|Gothic]], [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]], and [[Baroque art]] to the federal government for 2.1 million [[Peso ley|pesos]] (US$500,000), staved off its liquidation.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;

Remembered nostalgically by friends of the arts, and particularly during the "[[Dirty War]]" of the late 1970s, when repression of political terrorism quickly extended to dissidents and controversial artists, the institute's absence became an example of the "cultural blackout" described by writer [[Ernesto Sábato]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jordán, Alberto. ''El Proceso''. Emecé Editores, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Following President [[Néstor Kirchner]]'s appointment of Torcuato Di Tella (jr.) as Secretary of Culture in 2003, the idea of reviving the storied center was first plausibly discussed by the president of the board of regents of [[Torcuato di Tella University]], [[Manuel Mora y Araujo]].&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/24/sociedad/s-05601.htm ''Clarín'' (2/24/2007) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the 1960s-era documentation and numerous works had been stored by the library at the university, the di Tella family's surviving contribution to local culture, and the material's recataloguing was initiated in 2004. New facilities were developed that year from a former water company building by one of the center's alumni, sculptor and architect [[Clorindo Testa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=630140 ''La Nación'' (8/25/2004) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 21, 2007, the institute's center for visual arts was reinaugurated at the [[Figueroa Alcorta Avenue]] location with the ''Otro Modo'' (''Another Way'') Festival.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;  Continuing to host [[media art|media]] and [[conceptual art]] displays, the institute celebrated its 50th anniversary in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/03/07/um/m-01623241.htm ''Clarín'' (3/7/2008) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11959">In computing, the '''Two Generals Problem''' is a [[thought experiment]] meant to illustrate the pitfalls and design challenges of attempting to coordinate an action by communicating over an unreliable link. It is related to the more general [[Byzantine Generals]] Problem and appears often in introductory classes about [[computer networking]] (particularly with regard to the [[Transmission Control Protocol]], where it shows that TCP can't guarantee state consistency between endpoints and why), though it applies to any type of two-party communication where failures of communication are possible. A key concept in [[epistemic logic]], this problem highlights the importance of [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]]. Some authors also refer to this as the '''Two Generals Paradox''', the '''Two Armies Problem''', or the '''Coordinated Attack Problem'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gmytrasiewicz|first=Piotr J.|author2=Edmund H. Durfee |title=Decision-theoretic recursive modeling and the coordinated attack problem|journal=Proceedings of the first international conference on Artificial intelligence planning systems|year=1992|pages=88–95|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=139492.139503|accessdate=27 December 2013|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.uniroma1.it/~asd3/dispense/attack+amazons.pdf The coordinated attack and the jealous amazons] Alessandro Panconesi. Retrieved 2011-05-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Two Generals Problem was the first computer communication problem to be proved to be unsolvable.  An important consequence of this proof is that generalizations like the Byzantine Generals problem are also unsolvable in the face of arbitrary communication failures, thus providing a base of realistic expectations for any distributed consistency protocols.

==Definition==
Two [[army|armies]], each led by a different [[general]], are preparing to attack a fortified city. The armies are encamped near the city, each in its own valley. A third valley separates the two hills, and the only way for the two generals to communicate is by sending [[Runner (war)|messenger]]s through the valley. Unfortunately, the valley is occupied by the city's defenders and there's a chance that any given messenger sent through the valley will be captured.

[[File:2-generals.svg|right|thumb|Positions of the armies. Armies A1 and A2 need to communicate but their messengers may be captured by army B.]]

While the two generals have agreed that they will attack, they haven't agreed upon a time for attack. It is required that the two generals have their armies attack the city at the same time in order to succeed, else the lone attacker army will die trying. They must thus communicate with each other to decide on a time to attack and to agree to attack at that time, and each general must know that the other general knows that they have agreed to the attack plan. Because [[Acknowledgement (data networks)|acknowledgement of message receipt]] can be lost as easily as the original message, a potentially infinite series of messages is required to come to [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus]].

The thought experiment involves considering how they might go about coming to consensus. In its simplest form one general is known to be the leader, decides on the time of attack, and must communicate this time to the other general. The problem is to come up with algorithms that the generals can use, including sending messages and processing received messages, that can allow them to correctly conclude:

:Yes, we will both attack at the agreed-upon time.

Allowing that it is quite simple for the generals to come to an agreement on the time to attack (i.e. one successful message with a successful acknowledgement), the subtlety of the Two Generals' Problem is in the impossibility of designing algorithms for the generals to use to safely agree to the above statement.

==Illustrating the problem==
The first general may start by sending a message "Attack at 0900 on August 4." However, once dispatched, the first general has no idea whether or not the messenger got through. This uncertainty may lead the first general to hesitate to attack due to the risk of being the sole attacker.

To be sure, the second general may send a confirmation back to the first: "I received your message and will attack at 0900 on August 4." However, the messenger carrying the confirmation could face capture and the second general may hesitate, knowing that the first might hold back without the confirmation.

Further confirmations may seem like a solution—let the second general send a second confirmation: "I received your confirmation of the planned attack at 0900 on August 4." However, this new messenger from the second general is liable to be captured, too. Thus it quickly becomes evident that no matter how many rounds of confirmation are made, there is no way to guarantee the second requirement that each general be sure the other has agreed to the attack plan. Both generals will always be left wondering whether their last messenger got through.

==Proof==

===For deterministic protocols with a fixed number of messages===
Because this protocol is '''[[Deterministic_system|deterministic]]''', suppose there is a '''sequence''' of a fixed number of messages, one or more successfully delivered and one or more not. The assumption is that there should be a ''shared certainty for both generals to attack''.

Consider the last such message that was successfully delivered. If that last message had not been successfully delivered, then one general at least (presumably the receiver) would decide not to attack. {{Citation needed|reason=There is probably an error in the proof. In original reference or only here? See Talk page for details.|date=May 2017}} From the viewpoint of the sender of that last message, however, the '''sequence''' of messages sent and delivered is exactly the same as it would have been, had that message been delivered.

Since the protocol is '''deterministic''', the general sending that last message will still decide to attack. 
We've now created a situation where the suggested protocol leads one general to attack and the other not to attack—contradicting the assumption that the protocol was a solution to the problem.

===For nondeterministic and variable-length protocols===
A '''nondeterministic''' protocol with a variable message count can be compared to a '''finite''' [[tree (graph theory)|tree]], where each leaf or branch (node) in the tree represents an explored example up to a specified point.

The roots of this tree are labeled with the possible starting messages, and the branch nodes stemming from these roots are labeled with the possible next messages. Leaf nodes represent examples which end after sending the last message. A protocol that terminates before sending any messages is represented by a null tree.

Suppose there exists a '''nondeterministic''' protocol which solves the problem. Then, by a similar argument to the '''deterministic''' example in the previous section, where a deterministic protocol can be obtained from the non-deterministic one by removing all leaf nodes, the '''deterministic''' protocol must then also solve the problem.

Since the '''nondeterministic''' protocol is '''finite''', it then follows that the protocol represented by the empty tree would solve the problem. Clearly this is not possible. Therefore a '''nondeterministic''' protocol which solves the problem cannot exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennard|first1=Fredrick|title=Thought Experiments: Popular Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Physics, Ethics, Computer Science &amp; Mathematics|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329003422|page=346|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=sX-pCQAAQBAJ|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering approaches==
A pragmatic approach to dealing with the Two Generals' Problem is to use schemes that accept the [[uncertainty]] of the [[communication]]s channel and not attempt to eliminate it, but rather mitigate it to an acceptable degree. For example, the first general could send 100 messengers, anticipating that the probability of all being captured is low. With this approach the first general will attack no matter what, and the second general will attack if any message is received. Alternatively the first general could send a stream of messages and the second general could send acknowledgments to each, with each general feeling more comfortable with every message received. As seen in the proof, however, neither can be certain that the attack will be coordinated. There's no algorithm that they can use (e.g. attack if more than four messages are received) which will be certain to prevent one from attacking without the other. Also, the first general can send a marking on each message saying it is message 1, 2, 3 ... of n. This method will allow the second general to know how reliable the channel is and send an appropriate number of messages back to ensure a high probability of at least one message being received. If the channel can be made to be reliable, then one message will suffice and additional messages do not help. The last is as likely to get lost as the first.

Assuming that the generals must sacrifice lives every time a messenger is sent and intercepted, an algorithm can be designed to minimize the number of messengers required to achieve the maximum amount of confidence the attack is coordinated.  To save them from sacrificing hundreds of lives to achieve a very high confidence in coordination, the generals could agree to use the absence of messengers as an indication that the general who began the transaction has received at least one confirmation, and has promised to attack. Suppose it takes a messenger 1 minute to cross the danger zone, allowing 200 minutes of silence to occur after confirmations have been received will allow us to achieve extremely high confidence while not sacrificing messenger lives.  In this case messengers are used only in the case where a party has not received the attack time.  At the end of 200 minutes, each general can reason: "I have not received an additional message for 200 minutes; either 200 messengers failed to cross the danger zone, or it means the other general has confirmed and committed to the attack and has confidence I will too".

==History==
The Two Generals Problem and its impossibility proof was first published by E. A. Akkoyunlu, K. Ekanadham, and R. V. Huber in 1975 in "Some Constraints and Trade-offs in the Design of Network Communications",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hydra.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/teaching/courses/AdvancedDistributedSystems/download/1975_Akkoyunlu,%20Ekanadham,%20Huber_Some%20constraints%20and%20tradeoffs%20in%20the%20design%20of%20network%20communications.pdf |doi=10.1145/800213.806523 
|title=Some constraints and trade-offs in the design of network communications |publisher=Portal.acm.org |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is described starting on page 73 in the context of communication between two groups of gangsters.

This problem was given the name the ''Two Generals Paradox'' by [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/JimGrayHomePageSummary.htm |title=Jim Gray Summary Home Page |publisher=Research.microsoft.com |date=2004-05-03 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1978 in "Notes on Data Base Operating Systems"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=723863 |title=Notes on Data Base Operating Systems |publisher=Portal.acm.org |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting on page 465. This reference is widely given as a source for the definition of the problem and the impossibility proof, though both were published previously as above.

'''United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX) (Definition of Aggression)''' was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 14, 1974 as a non-binding recommendation to the [[United Nations Security Council]] on the definition it should use for the [[crime of aggression]].&lt;ref name=Yoram/&gt;

== Background ==
The adoption of the definition was the culmination of a long process begun in 1923 under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]]. In December 1967 the General Assembly adopted Resolution 2330 (XXII), which established a Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression. This body comprised 35 member states.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES2330XXII_page2"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-2330(XXII) |type=Resolution| body=General Assembly |page=2 |accessdate=2007-11-13|date=18 December 1967|title=Need to expedite the drafting of a definition of aggression in light of the present international situation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seven years, it reported back to the General Assembly with draft proposals that formed the basis of the final Definition of Aggression.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES3314XXIX_page1"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-3314(XXIX) |type=Resolution| body=General Assembly ||page=1 |accessdate=2007-11-13| title=Definition of aggression}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The definition of aggression ==
The definition makes a distinction between ''[[aggression]]'' (which "gives rise to international responsibility") and ''[[war of aggression]]'' (which is "a crime against international peace"). Article 3 "in accordance with the provisions of article 2", defines certain acts as aggression, such as armed invasions or attacks, bombardments, blockades, armed violations of territory, permitting other states to use one's own territory to perpetrate acts of aggression and the employment of armed irregulars or mercenaries to carry out acts of aggression. Article 2 states that the first use of force in contravention of the UN Charter will be prima facie evidence of aggression, but the Security Council has the authority to determine that given the circumstances aggression has not taken place. A war of aggression is a series of acts committed with a sustained intent. The definition's distinction between an ''act'' of aggression and a ''war'' of aggression make it clear that not every act of aggression would constitute a crime against peace; only war of aggression does. States would nonetheless be held responsible for acts of aggression.

== Criticisms of the definition ==
The wording of the definition has been criticised by many commentators. Its clauses on the use of armed irregulars are vague, as it is unclear what level of "involvement" would entail state responsibility. It is also highly state-centric, in that it deems states to be the only actors liable for acts of aggression. Domestic or transnational insurgent groups, such as those that took part in the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] and the [[Yugoslav Wars]], were key players in their respective conflicts despite being non-state parties; they would not have come within the scope of the definition.

The Definition of Aggression also does not cover acts by international organisations. The two key military alliances at the time of the definition's adoption, [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], were non-state parties and thus were outside the scope of the definition.&lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Detter Delupis, ''The Law of War'', pp. 69-70. Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the definition does not deal with the responsibilities of individuals for acts of aggression. It is widely perceived as an insufficient basis on which to ground individual criminal prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;L.F. Damrosch, "Enforcing International Law through Non-forcible Measures", p. 202. ''Recueil De Cours/Collected Courses'', Académie de Droit International de La Haye, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition is not binding on the Security Council. The [[United Nations Charter]] empowers the General Assembly to make recommendations to the [[United Nations Security Council]] but the Assembly may not dictate to the Council. The resolution accompanying the definition states that it is intended to provide guidance to the Security Council to aid it "in determining, in accordance with the Charter, the existence of an act of aggression".&lt;ref name=Yoram&gt;[[Yoram Dinstein]], ''War, Aggression and Self-Defence'', p. 118. Cambridge University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council may apply or disregard this guidance as it sees fit. Legal commentators argued in 1999 that the Definition of Aggression has had "no visible impact" on the deliberations of the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Bassiouni and B.B. Ferencz, "The Crime against Peace", ''International Criminal Law'', I, 313, 334 (M.C. Bassiouni ed., 2nd ed., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2250">A '''vanishing mediator''' is a concept that exists to mediate between two opposing ideas, as a transition occurs between them. This mediating concept exists just long enough to facillitate such an interaction: at the point where one idea has been replaced by the other, the concept is no longer required and thus vanishes.&lt;ref name="Žižek"&gt;[http://www.lacan.com/zizekchro1.htm  Slavoj Zizek - Key Ideas]&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of [[Dialectics#Hegelian dialectic|Hegelian dialectics]] the conflict between the theoretical abstraction and its empirical negation (through trial and error) is resolved by a concretion of the two ideas, representing a theoretical abstraction taking into account the previous contradiction, whereupon the mediator vanishes.

In terms of [[psychoanalytic theory]], when someone is caught in a dilemma they experience [[hysteria]]. A conceptual deadlock exists until the resulting hysteric breakdown precipitates some kind of resolution, therefore the Hysteria is a vanishing mediator in this case.&lt;ref name="Hys"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070620203152/http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~hartleyg/epoetry/avant/hysteria.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[political history]], it refers to social movements, which operate in a particular way to influence politics, until they either are forgotten or change their purpose.&lt;ref name="Us"&gt;[http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2006/01/zizek_and_us.html Zizek and us.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fredric Jameson introduced the term in a 1973 essay ("The Vanishing Mediator: Narrative Structure in Max Weber," in New German Critique 1 [Winter, 1973]: 52-89). [[Alain Badiou]] uses a similar, but more explicitly post-structuralist term (″terme évanouissant″ or ″vanishing term″) in ''Théorie du sujet''.

Since, this concept has been adopted by [[Žižek]] in "For They Know Not What They Do: Enjoyment as a Political factor", where he uses it in a political sense, similar to [[Marx]]'s Analysis of Revolution.&lt;ref name="Žižek"/&gt;

The '''Watching-Eye Effect''' is related to the [[Hawthorne effect]] which describes that there is an observable change in behavior when people are being watched. It has been demonstrated that these effects are so pronounced that even depictions of eyes are enough to trigger them, in which case they are referred to as Watching-Eye Effect. Empirical psychological research has continually shown that the visible presence of images depicting eyes nudges people towards slightly, but measurably more honest and more pro-social behavior.

The concept is part of the psychology of surveillance and has implications for the areas of crime reduction and prevention without increasing actual surveillance, just by psychological measures alone.

The effect differs from the [[Psychic staring effect]] in that the latter describes the feeling of being watched, whereas individuals who succumb to the Watching-Eye Effect are usually aware that the eyes are only images.

'''Wonder''' is an emotion comparable to [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]] that people feel when perceiving something very rare or unexpected (but not threatening). It has historically been seen as an important aspect of [[human nature]], specifically being linked with [[curiosity]] and the drive behind intellectual exploration.&lt;ref name="Philip Fisher"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674955622 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |title=Wonder, the Rainbow, and the Aesthetics of Rare Experiences |author=Philip Fisher |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wonder is also often compared to the emotion of [[awe (emotion)|awe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1= |last1=Keltner |first2= |last2=Haidt |title=Approaching awe |format=PDF |url=http://emotion.caltech.edu/dropbox/bi133/files/keltner.approaching-awe.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075439/http://emotion.caltech.edu/dropbox/bi133/files/keltner.approaching-awe.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but awe implies [[fear]] or [[respect]] rather than [[joy]].

==History==
French philosopher, mathematician, scientist, and writer [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) described wonder as one of the primary emotions because he claimed that emotions, in general, are reactions to unexpected phenomena. He noted that when people first encounter a surprising or new object, "... this makes us wonder and be astonished at it". Descartes, therefore, propounded that "Wonder is the first of all the passions." (Descartes ''The [[Passions of the Soul]]'' Article 53.)  But Descartes, unlike the Greek philosophers before him, held a fundamentally negative view of wonder: "Although it is good to be born with some kind of inclination to this passion [wonder] because it disposes us to the acquisition of sciences, yet we ought afterwards to endeavor as much as we can to be rid of it." (Descartes ''The [[Passions of the Soul]]'' 2 Article 76.)

This sentiment is reflected in other early modern authors like [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his discussion about the English words [[Curiosity]], [[Joy]] and [[Admiration]].  Hobbes argued that since "... whatsoever therefore happeneth new to a man, giveth him hope and matter of knowing somewhat that he knew not before", which creates "...hope and expectation of future knowledge from anything that happeneth new and strange", a "passion which we commonly call ADMIRATION; and the same considered as appetite, is called CURIOSITY, which is appetite for knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;''Elements of Law'' I (Human Nature) IX, paragraph 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''De Homine'' XII, Hobbes discussed the “joy” of “admiration” again contrasting humans to other animals. Hobbes argues that "...this passion is almost peculiar to men." He pointed out that "even if other animals, whenever they behold something new or unusual, admire it as far as they behold something new or unusual" so that they can determine if it dangerous or harmless, men on the other hand, "when they see something new, seek to know whence it came and to what use they can put it."

In ''The History of Astronomy'', [[Adam Smith]]  dwells on wonder not to explain the difference between human and animal thinking only, but rather to explain why we study [[natural science]]. An uncivilized person, or child, is still clearly different from other animals because “it beats the stone that hurts it”. The child is concerned with finding an account of cause and effect, but it is limited in its ability to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Smith |first=Adam |title=The HISTORY of ASTRONOMY - Adam Smith, Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence Vol. 3 Essays on Philosophical Subjects |origyear=1795 |year=1982 |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=201&amp;chapter=56013&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805194903/http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=201&amp;chapter=56013&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |archivedate=August 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|But when law has established order and security, and subsistence ceases to be precarious, the curiosity of mankind is increased, and their fears are diminished. [...] Wonder, therefore, and not any expectation of advantage from its discoveries, is the first principle which prompts mankind to the study of Philosophy, of that science which pretends to lay open the concealed connections that unite the various appearance of nature; and they pursue this study for its own sake, as an original pleasure or good in itself, without regarding its tendency to procure them the means of many other pleasures.| Section III [https://web.archive.org/web/20100810181512/http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=201&amp;chapter=56018&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 History of Astronomy]}}

In ''The Tangled Wing'', [[Melvin Konner]] reviews the biologist’s view of this pain and pleasure of learning. He notes that "If the problem is too unfamiliar, it will evoke attention; if it is difficult but doable, it will evoke interest, attention, and arousal and, when solved, it will evoke pleasure, often signalled by a smile." (p.&amp;nbsp;242) He says that “wonder” is “the hallmark of our species and the central feature of the human spirit”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Konner, Melvin J |year=2002 |title=The Tangled Wing: Biological Constraints on the Human Spirit |edition=2nd |origyear=1982 |location=New York |publisher=Times Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the special importance of wonder (θαυμάζειν, ''thaumazein'' in Ancient Greek) to [[philosophy]] see [[Plato]] ''Theaetetus'' 155D and [[Aristotle]] ''Metaphysics'' I.ii.982b11-24. For Aristotle also see ''Poetics'' IV: “understanding [''manthanein''] gives great [[pleasure]] not only to philosophers but likewise to others too, though the latter have a smaller share in it”. Indeed, he says, people like looking at images because of the pleasure of contemplating [''theôrizein''] what something is through ''manthanein'' and ''syllogizesthai'' (syllogism: a bringing together of ''logoi'' or accounts). We even “enjoy contemplating the most precise images of things whose sight is painful to us”.
