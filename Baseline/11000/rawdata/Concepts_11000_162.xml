In the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s, an '''''a priori'' estimate''' (also called an '''apriori estimate''' or '''''a priori'' bound''') is an estimate for the size of a solution or its derivatives of a partial differential equation. ''A priori'' is Latin for "from before" and refers to the fact that the estimate for the solution is derived before the solution is known to exist. One reason for their importance is that if one can prove an ''a priori'' estimate for solutions of a differential equation, then it is often possible to prove that solutions exist using the [[continuity method]] or a [[fixed point theorem]].

''A priori'' estimates were introduced and named by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Sergei Natanovich Bernstein|first=Sergei Natanovich|last=Bernstein|year=1906|year2=1910}}, who used them to prove existence of solutions to  second order nonlinear elliptic equations in the plane. Some other early influential examples of ''a priori'' estimates include the [[Schauder estimates]] given by {{harvs|txt|last=Schauder|year1=1934|year2=1937}}, and the estimates given by De Giorgi and Nash for second order elliptic or parabolic equations in many variables in their solution to [[Hilbert's nineteenth problem]].

'''African Centre for Technology Studies''' (ACTS) is an intergovernmental non-profit organization, founded in 1988 by [[Calestous Juma]]  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|commas=true}}&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt; in Nairobi, Kenya, promoting policy-oriented research on science and technology in development that is sustainable in terms of the economy, society, and the environment.&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt; It was the first African non-profit organization to combine policy research, science and technology.&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==History==
Founded in 1988, ACTS was a pioneer in development research on innovative development policies related to applied science, technology, and innovation.&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt;

ACTS research influenced policies on industrial property legislation and policy in Kenya, environmental impact assessment standards in Eastern and Southern Africa,  [[biofuels]] and [[bio-energy]] in Kenya, Eastern and West Africa. ACTS has also influenced policies across Africa on issues such as [[climate change adaptation]] and [[climate change mitigation|mitigation]], agriculture, biotechnology, [[biodiplomacy]], and [[biosafety]].&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt;

==Affiliations==
ACTS is a member of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD),  which includes 150 data producers and users working towards sustainable development focusing on data that informs research ending extreme poverty and addressing climate change. The Canadian, Colombian, French, Ghanaian, Italian, Mexican, Moroccan, Nigerian, Philippine, Senagalese, United Kingdom and United States' governments are member-states of the network.&lt;ref name="sustainabledevelopment_UN"&gt;{{citation |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=9691 |title=Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data |publisher=United Nations |date=2016 |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2013, ACTS was named as one of the top Environment Think Tanks globally.&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt; In 1991 the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa ([[CODESRIA]]) honored ACTS for its contribution to expanding the knowledge base for development in Africa with the Justinian Rweyemamu Prize, named after Tanzania’s first major economics scholar, [[Justinian Rweyemamu]].&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Community-based actions==
ACTS policy researchers engage with local communities to encourage communities to reflect on and learn from their own coping mechanisms when faced with flood-prone areas. They then choose best practice adaptations and develop long-term proactive strategies for flood mitigation which might include crop diversification.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://cdkn.org/resource/in-conversation-with-elvin-nyukuri-african-centre-for-technology-studies-2/?loclang=en_gb |title=In conversation with… Elvin Nyukuri, African Centre for Technology Studies |publisher=African Centre for Technology Studies |date=May 16, 2011 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected publications==
ACTS published the groundbreaking study by Harvard professor, Calestous Juma&lt;ref name="List of Fellows"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Fellows|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about-us/people-council-committees/the-fellowship/list-of-fellows}}&lt;/ref&gt; and J.

In his 1993 article, in which he examined legal processes regarding access and tenurial issues in regards to group and individual pastoral natural resource management in Turkana in Kenya, focusing on tree rights, Edmund G.C. Barrow made a case for indigenous property rights.&lt;ref name="Barrow_1993_Tree_rights"&gt;{{citation |publisher=Biopolicy International, African Centre for Technology Studies via Bioline International |number=8 |date=1993 |pages=1–23 |title=Tree Rights in Kenya: The Case of the Turkana (Part 1) |author=Edmund G.C.

According to [[Charaka Samhitā]], an early text on Ayurveda (Indian traditional medicine),  the cosmos and its correspondence – the human body, are composed of both physical (Visible) and metaphysical (Invisible) forces.

Ayurvedic acupressure talks about 10 elements – 5 physical and 5 metaphysical.

* 5 elements(not exactly elements but like forms of matter exists in our body and environment) or Panch Tatva: – Electricity or flow of charges(Not Space as it does not exist in our body and environment) , Air, Fire, Water and Earth.
* 5 metaphysical elements: – Time, Direction, Mind, Soul and Tam (Origin).

In Ayurveda the pressure points or the meridians are called Marma points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=
https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AJkWAQAACAAJ&amp;dq | title=Marma Points of Ayurveda | publisher=Ayurvedic Press | author=Vasant Lad, Anisha Durve}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are considered as energy points, just as Chinese refer them as pressure points, and they help in stimulating not only circulation, but also improve mental and emotional outlook. The Marma points are located throughout the body.

Treatment in Ayurvedic Acupressure can be easily done without needles by:
* Applying pressure with finger
* Seeds
* Magnets
* Colours

'''Calendar reform''', properly '''calendrical reform''', is any significant revision of a [[calendar]] system. The term sometimes is used instead for a proposal to switch to a different calendar design.

== Principles ==

The prime objective of a calendar is to unambiguously identify any day throughout history by a specific date. 
Periods that contain multiple days, like weeks, months and even years, are secondary features of a calendar for convenience.
Most cultures adopt a primary dating system, but different cultures have always needed to align multiple calendars with each other, because they coexisted in the same space (e.g. secular and religious groups with different demands) or had established trading relations. 
Once specified, a ''calendar design'' cannot be altered without becoming a new one, but if a design is sufficiently close to the one used before in the local ''calendar system'', switching to it and hence a calendar reform is possible without disruption. 
Some design changes, however, will yield date identifiers different from the previous design for some days, often in the distant past or future. 
The calendar system must clarify whether dates are changed to the new design retroactively (using a ''proleptic calendar'') or whether the design in use then and there shall be respected. 
Calendar schisms happen if not all cultures that adopted a common calendar system before perform a calendar reform at the same time. 
If date identifiers are similar but different, confusion and mistakes are unavoidable. 


Most calendars have several rules which could be altered by reform:
* Whether and how days are grouped into subdivisions such as [[month]]s and [[week]]s, and days outside those subdivisions, if any.
* Which years are [[leap year]]s and [[common year]]s and how they differ.
* Numbering of years, selection of the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], and the issue of [[0 (year)|year zero]].
* Start of the year (such as the [[December solstice]], 1 January, 1 March, [[March equinox]], [[Lady Day]]).
* If a week is retained, the start, length, and names of its days.
* Start of the day (midnight, sunrise, noon, or sunset).
* If months are retained, number, lengths, and names of months.
* Special days and periods (such as leap day or intercalary day).
* Alignment with social cycles.
* Alignment with astronomical cycles.
* Alignment with biological cycles.
* Literal notation of dates.

== Historical reforms ==
Historically, most calendar reforms have been made in order to synchronize the calendar with the astronomical year (either [[solar year|solar]] or [[sidereal year|sidereal]]) and/or the [[synodic month]] in [[lunar calendar|lunar]] or [[lunisolar calendar]]s. Most reforms for calendars have been to make them more accurate. This has happened to various lunar and lunisolar calendars, and also the Julian calendar when it was altered to the Gregorian calendar.

The fundamental problems of the calendar are that the astronomical year has neither a whole number of days nor a whole number of lunar months; neither does the lunar month have a whole number of days: in each case there are fractions "left over". (In some physical circumstances the rotations and revolutions of a planet and its satellite(s) can be phase-locked —for example the same side of the moon always faces us— but this has not operated to lock together the lengths of the Earth's year, day and month.) Such remainders could accumulate from one period to the next, thereby driving the cycles out of synch.

A typical solution to force synchronization is '[[intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]]'. This means occasionally adding an extra day (or month) into the cycle. An alternative approach is to ignore the mismatch and simply let the cycles continue to drift apart. The general approaches include:

* The lunar calendar, which fits days into the cycle of lunar months, adding an extra day when needed, while ignoring the annual solar cycle of the seasons.
* The solar calendar, which fits artificial months into the year, adding an extra day into one month when needed, while ignoring the lunar cycle of new/full moons.
* The lunisolar calendar, which keeps both the lunar and solar cycles, adding an extra month into the year when needed.

An obvious disadvantage of the lunisolar method of inserting a whole extra month is the large irregularity of the length of the year from one to the next. The simplicity of a lunar calendar has always been outweighed by its inability to track the seasons, and a solar calendar is used in conjunction to remedy this defect. Identifying the lunar cycle month requires straightforward observation of the Moon on a clear night. However, identifying seasonal cycles requires much more methodical observation of stars or a device to track solar day-to-day progression, such as that established at places like [[Stonehenge]]. After centuries of empirical observations, the theoretical aspects of calendar construction could become more refined, enabling predictions that identified the need for reform.

=== Reform of lunar and lunisolar calendars ===
There have been 50 to 100 reforms of the traditional [[Chinese calendar]] over 2500 years, most of which were intended to better fit the calendar months to astronomical lunations and to more accurately add the extra month so that the regular months maintain their proper seasonal positions, even though each seasonal marker can occur anywhere within its month.
There have been at least four similar reforms of the lunisolar version of the [[Hindu calendar]], all intended to make the month a better match to the lunation and to make the year a better fit to the ''sidereal'' year. There have been reforms of the ''solar'' version of the Hindu calendar which changed the distribution of the days in each month to better match the length of time that the Sun spends in each ''sidereal'' zodiacal sign. The same applies to the [[Buddhist calendar]]. The first millennium reform of the [[Hebrew calendar]] changed it from an observational calendar into a calculated calendar. The [[Islamic calendar]] was a reform of the preceding lunisolar calendar which completely divorced it from the solar year.

Another reform was performed in [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuk Persia]] by [[Omar Khayyam]] and others, developing the precisely computed [[Jalali calendar]].

=== Julian and Gregorian reforms ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
When [[Julius Caesar]] took power in Rome, the [[Roman calendar]] had ceased to reflect the year accurately.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The [[Julian calendar|Julian reform]] lengthened seven months and replaced the intercalary month with an intercalary day to be inserted within February every four years. This produced a noticeably more accurate calendar, but it had an average year length of 365 days and 6 hours (365.25 d). This had the effect of adding about three-quarters of an hour every four years. The effect accumulated from inception in 45 BC until by the 16th century the northward equinox was falling on March 10 or 11.

[[Image:William Hogarth 028.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[William Hogarth]]’s ''[[Humours of an Election|An Election Entertainment]]'' includes a banner with the protest slogan against the Gregorian calendar: "Give us our Eleven days" (on floor at lower right)]]

Under [[Pope Gregory XIII]], the leap year rule was altered: century years which are not divisible by 400 would be common years. So 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are not leap years. This rule makes the mean year 365.2425 days {{nowrap|(365&amp;nbsp;d, 5&amp;nbsp;h, 49&amp;nbsp;min, 12&amp;nbsp;s)}} long.  While this does not synchronize the years entirely, it would require a few thousand years to accumulate a day.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', corrected printing (Oxford University Press, 2013), 692.&lt;/ref&gt;

So that the northward equinox would have the same date in the new Gregorian calendar as it had when the Council of Nicaea made recommendations in AD 325 ({{nowrap|March 21}}), ten days were dropped so that {{nowrap|October 5}} became {{nowrap|October 15}} in 1582. This reform took a few centuries to spread through the nations that used the Julian calendar, although the Russian church year still uses the Julian calendar. Those nations that adopted this calendar on or after 1700 had to drop more than ten days: Great Britain, for instance, dropped eleven.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

In 1923, [[Milutin Milanković]] proposed to a [[synod]] of some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es at [[Constantinople]] that only those centennial years (those ending in 00) that leave a remainder of 200 or 600 upon division by 900 would be leap years, decreasing the average year length to 365.242222 days. These remainders were chosen to delay the first year (after 1923) that this calendar would disagree with the Gregorian calendar as much as possible, until 2800. It was adopted by some Eastern Orthodox Churches under the names [[Revised Julian calendar]] or New calendar, but was rejected by others.

== Proposals ==
The [[Gregorian calendar]] is currently used by most of the world. There is also an international standard describing the calendar, [[ISO 8601]], with some differences to traditional conceptions in many cultures.

Since the papal reform in 1582, several proposals have been offered to make the Gregorian calendar more useful or regular. Very few reforms have gained official acceptance. The rather different [[decimal calendar|decimal]] [[French Republican Calendar]] was one such official reform, but was abolished twelve years later by [[Napoleon]]. After [[World War II]], the newly formed United Nations continued efforts of its predecessor, the [[League of Nations]], to establish the proposed [[World Calendar]] but postponed the issue after a veto from the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]], which was mainly based upon concerns of religious groups about the proposed days that would be outside the seven-day week cycle ("blank days") and thus disrupt having a sabbath every seven days.  Independently the [[World Council of Churches]] still tries to find a common rule for the date of Easter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/towards-a-common-date-for-easter/towards-a-common-date-for-easter.html|title=Towards a Common Date for Easter|author=World Council of Churches|date=1997-03-10|website=www.oikoumene.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which might be eased by a new common calendar.

Reformers cite several problems with the Gregorian calendar:
* It is not [[Perennial Calendar|perennial]]. Each year starts on a different day of the week and calendars expire every year.
* It is difficult to determine the weekday of any given day of the year or month.
* Months are not equal in length, nor regularly distributed across the year, and so some people rely on [[mnemonic]]s (e.g., "[[Thirty days hath September]]" or [[Knuckle_mnemonic|knuckle counting]]) to remember the lengths of months.
* The year's four quarters (of three full months each) are not equal (being of 90/91, 91, 92 and 92 days respectively). [[Business quarter]]s that are equal would make accounting easier.
* Its epoch, i.e. start of the year count, is religious. The same applies to month and [[weekday]] names in many languages.
* Each month has no connection with the [[lunar phase]]s.
* Solstices and equinoxes do not coincide with either the beginning of the Gregorian months or the midpoint of the months.
* The calendar does not have a [[Year Zero|year zero]], the year after [[1 BC]] was [[1 AD]], with nothing in between them. 

It is hard or even impossible to solve all these issues in just one calendar.

Most plans evolve around the solar year of a little more than 365 days. This number does not divide well by seven or twelve, which are the traditional numbers of days per week and months per year respectively. The nearby numbers 360, 364 and 366 are divisible in better ways. There are also lunar-centric proposals.

=== Perennial calendars ===

{{see also|Perennial calendar}}
Many calendar reforms have offered solutions to make the Gregorian calendar perennial. These reforms would make it easy to work out the day of the week of a particular [[calendar date|date]], and would make changing calendars each year unnecessary. There are, roughly speaking, two options to achieve this goal: [[leap week calendar]]s and [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary days]]. Leap week calendars add a leap week of seven days to the calendar every five or six years to keep the calendar roughly in step with the tropical year. They have years of either 364 days (52 weeks) or 371 days (53 weeks), thus preserving the 7-day week.

Proposals mainly differ in their selection of a leap rule, placing of the leap item (usually middle or end of the year), in the start day of the week and year, in the number (12 or 13) and size of months and in connected naming; some are compatible to the [[week date]] of ISO 8601.

The [[World Calendar]], favored by the UN in the 1950s, and the [[International Fixed Calendar]], quite popular among economists between the World Wars, are proposals that start each year on a Sunday. The 364 days within the week system form 52 weeks of 7 days. The World Calendar has every quarter beginning on the same day of the week. In the World Calendar, the 365th and 366th day are considered holidays and named Worlds Day and Leap Year Day. These "off-calendar" days stand outside the seven-day week and caused some religious groups to strongly oppose adoption of the World Calendar. Such concerns helped prevent the World Calendar from being adopted. Supporters of the World Calendar, however, argue that the religious groups' opposition overlooked every individual's right to celebrate these holidays as extra days of worship, or [[Sabbath]]s. This option, they reason, maintained the seven-day worship cycle for those who share that concern, while allowing benefits of a perennial calendar to be shared by all.

Some calendar reform ideas, such as the [[Pax Calendar]], [[Symmetry454]] calendar and the [[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]], were created to solve this problem by having years of either 364 days (52 weeks) or 371 days (53 weeks), thus preserving the 7-day week. The 53-week calendar, used in government and in business for [[fiscal year]]s, is a variant of this concept. Each year of this calendar can be up to 371 days long.

Some calendars have quarters of regularly patterned uneven months e.g., a 35-day (five-week) month and a pair of 28-day (four-week) months, with a leap week appended to the final month when needed. The Common Civil Calendar and Time calendar has months of 30 and 31 days, but inserts a leap week in the middle of the year, when needed, whereas its successor, the Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar, moves the extra week to the end of the year.

In the [[Isaac Asimov#Other writings|World Season Calendar]], months are discarded altogether; instead, the year is divided into four seasons of 13 weeks each.  An extra day (two days during leap year) is added to the calendar that is not assigned a day of the week in order to perennialize the calendar. The same calendar of 91 days is used for each season of every year.

Still other proposals, like the 30x11 Calendar, abandon attempts to make the calendar perennial, instead opting for eleven 30-day months and one long month at the end of 35 (or 36) days.

=== Systematic 12-month calendars ===
{{OR|date=June 2018}}

The lengths of the months inherited from the old [[Roman calendar]] as reformed by Julius Caesar do not follow any apparent logic systematically. Many reform proposals seek to make the pattern more uniform. 
When keeping the traditional dozen of months and the close approximation of a solar year, this usually yields four equal quarters of three months each where one month is longer than the other two. The most common approaches are 30∶30∶31, 30∶31∶30 and 31∶30∶30 days per month, but 4∶4∶5, 4∶5∶4 and 5∶4∶4 weeks per months have also been proposed or used. They all result in 364 systematically distributed days and hence have to add either one extra and one leap day or a leap week. 
Some calendar designs do not use the same pattern for all quarters but, for instance, flip it in the middle of the year. This is more common with 31∶30 and 30∶31 patterns, which lead to 366 days of which one needs to be dropped in common years, since that is basically what the Julian and Gregorian calendars do except that July also has 31 days and February never has 30.

Incidentally, the close correspondence to existing conventions is often considered an advantage, but even patterns that deviate more may have strong benefits. For instance, all quarterly patterns with 30 and 31 days per month result in a week distribution of 4∶5∶4 if a week is counted for the month most of its days belong to and the first day of the first month is also the first day of a week.

A change in month lengths will frequently also result in months starting at a different ordinal day of the year, especially since all regular designs lengthen February. For a non-leap year, all designs with 91-day quarters realign in October with the Julian pattern and some as early as June, while all designs that are alternating odd and even months completely mismatch after January even if the last day of February remained the leap day.

=== 13-month calendars ===
&lt;!-- perennialization and 13 months are not mutually exclusive --&gt;

Some calendar reformers seek to equalize the length of each month in the year. This is often accomplished by creating a calendar that has 13 months of 4 weeks (28 days) each, making 364 days. The earliest known proposal of this type was the Georgian Calendar (1745)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Georgian Calendar|url=http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/hirossa.html|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Hugh Jones (reverend)|Rev. Hugh Jones]].

The [[Positivist calendar]] (1849), created by [[Auguste Comte]], was based on a 364-day year which included one or two “blank” days. Each of the 13 months had 28 days and exactly four weeks, and each started on a Monday. The [[International Fixed Calendar]] is a more modern descendant of this calendar.

Some proposals&lt;!--, such as the [[Sol Calendar]],--&gt; add one or two days to the calendar each year to account for the annual solar cycle, while others keep these days off the calendar entirely, to make the calendar perennial.

Around 1930 Colligan invented the [[Pax Calendar]], which avoids off-calendar days by adding a 7-day [[leap week calendar|leap week]] to the 364-day common year for 71 out of 400 years. &lt;!-- The New Earth Calendar does likewise with a different leap rule. --&gt;

In 1993, Lloydine and [[José Argüelles]] founded the World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lightparty.com/Spirituality/World13MoonCalendar.html|title=The World 13 Moon Calendar Peace Movement
|author=The Light Party|date=|website=lightparty.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{importance inline}}

Dividing the years into 52 weeks creates 13 months of 28 days (4 weeks), and 4 quarters of 91 days (13 weeks). This creates months and quarters of fixed, even duration, but not quarters containing a whole number of months.

Instead of a leap week or an extra day and a leap day, such a calendar design could add a 14th ''leap month'' of 4 weeks about every 22 years.
While the Gregorian leap cycle of 400 years contains a whole number of 7-day weeks, this number is not divisible by 4, so this cycle would not be a good fit for a leap month calendar.

===19-month calendar===
The [[Bahá'í calendar]], established by the founders of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], does not seek to reform the Gregorian calendar, but establishes a purely solar calendar. As of 2015, the year always starts in spring on the sunset to sunset day of the vernal equinox (calculated in advance). This calendar has 19 months of 19 days, with an extra 4 or 5 intercalary days added so that the year ends on the day before the next vernal equinox.

=== Lunisolar calendars ===
{{See also|Lunisolar calendar}}

Lunisolar calendars usually have 12 or 13 months of 29 or 30 days.
&lt;!--
The [[Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar]] is a lunisolar calendar proposal which has 12 or 13 lunar months of 29 or 30 days a year, and begins each year near the [[vernal equinox]].
--&gt;&lt;!--
[[The Simple Lunisolar Calendar]] uses 12 or 13 lunar months of 30 or 29 days with fixed lengths, and begins each year between Gregorian December 3 and January 1.
--&gt;&lt;!--
The [[Meyer-Palmen Solilunar Calendar]] has 12 lunar months with 29 or 30 days plus a leap month called [[Meton]] every 3 or 2 years with 30 or 31 days. 60 years together are called a cycle. It uses a leap cycle which has equal number of days, weeks, months, years and cycles. 2498258 days, 356894 weeks, 84599 months, 6840 years and 114 cycles nearly all equal each other. It is called an era, although time isn't divided into it in this calendar.
--&gt;
Some propose to improve leap rules of existing calendars, such as the [[Hebrew calendar]]. The [[Rectified Hebrew calendar]] uses a more accurate leap cycle of 4366 months per 353-year cycle, with 130 leap years per cycle, and a progressively shorter ''[[molad]]'' interval, intended to replace the 19-year leap cycle and the constant ''molad'' interval of the traditional fixed arithmetic Hebrew calendar, respectively.

=== Naming ===
Calendar proposals that introduce a thirteenth month or change the Julian-Gregorian system of months often also propose new names for these months. New names have also been proposed for days out of the week cycle (e.g., 365th and leap) and weeks out of the month cycle.

Proposals to change the traditional month and weekday names are less frequent. The Gregorian calendar obtains its names mostly from gods of historical religions (e.g., Thursday from Nordic [[Thor]] or March from Roman [[Mars (god)|Mars]]) or leaders of vanished empires (July and August from the first Cæsars), or ordinals that got out of synchronization (September through December, originally seventh through tenth, now ninth through twelfth).

Calendar reformers, therefore, seek to correct what they see as deficiencies by focusing on more homogeneous sets of individuals, who usually share common traits.

==== Examples ====
Comte’s Positivist calendar, for example, proposed naming the 13 months in his calendar after figures from religion, literature, philosophy and science. Similarly, the [[Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar]] uses 12 or 13 lunar months named after 13 contributors to research on psychoactive plants and chemicals. The [[Simple Lunisolar Calendar]] names its months after the letters of the [[Greek alphabet]].

Some, such as Karl Palmen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/palmen/playcard.htm|title=Playing Card Calendar|author=Karl Palmen|date=2001-01-15|website=www.hermetic.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested reusing an existing 13 × 4 naming system, the one found in [[playing cards]]. Thus either months are numbered Ace, Two through Ten, Jack, Queen and King with four weeks each, named after the four [[suit (cards)|suit]]s (♠♣♥♦); or the roles are reversed if the calendar has four quarters with thirteen weeks each. Leap days or weeks are assigned the Joker. This system has internationalisation problems, though, because even where the 52-card deck is known, the order of suits may vary.

The contemporary [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] has 26 letters, which could be used, together with a further binary indicator, as keys for 52 weeks.

== Specific proposals ==
{{main|List of calendars}}
There have been many specific calendar proposals to replace the Gregorian calendar:

The following count one or more days outside the standard seven-day week:
* [[Positivist calendar]]
* [[World Calendar|The World Calendar]]
* [[International Fixed Calendar]]
* [[Invariable Calendar]]
* [[World Season Calendar]]
* [[Tranquility Calendar]]

The following are leap week calendars:
* [[Pax Calendar]]
* [[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]]
* [[Symmetry454]]

The following track the moon as well as the sun:
* Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar
* Rectified Hebrew calendar

There have also been proposals to revise the way years are numbered:
* [[Anno Lucis]]
* [[Holocene calendar]]
* [[Japanese era name|Jomon Era]]

Reform of the Islamic calendar:

Since the beginning of the 21st century, there is a trend within the Muslim communities of North America and Europe to substitute a lunar calendar based on calculations for the traditional Islamic method of monthly observation of the new moon to declare the beginning of the new month in each country separately. The details are in the following study:

[[File:James Clerk Maxwell.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Clerk Maxwell]] played a major role in developing the concept of a coherent [[CGS system]] and in extending the [[metric system]] to include electrical units.]]

A '''coherent system of units''' is a system of units based on a system of quantities in such a way that the equations between the numerical values expressed in the units of the system have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations between the quantities.&lt;ref name=definition/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0026-1394/30/5/010/pdf |author=Thor, A. J. |year=1994 |title=New International Standards for Quantities and Units |journal=Metrologia |volume=30 |number=5|page=517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalently, it is a system in which every quantity has a unique unit, or one that does not use [[conversion factor]]s.

A '''coherent derived unit''' is a [[Derived unit (measurement)|derived unit]] that, for a given system of quantities and for a chosen set of [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]]s, is a product of powers of base units with the proportionality factor being one.&lt;ref name=definition/&gt;

If a system of units has both equations and base units, with only one base unit for each base quantity, then it is coherent if and only if every derived unit of the system is coherent.

The concept of coherence was developed in the mid-nineteenth century by, amongst others, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and promoted by the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]].  The concept was initially applied to the [[centimetre–gram–second]] (CGS) in 1873 and the [[foot–pound–second system]]s (FPS) of units in 1875.  The [[International System of Units]] (1960) was designed around the principle of coherence.

==Basic concepts==
In SI, which is a coherent system, the unit of power is the [[watt]], which is defined as one joule per second.&lt;ref&gt;SI Brochure, Table 4, pg 118&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[US customary system]] of measurement, which is non-coherent, the unit of power is the [[horsepower]], which is defined as 550 foot-pounds per second (the pound in this context being the [[pound-force]]); similarly the gallon is not equal to a cubic yard (nor is it the cube of any length unit of the system).

==Before the metric system==
The earliest units of measure devised by humanity bore no relationship to each other.  As both humanity's understanding of [[Philosophy|philosophical concepts]] and the organisation of [[society]] developed, so units of measurement were standardised – first particular units of measure had the same value across a [[community]] then different units of the same [[quantity]] (for example feet and inches) were given a fixed relationship. Apart from [[Ancient China]] where the units of capacity and of mass are linked to [[millet|red millet seed]], there is little evidence of the linking of different quantities until the [[Age of Reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Relating quantities of the same kind===
&lt;!--Discussion of development of relationship between quantities of the same kind, for eample, feet and inches are quantities of the same kind, feet and acres are not.--&gt;
The history of the measurement of length dates back to the early civilisations of the [[Middle East]] (10000&amp;nbsp;BC &amp;ndash; 8000&amp;nbsp;BC). Archeologists have been able to reconstruct the units of measure in use in [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|Mesopotamia]], [[History of measurement systems in India|India]], [[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement|the Jewish culture]] and many others. Archaeological and other evidence shows that in many civilisations, the ratios between different units for the same quantity of measure were adjusted so that they were integer numbers.  In many early cultures such as [[Ancient Egyptian units of measurement|Ancient Egypt]], multiples of 2, 3 and 5 were not always used&amp;mdash;the Egyptian royal cubit being 28 fingers of 7 [[Hand (unit)|hands]].&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite book

===Relating quantities of different kinds===
Non-[[Unit_commensurability#Commensurability|commensurable]] quantities have different [[Dimensional analysis|physical dimension]]s which means that adding or subtracting them is not meaningful. For instance, adding the [[mass]] of an object to its [[volume]] has no physical meaning. However, new quantities (and, as such, units) can be [[Derived units|derived]] via multiplication and [[exponentiation]] of other units. As an example, the [[SI unit]] for force is the [[Newton (unit)|newton]], which is defined as kg⋅m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Since a coherent derived unit is one which is defined by means of multiplication and exponentiation of other units but not multiplied by any scaling factor other than 1, the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] is a coherent unit of [[pressure]] (defined as kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;), but the [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (defined as {{val|100000|u=kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is not. 

Note that coherence of a given unit depends on the definition of the base units. Should the meter's definition change such that it is shorter by a factor of {{val|100000}}, then the bar would be a coherent derived unit. However, a coherent unit remains coherent (and a non-coherent unit remains non-coherent) if the base units are redefined in terms of other units with the numerical factor always being unity.

==Metric system==

===Rational system and use of water===
The concept of coherence was only introduced into the metric system in the third quarter of the nineteenth century; in its original form the metric system was non-coherent – in particular the [[litre]] was 0.001&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the [[Hectare#Are|are]] (from which we get the [[hectare]]) was 100&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A precursor to the concept of coherence was however present in that the units of mass and length were related to each other through the physical properties of water, the gram having been designed as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its freezing point.&lt;ref name=France1795&gt;{{cite web

The [[CGS system]] had two units of energy, the [[erg]] that was related to [[mechanics]] and the [[calorie]] that was related to [[thermal energy]], so only one of them (the erg, equivalent to the g⋅cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) could bear a coherent relationship to the base units. By contrast, coherence was a design aim of the SI, resulting in only one unit of energy being defined – the [[joule]].&lt;ref&gt;SI brochure, §1.2 Two classes of SI Units, p92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimension-related coherence===

Each variant of the metric system has a degree of coherence&amp;nbsp;– the various derived units being directly related to the base units without the need of intermediate conversion factors.&lt;ref name=definition&gt;{{citation

:''{{overset|force|F}}'' = ''{{overset|mass|m}}'' × ''{{overset|acceleration|a}}''

[[Isaac Asimov]] wrote, "In the cgs system, a unit force is described as one that will produce an acceleration of 1 cm/sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  on a mass of 1 gm. A unit force is therefore 1 cm/sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  multiplied by 1 gm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are independent statements. The first is a definition; the second is not. The first implies that the constant of proportionality in the force law has a magnitude of one; the second implies that it is dimensionless. Asimov uses them both together to prove that it is the pure number one.

Asimov's conclusion is not the only possible one. In a system that uses the units foot (ft) for length, second (s) for time, pound (lb) for mass, and pound-force (lbf) for force, the law relating force (''F''), mass (''m''), and acceleration (''a'') is {{nowrap|1=''F'' = 0.031081 ''ma''}}. Since the proportionality constant here is dimensionless and the units in any equation must balance without any numerical factor other than one, it follows that 1 lbf = 1 lb⋅ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This conclusion appears paradoxical from the point of view of competing systems, according to which {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''ma''}} and {{nowrap|1=1 lbf = 32.174 lb⋅ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Although the pound-force is a coherent derived unit in this system according to the official definition, the system itself is not considered to be coherent because of the presence of the proportionality constant in the force law.

A variant of this system applies the unit s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ft to the proportionality constant. This has the effect of identifying the pound-force with the pound. The pound is then both a base unit of mass and a coherent derived unit of force. One may apply any unit one pleases to the proportionality constant. If one applies the unit s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/lb to it, then the foot becomes a unit of force. In a four-unit system ([[English engineering units]]), the pound and the pound-force are distinct base units, and the proportionality constant has the unit lbf⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(lb⋅ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

All these systems are coherent. One that is not is a three-unit system (also called English engineering units) in which ''F'' = ''ma'' that uses the pound and the pound-force, one of which is a base unit and the other, a noncoherent derived unit. In place of an explicit proportionality constant, this system uses conversion factors derived from the relation 1 lbf = 32.174 lb⋅ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In numerical calculations, it is indistinguishable from the four-unit system, since what is a proportionality constant in the latter is a conversion factor in the former. The relation among the numerical values of the quantities in the force law is {''F''} = 0.031081 {''m''} {''a''}, where the braces denote the numerical values of the enclosed quantities. Unlike in this system, in a coherent system, the relations among the numerical values of quantities are the same as the relations among the quantities themselves.

The following example concerns definitions of quantities and units. The (average) velocity (''v'') of an object is defined as the quantitative physical property of the object that is directly proportional to the distance (''d'') traveled by the object and inversely proportional to the time (''t'') of travel, i.e., ''v'' = ''kd''/''t'', where ''k'' is a constant that depends on the units used. Suppose that the meter (m) and the second (s) are base units; then the kilometer (km) and the hour (h) are noncoherent derived units. The meter per second (mps) is defined as the velocity of an object that travels one meter in one second, and the kilometer per hour (kmph) is defined as the velocity of an object that travels one kilometer in one hour. Substituting from the definitions of the units into the defining equation of velocity we obtain, 1 mps = ''k'' m/s and 1 kmph = ''k'' km/h = 1/3.6 ''k'' m/s = 1/3.6 mps. Now choose ''k'' = 1; then the meter per second is a coherent derived unit, and the kilometer per hour is a noncoherent derived unit. Suppose that we choose to use the kilometer per hour as the unit of velocity in the system. Then the system becomes noncoherent, and the numerical value equation for velocity becomes {''v''} = 3.6 {''d''}/{''t''}. Coherence may be restored, without changing the units, by choosing ''k'' = 3.6; then the kilometer per hour is a coherent derived unit, with 1 kmph = 1 m/s, and the meter per second is a noncoherent derived unit, with 1 mps = 3.6 m/s.

A definition of a physical quantity is a statement that determines the ratio of any two instances of the quantity. The specification of the value of any constant factor is not a part of the definition since it does not affect the ratio. The definition of velocity above satisfies this requirement since it implies that ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); thus if the ratios of distances and times are determined, then so is the ratio of velocities. A definition of a unit of a physical quantity is a statement that determines the ratio of any instance of the quantity to the unit. This ratio is the numerical value of the quantity or the number of units contained in the quantity. The definition of the meter per second above satisfies this requirement since it, together with the definition of velocity, implies that ''v''/mps = (''d''/m)/(''t''/s); thus if the ratios of distance and time to their units are determined, then so is the ratio of velocity to its unit. The definition, by itself, is inadequate since it only determines the ratio in one specific case; it may be thought of as exhibiting a specimen of the unit.

A new coherent unit cannot be defined merely by expressing it algebraically in terms of already defined units. Thus the statement, "the meter per second equals one meter divided by one second", is not, by itself, a definition. It does not imply that a unit of velocity is being defined, and if that fact is added, it does not determine the magnitude of the unit, since that depends on the system of units. In order for it to become a proper definition both the quantity and the defining equation, including the value of any constant factor, must be specified. After a unit has been defined in this manner, however, it has a magnitude that is independent of any system of units.

Collective security is more ambitious than systems of [[military alliance|alliance security]] or collective defense in that it seeks to encompass the totality of states within a region or indeed globally, and to address a wide range of possible threats. While collective security is an idea with a long history, its implementation in practice has proved problematic. Several prerequisites have to be met for it to have a chance of working. It is the theory or practice of states pledging to defend one another in order to deter aggression or to exterminate transgressor if international order has been breached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979008143|title=Global politics|last=Macmillan.|first=Palgrave|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137349262|oclc=979008143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early mentions===

Collective security is one of the most promising approaches for peace and a valuable device for [[Power (social and political)|power]] management on an [[international]] scale. [[Cardinal Richelieu]] proposed a scheme for collective security in 1629, which was partially reflected in the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. In the eighteenth century many proposals were made for collective security arrangements, especially in Europe.

The concept of a peaceful community of nations was outlined in 1795 in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=Mount Holyoke College| title=Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Western Thought:from Ancient Greece to the Twentieth Century|last1=Skirbekk|first1=Gunnar|authorlink1=Gunnar Skirbekk|last2=Gilje|first2=Nils|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|edition=illustrated|isbn=978-0-415-22073-6|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoLAHXt4PRMC|accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he argues for the establishment of a peaceful world community not in a sense that there be a [[global government]] but in the hope that each state would declare itself as a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings. His key argument is that a union of free states would promote peaceful society worldwide: therefore, in his view, there can be a perpetual peace shaped by the international community rather than by a world government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.constitution.org/kant/perpeace.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the [[Concert of Europe]] that developed after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the ''status quo'' between European states and so avoid war.{{sfn|Reichard|2006|p=9}}{{sfn|Rapoport|1995|pp=498–500}}  This period also saw the development of international law with the first [[Geneva Conventions]] establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.{{sfn|Bouchet-Saulnier|Brav|Olivier|2007|pp=14–134}}{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=10}}

The forerunner of the League of Nations, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU), was formed by peace activists [[William Randal Cremer]] and [[Frédéric Passy]] in 1889. The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of [[parliament]], in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. The IPU's structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Before the League of Nations|publisher=The United Nations Office at Geneva|url=http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/B5B92952225993B0C1256F2D00393560?OpenDocument|accessdate =2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the twentieth century two power blocs emerged through alliances between the European [[Great Powers]]. It was these alliances that came into effect at the [[Origins of World War I|start of the First World War]] in 1914, drawing all the major European powers into the war. This was the first major war in Europe between [[industrialized]] countries and the first time in Western Europe the results of [[industrialization]] (for example [[mass production]]) had been dedicated to war. The result of this [[industrial warfare]] was an unprecedented casualty level with eight and a half million members of [[armed services]] dead, an estimated 21 million wounded, and approximately 10 million civilian deaths.{{sfn|Bell|2007|pp=15–17}}{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=1–2}}

By the time the fighting ended in November 1918, the war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of [[Europe]] and inflicting psychological and physical damage on the continent.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=16}} Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as "[[The war to end war|the war to end all wars]]",{{sfn|Archer|2001|p=14}}{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=1}} and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included [[arms race]]s, alliances, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. The perceived remedies to these were seen as the creation of an international organization whose aim was to prevent future war through [[disarmament]], open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage wars, and penalties that made war unattractive to nations.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=8}}

==Theory==
Collective security can be understood as a security arrangement in which all states cooperate collectively to provide security for all by the actions of all against any states within the groups which might challenge the existing order by using force. This contrasts with self-help strategies of engaging in war for purely immediate national interest. While collective security is possible, several prerequisites have to be met for it to work.

Collective Security also contrasts with [[Alliance|alliances]] in term of different forms. In Ph.D dissertation of Andreatta, collective security is based on the perspective of all together in a group against any one rather than on [[Unilateralism|unilateral]] idea of some against specific others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreatta|first=Filippo|date=Summer 1996|title=Collective security: Theory and practice of an institution for peace in the XX century.|url=|journal=Collective Security|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alliance has the form of two groups against each other as like states A+B+C against states Y+Z; however, collective security system takes form of conducting one agreement between A+B+C+Y+Z against any one of them. Moreover, it is also different from alliance since collective security is built to focus on internal regulation required universal membership while alliance is built to deter or reduce an outside threat as an exclusive institution. For alliance, states would see their allies as [[Absolute gain (international relations)|absolute gain]] and their enemies as [[Relative gain (international relations)|relative gains]] without [[legal obligation]]. In contrast, collective security follows the case of neutrality as the whole group would be required to punish the aggressor with the hope for it not to violate general norms, in which are beyond the states' control rather than by their self-interests. Opposite with short term interest of allies fighting for a common threat, collective security tends to use universal interests for [[global peace]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Sovereign nations eager to maintain the status quo, willingly cooperate, accepting a degree of vulnerability and in some cases of minor nations, also accede to the interests of the chief contributing nations organising the collective security. Collective Security is achieved by setting up an international cooperative organisation, under the auspices of international law and this gives rise to a form of international collective governance, albeit limited in scope and effectiveness. The collective security organisation then becomes an arena for diplomacy, balance of power and exercise of soft power. The use of hard power by states, unless legitimised by the Collective Security organisation, is considered illegitimate, reprehensible and needing remediation of some kind. The collective security organisation not only gives cheaper security, but also may be the only practicable means of security for smaller nations against more powerful threatening neighbours without the need of joining the camp of the nations balancing their neighbours.

The concept of "collective security" forwarded by men such as [[Michael Joseph Savage]], [[Martin Wight]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]], are deemed to apply interests in security in a broad manner, to "avoid grouping powers into opposing camps, and refusing to draw dividing lines that would leave anyone out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NATO Transformed: The Alliance's New Roles in International Security|last=Yost|first=David S.|publisher=Leicester University Press|year=1977|location=London|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "collective security" has also been cited as a principle of the [[United Nations]], and the [[League of Nations]] before that. By employing a system of collective security, the UN hopes to dissuade any member state from acting in a manner likely to threaten peace, thereby avoiding any conflict.

Collective security selectively incorporates the concept of both [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] and [[global government]]. However, the term "Collective Security" is not the same as Balance of power, mentioned in [[Realism (international relations)|Realism theory]]. According to Adreatta, balance of power focuses on state's unilateral interests stoping aggression. Since states look at the world as having security dilemma due to the fear of relative gain, state does not want any state to become predominant causing a mutually restraining equilibrium. In other word, Balance of power between states opts for decentralization of power. States are separate actors who do not subordinate their [[autonomy]] or sovereignty to a central. "Singly or in combinations reflecting the coincidence of interests, States seek to influence the pattern of power distribution and to determine their own places within that pattern."&lt;ref&gt;I.L. Claude, Jr., "The Management of Power in the Changing United Nations", ''International Organization'', Vol. 15 (Spring 1961), pp. 219–221&lt;/ref&gt; The expectation of order and peace comes from the belief that competing powers will somehow balance and thereby cancel each other out to produce “deterrence through equilibration.”&lt;ref name="Claude_222"&gt;Claude, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, under collective security, states share the long term goal of global peace, reversing relationship between individual and community goals mentioned in Balance of Power theories. Balance of power fails to maintain stability led to break down of war as in the case of Napoleonic Wars and World Wars when states unilaterally decided to be unwilling or unable to fight. 

At the same time, the concept of global government is about centralization. Global government is a centralized institutional system that possesses the power use of force like a well established sovereign nation state. This concept strips states of their "standing as centers of power and policy, where issues of war and peace are concerned,"&lt;ref name="Claude_222" /&gt; and superimposing on them "an institution possessed of the authority and capability to maintain, by unchallengeable force so far as may be necessary, the order and stability of a global community."&lt;ref name="Claude_222" /&gt; Despite some different characteristics of balance of power theory, collective Collective security selectively incorporates both of the concepts, centralization and decentralization, which can broil down to a phrase: "order without government."&lt;ref&gt;I. L. Claude, Jr. "An Autopsy of Collective Security", ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 90 (Winter 1975–76), p. 715&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, collective security seems to be more reliable alternative since it gathers power as a team to punish the aggressor, and it is an attempt to improve international relations and to provide solid rules under [[Anarchy|anarchy.]] 

===Basic assumptions===
Organski (1960) lists five basic assumptions underlying the theory of collective security:&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Ghosh (1960), pg 89. Paraphrased.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In an armed conflict, member nation-states will be able to agree on which nation is the aggressor.
* All member nation-states are equally committed to contain and constrain the aggression, irrespective of its source or origin.
* All member nation-states have identical freedom of action and ability to join in proceedings against the aggressor.
* The cumulative power of the cooperating members of the alliance for collective security will be adequate and sufficient to overpower the might of the aggressor.
* In the light of the threat posed by the collective might of the nations of a collective security coalition, the aggressor nation will modify its policies, or if unwilling to do so, will be defeated.

===Prerequisites===
Morgenthau (1948) states that three prerequisites must be met for collective security to successfully prevent war:

* The collective security system must be able to assemble military force in strength greatly in excess to that assembled by the aggressor(s) thereby deterring the aggressor(s) from attempting to change the world order defended by the collective security system.
* Those nations, whose combined strength would be used for deterrence as mentioned in the first prerequisite, should have identical beliefs about the security of the world order that the collective is defending.
* Nations must be willing to subordinate their conflicting interests to the common good defined in terms of the common defense of all member-states.

===In the League of Nations===
After World War I, the first large scale attempt to provide collective security in modern times was the establishment of the [[League of Nations]] in 1919–20. The provisions of the League of Nations Covenant represented a weak system for decision-making and for collective action. According to Palmer and Perking, they pointed failure of United States in joining League of Nations and the rise of USSR outside the League as one of major reasons why it was failed under enforcement of collective security&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebegbulem|first=Joseph C|date=2011|title=The Failure of Collective Security in the Post World Wars I and II International System|url=https://www2.hu-berlin.de/transcience/Vol2_Issue2_2011_23_29.pdf|journal=Journal of Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|volume=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, an example of the failure of the League of Nations' collective security is the [[Manchurian Crisis]], when [[Japan]] occupied part of [[China]] (which was a League member). After the invasion, members of the League passed a resolution calling for Japan to withdraw or face severe penalties. Given that every nation on the League of Nations council had veto power, Japan promptly vetoed the resolution, severely limiting the LN's ability to respond. After one year of deliberation, the League passed a resolution condemning the invasion without committing the League's members to any action against it. The Japanese replied by quitting the League.

[[Abyssinia Crisis|A similar process]] occurred in 1935, when [[Italy]] invaded [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] (now [[Ethiopia]]). Sanctions were passed, but Italy would have vetoed any stronger resolution. Additionally, Britain and France sought to court Italy's government as a potential deterrent to Hitler, given that Mussolini was not yet in what would become the Axis alliance of [[World War II]]. Thus, neither enforced any serious sanctions against the Italian government. Additionally, in this case and with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the absence of the United States from the League of Nations deprived it of another major power that could have used economic leverage against either of the aggressor states. Inaction by the League subjected it to criticisms that it was weak and concerned more with European issues (most leading members were European), and it did not deter Hitler from his plans to dominate Europe. Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] continued to support collective security, as he assessed that impotence lay not in the principle but in its covenantors' commitment to honor its tenets.

One active and articulate exponent of collective security during the immediate pre-war years was the Soviet foreign minister, [[Maxim Litvinov]]. However, there are grounds for doubt about the depth of Soviet commitment to the principle as well as that of Western powers. After the [[Munich Agreement]] in September 1938 and the passivity of outside powers in the face of German occupation of the remainder of [[Czechoslovakia]] in March 1939, it was shown that the Western powers were not prepared to engage in collective security against aggression by the Axis powers together with the Soviet Union, Soviet foreign policy was revised and Litvinov was replaced as foreign minister in early May 1939 to facilitate the negotiations that led to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with Germany, signed by Litvinov's successor, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], on August 23 of that year. The war in Europe broke out a week later, with the [[invasion of Poland]], starting on September 1, 1939. Thus, this could be seen that collective security does not always work due to the lack of commitment and unwillingness of states or International Community to act in concert (Mingst 1999).

=== Under United Nations and recent events ===
The 1945 [[United Nations Charter]], although containing stronger provisions for decision-making and collective military action than those of the League of Nations Covenant, does not represent a complete system of collective security, but rather a balance between collective action on the one hand and continued operation of the states system (including the continued special roles of great powers) on the other. States in UN collective security system are selective to support or oppose UN action in certain conflicts based on their self-interests. United Nations can be somehow seen as the platform for self-interest purposes for members in Security Council due to their Veto power and excessive assistance or aid. This has made those states to act unilaterally ignoring the approval, or flout orders of Security Council not to act unilaterally. The [[Iraq crisis]] is a clearer example as “Rather than seek the global interest of peace and security through stability in Iraq and the Middle East region, the domination oriented members amassed their vast economic, diplomatic and military resources, captured and brazenly subjugated Iraq to an unprecedented condominial regime serving their economic interest under Iraq Reconstruction Programme.” (Eke, 2007)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, lack of geographical spread of members in Security Council causes unbalancing on the role of maintenance global peace and security. The voices of small countries can be only heard, but not all policies were adopted in response to them unless they serves the great powers' interests.  

However, this does not mean collective security in the UN is completely fail. The role of the UN and collective security in general is evolving, given the rise of [[Civil war|internal state conflict]]s. Since the end of World War II, there have been 111 military conflicts worldwide, but only 9 of these have involved two or more states going to war with one another. The remainder have either been internal civil wars or civil wars where other [[nation]]s intervened in some manner. This means that collective security may have to evolve towards providing a means to ensure stability and a fair international resolution to those internal conflicts. Whether this will involve more powerful peacekeeping forces, or a larger role for the UN diplomatically, will likely be judged on a case-by-case basis. 

==Collective defense==
Collective defense is an arrangement, usually formalized by a treaty and an organization, among participant states that commit support in defense of a member state if it is attacked by another state outside the organization. [[NATO]] is the best known collective defense organization; its famous Article 5 calls on (but does not fully commit) member states to assist another member under attack. This article was invoked after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]] on the [[United States]], after which other NATO members provided assistance to the US [[War on Terror]] in [[Afghanistan]].

Collective defense has its roots in multiparty [[Political alliance|alliances]] and entails benefits as well as risks. On the one hand, by combining and pooling resources, it can reduce any single state's cost of providing fully for its security. Smaller members of NATO, for example, have leeway to invest a greater proportion of their budget on non-military priorities, such as education or health, since they can count on other members to come to their defense, if needed.

On the other hand, collective defense also involves risky commitments. Member states can become embroiled in costly wars benefiting neither the direct victim nor the aggressor. In [[World War I]], countries in the collective defense arrangement known as the [[Triple Entente]] ([[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]]) were pulled into war quickly when Russia started full mobilization against [[Austria-Hungary]], whose ally [[German Empire|Germany]] subsequently declared war on Russia.

{{merge from|Complementary monopoly|discuss=Talk:Complementary monopoly#Merge to Cournot competition|date=January 2018}}
'''Cournot competition''' is an [[economic]] model used to describe an industry structure in which companies compete on the amount of output they will produce, which they decide on independently of each other and at the same time. It is named after [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] (1801–1877) who was inspired by observing competition in a spring water [[duopoly]].&lt;ref name="varian"&gt;{{cite book | last=Varian | first=Hal R. | authorlink=Hal Varian | year=2006 | title=Intermediate microeconomics: a modern approach | edition=7th | publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] | isbn=0-393-92702-4 | page=490 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4XvRngEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the following features:
* There is more than one firm and all firms produce a [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] [[Product (business)|product]], i.e. there is no [[product differentiation]];
* Firms do not cooperate, i.e. there is no [[collusion]];
* Firms have [[market power]], i.e. each firm's output decision affects the good's price;
* The number of firms is fixed;
* Firms compete in quantities, and choose quantities simultaneously;
* The firms are economically rational and [[game theory|act strategically]], usually seeking to maximize profit given their competitors' decisions.

An essential assumption of this model is the "not conjecture" that each firm aims to maximize profits, based on the expectation that its own output decision will not have an effect on the decisions of its rivals.
Price is a commonly known decreasing function of total output. All firms know &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the total number of firms in the market, and take the output of the others as given. Each firm has a [[Cost curve|cost function]] &lt;math&gt;c_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt;. Normally the cost functions are treated as common knowledge. The cost functions may be the same or different among firms. The market price is set at a level such that [[Supply and demand|demand]] equals the total quantity produced by all firms.
Each firm takes the quantity set by its competitors as a given, evaluates its residual demand, and then behaves as a [[monopoly]].

==History==
{{Rquote|right|The state of equilibrium... is therefore ''stable''; i.e. if either of the producers, misled as to his true interest, leaves it temporarily, he will be brought back to it.|Antoine Augustin Cournot|''Recherches sur les Principes Mathematiques de la Theorie des Richesses'' (1838), translated by Bacon (1897).}}

[[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] (1801-1877) first outlined his theory of competition in his 1838 volume ''Recherches sur les Principes Mathematiques de la Theorie des Richesses'' as a way of describing the competition with a market for spring water dominated by two suppliers (a [[duopoly]]).&lt;ref name="berg"&gt;{{harvnb|Van den Berg|Bos|Herings|Peters|2011|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was one of a number that Cournot set out "explicitly and with mathematical precision" in the volume.&lt;ref name="morrison"&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Cournot constructed profit functions for each firm, and then used [[partial differentiation]] to construct a function representing a firm's [[best response]] for given (exogenous) output levels of the other firm(s) in the market.&lt;ref name="morrison"/&gt; He then showed that a stable equilibrium occurs where these functions intersect (i.e. the simultaneous solution of the best response functions of each firm).&lt;ref name="morrison"/&gt;

The consequence of this is that in equilibrium, each firm's expectations of how other firms will act are shown to be correct; when all is revealed, no firm wants to change its output decision.&lt;ref name="varian"/&gt; This idea of stability was later taken up and built upon as a description of [[Nash equilibria]], of which Cournot equilibria are a subset.&lt;ref name="morrison"/&gt;

==Graphically finding the Cournot duopoly equilibrium==
This section presents an analysis of the model with 2 firms and constant [[marginal cost]].

:&lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; = firm 1 price, &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt; = firm 2 price

:&lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; = firm 1 quantity, &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; = firm 2 quantity

:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; = [[marginal cost]], identical for both firms

[[Economic equilibrium|Equilibrium]] prices will be:
:&lt;math&gt;p_1 = p_2 = P(q_1+q_2)&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that firm 1’s profit is given by &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1 = q_1(P(q_1+q_2)-c)&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate firm 1’s residual demand: Suppose firm 1 believes firm 2 is producing quantity &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;. What is firm 1's optimal quantity? Consider the diagram 1. If firm 1 decides not to produce anything, then price is given by &lt;math&gt;P(0+q_2)=P(q_2)&lt;/math&gt;. If firm 1 produces &lt;math&gt;q_1'&lt;/math&gt; then price is given by &lt;math&gt;P(q_1'+q_2)&lt;/math&gt;. More generally, for each quantity that firm 1 might decide to set, price is given by the curve &lt;math&gt;d_1(q_2)&lt;/math&gt;. The curve &lt;math&gt;d_1(q_2)&lt;/math&gt; is called firm 1’s residual demand; it gives all possible combinations of firm 1’s quantity and price for a given value of &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:economics cournot diag1 svg.svg]]
* Determine firm 1’s optimum output: To do this we must find where [[marginal revenue]] equals marginal cost. Marginal cost (c) is assumed to be constant. Marginal revenue is a curve - &lt;math&gt;r_1(q_2)&lt;/math&gt; - with twice the slope of &lt;math&gt;d_1(q_2)&lt;/math&gt; and with the same vertical intercept. The point at which the two curves (&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_1(q_2)&lt;/math&gt;) intersect corresponds to quantity &lt;math&gt;q_1''(q_2)&lt;/math&gt;. Firm 1’s optimum &lt;math&gt;q_1''(q_2)&lt;/math&gt;, depends on what it believes firm 2 is doing. To find an equilibrium, we derive firm 1’s optimum for other possible values of &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;. Diagram 2 considers two possible values of &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;q_2=0&lt;/math&gt;, then the first firm's residual demand is effectively the market demand, &lt;math&gt;d_1(0)=D&lt;/math&gt;. The optimal solution is for firm 1 to choose the [[monopoly]] quantity; &lt;math&gt;q_1''(0)=q^m&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;q^m&lt;/math&gt; is monopoly quantity). If firm 2 were to choose the quantity corresponding to [[perfect competition]], &lt;math&gt;q_2=q^c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;P(q^c)=c&lt;/math&gt;, then firm 1’s optimum would be to produce nil: &lt;math&gt;q_1''(q^c)=0&lt;/math&gt;. This is the point at which marginal cost intercepts the marginal revenue corresponding to &lt;math&gt;d_1(q^c)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:economics cournot diag2 svg.svg]]
* It can be shown that, given the linear demand and constant marginal cost, the function &lt;math&gt;q_1''(q_2)&lt;/math&gt; is also linear. Because we have two points, we can draw the entire function &lt;math&gt;q_1''(q_2)&lt;/math&gt;, see diagram 3. Note the axis of the graphs has changed, The function &lt;math&gt;q_1''(q_2)&lt;/math&gt; is firm 1’s reaction function, it gives firm 1’s optimal choice for each possible choice by firm 2. In other words, it gives firm 1’s choice given what it believes firm 2 is doing.

[[File:economics cournot diag3 svg.svg]]
* The last stage in finding the Cournot equilibrium is to find firm 2’s reaction function. In this case it is symmetrical to firm 1’s as they have the same cost function. The equilibrium is the intersection point of the reaction curves. See diagram 4.

[[File:economics cournot diag4 svg.svg|375 px|]]
* The prediction of the model is that the firms will choose [[Nash equilibrium]] output levels.

==Calculating the equilibrium==
In very general terms, let the price function for the (duopoly) industry be &lt;math&gt;P(q_1+q_2)&lt;/math&gt; and firm &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; have the cost structure &lt;math&gt;C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt;. To calculate the Nash equilibrium, the [[best response|best response functions]] of the firms must first be calculated.

The profit of firm i is revenue minus cost. Revenue is the product of price and quantity and cost is given by the firm's cost function, so profit is (as described above):
&lt;math&gt;\Pi_i = P(q_1+q_2) \cdot q_i - C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt;. The best response is to find the value of &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; that maximises &lt;math&gt;\Pi_i&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;i \ne j&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. given some output of the opponent firm, the output that maximises profit is found. Hence, the maximum of &lt;math&gt;\Pi_i&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; is to be found. First take the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\Pi_i&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi_i }{\partial q_i} = \frac{\partial P(q_1+q_2) }{\partial q_i} \cdot q_i + P(q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i}&lt;/math&gt;

Setting this to zero for maximization:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi_i }{\partial q_i} = \frac{\partial P(q_1+q_2) }{\partial q_i} \cdot q_i + P(q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i}=0&lt;/math&gt;

The values of &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy this equation are the best responses. The Nash equilibria are where both &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; are best responses given those values of &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;.

===An example===
Suppose the industry has the following price structure: &lt;math&gt;P(q_1+q_2)= a - (q_1+q_2)&lt;/math&gt; The profit of firm &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (with cost structure &lt;math&gt;C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial ^2C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i^2}=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_j}=0, j \ne i&lt;/math&gt; for ease of computation) is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_i = \bigg(a - (q_1+q_2)\bigg) \cdot q_i - C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt;

The maximization problem resolves to (from the general case):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \bigg(a - (q_1+q_2)\bigg) }{\partial q_i} \cdot q_i + a - (q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Without loss of generality, consider firm 1's problem:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \bigg(a - (q_1+q_2)\bigg) }{\partial q_1} \cdot q_1 + a - (q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ - q_1 + a - (q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_1 = \frac{a - q_2 - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

By symmetry:

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_2 = \frac{a - q_1 - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

These are the firms' best response functions. For any value of &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;, firm 1 responds best with any value of &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the above. In Nash equilibria, both firms will be playing best responses so solving the above equations [[simultaneous equation|simultaneously]]. Substituting for &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; in firm 1's best response:

:&lt;math&gt;\ q_1 = \frac{a - \left(\frac{a - q_1 - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{2}\right) - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_1^* = \frac{a + \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2} - 2*\frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_2^* = \frac{a + \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1} - 2*\frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetric Nash equilibrium is at &lt;math&gt;(q_1^*,q_2^*)&lt;/math&gt;. (See Holt (2005, Chapter 13) for asymmetric examples.)  Making suitable assumptions for the partial derivatives (for example, assuming each firm's cost is a linear function of quantity and thus using the slope of that function in the calculation), the equilibrium quantities can be substituted in the assumed industry price structure &lt;math&gt;P(q_1+q_2)= a - (q_1+q_2)&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the equilibrium market price.

==Cournot competition with many firms and the Cournot theorem==
For an arbitrary number of firms, &lt;math&gt;N &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, the quantities and price can be derived in a manner analogous to that given above. With linear demand and identical, constant marginal cost the equilibrium values are as follows:

Market demand; &lt;math&gt;\ p(q)=a-bq=a-bQ=p(Q) &lt;/math&gt;

Cost function; &lt;math&gt;\ c_i(q_i)=cq_i &lt;/math&gt;, for all i

:&lt;math&gt;\ q_i = Q/N = \frac{a-c} {b(N+1)},&lt;/math&gt;

which is each individual firm's output

:&lt;math&gt;\sum q_i = Nq = \frac{N(a-c)} {b(N+1)},&lt;/math&gt;

which is total industry output

:&lt;math&gt;\ p =a-b(Nq)= \frac{a + Nc} {N+1},&lt;/math&gt;

which is the market clearing price, and

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_i = \left(\frac{a - c} {N+1}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{b}\right)&lt;/math&gt; ,  which is each individual firm's profit.

The Cournot Theorem then states that, in absence of fixed costs of production, as the number of firms in the market, ''N'', goes to infinity, market output, ''Nq'', goes to the competitive level and the price converges to marginal cost.

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\rightarrow \infty} p = c&lt;/math&gt;

Hence with many firms a Cournot market approximates a perfectly competitive market. This result can be generalized to the case of firms with different cost structures (under appropriate restrictions) and non-linear demand.

When the market is characterized by fixed costs of production, however, we can endogenize the number of competitors imagining that firms enter in the market until their profits are zero. In our linear example with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; firms, when fixed costs for each firm are &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, we have the endogenous number of firms:

:&lt;math&gt;N=\frac{a-c}{\sqrt{Fb}}-1&lt;/math&gt;

and a production for each firm equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;q=\frac{\sqrt{Fb}}{b}&lt;/math&gt;

This equilibrium is usually known as Cournot equilibrium with endogenous entry, or Marshall equilibrium.&lt;ref name=Etro_6&gt;Etro, Federico. ''[http://dipeco.economia.unimib.it/persone/etro/economia_e_politica_della_concorrenza/notes.pdf Simple models of competition]'', page 6, Dept. Political Economics -- Università di Milano-Bicocca, November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
* Output is greater with Cournot duopoly than monopoly, but lower than perfect competition.
* Price is lower with Cournot duopoly than monopoly, but not as low as with perfect competition.
* According to this model the firms have an incentive to form a cartel, effectively turning the Cournot model into a Monopoly. Cartels are usually illegal, so firms might instead tacitly collude using self-imposing strategies to reduce output which, ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' will raise the price and thus increase profits for all firms involved.

==Bertrand versus Cournot==
Although both models have similar assumptions, they have very different implications:
* Since the [[Bertrand game|Bertrand model]] assumes that firms compete on price and not output quantity, it predicts that a [[duopoly]] is enough to push prices down to marginal cost level, meaning that a duopoly will result in [[perfect competition]].
* Neither model is necessarily "better." The accuracy of the predictions of each model will vary from industry to industry, depending on the closeness of each model to the industry situation.
* If capacity and output can be easily changed, Bertrand is a better model of duopoly competition. If output and capacity are difficult to adjust, then Cournot is generally a better model.
* Under some conditions the Cournot model can be recast as a two-stage model, where in the first stage firms choose capacities, and in the second they compete in Bertrand fashion.
However, as the number of firms increases towards infinity, the Cournot model gives the same result as in Bertrand model: The market price is pushed to marginal cost level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50028">Many [[programming language]] [[type system]]s support [[subtyping]]. '''Variance''' refers to how subtyping between more complex types relates to subtyping between their components. For instance, if the type {{C sharp|Cat}} is a subtype of {{C sharp|Animal}}, then an expression of type {{C sharp|Cat}} can be used wherever an expression of type {{C sharp|Animal}} is used.  How should a list of {{C sharp|Cat}}s relate to a list of {{C sharp|Animal}}s? Or how should a function returning {{C sharp|Cat}} relate to a function returning {{C sharp|Animal}}? Depending on the variance of the [[type constructor]], the subtyping relation of the simple types may be either preserved, reversed, or ignored for the respective complex types. In the [[OCaml]] programming language, for example, "list of Cat" is a subtype of "list of Animal" because the list constructor is '''covariant'''. This means that the subtyping relation of the simple types are preserved for the complex types, while "function from Animal to String" is a subtype of "function from Cat to String" because the function type constructor is '''contravariant''' in the argument type. Here the subtyping relation of the simple types is reversed for the complex types.

A programming language designer will consider variance when devising typing rules for language features such as arrays, inheritance, and generic datatypes. By making type constructors covariant or contravariant instead of invariant, more programs will be accepted as well-typed. On the other hand, programmers often find contravariance unintuitive, and accurately tracking variance to avoid runtime type errors can lead to complex typing rules. In order to keep the type system simple and allow useful programs, a language may treat a type constructor as invariant even if it would be safe to consider it variant, or treat it as covariant even though that could violate type safety.

==Formal definition==

Within the [[type system]] of a [[programming language]], a typing rule or a type constructor is:

* ''covariant'' if it preserves the [[subtype|ordering of types (≤)]], which orders types from more specific to more generic; 
* ''contravariant'' if it reverses this ordering;
* ''bivariant'' if both of these apply (i.e., both {{C sharp|I&lt;A&gt;}} ≤ {{C sharp|I&lt;B&gt;}} and {{C sharp|I&lt;B&gt;}} ≤ {{C sharp|I&lt;A&gt;}} at the same time)&lt;ref&gt;This only happens in a pathological case. For example, &lt;code&gt;type 'a t = int&lt;/code&gt;: any type can be put in for &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; and the result is still &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;;
* ''invariant'' or ''nonvariant'' if neither of these applies.

The article considers how this applies to some common type constructors.

=== C# examples ===

For example, in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], if  {{C sharp|Cat}} is a subtype of {{C sharp|Animal}}, then:
* {{C sharp|IEnumerable&lt;Cat&gt;}} is a subtype of {{C sharp|IEnumerable&lt;Animal&gt;}}. The subtyping is preserved because {{C sharp|IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;}} is '''covariant''' on {{C sharp|T}}.
* {{C sharp|Action&lt;Animal&gt;}} is a subtype of {{C sharp|Action&lt;Cat&gt;}}. The subtyping is reversed because {{C sharp|Action&lt;T&gt;}} is '''contravariant''' on {{C sharp|T}}.
* Neither {{C sharp|IList&lt;Cat&gt;}} nor {{C sharp|IList&lt;Animal&gt;}} is a subtype of the other, because {{C sharp|IList&lt;T&gt;}} is '''invariant''' on {{C sharp|T}}.
The variance of a C# generic interface is declared by placing the {{C sharp|out}} (covariant) or {{C sharp|in}} (contravariant) attribute on (zero or more of) its type parameters. For each so-marked type parameter, the compiler conclusively verifies, with any violation being fatal, that such use is globally consistent. The above interfaces are declared as {{C sharp|IEnumerable&lt;out T&gt;}}, {{C sharp|Action&lt;in T&gt;}}, and {{C sharp|IList&lt;T&gt;}}. Types with more than one type parameter may specify different variances on each type parameter. For example, the delegate type {{C sharp|Func&lt;in T, out TResult&gt;}} represents a function with a '''contravariant''' input parameter of type {{C sharp|T}} and a '''covariant''' return value of type {{C sharp|TResult}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb549151.aspx Func&lt;T, TResult&gt; Delegate] - MSDN Documentation&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[#Interfaces|typing rules for interface variance]] ensure type safety. For example, an {{C sharp|Action&lt;T&gt;}} represents a first-class function expecting an argument of type {{C sharp|T}}, and a function that can handle any type of animal can always be used instead of one that can only handle cats.

==Arrays==

Read-only data types (sources) can be covariant; write-only data types (sinks) can be contravariant. Mutable data types which act as both sources and sinks should be invariant. To illustrate this general phenomenon, consider the [[array data type|array type]].  For the type {{java|Animal}} we can make the type {{java|Animal[]}}, which is an "array of animals".  For the purposes of this example, this array supports both reading and writing elements.

We have the option to treat this as either:
* Covariant: a {{java|Cat[]}} is an {{java|Animal[]}}
* Contravariant: an {{java|Animal[]}} is a {{java|Cat[]}}
* Invariant: an {{java|Animal[]}} is not a {{java|Cat[]}} and a {{java|Cat[]}} is not an {{java|Animal[]}}

If we wish to avoid type errors, then only the third choice is safe. Clearly, not every {{java|Animal[]}} can be treated as if it were a {{java|Cat[]}}, since a client reading from the array will expect a {{java|Cat}}, but an {{java|Animal[]}} may contain e.g. a {{java|Dog}}. So the contravariant rule is not safe.

Conversely, a {{java|Cat[]}} cannot be treated as an {{java|Animal[]}}. It should always be possible to put a {{java|Dog}} into an {{java|Animal[]}}. With covariant arrays this cannot be guaranteed to be safe, since the backing store might actually be an array of cats. So the covariant rule is also not safe&amp;mdash;the array constructor should be ''invariant''. Note that this is only an issue for mutable arrays; the covariant rule is safe for immutable (read-only) arrays.

===Covariant arrays in Java and C#===
Early versions of Java and C# did not include generics, also termed [[parametric polymorphism]]. In such a setting, making arrays invariant rules out useful polymorphic programs.

For example, consider writing a function to shuffle an array, or a function that tests two arrays for equality using the {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|Object}}.{{java|equals}} method on the elements. The implementation does not depend on the exact type of element stored in the array, so it should be possible to write a single function that works on all types of arrays. It is easy to implement functions of type:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    boolean equalArrays(Object[] a1, Object[] a2);
    void shuffleArray(Object[] a);
&lt;/source&gt;
However, if array types were treated as invariant, it would only be possible to call these functions on an array of exactly the type {{java|Object[]}}. One could not, for example, shuffle an array of strings.

Therefore, both Java and C# treat array types covariantly.
For instance, in Java {{java|String[]}} is a subtype of {{java|Object[]}}, and in C# {{C sharp|string[]}} is a subtype of {{C sharp|object[]}}.

As discussed above, covariant arrays lead to problems with writes into the array. Java and C# deal with this by marking each array object with a type when it is created. Each time a value is stored into an array, the execution environment will check that the run-time type of the value is equal to the run-time type of the array. If there is a mismatch, an {{java|ArrayStoreException}} (Java) or {{C sharp|ArrayTypeMismatchException}} (C#) is thrown:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    // a is a single-element array of String
    String[] a = new String[1];

    // b is an array of Object
    Object[] b = a;

    // Assign an Integer to b. This would be possible if b really were
    // an array of Object, but since it really is an array of String,
    // we will get a java.lang.ArrayStoreException.
    b[0] = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above example, one can ''read'' from the array (b) safely. It is only trying to ''write'' to the array that can lead to trouble.

One drawback to this approach is that it leaves the possibility of a run-time error that a stricter type system could have caught at compile-time. Also, it hurts performance because each write into an array requires an additional run-time check.

With the addition of generics, Java and C# now offer ways to write this kind of polymorphic function without relying on covariance. The array comparison and shuffling functions can be given the parameterized types
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    &lt;T&gt; boolean equalArrays(T[] a1, T[] a2);
    &lt;T&gt; void shuffleArray(T[] a);
&lt;/source&gt;
Alternatively, to enforce that a C# method accesses a collection in a read-only way, one can use the interface  {{C sharp|IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;}} instead of passing it an array {{C sharp|object[]}}.

==Function types==
Languages with [[first-class function]]s have [[function type]]s like "a function expecting a Cat and returning an Animal" (written {{OCaml|Cat -&gt; Animal}} in [[OCaml]] syntax or {{C sharp|Func&lt;Cat,Animal&gt;}} in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] syntax).

Those languages also need to specify when one function type is a subtype of another&amp;mdash;that is, when it is safe to use a function of one type in a context that expects a function of a different type. 
It is safe to substitute a function ''f'' for a function ''g'' if ''f'' accepts a more general type of arguments and returns a more specific type than ''g''.
For example, both functions of type {{OCaml|Cat -&gt; Cat}} and {{OCaml|Animal -&gt; Animal}} can be used wherever a {{OCaml|Cat -&gt; Animal}} was expected. (One can compare this to the [[robustness principle]] of communication: "be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you produce.") The general rule is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S_1 \rightarrow S_2 \leq T_1 \rightarrow T_2&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;T_1 \leq S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2 \leq T_2&lt;/math&gt;. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Using [[Rule of inference|inference rule notation]] the same rule can be written as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;math&gt;T_1 \leq S_1 \quad S_2 \leq T_2 
\over
S_1 \rightarrow S_2 \leq T_1 \rightarrow T_2&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, the → type constructor is ''contravariant in the input type'' and ''covariant in the output type''. This rule was first stated formally by [[John C. Reynolds]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference|author=John C. Reynolds |title=The Essence of Algol
 |conference=Symposium on Algorithmic Languages |year=1981 |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Reynolds81.ps |publisher=North-Holland }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further popularized in a paper by [[Luca Cardelli]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference|author=Luca Cardelli |title=A semantics of multiple inheritance |conference=Semantics of Data Types (International Symposium Sophia-Antipolis, France, June 27 – 29, 1984) |year=1984 |url=http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/Inheritance%20(Semantics%20of%20Data%20Types).pdf |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=173 |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/3-540-13346-1_2}}(Longer version in Information and Computation, 76(2/3): 138-164, February 1988.)&lt;/ref&gt;

When dealing with [[higher-order function|functions that take functions as arguments]], this rule can be applied several times. For example, by applying the rule twice, we see that (A'→B)→B ≤ (A→B)→B if A'≤A. In other words, the type (A→B)→B is ''covariant'' in the A position. For complicated types it can be confusing to mentally trace why a given type specialization is or isn't type-safe, but it is easy to calculate which positions are co- and contravariant: a position is covariant if it is on the left side of an even number of arrows applying to it.

== Inheritance in object-oriented languages ==

When a subclass [[Method overriding|overrides]] a method in a superclass, the compiler must check that the overriding method has the right type. While some languages require that the type exactly matches the type in the superclass (invariance), it is also type safe to allow the overriding method to have a "better" type. By the usual subtyping rule for function types, this means that the overriding method should return a more specific type (return type covariance), and accept a more general argument (argument type contravariance). In [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation, the possibilities are as follows:

&lt;gallery perrow="5" heights="190" caption="Variance and method overriding: overview"&gt;
Image:Vererbung T.svg|Subtyping of the argument/return type of the method.
Image:Inheritance_invariant.svg|''Invariance''. The signature of the overriding method is unchanged.
Image:Inheritance_covariant_return.svg|''Covariant return type''. The subtyping relation is in the same direction as the relation between ClassA and ClassB.
Image:Inheritance_contravariant_argument.svg|''Contravariant argument type''. The subtyping relation is in the opposite direction to the relation between ClassA and ClassB.
Image:Inheritance_covariant_argument.svg|''Covariant argument type''. Not type safe.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

For a concrete example, suppose we are writing a class to model an [[animal shelter]]. We assume that {{java|Cat}} is a subclass of {{java|Animal}}, and that we have a base class (using Java syntax)

[[File:AnimalShelter.svg|frameless|right|upright|alt=UML diagram]]
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class AnimalShelter {
        Animal getAnimalForAdoption() {
          ...
        }
    
        void putAnimal(Animal animal) {
          ...
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Now the question is: if we subclass {{java|AnimalShelter}}, what types are we allowed to give to {{java|getAnimalForAdoption}} and {{java|putAnimal}}?

{{clear}}

===Covariant method return type===

In a language which allows [[covariant return type]]s, a derived class can override the {{java|getAnimalForAdoption}} method to return a more specific type:

[[File:Inheritance covariant return animalshelter.svg|thumb|right|upright|alt=UML diagram]]
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class CatShelter extends AnimalShelter {
        Cat getAnimalForAdoption() {
    	    return new Cat();
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Among mainstream OO languages, [[Java (Programming language)|Java]] and [[C++]] support covariant return types, while [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] does not. Adding the covariant return type was one of the first modifications of the C++ language approved by the standards committee in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Allison |first=Chuck |url=http://www.drdobbs.com/184403580 |title=What's New in Standard C++?}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and [[D (programming language)|D]]  also support covariant return types.

{{clear}}

===Contravariant method argument type===

Similarly, it is type safe to allow an overriding method to accept a more general argument than the method in the base class:

[[File:Inheritance contravariant argument animalshelter.svg|thumb|right|upright|alt=UML diagram]]
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class CatShelter extends AnimalShelter {
        void putAnimal(Object animal) {
           ...
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Not many object-oriented languages actually allow this. C++ and Java would interpret this as an unrelated method with an [[Function overloading|overloaded]] name.

However, [[Sather]] supported both covariance and contravariance. Calling convention for overridden methods are covariant with ''out'' arguments and return values, and contravariant with normal arguments (with the mode ''in'').

{{clear}}

===Covariant method argument type===

Uniquely among mainstream languages, [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] allows the arguments of an overriding method to have a ''more'' specific type than the method in the superclass (argument type covariance). Thus, the Eiffel version of the following code would type check, with {{java|putAnimal}} overriding the method in the base class:

[[File:Inheritance covariant argument animalshelter.svg|thumb|right|upright|alt=UML diagram]]
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class CatShelter extends AnimalShelter {
        void putAnimal(Cat animal) {
           ...
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

This is not type safe. By up-casting a {{java|CatShelter}} to an {{java|AnimalShelter}}, one can try to place a dog in a cat shelter. That does not meet {{java|CatShelter}} argument restrictions, and will result in a runtime error. The lack of type safety (known as the "catcall problem" in the Eiffel community, where "cat" or "CAT" is a Changed Availability or Type) has been a long-standing issue. Over the years, various combinations of global static analysis, local static analysis, and new language features  have been proposed to remedy it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Static Typing |author=Bertrand Meyer |booktitle=OOPSLA 95 (Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and Applications), Atlanta, 1995. |date=October 1995 |url=http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/acm/typing.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="competentCompilers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Type-safe covariance: Competent compilers can catch all catcalls |first1=Mark |last1=Howard |first2=Eric |last2=Bezault |first3=Bertrand |last3=Meyer |first4=Dominique |last4=Colnet |first5=Emmanuel |last5=Stapf |first6=Karine |last6=Arnout |first7=Markus |last7=Keller |date=April 2003 |accessdate=23 May 2013 |url=http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/covariance/recast.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these have been implemented in some Eiffel compilers.

Despite the type safety problem, the Eiffel designers consider covariant argument types crucial for modeling real world requirements.&lt;ref name="competentCompilers"/&gt; The cat shelter illustrates a common phenomenon: it is ''a kind of'' animal shelter but has ''additional restrictions'', and it seems reasonable to use inheritance and restricted argument types to model this. In proposing this use of inheritance, the Eiffel designers reject the [[Liskov substitution principle]], which states that objects of subclasses should always be less restricted than objects of their superclass.

One other instance of a mainstream language allowing covariance in method arguments is PHP in regards to class constructors.  In the following example, the __construct() method is accepted, despite the method argument being covariant to the parent's method argument.  Were this method anything other than __construct(), an error would occur:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
	interface AnimalInterface {}
	interface DogInterface extends AnimalInterface {}

	class Dog implements DogInterface {}

	class Pet {
		public function __construct(AnimalInterface $animal) {}
	}

	class PetDog extends Pet {
		public function __construct(DogInterface $dog) { parent::__construct($dog); }
	}
&lt;/source&gt;

Another example where covariant arguments seem helpful is so-called binary methods, i.e. methods where the argument is expected to be of the same type as the object the method is called on. An example is the {{java|compareTo}} method: {{java|a.compareTo(b)}} checks whether {{java|a}} comes before or after {{java|b}} in some ordering, but the way to compare, say, two rational numbers will be different from the way to compare two strings. Other common examples of binary methods include equality tests, arithmetic operations, and set operations like subset and union.

In older versions of Java, the comparison method was specified as an interface {{java|Comparable}}:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    interface Comparable {
        int compareTo(Object o);
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

The drawback of this is that the method is specified to take an argument of type {{java|Object}}. A typical implementation would first down-cast this argument (throwing an error if it is not of the expected type):

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class RationalNumber implements Comparable {
        int numerator;
        int denominator;
    
        ...
        
        public int compareTo(Object other) {
            RationalNumber otherNum = (RationalNumber)other;
            return Integer.compare(numerator*otherNum.denominator,
                                   otherNum.numerator*denominator);
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

In a language with covariant arguments, the argument to {{java|compareTo}} could be directly given the desired type {{java|RationalNumber}}, hiding the typecast. (Of course, this would still give a runtime error if {{java|compareTo}} was then called on e.g. a {{java|String}}).

=== Avoiding the need for covariant argument types ===

Other language features can provide the apparent benefits of covariant arguments while preserving Liskov substitutability.

In a language with ''generics'' (a.k.a. [[parametric polymorphism]]) and [[bounded quantification]], the previous examples can be written in a type-safe way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Getting Class Correctness and System Correctness Equivalent - How to Get Covariance Right |author=Franz Weber |year=1992 |booktitle=TOOLS 8 (8th conference on Technology of Object-Oriented Languages and Systems), Dortmund, 1992 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.52.7872}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of defining {{java|AnimalShelter}}, we define a parameterized class {{java|Shelter&lt;T&gt;}}. (One drawback of this is that the implementer of the base class needs to foresee which types will need to be specialized in the subclasses).

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class Shelter&lt;T extends Animal&gt; {
        T getAnimalForAdoption() {
          ...
        }
    
        void putAnimal(T animal) {
          ...
        }
    }
    
    
    class CatShelter extends Shelter&lt;Cat&gt; {
        Cat getAnimalForAdoption() {
          ...
        }
    
        void putAnimal(Cat animal) {
          ...
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Similarly, in recent versions of Java the {{java|Comparable}} interface has been parameterized, which allows the downcast to be omitted in a type-safe way:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class RationalNumber implements Comparable&lt;RationalNumber&gt; {
        int numerator;
        int denominator;
      
        ...
         
        public int compareTo(RationalNumber otherNum) {
            return Integer.compare(numerator*otherNum.denominator, 
                                   otherNum.numerator*denominator);
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Another language feature that can help is ''multiple dispatch''. 
One reason that binary methods are awkward to write is that in a call like {{java|a.compareTo(b)}}, selecting the correct implementation of {{java|compareTo}} really depends on the runtime type of both {{java|a}} and {{java|b}}, but in a conventional OO language only the runtime type of {{java|a}} is taken into account. In a language with [[Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS)-style [[multiple dispatch]], the comparison method could be written as a generic function where both arguments are used for method selection.

Giuseppe Castagna&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Castagna, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=203096&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=&amp;CFID=15151515&amp;CFTOKEN=6184618 Covariance and contravariance: conflict without a cause], ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, Volume 17, Issue 3, May 1995, pages 431-447.&lt;/ref&gt; observed that in a typed language with multiple dispatch, a generic function can have some arguments which control dispatch and some "left-over" arguments which do not. Because the method selection rule chooses the most specific applicable method, if a method overrides another method, then the overriding method will have more specific types for the controlling arguments. On the other hand, to ensure type safety the language still must require the left-over arguments to be at least as general. 
Using the previous terminology, types used for runtime method selection are covariant while types not used for runtime method selection of the method are contravariant. Conventional single-dispatch languages like Java also obey this rule: there only one argument is used for method selection (the receiver object, passed along to a method as the hidden argument {{java|this}}), and indeed the type of {{java|this}} is more specialized inside overriding methods than in the superclass.

Castagna suggests that examples where covariant argument types are superior, particularly binary methods, should be handled using multiple dispatch which is naturally covariant.
However, most programming languages do not support multiple dispatch.

== Generic types ==

In programming languages that support generics (a.k.a. [[parametric polymorphism]]), the programmer can extend the type system with new constructors. For example, a C# interface like {{C sharp|IList&lt;T&gt;}} makes it possible to construct new types like {{C sharp|IList&lt;Animal&gt;}} or {{C sharp|IList&lt;Cat&gt;}}. The question then arises what the variance of these type constructors should be.

There are two main approaches. In languages with ''declaration-site variance annotations'' (e.g., [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]), the programmer annotates the definition of a generic type with the intended variance of its type parameters. With ''use-site variance annotations'' (e.g., [[Java (programming language)|Java]]), the programmer instead annotates the places where a generic type is instantiated.

=== Declaration-site variance annotations ===

The most popular languages with declaration-site variance annotations are [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (using the keywords {{C sharp|out}} and {{C sharp|in}}),
and  [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and [[OCaml]] (using the keywords {{OCaml|+}} and {{OCaml|-}}).
C# only allows variance annotations for interface types, while Scala and OCaml allow them for both interface types and concrete data types.

==== Interfaces ====

In C#, each type parameter of a generic interface can be marked covariant ({{C sharp|out}}), contravariant ({{C sharp|in}}), or invariant (no annotation). For example, we can define an interface {{C sharp|IEnumerator&lt;T&gt;}} of read-only iterators, and declare it to be covariant (out) in its type parameter.
&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
    interface IEnumerator&lt;out T&gt;
    {
        T Current { get; }
        bool MoveNext();
    }
&lt;/source&gt;
With this declaration, {{C sharp|IEnumerator}} will be treated as covariant in its type argument, e.g. {{C sharp|IEnumerator&lt;Cat&gt;}} is a subtype of {{C sharp|IEnumerator&lt;Animal&gt;}}.

The typechecker enforces that each method declaration in an interface only mentions the type parameters in a way consistent with the {{C sharp|in}}/{{C sharp|out}} annotations. That is, a parameter that was declared covariant must not occur in any contravariant positions (where a position is contravariant if it occurs under an odd number of contravariant type constructors). The precise rule&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Lippert|title=Exact rules for variance validity |date=3 December 2009 |accessdate=16 August 2016 |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/12/03/exact-rules-for-variance-validity.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Section II.9.7 in &lt;cite&gt;ECMA International Standard ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) 6th edition (June 2012)&lt;/cite&gt;; [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm available online]&lt;/ref&gt; is that the return types of all methods in the interface must be ''valid covariantly'' and all the method argument types must be ''valid contravariantly'', where ''valid S-ly'' is defined as follows:
* Non-generic types (classes, structs, enums, etc.) are valid both co- and contravariantly.
* A type argument {{C sharp|T}} is valid covariantly if it was not marked {{C sharp|in}}, and valid contravariantly if it was not marked {{C sharp|out}}
* An array type {{C sharp|A[]}} is valid S-ly if {{C sharp|A}} is. (This is because C# has covariant arrays).
* A generic type {{C sharp|G&lt;A1,A2,...,An&gt;}} is valid S-ly if for each argument {{C sharp|Ai}}, 
** Ai is valid S-ly, and the ''i''th parameter to {{C sharp|G}} is declared covariant, or
** Ai is valid (not S)-ly, and the ''i''th parameter to {{C sharp|G}} is declared contravariant, or
** Ai is valid both covariantly and contravariantly, and the ''i''th parameter to {{C sharp|G}} is declared invariant.

As an example of how these rules apply, consider the {{C sharp|IList&lt;T&gt;}} interface. 
&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
    interface IList&lt;T&gt;
    {
        void Insert(int index, T item);
        IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; GetEnumerator();
    }
&lt;/source&gt;
The argument type {{C sharp|T}} of {{C sharp|Insert}} must be valid contravariantly, i.e. the type parameter {{C sharp|T}} must not be tagged {{C sharp|out}}. Similarly, the result type {{C sharp|IEnumerator&lt;T&gt;}} of {{C sharp|GetEnumerator}} must be valid covariantly, i.e. (since {{C sharp|IEnumerator}} is a covariant interface) the type {{C sharp|T}} must be valid covariantly, i.e. the type parameter {{C sharp|T}} must not be tagged {{C sharp|in}}. This shows that the interface {{C sharp|IList}} is not allowed to be marked either co- or contravariant.

In the common case of a generic data structure such as {{C sharp|IList}}, these restrictions mean that an {{C sharp|out}} parameter can only be used for methods getting data out of the structure, and an {{C sharp|in}} parameter can only be used for methods putting data into the structure, hence the choice of keywords.

==== Data ====

C# allows variance annotations on the parameters of interfaces, but not the parameters of classes. Because fields in C# classes are always mutable, variantly parameterized classes in C# would not be very useful. But languages which emphasize immutable data can make good use of covariant data types. For example, both in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and [[OCaml]] the immutable list type is covariant: &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;List[Cat]&lt;/source&gt; is a subtype of &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;List[Animal]&lt;/source&gt;.

Scala's rules for checking variance annotations are essentially the same as C#'s. However, there are some idioms that apply to immutable datastructures in particular. They are illustrated by the following (excerpt from the) definition of the &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;List[A]&lt;/source&gt; class.

&lt;source lang="scala"&gt;
sealed abstract class List[+A] extends AbstractSeq[A] {
  def head: A
  def tail: List[A]

  /** Adds an element at the beginning of this list. */
  def ::[B &gt;: A] (x: B): List[B] =
    new scala.collection.immutable.::(x, this)

  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

First, class members that have a variant type must be immutable. Here, &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;head&lt;/source&gt; has the type &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;A&lt;/source&gt;, which was declared covariant (&lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;+&lt;/source&gt;), and indeed &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;head&lt;/source&gt; was declared as a method (&lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;def&lt;/source&gt;). Trying to declare it as a mutable field (&lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;var&lt;/source&gt;) would be rejected as type error.

Second, even if a data structure is immutable, it will often have methods where the parameter type occurs contravariantly. For example, consider the method &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;::&lt;/source&gt; which adds an element to the front of a list. (The implementation works by creating a new object of the similarly-named ''class'' &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;::&lt;/source&gt;, the class of nonempty lists). The most obvious type to give it would be 
&lt;source lang=scala&gt;
  def :: (x: A): List[A]
&lt;/source&gt;
However, this would be a type error, because the covariant parameter &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;A&lt;/source&gt; appears in a contravariant position (as a function argument). But there is a trick to get around this problem. We give &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;::&lt;/source&gt; a more general type, which allows adding an element of any type &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;B&lt;/source&gt; 
as long as &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;B&lt;/source&gt; is a supertype of &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;A&lt;/source&gt;. Note that this relies on &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;List&lt;/source&gt; being covariant, since 
&lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;this&lt;/source&gt;  has type &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;List[A]&lt;/source&gt; and we treat it as having type &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;List[B]&lt;/source&gt;.  At first glance it may not be obvious that the generalized type is sound, but if the programmer starts out with the simpler type declaration, the type errors will point out the place that  needs to be generalized.

==== Inferring variance ====

It is possible to design a type system where the compiler automatically infers the best possible variance annotations for all datatype parameters.&lt;ref name="tamingCombining"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=John Altidor |author2=Huang Shan Shan |author3=Yannis Smaragdakis |title=Taming the wildcards: combining definition- and use-site variance |booktitle=Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGPLAN conference on Programming language design and implementation (PLDI'11) |year=2011 |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~jaltidor/variance_pldi11.pdf }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the analysis can get complex for several reasons. First, the analysis is nonlocal since the variance of an interface {{java|I}} depends on the variance of all interfaces that {{java|I}} mentions.  Second, in order to get unique best solutions the type system must allow ''bivariant'' parameters (which are simultaneously co- and contravariant). And finally, the variance of type parameters should arguably be a deliberate choice by the designer of an interface, not something that just happens.

For these reasons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Covariance and Contravariance in C# Part Seven: Why Do We Need A Syntax At All? |author1= Eric Lippert |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=16 August 2016
|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2007/10/29/covariance-and-contravariance-in-c-part-seven-why-do-we-need-a-syntax-at-all.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; most languages do very little variance inference. C# and Scala do not infer any variance annotations at all. OCaml can infer the variance of parameterized concrete datatypes, but the programmer must explicitly specify the variance of abstract types (interfaces).

For example, consider an OCaml datatype {{OCaml|T}} which wraps a function
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
type ('a, 'b) t = T of ('a -&gt; 'b) 
&lt;/source&gt;
The compiler will automatically infer that {{OCaml|T}} is contravariant in the first parameter, and covariant in the second. The programmer can also provide explicit annotations, which the compiler will check are satisfied. Thus the following declaration is equivalent to the previous one:
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
type (-'a, +'b) t = T of ('a -&gt; 'b) 
&lt;/source&gt;

Explicit annotations in OCaml become useful when specifying interfaces. For example, the standard library interface {{OCaml|Map.S}} for association tables include an annotation saying that the map type constructor is covariant in the result type.
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
module type S =
  sig
    type key
    type (+'a) t
    val empty: 'a t
    val mem: key -&gt; 'a t -&gt; bool
    ...
  end
&lt;/source&gt;
This ensures that e.g. {{OCaml|cat IntMap.t}} is a subtype of {{OCaml|animal IntMap.t}}.

=== Use-site variance annotations (wildcards) ===

One drawback of the declaration-site approach is that many interface types must be made invariant. For example, we saw above that {{C sharp|IList}} needed to be invariant, because it contained both {{C sharp|Insert}} and {{C sharp|GetEnumerator}}. In order to expose more variance, the API designer could provide additional interfaces which provide subsets of the available methods (e.g. an "insert-only list" which only provides {{C sharp|Insert}}). However this quickly becomes unwieldy.

Use-site variance annotations aim to give users of a class more opportunities for subtyping without requiring the designer of the class to define multiple interfaces with different variance. Instead, each time a class or interface is used in a type declaration, the programmer can indicate that only a subset of the methods will be used. In effect, each definition of a class also makes available interfaces for the covariant and contravariant ''parts'' of that class. Therefore, the designer of the class no longer needs to take variance into account, increasing re-usability.

Java provides use-site variance annotations through [[Wildcard (Java)|wildcards]], a restricted form of [[bounded quantification|bounded]] [[existential type]]s. A parameterized type can be instantiated by a wildcard {{java|?}} together with an upper or lower bound, e.g. {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}} or {{java|List&lt;? super Animal&gt;}}. (A an unbounded wildcard like {{java|List&lt;?&gt;}} is equivalent to {{java|List&lt;? extends Object&gt;}}). Such a type  represents {{java|List&lt;X&gt;}} for some unknown type {{java|X}} which satisfies the bound. For example, if {{java|l}} has type {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}}, then the typechecker will accept
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    Animal a = l.get(3);
&lt;/source&gt;
because the type {{java|X}} is known to be a subtype of {{java|Animal}}, but
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    l.add(new Animal())
&lt;/source&gt;
will be rejected as a type error since an {{java|Animal}} is not necessarily an {{java|X}}. In general, given some interface {{java|I&lt;T&gt;}}, a reference to a {{java|I&lt;? extends A&gt;}} forbids using  methods from the interface where {{java|T}} occurs contravariantly in the type of the method. Conversely, if {{java|l}} had type {{java|List&lt;? super Animal&gt;}} one could call {{java|l.add}} but not {{java|l.get}}.

[[File:Java wildcard subtyping.svg|thumb|right|350px|Wildcard subtyping in Java can be visualized as a cube.]]

While plain generic types in Java are invariant (e.g. there is no subtyping relationship between {{java|List&lt;Cat&gt;}} and {{java|List&lt;Animal&gt;}}), wildcard types can be made more specific by specifying a tighter bound, for example {{java|List&lt;? extends Cat&gt;}} is a subtype of {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}}. This shows that wildcard types are ''covariant in their upper bounds'' (and also ''contravariant in their lower bounds''). In total, given a wildcard type like {{java|C&lt;? extends T&gt;}}, there are three ways to form a subtype: by specializing the class {{java|C}}, by specifying a tighter bound {{java|T}}, or by replacing the wildcard {{java|?}} by a specific type (see figure).

By combining two steps of subtyping, it is therefore possible to e.g. pass an argument of type {{java|List&lt;Cat&gt;}} to a method expecting a {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}}. This is exactly the kind of programs that covariant interface types allow. The type {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}} acts as an interface type containing only the covariant methods of {{java|List&lt;T&gt;}}, but the implementer of {{java|List&lt;T&gt;}} did not have to define it ahead of time. This is use-site variance.

In the common case of a generic data structure {{C sharp|IList}}, covariant parameters are used for methods getting data out of the structure, and contravariant parameters for methods putting data into the structure. The mnemonic for Producer Extends, Consumer Super (PECS), from the book ''Effective Java'' by [[Joshua Bloch]] gives an easy way to remember when to use covariance and contravariance.

Wildcards are flexible, but there is a drawback. While use-site variance means that API designers need not consider variance of type parameters to interfaces, they must often instead use more complicated method signatures. A common example involves the {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|Comparable}} interface. Suppose we want to write a function that finds the biggest element in a collection. The elements need to implement the {{java|compareTo}} method, so a first try might be
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt;  T max(Collection&lt;T&gt; coll);
&lt;/source&gt;
However, this type is not general enough&amp;mdash;one can find the max of a {{java|Collection&lt;Calendar&gt;}}, but not a {{java|Collection&lt;GregorianCalendar&gt;}}. The problem is that {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|GregorianCalendar}} does not implement {{java|Comparable&lt;GregorianCalendar&gt;}}, but instead the (better) interface {{java|Comparable&lt;Calendar&gt;}}. In Java, unlike in C#, {{java|Comparable&lt;Calendar&gt;}} is not considered a subtype of {{java|Comparable&lt;GregorianCalendar&gt;}}. Instead the type of {{java|max}} has to be modified:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;&gt; T max(Collection&lt;T&gt; coll);
&lt;/source&gt;
The bounded wildcard {{java|? super T}} conveys the information that {{java|max}} calls only contravariant methods from the {{java|Comparable}} interface. This particular example is frustrating because ''all'' the methods in {{java|Comparable}} are contravariant, so that condition is trivially true. A declaration-site system could handle this example with less clutter by annotating only the definition of {{java|Comparable}}.

=== Comparing declaration-site and use-site annotations ===

Use-site variance annotations provide additional flexibility, allowing more programs to type-check. However, they have been criticized for the complexity they add to the language, leading to complicated type signatures and error messages.

One way to assess whether the extra flexibility is useful is to see if it is used in existing programs. A survey of a large set of Java libraries&lt;ref name="tamingCombining" /&gt; found that 39% of wildcard annotations could have been directly replaced by a declaration-site annotations. Thus the remaining 61% is an indication on places where Java benefits from having the use-site system available.

In a declaration-site language, libraries must either expose less variance, or define more interfaces. For example, the Scala Collections library defines three separate interfaces for classes which employ covariance: a covariant base interface containing common methods, an invariant mutable version which adds side-effecting methods, and a covariant immutable version which may specialize the inherited implementations to exploit structural sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Scala 2.8 Collections API |author1=Marin Odersky |author2=Lex Spoon |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2016 |url=http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/collections-api/collections.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design works well with declaration-site annotations, but the large number of interfaces carry a complexity cost for clients of the library. And modifying the library interface may not be an option&amp;mdash;in particular, one goal when adding generics to Java was to maintain binary backwards compatibility.

On the other hand, Java wildcards are themselves complex. In a conference presentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joshua Bloch |title=The Closures Controversy [video] |date=November 2007 |place=Presentation at Javapolis'07 |url=http://parleys.com/play/514892250364bc17fc56bb15/chapter0/about |accessdate=May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202190630/http://parleys.com/play/514892250364bc17fc56bb15/chapter0/about |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joshua Bloch]] criticized them as being too hard to understand and use, stating that when adding support for [[Closure (computer science)|closures]] "we simply cannot afford another ''wildcards''". Early versions of Scala used use-site variance annotations but programmers found them difficult to use in practice, while declaration-site annotations were found to be very helpful when designing classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Martin Odersky |author2=Matthias Zenger |title=Scalable component abstractions |booktitle=Proceedings of the 20th annual ACM SIGPLAN conference on Object-oriented programming, systems, languages, and applications (OOPSLA '05) |year=2005 |url=http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/papers/ScalableComponent.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of Scala added Java-style existential types and wildcards; however, according to [[Martin Odersky]], if there were no need for interoperability with Java then these would probably not have been included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Purpose of Scala's Type System: A Conversation with Martin Odersky, Part III |author=Bill Venners and Frank Sommers |date=May 18, 2009 |accessdate=16 August 2016 |url=http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/scalas_type_system.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross Tate argues&lt;ref name="MixedSiteVariance"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Ross Tate |title=Mixed-Site Variance |booktitle=FOOL '13: Informal Proceedings of the 20th International Workshop on Foundations of Object-Oriented Languages |year=2013 |url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ross/publications/mixedsite/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; that part of the complexity of Java wildcards is due to the decision to encode use-site variance using a form of existential types. The original proposals&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference |author1=Atsushi Igarashi |author2=Mirko Viroli |title=On Variance-Based Subtyping for Parametric Types |booktitle=Proceedings of the 16th European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP '02) |year=2002 |url=http://www.sato.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~igarashi/papers/pdf/variance.ecoop02.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622001350/http://www.sato.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~igarashi/papers/pdf/variance.ecoop02.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Kresten Krab Thorup |author2=Mads Torgersen |title=Unifying Genericity: Combining the Benefits of Virtual Types and Parameterized Classes |booktitle=Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP '99) |year=1999 |url=http://www.daimi.au.dk/~madst/tool/papers/unifying.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; used special-purpose syntax for variance annotations, writing {{java|List&lt;+Animal&gt;}} instead of Java's more verbose {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}}.

Since wildcards are a form of existential types they can be used for more things than just variance. A type like {{java|List&lt;?&gt;}} ("some type of list") lets objects be passed to methods or stored in fields without exactly specifying their type parameters. This is particularly valuable for classes such as {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|Class}} where most of the methods do not mention the type parameter.

However, [[type inference]] for existential types is a difficult problem. For the compiler implementer, Java wildcards raise issues with type checker termination, type argument inference, and ambiguous programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Taming wildcards in Java's type system |first1=Ross |last1=Tate |first2=Alan |last2=Leung |first3=Sorin |last3=Lerner |booktitle=Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGPLAN conference on Programming language design and implementation (PLDI '11) |year=2011 |url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ross/publications/tamewild/}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In general it is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] whether a Java program using generics is well-typed or not,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author1=Radu Grigore | title=Java generics are turing complete | booktitle=Proceedings of the 44th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL'17) | year=2017 | arxiv=1605.05274 | bibcode=2016arXiv160505274G }}&lt;/ref&gt; so any type checker will have to go into an infinite loop or time out for some programs.) For the programmer, it leads to complicated type error messages. Java typechecks wildcard types by replacing the wildcards with fresh type variables (so-called ''capture conversion''). This can make error messages harder to read, because they refer to type variables that the programmer did not directly write. For example, trying to add a {{java|Cat}} to a {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}} will give an error like

 method List.add(capture#1) is not applicable
   (actual argument Cat cannot be converted to capture#1 by method invocation conversion)
 where capture#1 is a fresh type-variable:
   capture#1 extends Animal from capture of ? extends Animal

Since both declaration-site and use-site annotations can be useful, some type systems provide both.&lt;ref name=tamingCombining /&gt;&lt;ref name="MixedSiteVariance" /&gt;

==Origin of the term ''covariance''==

These terms come from the notion of [[covariance and contravariance of functors|covariant and contravariant functors]] in [[category theory]]. Consider the category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; whose objects are types and whose morphisms represent the subtype relationship  ≤. (This is an example of how any partially ordered set can be considered as a category.) Then for example the function type constructor takes two types ''p'' and ''r'' and creates a new type ''p'' → ''r''; so it takes objects in &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; to objects in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. By the subtyping rule for function types this operation reverses ≤ for the first argument and preserves it for the second, so it is a contravariant functor in the first argument and a covariant functor in the second.

{{Conservation status}}
[[File:Linces1.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Iberian lynx]] (''Lynx pardinus''), an endangered species.]]
An '''endangered species''' is a [[species]] which has been categorized  as very likely to become [[Extinction|extinct]]. E&lt;!--Capital "E" as this is a specific IUCN category--&gt;ndangered (EN), as categorized by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) [[IUCN Red List|Red List]], is the second most severe [[conservation status]] for wild populations in the IUCN's schema after [[Critically endangered|{{allow wrap|Critically Endangered}}]]&amp;nbsp;(CR).

In 2012, the IUCN Red List featured 3079 [[animal]] and 2655 [[plant]] species as endangered&amp;nbsp;(EN) worldwide.&lt;ref name="iucn 2012.2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/summarystatistics/2012_2_RL_Stats_Table_2.pdf |title=IUCN Red List version 2012.2: Table 2: Changes in numbers of species in the threatened categories (CR, EN, VU) from 1996 to 2012 (IUCN Red List version 2012.2) for the major taxonomic groups on the Red List |accessdate=2012-12-31 |publisher=[[IUCN]] |year=2012 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures for 1998 were, respectively, 1102 and 1197.

Many nations have [[Environmental law|law]]s that protect [[conservation-reliant species]]: for example, forbidding [[hunting]], restricting [[land development]] or creating preserves. Population numbers, trends and species' conservation status can be found at the [[lists of organisms by population]].

{{main|Conservation status}}

The [[conservation status]] of a [[species]] indicates the likelihood that it will become [[extinct]].  Many factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natureserve.org/infonatura/Lnsstatus.htm |title=NatureServe Conservation Status |date=April 2007 |publisher=NatureServe |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |title=Red List Overview |date=February 2011 |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527175928/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |archivedate=May 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/ |title=Threatened Species |publisher=Conservation and Wildlife |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913043721/http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species |archivedate=September 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord to create [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s that will protect endangered and other threatened species. In the [[United States]], such plans are usually called [[Endangered Species Recovery Plan|Species Recovery Plan]]s.

Though labelled a list, the [[IUCN Red List]] is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species that includes "Data Deficient"&amp;nbsp;(DD) species&amp;nbsp;– species for which more data and assessment is required before their status may be determined&amp;nbsp;– as well species comprehensively assessed by the IUCN's species assessment process. Those species of "[[Near-threatened species|Near Threatened]]"&amp;nbsp;(NT) and "[[Least concern|Least Concern]]"&amp;nbsp;(LC) status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations, though these may be in decline. Unlike their more general use elsewhere, the List uses the terms "endangered species" and "threatened species" with particular meanings: "Endangered"&amp;nbsp;(EN) species lie between "[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]"&amp;nbsp;(VU) and "[[Critically Endangered species|Critically Endangered]]"&amp;nbsp;(CR) species, while "Threatened" species are those species determined to be Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered.

The IUCN categories, with examples of animals classified by them, include:

== Endangered species in the United States ==
There is data from the United States that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species. Using species data from the Database on the Economics and Management of Endangered Species (DEMES) database and the period that the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) has been in existence, 1970 to 1997, a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Shogren|editor1-first=Jason F.|editor2-last=Tschirhart|editor2-first=John|title=Protecting Endangered Species in the United States: Biological Needs, Political Realities, Economic Choices|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521662109|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endangered Species Act===
[[File:Status ESA LE.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|"Endangered" in relation to "threatened" under the ESA.]]
Under the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] in the [[United States]], species may be listed as "endangered" or "threatened". The [[Salt Creek tiger beetle]] (''Cicindela nevadica lincolniana'') is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species, and adding a particular species to the list can be a long, controversial process (Wilcove &amp; Master, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;414).

Some endangered species laws are controversial. Typical areas of controversy include: criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and criteria for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered; whether restrictions on land development constitute a "taking" of land by the [[government]]; the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their lands; and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws. Also lobbying from [[hunting|hunters]] and various industries like the [[petroleum industry]], [[construction]] industry, and [[logging]], has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws.

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species. Under the [[Obama administration]], this policy has been reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/news/newsreleases/showNews.cfm?newsId=EE78C309-C119-D9DC-042421265ACD62A4|title=FWS.gov|author=|date=|website=fws.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Courchamp |first=Franck |author2=Elena Angulo |author3=Philippe Rivalan |author4=Richard J.

Another problem with the listing species is its effect of inciting the use of the "shoot, shovel, and shut-up" method of clearing endangered species from an area of land. Some landowners currently may perceive a diminution in value for their land after finding an endangered animal on it. They have allegedly opted to silently kill and bury the animals or destroy habitat, thus removing the problem from their land, but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/34933.html |title=Shoot, Shovel and Shut Up |work=Reasononline |publisher=Reason Magazine |date=2003-12-31 |accessdate=2006-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]]&amp;nbsp;– which coined the term "endangered species"&amp;nbsp;– has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool. Nineteen species have been delisted and recovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/DelistingReport.do |title=USFWS Threatened and Endangered Species System (TESS) |publisher=U.

Currently, 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law.&lt;!--Too vague: &lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 2006 (webpage).&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; This approximation, however, does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws as the Endangered Species Act. According to [[NatureServe conservation status|NatureServe's global conservation status]], approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish), seventeen percent of vascular plants, and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled.&lt;ref name="WM2008"&gt;Wilcove &amp; Master 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpages|415|16}} Thus, in total, between seven and eighteen percent of the United States' known animals, fungi and plants are near extinction.&lt;ref name="WM2008"/&gt;{{refpage|416}} This total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.

[[File:American bison k5680-1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|American bison]]
Ever since mankind began hunting to preserve itself, over-hunting and fishing has been a large and dangerous problem. Of all the species who became extinct due to interference from mankind, the [[dodo]], [[passenger pigeon]], [[great auk]], [[Tasmanian tiger]] and [[Steller's sea cow]] are some of the more well known examples; with the [[bald eagle]], [[grizzly bear]], [[American bison]], [[Eastern timber wolf]] and [[sea turtle]] having been hunted to near-extinction.  Many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport. However, due to major efforts to prevent extinction, the bald eagle, or ''[[Bald eagle|Haliaeetus leucocephalus]]'' is now under the category of Least Concern on the red list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Haliaeetus leucocephalus (Bald Eagle)|url = http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/22695144/0|website = www.iucnredlist.org|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A present-day example of the over-hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced. Large whales like the blue whale, bowhead whale, finback whale, gray whale, sperm whale and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the Endangered Species List. Actions have been taken to attempt reduction in whaling and increase population sizes, including prohibiting all whaling in United States waters, the formation of the CITES treaty which protects all whales, along with the formation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).  But even though all of these movements have been put in place, countries such as [[Japan]] continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of "scientific purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freedman |first=Bill |title=Endangered species |journal=Gale |year=2008 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-hunting, climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list and could mean that extinction rates could increase to a large extent in the future.

== Invasive species ==
{{main|Introduced species}}

The introduction of non-indigenous species to an area can disrupt the ecosystem to such an extent that native species become endangered. Such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species. In some cases the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives. In other cases a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline. New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chiras |first=Daniel D. |title=Invader Species |url=http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3753825|journal=Grolier |year=2011 |series=Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Captive breeding===
{{main|Captive breeding}}
Captive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with restricted settings, such as wildlife reserves, zoos and other conservation facilities. Captive breeding is meant to save species from extinction and so stabilize the population of the species that it will not disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/ConservationAndScience/EndangeredSpecies/CapBreedPops/default.cfm |title=Captive Breeding Populations - National Zoo |publisher=Nationalzoo.si.edu |accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technique has worked for many species for some time, with probably the oldest known such instances of captive mating being attributed to menageries of European and Asian rulers, an example being the [[Père David's deer]]. However, captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for such highly mobile species as some migratory birds (e.g. cranes) and fishes (e.g. [[hilsa]]). Additionally, if the captive breeding population is too small, then inbreeding may occur due to a reduced [[gene pool]] and reduce [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].

In 1981, the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA) created a [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP) in order to help preserve specific endangered and threatened species through captive breeding.  With over 450 SSP Plans, there are a number of endangered species that are covered by the AZA with plans to cover population management goals and recommendations for breeding for a diverse and healthy population, created by Taxon Advisory Groups.  These programs are commonly created as a last resort effort. SSP Programs regularly participate in species recovery, veterinary care for wildlife disease outbreaks, and a number of other wildlife conservation efforts.  The AZA's Species Survival Plan also has breeding and transfer programs, both within and outside of AZA - certified zoos and aquariums.  Some animals that are part of SSP programs are [[giant pandas]], lowland gorillas, and [[California condors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/|archive-url =https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090803071836/http://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/|dead-url =yes|archive-date =2009-08-03|title =Association of Zoos and Aquariums Species Survival Programs|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private farming===
[[File:Ostafrikanisches Spitzmaulnashorn.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Black rhino]]
[[File:Thmac u0.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Southern bluefin tuna]]
Whereas poaching substantially reduces endangered animal populations, legal, for-profit, private farming does the opposite. It has substantially increased the populations of the southern [[black rhinoceros]] and southern [[white rhinoceros]]. Dr Richard Emslie, a scientific officer at the IUCN, said of such programs, "Effective law enforcement has become much easier now that the animals are largely privately owned... We have been able to bring local communities into the conservation programmes. There are increasingly strong economic incentives attached to looking after rhinos rather than simply poaching: from Eco-tourism or selling them on for a profit. So many owners are keeping them secure. The private sector has been key to helping our work."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/hes-black-and-hes-back-private-enterprise-saves-southern-africas-rhino-from-extinction-848482.html He's black, and he's back!

Conservation experts view the effect of China's [[turtle farming]] on the wild turtle populations of China and South-Eastern Asia&amp;nbsp;– many of which are endangered&amp;nbsp;– as "poorly understood".&lt;ref name="scale"&gt;{{cite news |title=Evidence for the massive scale of turtle farming in China |last=Shi |first=Haitao |last2=Parham |first2=James F. |last3=Fan |first3=Zhiyong |last4=Hong |first4=Meiling |last5=Yin |first5=Feng |publication-date= |date=2008-01-01 |periodical=Oryx |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=42 |pages=147–150 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=1738732&amp;jid=ORX&amp;volumeId=42&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=1738724 |doi=10.1017/S0030605308000562 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they commend the gradual replacement of turtles caught wild with [[Turtle farming|farm-raised turtles]] in the marketplace&amp;nbsp;– the percentage of farm-raised individuals in the "visible" trade grew from around 30% in 2000 to around 70% in 2007&lt;ref name="ff"&gt;"[http://www.fishfarmer-magazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/993/Turtle_farms_threaten_rare_species,_experts_say.html Turtle farms threaten rare species, experts say] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218191219/http://www.fishfarmer-magazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/993/Turtle_farms_threaten_rare_species%2C_experts_say.html |date=2012-02-18 }}". ''Fish Farmer'', 30 March 2007. Their source is an article by James Parham, Shi Haitao and two other authors, published in February 2007 in the journal ''Conservation Biology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– they worry that many wild animals are caught to provide farmers with breeding stock.  The conservation expert Peter Paul van Dijk noted that turtle farmers often believe that animals caught wild are superior breeding stock. Turtle farmers may, therefore, seek and catch the last remaining wild specimens of some endangered turtle species.&lt;ref name="ff"/&gt;

In 2009, researchers in Australia managed to coax [[southern bluefin tuna]] to breed in landlocked tanks, raising the possibility that [[fish farming]] may be able to save the species from [[overfishing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1945379_1944416_1944425,00.html The Top 10 Everything of 2009: Top 10 Scientific Discoveries: 5.

== History ==
'''Enterprise Dynamics''' is based on the Taylor II simulation software, which was developed by F&amp;H Simulations.&lt;ref&gt;William B. Nordgren. "Taylor II manufacturing simulation software". ''In Proceedings of the 27th Conference on Winter Simulation, IEEE Computer Society'', Washington, DC, 401–404, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the newly developed simulation platform Taylor Enterprise Dynamics was introduced and in 2000, F&amp;H Simulations was acquired by the consulting company and simulation software distributor Incontrol Business Engineers. The new company name became [[INCONTROL Simulation Solutions]] and Taylor ED was renamed to '''Enterprise Dynamics'''. At this time F&amp;H Simulations, now called Flexsim Software Products, became independent and developed a new simulation software called [[Flexsim]].&lt;ref name="ED Brochures"&gt;{{cite web|title=ED Brochures|url=http://support.incontrolsim.com/en/ed-brochures.html|accessdate=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flexsim company history|url=http://www.flexsim.com/company/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
'''Enterprise Dynamics''' is an object-oriented simulation platform combined with an event-oriented approach. The user can select standard simulation objects (the so-called 'Atoms'), in which the behavior of their real life equivalents is captured, from a library and create a model by clicking and dragging the objects into the model space. For each simulation object, parameters can be altered to change its behavior.&lt;ref name="DW Dillen Book"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.H. Lian, H.

The '''Equality Act 2010'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality Act 2010|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=22 September 2016|ref={{sfnref|Equality Act}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], and has the same goals as the four major EU [[Equal Treatment Directive]]s, whose provisions it mirrors and implements.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Employment Equality Framework Directive|EU Directive 2000/78/EC]], 2000/43/EC, 2006/54/EC&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary purpose of the Act is to codify the complicated and numerous array of Acts and Regulations, which formed the basis of [[anti-discrimination law]] in Great Britain. This was, primarily, the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]], the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], the [[Race Relations Act 1976]], the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] and three major [[statutory instruments]] protecting discrimination in employment on grounds of [[Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003|religion or belief]], [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003|sexual orientation]] and [[Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006|age]].

The Act requires equal treatment in access to employment as well as private and public services, regardless of the protected characteristics of age, [[disability]], [[sex reassignment therapy|gender reassignment]], marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, [[sex]], and [[sexual orientation]]. There are special protections for pregnant women. In the case of gender reassignment, the Act does not guarantee transgender people access to single-sex services where the restrictions are "a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim".{{sfn|Equality Act|loc=schedule 3, part 7, para 28}} In the case of disability, employers and service providers are under a duty to make [[reasonable accommodation|reasonable adjustments]] to their workplaces to overcome barriers experienced by disabled people. In this regard, the Equality Act 2010 did not change the law. Under s.217, with [[Disability in Northern Ireland| limited exceptions]] the Act does not apply to [[Northern Ireland]].{{sfn|Equality Act|loc=s.217}}

==Background==
{{main|UK employment discrimination law}}
The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] included a commitment to an Equality Bill in its 2005 election manifesto. The ''Discrimination Law Review'' was established in 2005 to develop the legislation and was led by the [[Government Equalities Office]]. The review considered the findings of the Equalities Review Panel, chaired by [[Trevor Phillips]], which reported in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/dlr/index.htm|title=Discrimination Law Review (DLR)|publisher=Government Equalities Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act is intended to simplify the law by bringing together existing anti-discrimination legislation. The Equality Act 2010 has replaced the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]], [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], [[Race Relations Act 1976]], [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]], [[Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003]], [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003]]&lt;ref&gt;See also, [[Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006]].

[[Polly Toynbee]] wrote that the bill, which was drafted under the guidance of [[Harriet Harman]], was "Labour's biggest idea for 11 years. A public-sector duty to close the gap between rich and poor will tackle the class divide in a way that no other policy has... This new duty to narrow the gap would permeate every aspect of government policy. Its possible ramifications are mind-bogglingly immense." One cabinet member described it as "socialism in one clause".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/13/polly-toynbee-harriet-harman-social-mobility guardian.co.uk: "Harman's law is Labour's biggest idea for 11 years"] (Toynbee) 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections 104–105 of the Act extend until 2030 the exemption from sex discrimination law, which allows political parties to create [[all-women shortlist]]s.&lt;ref name=equalityhumanrights-2011&gt;{{cite book |pages=179-182 |url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/servicescode_0.pdf |title=Equality Act 2010 Statutory Code of Practice - Services, public functions and associations |isbn=9780108509728 |publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission |year=2011 |accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exemption was previously permitted by the [[Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002]].

The Parliamentary process was completed, following a debate, shortly after 11&amp;nbsp;pm on 6 April 2010, when amendments by the House of Lords were accepted in full.&lt;ref&gt;See the debate in Hansard HC vol 508 [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100406/debtext/100406-0021.htm#1004073000001 cols 927-942] (6 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
===Reform of the monarchy===
In April 2008, [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] [[Vera Baird]] announced that as part of the Single Equality Bill, legislation would be introduced to repeal parts of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] that prevent [[Roman Catholics]] or those who marry Roman Catholics from ascending to the throne, and to change the inheritance of the monarchy from [[Primogeniture#Cognatic primogeniture|cognatic primogeniture]] to [[Primogeniture#Absolute primogeniture|absolute primogeniture]], so that the first-born heir would inherit the throne regardless of gender or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7357017.stm|accessdate=21 April 2008|title=Move to change succession laws|date=20 April 2008|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, later in 2008 the Attorney General [[Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal|Baroness Scotland of Asthal]] decided not to sponsor a change in the law of succession, saying, "To bring about changes to the law on succession would be a complex undertaking involving amendment or repeal of a number of items of related legislation, as well as requiring the consent of legislatures of member nations of the Commonwealth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/1905565/U-turn-on-royal-succession-law-change.html|title=U-turn on royal succession law change|author=Andrew Pierce|publisher=The Telegraph|date=29 April 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The published draft bill did not contain any provisions to change the succession laws. Cognatic primogeniture for the British monarchy was instead abolished separately three years after the Equality Act came into force, with the enactment of the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]].

===Opposition by bishops===
Although the act was never going to change the law with regard to churches from its existing position, nor change the binding European Union law which covers many more Roman Catholics than those living in the United Kingdom, and although the position had been spelled out in the High Court in ''[[R (Amicus) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2004] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2004/860.html EWHC 860 (Admin)]&lt;/ref&gt; a small number of Roman Catholic bishops in England and Wales made claims that they might in future be prosecuted under the Equality Act 2010 for refusing to allow women, married men, transsexual people, and gay people into the priesthood.&lt;ref name="thebostonpilot1"&gt;[http://www.thebostonpilot.com/article.asp?ID=11224 English, Welsh bishops say Equality Bill redefines who can be priest]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=18231 |title=Equality Bill redefines who can be priest: UK Bishops |publisher=Cathnews.com |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=3 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103215847/http://cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=18231 |archivedate=3 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kirsty Walker |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1228643/Christmas-killed-Harmans-Equality-Bill-bishops-warn.html |title=Christmas could be killed off by Harman's Equality Bill, bishops warn |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= 18 November 2009|accessdate=3 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This claim was rejected by the government.  A spokesman said an exemption in the law "covers ministers of religion such as Catholic priests"&lt;ref name="thebostonpilot1"/&gt; and a document released by the Government Equalities Office states that "the Equality Bill will not change the existing legal position regarding churches and employment".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/pdf/Equality%20Bill%20and%20Religion%20for%20press%20and%20website%20(3).pdf |title=Myth-Busting: the Equality Bill and Religion |accessdate=10 January 2010 |format=PDF |publisher=Government Equalities Office |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mfNU5Tok?url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/pdf/Equality%20Bill%20and%20Religion%20for%20press%20and%20website%20%283%29.pdf |archivedate=10 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}  ''In the case of Ministers of Religion and other jobs which exist to promote and represent religion, the Bill recognises that a church may need to impose requirements regarding sexual orientation, sex, marriage and civil partnership or gender reassignment if it is necessary to comply with its teachings or the strongly held beliefs of followers. However, it would not be right to permit such requirements across all jobs within organised religions, such as administrators and accountants, and the Equality Bill makes this clear.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The legislation was also criticised by Anglican clergy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/news/?NewsID=5374 UK Government attacked over Equality Bil] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014070515/http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/news/?NewsID=5374 |date=14 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="94202">{{About|the five precepts in Buddhism|Taoism|Five Precepts (Taoism)}}
{{short description|System of morality in Buddhism}}
{{LayBuddhistPractices}}
The '''five precepts''' ({{lang-pi|italic=yes|pañcasīla}}; {{lang-sa|italic=yes|pañcaśīla}}) or '''five rules of training''' ({{lang-pi|pañcasikkhapada|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|pañcaśikṣapada|italic=yes}}{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9}}){{refn |group=note |Also spelled as ''pañcasīlani'' and ''pañcasikkhāpadani'', respectively.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=178}}}} is the most important system of morality for [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|Buddhist lay people]]. They constitute the basic code of [[Buddhist ethics|ethics]] undertaken by lay followers of Buddhism. The precepts are commitments to abstain from killing [[sentient being (Buddhism)|living beings]], stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and intoxication. Within the Buddhist doctrine, they are meant to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. They are sometimes referred to as the '''''[[śrāvakayāna]] precepts''''' in the [[Mahāyāna]] tradition, contrasting them with the [[bodhisattva Precepts|''bodhisattva'' precepts]]. The five precepts form the basis of several parts of Buddhist doctrine, both lay and monastic. With regard to their fundamental role in Buddhist ethics, they have been compared with the [[ten commandments]] in Christianity{{sfn |Keown |2013b |page=638}}{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=4}} or the [[li (Confucianism)|ethical codes]] of [[Confucianism]]. The precepts have been connected with [[utilitarianist]], [[deontological]] and [[virtue ethics|virtue]] approaches to ethics. They have been compared with human rights because of their universal nature, and some scholars argue they can complement the concept of human rights.

The five precepts were common to the religious milieu of 6th-century BCE India, but the Buddha's focus on [[Appamada|awareness]] through the fifth precept was unique. As shown in [[Early Buddhist Texts]], the precepts grew to be more important, and finally became a condition for membership of the Buddhist religion. When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries where Buddhism had to compete with other religions, such as China, the ritual of undertaking the five precepts developed into an initiation ceremony to become a Buddhist lay person. On the other hand, in countries with little competition from other religions, such as Thailand, the ceremony has had little relation to the rite of becoming Buddhist, as many people are presumed Buddhist from birth.

Undertaking and upholding the five precepts is based on the principle of [[ahimsa|non-harming]] ([[Pāli]] and {{lang-sa|ahiṃsa|italic=yes}}). The [[Pali Canon]] recommends one to compare oneself with others, and on the basis of that, not to hurt others. Compassion and a belief in [[karma (Buddhism)|karmic retribution]] form the foundation of the precepts. Undertaking the five precepts is part of regular lay devotional practice, both at home and at the local temple. However, the extent to which people keep them differs per region and time. People keep them with an intention to develop themselves, but also out of fear of a [[Buddhist cosmology|bad rebirth]].

The first precept consists of a prohibition of killing, both humans and all animals. Scholars have interpreted Buddhist texts about the precepts as an opposition to and prohibition of capital punishment,{{sfn |Alarid |Wang |2001 |pages=236{{en dash}}7}} suicide, abortion{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=213}}{{sfn |Perrett |2000 |page=110}} and euthanasia.{{sfn |Keown |2016b |page=170}} In practice, however, many Buddhist countries still use the death penalty. With regard to abortion, Buddhist countries take the middle ground, by condemning though not prohibiting it. The Buddhist attitude to violence is generally interpreted as opposing all warfare, but some scholars have raised exceptions. The second precept prohibits theft. The third precept refers to adultery in all its forms, and has been defined by modern teachers with terms such as ''sexual responsibility'' and ''long-term commitment''. The fourth precept involves falsehood spoken or committed to by action, as well as malicious speech, harsh speech and gossip. The fifth precept prohibits intoxication through alcohol, drugs or other means.{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}} Early Buddhist Texts nearly always condemn alcohol, and so do Chinese Buddhist post-canonical texts. Buddhist attitudes toward smoking differ per time and region, but are generally permissive. In modern times, traditional Buddhist countries have seen revival movements to promote the five precepts. As for the West, the precepts play a major role in Buddhist organizations. They have also been integrated in [[mindfulness]] training programs, though many mindfulness specialists do not support this because of the precepts' religious import. Lastly, many conflict prevention programs make use of the precepts.

Buddhist scriptures explain the five precepts as the minimal standard of Buddhist morality.{{sfn |Gowans |2013 |page=440}} It is the most important system of morality in Buddhism, together with the [[Patimokkha|monastic rules]].&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goodman |first1=Charles |title=Ethics in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708233552/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/ |archive-date=8 July 2010 |dead-url=no |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, [[Stanford University]] |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Śīla]]'' (Sanskrit; {{lang-pi|sīla|italic=yes}}) is used to refer to Buddhist precepts,{{sfn|Edelglass|2013|p=479}} including the five.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}} But the word also refers to the virtue and morality which lies at the foundation of the spiritual path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], which is the first of the [[Three Trainings|three forms of training]] on the path. Thus, the precepts are rules or guidelines to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]].{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}} The five precepts are part of the right speech, action and livelihood aspects of the [[eight-fold path]], the core teaching of Buddhism.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}{{sfn|Powers |2013 |loc=āryāṣtāṅga-mārga }}{{refn |group=note |The fifth precept has also been connected with [[right mindfulness]].{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}}}} Moreover, the practice of the five precepts and other parts of ''śīla'' are described as forms of [[merit-making]], means to create good [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]].{{sfn |Osto |2015}}{{sfn |McFarlane |1997}} The five precepts have been described as [[value (ethics)|social values]] that bring harmony to society,{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}}{{sfn |De Silva |2016 |page=79 }} and breaches of the precepts described as antithetical to a harmonious society.{{sfn |Keown |2012 |page=31}} On a smilar note, in Buddhist texts, the ideal, righteous society is one in which people keep five precepts.{{sfn |Tambiah |1992 |page=121}}
[[File:Dharmachakra, withprint (en).svg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The [[eight-fold path]], of which the five precepts are part.|alt=Wheel with eight spokes, with the different aspects of the Buddhist eight-fold written on them]]
Comparing different parts of Buddhist doctrine, the five precepts form the basis of the eight precepts, which are lay precepts stricter than the five precepts, similar to monastic precepts.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} Secondly, the five precepts form the first half of the [[bodhisattva Precepts|ten or eleven precepts]] for a [[bodhisattva|person aiming to become a Buddha]] (''[[bodhisattva]]''), as mentioned in the ''[[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahmajala Sūtra]]'' of the Mahāyāna tradition.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}{{sfn|Cozort |Shields |2018 |loc=Dōgen, The Bodhisattva Path according to the ''Ugra'' }}{{sfn |Funayama |2004 |page=98}} Contrasting these precepts with the five precepts, the latter were commonly referred to by Mahāyānists as the ''[[śrāvakayāna]]'' precepts, or the precepts of those aiming to become [[arhat|enlightened disciples]] of a Buddha, but not [[Buddha (title)|Buddhas]] themselves. The ten{{en dash}}eleven ''bodhisattva'' precepts presuppose the five precepts, and are partly based on them.{{sfn |Funayama|2004 |page=105}} The five precepts are also partly found in the teaching called the ten good courses of action, referred to in [[Theravāda]] ({{lang-pi|dasa-kusala-kammapatha|italic=yes}}) and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] ({{lang-sa |daśa-kuśala-karmapatha |italic=yes }}; {{bo|w=dge ba bcu|italic=yes}}).&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;{{sfn |Keown |2005 |loc=Precepts}} Finally, the first four of the five precepts are very similar to the [[parajika|most fundamental rules of monastic discipline]], and may have influenced their development.{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |page=173}}

In conclusion, the five precept lie at the foundation of all Buddhist practice, and in that respect, can be compared with the [[ten commandments]] in Christianity{{sfn |Keown |2013b |page=638}}{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=4}} or the [[li (Confucianism)|ethical codes]] of [[Confucianism]].{{sfn |Funayama |2004 |page=98}}

== History ==
[[File:Tang Dynasty circa 700 CE.png|thumb |In [[Tang Dynasty|8th-century China]], people held strict attitudes about abstinence of alcohol. |alt=Map marking part of China]]
The five precepts were part of [[early Buddhism]] and are common to nearly all schools of Buddhism.{{sfn|Keown |2003 |page=210 }} In early Buddhism, the five precepts were regarded as an ethic of restraint, to restrain unwholesome tendencies and thereby purify one's being to attain enlightenment.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |page=178}}{{sfn|Cozort |Shields |2018 |loc=Precepts in Early and Theravāda Buddhism}} The five precepts were based on the ''pañcaśīla'', prohibitions for pre-Buddhist [[Brahmanic]] priests, which were adopted in many Indic religions around 6th century BCE.{{sfn |Gombrich |2006 |page=78 }}{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pages=171, 173}} The first four Buddhist precepts were nearly identical to these ''pañcaśīla'', but the fifth precept, the prohibition on intoxication, was new in Buddhism:{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |page=173}}{{refn |group=note |The 6th century CE [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chāndogya Upaniśad]] contains four principles identical to the Buddhist precepts, but lying is not mentioned.{{sfn |Tachibana |1992 |p=58}} In contemporary [[Jainism]], the fifth principle became "appropriation of any sort".{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |page=173}}}} the Buddha's emphasis on [[appamada|awareness]] ({{lang-pi|appamāda|italic=yes |links=no}}) was unique.{{sfn |Gombrich |2006 |page=78 }}

In some schools of ancient Indic Buddhism, Buddhist devotees could choose to adhere to only a number of precepts, instead of the complete five. The schools that would survive in later periods, however, that is Theravāda and Mahāyāna Buddhism, were both ambiguous about this practice. Some early Mahāyāna texts allow it, but some do not; [[Pāli Canon|Theravāda texts]] do not discuss this practice at all.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=83}}

The prohibition on killing has motivated [[early Buddhism|early Buddhists]] to form a stance against animal sacrifice, a common ritual practice in ancient India.&lt;ref name="World Religions" /&gt;{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=273}} According to the Pāli Canon, however, early Buddhists did not adopt a vegetarian lifestyle.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=273}}

In [[Early Buddhist Texts]], the role of the five precepts gradually develops. First of all, the precepts are combined with a declaration of faith in the triple gem (the Buddha, [[dhamma|his teaching]] and [[sangha|the monastic community]]).&lt;!--173--&gt; Next, the precepts develop to become the foundation of lay practice.&lt;!--173-4--&gt;{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pp=173{{en dash}}4}} The precepts are seen a preliminary condition for the higher development of the mind.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=178}} At a third stage in the texts, the precepts are actually mentioned together with the triple gem, as though they are part of it. Lastly, the precepts, together with the triple gem, become a required condition for the practice of Buddhism, as lay people have to undergo a formal initiation to become a member of the Buddhist religion.{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |p=173}} When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries in which Buddhism was adopted as the main religion without much competition from other religious disciplines, such as Thailand, the relation between the initiation of a lay person and the five precepts has been virtually non-existent, and the taking of the precepts has become a sort of ritual cleansing ceremony. In such countries, people are presumed Buddhist from birth without much of an initiation. The precepts are often committed to by new followers as part of their installment, yet this is not very pronounced. However, in some countries like China, where Buddhism was not the only religion, the precepts became an ordination ceremony to initiate lay people into the Buddhist religion.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9, 205}}

In China, the five precepts were introduced in the first centuries CE,&lt;!--171, 176--&gt; both in their ''śrāvakayāna'' and ''bodhisattva'' formats.&lt;!--175--&gt;{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pages=171, 175{{en dash}}6}} During this time, it was particularly Buddhist teachers who promoted abstinence from alcohol (the fifth precept), since [[Daoism]] and other thought systems emphasized moderation rather than full abstinence. Chinese Buddhists interpreted the fifth precept strictly,&lt;!--p=223--&gt; even more so than in Indic Buddhism.&lt;!--p=226--&gt; For example, the monk [[Daoshi (Buddhist monk)|Daoshi]] ({{circa}} 600–83) dedicated large sections of [[Fayuan Zhulin|his encyclopedic writings]] to abstinence from alcohol.&lt;!--p=224--&gt; However, in some parts of China, such as [[Dunhuang]], considerable evidence has been found of alcohol consumption among both lay people and monastics.&lt;!--p=230--&gt; Later, from the 8th century onward, strict attitudes of abstinence led to a development of a distinct [[Chinese tea culture|tea culture]] among Chinese monastics and lay intellectuals, in which tea gatherings replaced gatherings with alcoholic beverages, and were advocated as such.&lt;!--214, 231--&gt;{{sfn |Benn |2005 |pages=214, 223{{en dash}}4, 226, 230{{en dash}}1}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}} These strict attitudes were formed partly because of the religious writings, but may also have been affected by the bloody [[An Lushan Rebellion]] of 775, which had a sobering effect on [[Tang dynasty|8th-century Chinese society]].{{sfn |Benn |2005 |page=231}} When the five precepts were integrated in Chinese society, they were associated and connected with karma,&lt;!--178--&gt; [[Wu Xing|Chinese cosmology]]&lt;!--176-7--&gt; and [[Chinese medicine|medicine]],&lt;!--184--&gt; a Daoist worldview,&lt;!--178--&gt; and [[Confucianism#Social morality and ethics|Confucian virtue ethics]].&lt;!--185--&gt;{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pages=176{{en dash}}8, 184{{en dash}}5}}

== Ceremonies ==
=== In Pāli tradition ===
[[File:Buddhist monks giving a teaching or blessing to lay people.jpg|thumb|In Thailand, a leading lay person will normally request the monk to administer the precepts.|alt=Asian person holding hands in prayer, facing two monks in brown robes.]]
In the Theravāda tradition, the precepts are recited in a standardized fashion, using [[Pāli language]]. In Thailand, a leading lay person will normally request the monk to administer the precepts by reciting the following three times:

{{blockquote |"Venerables, we request the five precepts and the [[three refuges]] [i.e. the triple gem] for the sake of observing them, one by one, separately". ({{lang|pi |Mayaṃ bhante visuṃ visuṃ rakkhaṇatthāya tisaraṇena saha pañca sīlāniyācāma.}}){{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=179{{en dash}}80}}}}

After this, the monk administering the precepts will recite a reverential line of text to introduce the ceremony, after which he guides the lay people in declaring that they take their refuge in the three refuges or triple gem.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=181}}

He then continues with reciting the five precepts:{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=67}}{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}}
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from onslaught on breathing beings." ({{lang-pi |Pāṇātipātā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes}})
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from taking what is not given." ({{lang-pi |Adinnādānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes}})
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from misconduct concerning sense-pleasures." ({{lang-pi |Kāmesumicchācāra veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes}})
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from false speech." ({{lang-pi |Musāvādā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes}})
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from alcoholic drink or drugs that are an opportunity for heedlessness." ({{lang-pi |Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes }})

In the fifth precept ''[[Sura (alcoholic beverage)|sura]]'', ''meraya'' and ''majja'' are kinds of alcoholic beverages. In some modern translations, ''Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā'', is rendered more broadly, variously, as, ''intoxicants'' or ''liquor and drugs'', etc.&lt;!--not sourced, but not contentious--&gt;

After the lay people have repeated the five precepts after the monk, the monk will close the ceremony reciting:

{{blockquote |"These five precepts lead with good behavior to bliss, with good behavior to wealth and success, they lead with good behavior to happiness, therefore purify behavior." ({{lang|pi |Imāni pañca sikkhāpadāni. Sīlena sugatiṃ yanti, sīlena bhogasampadā, sīlena nibbutiṃ yanti, tasmā sīlaṃ visodhaye.}}){{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=182}}}}

One formula of the precepts can be found in the ''Treatise on Taking Refuge and the Precepts'' ({{zh|s=归戒要集|t=歸戒要集|p=Guījiè Yāojí}}):

# As all Buddhas refrained from killing until the end of their lives, so I too will refrain from killing until the end of my life.
# As all Buddhas refrained from stealing until the end of their lives, so I too will refrain from stealing until the end of my life.
# As all Buddhas refrained from sexual misconduct until the end of their lives, so I too will refrain from sexual misconduct until the end of my life.
# As all Buddhas refrained from false speech until the end of their lives, so I too will refrain from false speech until the end of my life.
# As all Buddhas refrained from alcohol until the end of their lives, so I too will refrain from alcohol until the end of my life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=X60n1129_002 歸戒要集 第2卷 |url=http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/X60n1129_002?format=line&amp;linehead=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824071744/http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/X60n1129_002?format=line&amp;linehead=yes |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |website=CBETA 電子佛典集成 |publisher=Cbeta.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūla-Sarvāstivāda]] texts used in Tibetan Buddhism, the precepts are formulated such that one takes the precepts upon oneself for one's entire lifespan, following the examples of the enlightened disciples of the Buddha (''[[arahant]]'').{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=67 }}

The five precepts can be found in many places in the Early Buddhist Texts.{{sfn |Tedesco |2004 |p=91 }} The precepts are regarded as means to building good character, or as an expression of such character. The Pāli Canon describes them as means to avoid harm to oneself and others.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2017|page=2}} It further describes them as gifts toward oneself and others.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=66 }} Moreover, the texts say that people who uphold them will be confident in any gathering of people,&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;{{sfn |Tachibana |1992 |p=63}} will have wealth and a good reputation, and will die a peaceful death, reborn in heaven{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=67 }}{{sfn |Tachibana |1992 |p=63}} or as a [[Human beings in Buddhism|human being]]. On the other hand, living a life in violation of the precepts is believed to lead to rebirth in an [[Naraka (Buddhism)|unhappy destination]].&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt; They are understood as principles that define a person as human in body and mind.{{sfn |Wai |2002 |page=2}}

The precepts are normative rules, but are formulated and understood as "undertakings"{{sfn |Gombrich |2006 |page=66 }} rather than commandments enforced by a moral authority,{{sfn|Keown |2003 |page=268 }}{{sfn |Meadow |2006 |p=88 }} according to the voluntary and [[gradualism#Buddhism and other Oriental philosophies|gradualist]] standards of Buddhist ethics.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}} They are forms of restraint formulated in negative terms, but are also accompanied by virtues and positive behaviors,{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}}{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} which are cultivated through the practice of the precepts.{{sfn|Edelglass|2013|p=479}}{{refn |This dual meaning in negative formulations is typical for an Indic language like [[Sanskrit]].{{sfn |Keown |1998 |pages=399{{en dash}}400}}|group=note}} The most important of these virtues is [[ahimsa|non-harming]] ([[Pāli]] and {{lang-sa|ahiṃsa|italic=yes}}),&lt;ref name="World Religions"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ahiṃsā |date=1997 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |encyclopedia=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions |via=Encyclopedia.com |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/eastern-religions/hinduism/ahimsa |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824071832/https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/eastern-religions/hinduism/ahimsa |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Keown|2013a |page=616}} which underlies all of the five precepts.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}{{refn |group=note |However, anthropologist [[Melford Spiro]] argued that the fundamental virtue behind the precepts was [[mettā|loving-kindness]], not "the Hindu notion of non-violence".{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=45}}}} Precisely, the texts say that one should keep the precepts, adhering to the principle of comparing oneself with others:{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pages=33, 71 }}
{{blockquote|"For a state that is not pleasant or delightful to me must be so to him also; and a state that is not pleasing or delightful to me, how could I inflict that upon another?"{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=33 }}}}

In other words, all living beings are alike in that they want to be happy and not suffer. Comparing oneself with others, one should therefore not hurt others as one would not want to be hurt.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=120}} Ethicist Pinit Ratanakul argues that the compassion which motivates upholding the precepts comes from an understanding that all living beings are equal and of a nature that they are '[[anatman|not-self]]' ({{lang-pi|anattā|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Ratanakul |2007 |page=241 }} Another aspect that is fundamental to this is the belief in karmic retribution.{{sfn |Horigan |1996 |page=276}}
[[File:Amber.pendants.800pix.050203.jpg|thumb|upright=.8 |A layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a "jewel among laymen". |alt=Two pendants of amber]]
In the upholding or violation of the precepts, [[cetana|intention]] is crucial.{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=275}}{{sfn |Keown |1998 |page=386}} In the Pāli scriptures, an example is mentioned of a person stealing an animal only to [[life release|set it free]], which was not seen as an [[parajika|offense of theft]].{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=275}} In the Pāli [[atthakatha|commentaries]], a precept is understood to be violated when the person violating it finds the object of the transgression (e.g. things to be stolen), is aware of the violation, has the intention to violate it, does actually act on that intention, and does so successfully.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=139 }}

Upholding the precepts is sometimes distinguished in three levels: to uphold them without having formally undertaken them; to uphold them formally, willing to sacrifice one's own life for it; and finally, to spontaneously uphold them.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=141 }} The latter refers to the ''arahant'', who is understood to be morally incapable of violating the first four precepts.{{sfn|Keown |2003 |page=1}} A layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a "jewel among laymen".{{sfn |De Silva |2016 |page=63 }} On the other hand, the most serious violations of the precepts are the [[Anantarika-karma|five actions of immediate retribution]], which are believed to lead the perpetrator to an unavoidable rebirth in [[hell (Buddhism)|hell]]. These consist of injuring a Buddha, killing an ''arahant'', killing one's father or mother, and causing the monastic community to have a schism.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}

== Practice in general ==
Lay followers often undertake these training rules in the same ceremony as they [[taking refuge|take the refuges]].{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Festivals and Calendrical Rituals |date=2004 |publisher=[[The Gale Group]] |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/festivals-and-calendrical-rituals |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/71uE0BBbB |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |via=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monks administer the precepts to the laypeople, which creates an additional psychological effect.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}} Buddhist lay people may recite the precepts regularly at home, and before an important ceremony at the temple to prepare the mind for the ceremony.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}}
[[File:Thich Nhat Hanh 12.jpg|thumb |left |upright=.5 |[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] has written about the five precepts in a wider scope, with regard to social and institutional relations.|alt=Asian monk smiling]]
The five precepts are at the core of Buddhist morality.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}} In field studies in some countries like Sri Lanka, villagers describe them as the core of the religion.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}} Anthropologist {{ill |Barend Terwiel|de|Barend Jan Terwiel}} found in his fieldwork that most Thai villagers knew the precepts by heart, and many, especially the elderly, could explain the implications of the precepts following traditional interpretations.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=183}}

Nevertheless, Buddhists do not all follow them with the same strictness.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}} Devotees who have just started keeping the precepts will typically have to exercise considerable restraint. When they become used to the precepts, they start to embody them more naturally.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2017|page=10}} Researchers doing field studies in traditional Buddhist societies have found that the five precepts are generally considered demanding and challenging.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=286 }} For example, in a 1997 survey in Thailand, only 13.8% of the respondents indicated they adhered to the five precepts in their daily lives, with the fourth and fifth precept least likely to be adhered to.{{sfn |Ariyabuddhiphongs |2009 |page=193}} Yet, people do consider the precepts worth striving for, and do uphold them out of fear of bad karma and being reborn in [[hell (Buddhism)|hell]], or because they believe in that the Buddha issued these rules, and that they therefore should be maintained.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=188}}{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=449}} Anthropologist [[Melford Spiro]] found that Burmese Buddhists mostly upheld the precepts to avoid bad karma, as opposed to expecting to gain good karma.{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |pp=99, 102}} Religion scholar Winston King observed from his field studies that the moral principles of Burmese Buddhists were based on personal self-developmental motives rather than other-regarding motives. Religion scholar Richard Jones concludes that the moral motives of Buddhists in adhering to the precepts are based on the idea that renouncing self-service, ironically, serves oneself.{{sfn |Jones |1979 |p=374}}

In East Asian Buddhism, the precepts are intrinsically connected with the initiation as a Buddhist lay person.&lt;!--81--&gt; Early Chinese translations such as the ''Upāsaka-śila Sūtra'' hold that the precepts should only be ritually transmitted by a monastic.&lt;!--80--&gt; The texts describe that in the ritual the power of the Buddhas and ''bodhisattvas'' is transmitted, and helps the initiate to keep the precepts.&lt;!--81--&gt; This "lay ordination" ritual usually occurs after a stay in a temple, and often after a [[upasampada|monastic ordination]] has taken place. The ordained lay person is then given a [[Dharma name|religious name]]. The restrictions that apply are similar to a monastic ordination, such as permission from parents.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=80{{en dash}}1}}

In the Theravāda tradition, the precepts are usually taken "each separately" ({{lang-pi|visuṃ visuṃ|italic=yes|link=no}}), to indicate that if one precept should be broken, the other precepts are still intact. In very solemn occasions, or for very pious devotees, the precepts may be taken as a group rather than each separately.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=82}}{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=180}} This does not mean, however, that only some of the precepts can be undertaken; they are always committed to as a complete set.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=82{{en dash}}3}} In East Asian Buddhism, however, the vow of taking the precepts is considered a solemn matter, and it is not uncommon for lay people to undertake only the precepts that they are confident they can keep.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=83}} The act of taking a vow to keep the precepts is what makes it karmically effective: Spiro found that someone who did not violate the precepts, but did not have any intention to keep them either, was not believed to accrue any religious merit. On the other hand, when people took a vow to keep the precepts, and then broke them afterwards, the negative karma was considered larger as in the case no vow was taken to keep the precepts.{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=217}}

Several modern teachers such as [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] and [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] have written about the five precepts in a wider scope, with regard to social and institutional relations. In these perspectives, mass production of weapons or spreading untruth through media and education also violate the precepts.{{sfn |Queen |2013 |page=532}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Engaged Buddhism |date=2005 |publisher=[[Thomson Gale]] |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/engaged-buddhism |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/71uE9MCNL |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |via=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a similar note, human rights organizations in Southeast Asia have attempted to advocate respect for human rights by referring to the five precepts as guiding principles.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=154}}

[[File:Haft.jpg|thumb|The first of the five precepts includes abstention from killing small animals such as insects.|alt=Mayfly on human finger]]
The first precept prohibits the taking of life of a [[sentient being (Buddhism)|sentient being]].

Killing a large animal is worse than killing a small animal&lt;!--272--&gt;&lt;!--Harvey--&gt; (also because it costs more effort); killing a spiritually accomplished master is regarded as more severe than the killing of another "more average" human being;&lt;!--p=272--&gt; and killing a human being is more severe than the killing an animal.&lt;!--Harvey--&gt; But all killing is condemned.&lt;!--p=272--&gt;{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=139 }}{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|pages=271–2}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=156}} Virtues that accompany this precept are respect for dignity of life,{{sfn|Keown|2013a |page=616}} [[metta|kindness]] and [[karuṇā|compassion]],{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} the latter expressed as "trembling for the welfare of others".{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=68}} A positive behavior that goes together with this precept is protecting living beings.{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}} Positive virtues like sympathy and respect for other living beings in this regard are based on a belief in the [[samsara|cycle of rebirth]]{{em dash}}that all living beings must be born and reborn.{{sfn |Wai|2002|p=293}} The concept of the fundamental [[Buddha nature]] of all human beings also underlies the first precept.{{sfn |Horigan |1996 |page=275}}

The description of the first precept can be interpreted as a prohibition of capital punishment.{{sfn |Alarid |Wang |2001 |pages=236{{en dash}}7}} Suicide is also seen as part of the prohibition.{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=11}} Moreover, abortion goes against the precept, since in an act of abortion, the criteria for violation are all met.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=313{{en dash}}4}} In Buddhism, human life is understood to start at conception.{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=206}} A prohibition of abortion is mentioned explicitly in the monastic precepts,&lt;!--164--&gt; and several Buddhist tales warn of the harmful [[karma (Buddhism)|karmic]] consequences of abortion.&lt;!--157-63--&gt;{{sfn |Mcdermott |2016 |pp=157{{en dash}}64}}{{sfn |Perrett |2000 |page=101}} Bioethicist [[Damien Keown]] argues that Early Buddhist Texts do not allow for exceptions with regard to abortion, as they consist of a "consistent' (i.e. exceptionless) pro-life position".{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=209}}{{sfn |Perrett |2000 |page=110}} Keown further proposes that that a middle way approach to the five precepts is logically hard to defend.{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=205}} Asian studies scholar Giulo Agostini argues, however, that Buddhist commentators in India from the 4th century onward thought abortion did not break the precepts under certain circumstances.{{sfn |Agostini |2004 |pages=77{{en dash}}8}}

Ordering another person to kill is also included in this precept,{{sfn |Keown |2016b |page=170}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=69}} therefore requesting or administering euthanasia can be considered a violation of the precept,{{sfn |Keown |2016b |page=170}} as well as advising another person to commit abortion.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=314}} With regard to [[euthanasia]] and [[assisted suicide]], Keown quotes the Pāli ''[[Digha Nikaya|Dīgha Nikāya]]'' that says a person upholding the first precept "does not kill a living being, does not cause a living being to be killed, does not approve of the killing of a living being".{{sfn |Keown |1998 |p=400}} Keown argues that in Buddhist ethics, regardless of motives, death can never be the aim of one's actions.{{sfn |Keown |1998 |p=402}}

Interpretations of how Buddhist texts regard warfare are varied, but in general Buddhist doctrine is considered to oppose all warfare. In many ''Jātaka'' tales, such as that of [[Adhiṭṭhāna#Temiya the Wise|Prince Temiya]], as well as some historical documents, the virtue of non-violence is taken as an opposition to all war, both offensive and defensive.&lt;!--51-2--&gt; At the same time, though, the Buddha is often shown not to explicitly oppose war in his conversations with political figures. Buddhologist [[André Bareau]] points out that the Buddha was reserved in his involvement of the details of administrative policy, and concentrated on the moral and spiritual development of his disciples instead.&lt;!--50--&gt; He may have believed such involvement to be futile, or detrimental to Buddhism.&lt;!--51--&gt; Nevertheless, at least one disciple of the Buddha is mentioned in the texts who refrained from retaliating his enemies because of the Buddha, that is King [[Pasenadi]] ({{lang-sa|Prasenajit|link=no}}). The texts are ambiguous in explaining his motives though.&lt;!--51--&gt;{{sfn |Schmithausen |1999 |pages=50{{en dash}}2}} In some later Mahāyāna texts, such as in the writings of [[Asaṅga]], examples are mentioned of people who kill those who persecute Buddhists.{{sfn |Schmithausen |1999 |pages=57{{en dash}}59}}{{sfn |Jones |1979 |p=380}} In these examples, killing is justified by the authors because protecting Buddhism was seen as more important than keeping the precepts.&lt;!--380--&gt; Another example that is often cited is that of King [[Dutthagamani|Duṭṭhagāmaṇī]], who is mentioned in the post-canonical Pāli [[Mahavamsa|Mahāvaṃsa]] chronicle.

[[File:Vegmark.PNG|thumb|In Buddhism, there are different opinions about whether vegetarianism should be practiced.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} |alt=Signals used to indicate vegetarian or non-vegetarian food]]
Field studies in Cambodia and Burma have shown that many Buddhists considered the first precept the most important, or the most blamable.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=69}} In some traditional communities, such as in [[Kandal Province]] in pre-war Cambodia, as well as Burma in the 1980s, it was uncommon for Buddhists to slaughter animals, to the extent that meat had to be bought from not-Buddhists.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}}{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=45}} In his field studies in Thailand in the 1960s, Terwiel found that villagers did tend to kill insects, but were reluctant and self-conflicted with regard to killing larger animals.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=186}} In Spiro's field studies, however, Burmese villagers were highly reluctant even to kill insects.{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=45}}

Early Buddhists did not adopt a [[vegetarianism in Buddhism|vegetarian lifestyle]].&lt;!--cited above--&gt; Indeed, in several Pāli [[sutra|texts]] vegetarianism is described as irrelevant in the spiritual purification of the mind. There are prohibitions on certain types of meat, however, especially those which are condemned by society.&lt;!--p=274--&gt; The idea of abstaining from killing animal life has also led to a prohibition on professions that involve trade in flesh or living beings, but not to a full prohibition of all agriculture that involves cattle.&lt;!--p=276--&gt;{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|pages=273–4, 276}} In modern times, referring to the [[law of supply and demand]] or other principles, some Theravādin Buddhists have attempted to promote vegetarianism as part of the five precepts. For example, the Thai [[Santi Asoke]] movement practices vegetarianism.{{sfn |Meadow |2006 |p=88 }}{{sfn |Swearer |2010 |page=177}}

Furthermore, among some schools of Buddhism, there has been some debate with regard to a principle in the monastic discipline. This principle states that a Buddhist monk cannot accept meat if it comes from animals especially slaughtered for him. Some teachers have interpreted this to mean that when the recipient has no knowledge on whether the animal has been killed for him, he cannot accept the food either. Similarly, there has been debate as to whether laypeople should be vegetarian when adhering to the five precepts.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} Though vegetarianism among Theravādins is generally uncommon, it has been practiced much in East Asian countries,{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} as some Mahāyāna texts, such as the ''[[Mahaparinirvana Sutra|Mahāparanirvana Sūtra]]'' and the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'', condemn the eating of meat.{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Kieschnick |2005 |page=196}} Nevertheless, even among Mahāyāna Buddhists{{em dash}}and East Asian Buddhists{{em dash}}there is disagreement on whether vegetarianism should be practiced. In the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'', biological, social and hygienic reasons are given for a vegetarian diet; however, historically, a major factor in the development of a vegetarian lifestyle among Mahāyāna communities may have been that Mahāyāna monastics cultivated their own crops for food, rather than living from [[alms#Buddhism|alms]].{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=Ahiṃsa and Samādhi}} Already from the 4th century CE, Chinese writer [[Xi Chao]] understood the five precepts to include vegetarianism.{{sfn |Kieschnick |2005 |page=196}}

[[File:Dalai Lama 1430 Luca Galuzzi 2007crop.jpg|thumb |upright=.6 |The [[Dalai Lama]] has rejected forms of protest that are self-harming.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}}|alt=The Dalai Lama]]
Apart from trade in flesh or living beings, there are also other professions considered undesirable. Vietnamese teacher Thich Nhat Hanh gives a list of examples, such as working in the arms industry, the military, police, producing or selling poison or drugs such as alcohol and tobacco.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=341 }}

In general, the first precept has been interpreted by Buddhists as a call for non-violence and pacifism. But there have been some exceptions of people who did not interpret the first precept as an opposition to war. For example, in the twentieth century, some Japanese Zen teachers wrote in support of violence in war, and some of them argued this should be seen as a means to uphold the first precept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title={{nowrap|Religions - }}Buddhism: War |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/war.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824071857/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/war.shtml |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |website=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate and controversy surrounding the problem whether a person can commit suicide, such as [[self-immolation]], to reduce other people's suffering in the long run, such as in protest to improve a political situation in a country. Teachers like the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Lu Sheng-Yen|Shengyan]] have rejected forms of protest like self-immolation, as well as other acts of self-harming or fasting as forms of protest.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}}

Although capital punishment goes against the first precept, as of 2001, many countries in Asia still maintained the death penalty, including Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and Taiwan.&lt;!--239-41--&gt; In some Buddhist countries, such as Sri Lanka and Thailand, capital punishment was applied during some periods, while during other periods no capital punishment was used at all.&lt;!--239--&gt; In other countries with Buddhism, like China and Taiwan, Buddhism, or any religion for that matter, has had no influence in policy decisions of the government.&lt;!--240-1--&gt; Countries with Buddhism that have abolished capital punishment include Cambodia and Hong Kong.&lt;!--244 n.1--&gt;{{sfn |Alarid |Wang |2001 |pages=239{{en dash}}41, 244 n.1}}

In general, Buddhist traditions oppose abortion.{{sfn |Agostini |2004 |pages=77{{en dash}}8}} In many countries with Buddhist traditions such as Thailand, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, however, abortion is a widespread practice, whether legal or not.&lt;!--101--&gt; Many people in these countries consider abortion immoral, but also think it should be less prohibited. Ethicist Roy W. Perrett, following Ratanakul, argues that this field research data does not so much indicate hypocrisy, but rather points at a "middle way" in applying Buddhist doctrine to solve a [[moral dilemma]]. Buddhists tend to take "both sides" on the pro-life{{en dash}}pro-choice debate, being against the taking of life of a fetus in principle, but also believing in compassion toward mothers. Similar attitudes may explain the Japanese ''[[mizuko kuyō]]'' ceremony, a Buddhist memorial service for aborted children,&lt;!--102--&gt; which has led to a debate in Japanese society concerning abortion, and finally brought the Japanese to a consensus that abortion should not be taken lightly, though it should be legalized.&lt;!--103, 109--&gt; This position, held by Japanese Buddhists, takes the middle ground between the Japanese [[Shinto#Post-war|neo-Shinto]] "pro-life" position, and the [[Sex-positive feminism|liberationist]], "pro-choice" arguments.{{sfn |Perrett |2000 |pages=101{{en dash}}3, 109}} Keown points out, however, that this compromise does not mean a Buddhist [[middle way]] between two extremes, but rather incorporates two opposite perspectives.{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=205}} In Thailand, women who wish to have abortion usually do so in the early stages of pregnancy, because they believe the karmic consequences are less then. Having had abortion, Thai women usually make merits to compensate for the negative karma.{{sfn |Ratanakul |1998 |p=57}}

== Second precept ==
=== Textual analysis ===
[[File:Bribe.png|thumb|alt=One hand giving money to another hand, held behind a back.|Studies discovered that people who did not adhere to the five precepts more often tended to pay bribes.]]
The second precept prohibits theft, and involves the intention to steal what one perceives as not belonging to oneself ("what is not given") and acting successfully upon that intention. The severity of the act of theft is judged by the worth of the owner and the worth of that which is stolen. Underhand dealings, fraud, cheating and forgery are also included in this precept.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=139 }}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=70}} Accompanying virtues are [[dana (Buddhism)|generosity]], [[nekkhamma|renunciation]],{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} and [[right livelihood]],{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=3}} and a positive behavior is the protection of other people's property.{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}}

== Third precept ==
=== Textual analysis ===
The third precept condemns adultery with women that are "claimed" or "acquired", or, in other words, it condemns "going with the wife of another". The precept also includes women who are engaged with another man, young women that are still "protected by any relative", and women who are prostitutes. Moreover, rape and incest are also breaches of this precept.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=71{{en dash}}2}} In later texts, details such as intercourse at an inappropriate time or inappropriate place are also counted as breaches of the third precept.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=73}} Masturbation goes against the spirit of the precept, though in the early texts it is not prohibited for laypeople.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=140 }}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=72}}

The third precept is explained as leading to greed in oneself and harm to others. The transgression is regarded as more severe if the other person is a good person.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=140 }}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=72}} Virtues that go hand-in-hand with the third precept are contentment, especially with one's partner,{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=68}} and recognition and respect for faithfulness in a marriage.{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}}

The third precept is interpreted as avoiding to harm another by using sensuality in the wrong way. This means not engaging with inappropriate partners, but also respecting one's personal commitment to a relationship.{{sfn |Meadow |2006 |p=88 }} In some traditions, the precept also condemns adultery with a woman when her husband agrees with the act, since the nature of the act itself is condemned.&lt;!--only Harvey--&gt; Furthermore, flirting with a married woman may also be regarded as a violation.&lt;!--both--&gt;{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=183}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=71{{en dash}}2}} Though prostitution is discouraged in the third precept, it is usually not actively prohibited by Buddhist teachers.{{sfn |Derks |1998}} With regard to applications of the principles of the third precept, the precept, or any Buddhist principle for that matter, is usually not connected with a stance against contraception.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{cite book |title=Eugenics and Religious Law: IV.

In the interpretation of modern teachers, the precept includes any person in a sexual relationship with another person, as they define the precept by terms such as ''sexual responsibility'' and ''long-term commitment''.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=71{{en dash}}2}} Some modern teachers include masturbation as a violation of the precept,{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=74}} others include certain professions, such as those that involve sexual exploitation, prostitution or pornography, and professions that promote unhealthy sexual behavior, such as in the entertainment industry.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=342 }}

== Fourth precept ==
=== Textual analysis ===
[[File:Woman working behind computer.jpg|thumb|alt=Woman working behind computer.|thumb |Work that involves online scams can also be included as a violation of the fourth precept.]]

The fourth precept involves falsehood spoken or committed to by action.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=140 }} Avoiding other forms of wrong speech are also considered part of this precept, consisting of malicious speech, harsh speech and gossip.{{sfn |Segall |2003 |page=169}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=74, 76}} A breach of the precept is considered more serious if the falsehood is motivated by an ulterior motive{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=140 }} (rather than, for example, "a small white lie").{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=75}} The accompanying virtue is [[Sacca#Truth as an ethical practice|being honest]] and dependable,{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=68}} and involves honesty in work, truthfulness to others, loyalty to superiors and gratitude to benefactors.{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=3}} In Buddhist texts, this precept is considered most important next to the first precept, because a lying person is regarded to have no shame, and therefore capable of many wrongs.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=74}} Untruthfulness is not only to be avoided because it harms others, but also because it goes against the Buddhist ideal of finding the [[truth in Buddhism|truth]].{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=75}}{{sfn |Wai |2002|p=295}}

Nevertheless, he did describe certain cases when drinking was considered less of a problem, such as in the case of a queen distracting the king by alcohol to prevent him from murder.&lt;!--page=224--&gt; However, Daoshi was generally strict in his interpretations: for example, he allowed medicinal use of alcohol only in extreme cases.&lt;!--p=227--&gt;{{sfn |Benn |2005 |pages=224, 227}} Early Chinese translations of the [[Tripitaka]] describe negative consequences for people breaking the fifth precept, for themselves and their families. The Chinese translation of the ''Upāsikaśila Sūtra'', as well as the Pāli version of the [[Sigalovada Sutta|Sigālovāda Sutta]], speak of ill consequences such as loss of wealth, ill health, a bad reputation and "stupidity", concluding in a rebirth in hell.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}}{{sfn |Benn |2005 |page=225}} The ''[[Dīrghāgama]]'' adds to that that alcohol leads to quarreling, negative states of mind and damage to one's intelligence.&lt;!--p=225--&gt; The Mahāyāna ''[[Brahmajala Sutra|Brahmajāla Sūtra]]''{{refn |Not to be confused with the early Buddhist [[Brahmajala Sutta]]. |group=note}} describes the dangers of alcohol in very strong terms, including the selling of alcohol.&lt;!--p=226--&gt;{{sfn |Benn |2005 |pages=225{{en dash}}6}} Similar arguments against alcohol can be found in [[Nāgārjuna]]'s writings.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=78}} The strict interpretation of prohibition of alcohol consumption can be supported by the ''Upāli Sūtra''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s statement that a disciple of the Buddha should not drink any alcohol, "even a drop on the point of a blade of grass".&lt;!--p=78--&gt; However, in the writing of some [[Abhidharma]] commentators, consumption was condemned or condoned, depending on the intention with which alcohol was consumed.&lt;!--78-9--&gt;{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=78{{en dash}}9}}

As for the fifth precept, this is regarded as important, because drinking alcohol is condemned for the sluggishness and lack of self-control it leads to,{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=275}}{{sfn |Tachibana |1992 |p=62}} which might lead to breaking the other precepts.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}} In Spiro's field studies, violating the fifth precept was seen as the worst of all the five precepts by half of the monks interviewed, citing the harmful consequences.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}} Nevertheless, in practice it is often disregarded by lay people.{{sfn |Neumaier |2006 |page=78}} In Thailand, drinking alcohol is fairly common, even drunkenness.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=185}} Among Tibetans, drinking beer is common, though this is only slightly alcoholic.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=78}} Medicinal use of alcohol is generally not frowned upon,{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=298 }} and in some countries like Thailand and Laos, smoking is usually not regarded as a violation of the precept. Thai and Laotian monks have been known to smoke, though monks who have received more training are less likely to smoke.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}}{{sfn |Vanphanom |Phengsavanh |Hansana |Menorath |2009 |page=100}} On a similar note, as of 2000, no Buddhist country prohibited the sale or consumption of alcohol, though in Sri Lanka Buddhist revivalists attempted unsuccessfully to get a full prohibition passed in 1956.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}} Moreover, pre-Communist Tibet used to prohibit smoking in some areas of the capital. Monks were prohibited from smoking, and the import of tobacco was banned.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}}

Thich Nhat Hanh also includes the aspect of mindful consumption in this precept, which consists of unhealthy food, unhealthy entertainment and unhealthy conversations, among others.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=342 }}{{sfn |Kaza |2000 |page=24}}

== Present trends ==
[[File:Desiré Oliveros - P1130527.jpg|thumb|upright |Some scholars have proposed that the five precepts be introduced as a component in mindfulness training programs. |alt=Woman giving a workshop in a classroom]]
In modern times, adherence to the precepts among Buddhists is less strict than it traditionally was. This is especially true for the third precept. For example, in Cambodia in the 1990s and 2000s, standards with regard to sexual restraint were greatly relaxed.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=153}} Some Buddhist movements and communities have tried to go against the modern trend of less strict adherence to the precepts. In Cambodia, a [[Faith in Buddhism#Millenarianism|millenarian movement]] led by [[Chan Yipon]] promoted the revival of the five precepts.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=153}} And in the 2010s, the [[Supreme Sangha Council]] in Thailand ran a nationwide program called "[[Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen#Teachings|The Villages Practicing the Five Precepts]]", aiming to encourage keeping the precepts, with an extensive classification and reward system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=15 October 2013 |work=[[Khao Sod]] |publisher=Matichon Publishing |page=31 |language=th |script-title=สมเด็จวัดปากน้ำชงหมูบ้านรักษาศีล 5 ให้อปท.ชวนประชาชนยึดปฎิบัติ |trans-title=Wat Paknam's Somdet proposes the Five Precept Village for local administrators to persuade the public to practice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=39 ล้านคนร่วมหมู่บ้านศีล 5 สมเด็จพระมหารัชมังคลาจารย์ ย้ำทำต่อเนื่อง|trans-title=39 million people have joined ''Villages Practicing Five Precepts'', Somdet Phra Maharatchamangalacharn affirms it should be continued|url=https://www.thairath.co.th/content/969738|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121085832/https://www.thairath.co.th/content/969738|archive-date=21 November 2017|deadurl=no|work=[[Thai Rath]]|publisher=Wacharapol|date=11 March 2017|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Western Buddhist organizations, the five precepts play a major role in developing ethical guidelines.{{sfn |Bluck |2006 |page=193}} Furthermore, Buddhist teachers such as [[Philip Kapleau]], Thich Nhat Hanh and [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]] have promoted mindful consumption in the West, based on the five precepts.{{sfn |Kaza |2000 |page=24}} In another development in the West, some scholars working in the field of [[mindfulness]] training have proposed that the five precepts be introduced as a component in such trainings. Specifically, to prevent organizations from using mindfulness training to further an economical agenda with harmful results to its employees, the economy or the environment, the precepts could be used as a standardized ethical framework.&lt;!--p=957--&gt; As of 2015, several training programs made explicit use of the five precepts as secular, ethical guidelines.&lt;!--pp=958-9--&gt; However, many mindfulness training specialists consider it problematic to teach the five precepts as part of training programs in secular contexts because of their religious origins and import.&lt;!--pp=965-6--&gt;{{sfn |Baer |2015 |pages=957{{en dash}}9, 965{{en dash}}6}}

[[peace and conflict studies|Peace studies]] scholar Theresa Der-lan Yeh notes that the five precepts address physical, economical, familial and verbal aspects of interaction, and remarks that many conflict prevention programs in schools and communities have integrated the five precepts in their curriculum. On a similar note, peace studies founder [[Johan Galtung]] describes the five precepts as the "basic contribution of Buddhism in the creation of peace".{{sfn |Yeh |2006 |p=100}}

Studying lay and monastic ethical practice in traditional Buddhist societies, Spiro argued ethical guidelines such as the five precepts are adhered to as a means to a higher end, that is, a better rebirth or enlightenment. He therefore concluded that Buddhist ethical principles like the five precepts are similar to Western [[utilitarianism]].{{sfn |Buswell |2004}} Keown, however, has argued that the five precepts are regarded as rules that cannot be violated, and therefore may indicate a [[deontological]] perspective in Buddhist ethics.{{sfn|Keown|2013a |page=618}}{{sfn |Keown |2013b |page=643}} On the other hand, he has suggested that Aristoteles' [[virtue ethics]] could apply as well, since the precepts are considered good in themselves, and mutually dependent on other aspects of the Buddhist path of practice.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}}{{sfn|Edelglass|2013|p=481}}

=== Comparison with human rights ===
Keown has further argued that the five precepts are very similar to human rights, with regard to subject matter and with regard to their universal nature.{{sfn |Keown |2012 |pages=31{{en dash}}4}} Other scholars, as well as Buddhist writers and human rights advocates, have drawn similar comparisons.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |pages=540{{en dash}}1}}{{sfn |Seeger |2010 |p=78}} For example, the following comparisons are drawn:
# Keown compares the first precept with the [[right to life]].{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=33}} The Buddhism-informed Cambodian Institute for Human Rights (CIHR) draws the same comparison.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=540}}
# The second precept is compared by Keown and the CIHR with the right of property.{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=33}}{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=540}}
# The third precept is compared by Keown to the "right to fidelity in marriage";{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=33}} the CIHR construes this broadly as "right of individuals and the rights of society".{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}
# The fourth precept is compared by Keown with the "right not to be lied to";{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=33}} the CIHR writes "the right of human dignity".{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}
# Finally, the fifth precept is compared by the CIHR with the right of individual security and a safe society.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}

Keown summarizes the relationship between Buddhist precepts and human rights as "look[ing] both ways along the juridical relationship, both what one is due to do, and to what is due to one".{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=21}} On a similar note, Cambodian human rights advocates have argued that for human rights to be fully implemented in society, the strengthening of individual morality must also be addressed.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}} Buddhist monk and scholar [[P.A. Payutto|Phra Payutto]] sees the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Human Rights Declaration]] as an unfolding and detailing of the principles that are found in the five precepts, in which a sense of ownership is given to the individual, to make legitimate claims on one's rights.&lt;!--78--&gt; He believes that human rights should be seen as a part of human development,&lt;!--85, 88--&gt; in which one develops from [[śīla|moral discipline]] ({{lang-pi|sīla|italic=yes |link=no}}), to [[samadhi|concentration]] ({{lang-pi|samādhi|italic=yes |link=no}}) and finally [[paññā|wisdom]] ({{lang-pi|paññā|italic=yes |link=no}}).&lt;!--85--&gt; He does not believe, however, that human rights are [[natural rights]], but rather human conventions.&lt;!--79--&gt; Buddhism scholar Somparn Promta disagrees with him. He argues that human beings do have natural rights from a Buddhist perspective, and refers to the ''attūpanāyika-dhamma'', a teaching in which the Buddha prescribes a kind of [[golden rule]] of comparing oneself with others.&lt;!--79-80--&gt; (''See [[#Principles|§Principles]], above.'') From this discourse, Promta concludes that the Buddha has laid down the five precepts in order to protect individual rights such as right of life and property:&lt;!--80--&gt; human rights are implicit within the five precepts. Academic Buntham Phunsap argues, however, that though human rights are useful in culturally pluralistic societies, they are in fact not required when society is based on the five precepts. Phunsap therefore does not see human rights as part of Buddhist doctrine.&lt;!--86--&gt;{{sfn |Seeger |2010 |pp=78{{en dash}}80, 85{{en dash}}6, 88}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4173">The '''Geek Pride Festival''' was the name of a number of events between 1998 and 2000, organized by [[Tim McEachern]] and devoted to computer [[geek]] activities and interests. The name of the festival is most often associated with the large event held on March 31 and April 1, 2000 at the Park Plaza Castle in [[Boston]], United States.

Before that there were two events at the now closed Big House Brewery in [[Albany, New York]]. [http://www.wamc.org WAMC], the local NPR affiliate, sponsored the events which were organized by Tim McEachern.

==2000 event==
{{Tone|date=November 2008}}
[[Image:Geek pride festival t-shirt.png|thumb|right|Geek Pride Festival T-shirt]]
The 2000 event was a major production, organized with the help of [[Susan Kaup]], Chris O'Brien and many volunteers.

The event began Friday night, with a swap meet / social event at the Modern Lounge in Boston's [[Landsdowne Street]] nightclub district. Drink tickets were offered at the door, and the DJ played computer-themed music (e.g., ''[[It's All About The Pentiums]]'').

On Saturday, the main event occurred at the Castle, where admission was free. The middle of the floor held the "Email Garden", comprising about a dozen tables with [[Personal computer|PC]]s running [[Red Hat Linux]], in a wired [[LAN]] network and providing [[email]], [[World Wide Web|Web]], and general [[Internet]] access. At the front of the hall was a stage, which hosted a number of invited guests, including [[Rob Malda]] of [[Slashdot]], [[Eric S. Raymond]], the [[video game]] cover band [[Everyone (band)|Everyone]]. The stage was also host to the final round of a [[Quake III]] tournament, held in a back room, displayed on the stage's projection screen, as well as the final round of "Stump the Geek", a geek [[trivia]] contest.

Aside from the main events, the main floor had computer workstations displaying live [[webcam]] feeds of "satellite" Festivals in remote locations. A live [[Shoutcast]] feed was also provided of the Boston event. A poll for "greatest geek hero" was also held; the official winner was [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything.blockstackers.com/index.pl?node_id=475132]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Science/AAAS magazine, 2,000 people attended, though the open-door free admission made an official count impossible.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Other events==
The 2000 event is widely referred to as the "first annual" event, although McEachern organized at least one previous event named Geek Pride Festival (and/or Geek Pride Day) at a bar in Albany, New York. Some sources refer to the Boston event as the ''third'' annual.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

McEachern planned another event to take place later the same year in [[San Francisco]], but was never realized.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">In [[mathematics]], the concept of a '''generalised metric''' is a generalisation of that of a [[metric space|metric]], in which the distance is not a [[real number]] but taken from an arbitrary [[ordered field]].

In general, when we define [[metric space]] the distance function is taken to be a real-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]]. The real numbers form an ordered field which is [[archimedean property|Archimedean]] and [[complete ordered field|order complete]]. These metric spaces have some nice properties like: in a metric space [[compactness]], [[sequential compactness]] and [[countable compactness]] are equivalent etc. These properties may not, however, hold so easily if the distance function is taken in an arbitrary ordered field, instead of in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.

==Preliminary definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;(F,+,\cdot,&lt;)&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary ordered field, and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a nonempty set; a function &lt;math&gt;d :M\times M\to F^+\cup\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; is called a metric on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, iff the following conditions hold:

# &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=0\Leftrightarrow x=y&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=d(y,x)&lt;/math&gt;, commutativity;
# &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)+d(y,z)\geq d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt;, triangle inequality.

It is not difficult to verify that the open balls &lt;math&gt;B(x,\delta)\;:=\{y\in M\;:d(x,y)&lt;\delta\}&lt;/math&gt; form a basis for a suitable topology, the latter called the  ''[[metric topology]]'' on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, with the metric in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

In view of the fact that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in its [[order topology]] is [[monotonically normal]], we would expect &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to be at least [[Regular space|regular]].

== Further properties ==
However, under [[axiom of choice]], every general metric is [[monotonically normal]], for, given &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is open, there is an open ball &lt;math&gt;B(x,\delta)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in B(x,\delta)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;. Take &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)=B(x,\delta/2)&lt;/math&gt;. Verify the conditions for Monotone Normality.

The matter of wonder is that, even without choice, general metrics are [[monotonically normal]].

''proof''.

Case I: ''F'' is an [[Archimedean field]].

Now, if ''x'' in  &lt;math&gt;G, G&lt;/math&gt; open, we may take &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G):= B(x,1/2n(x,G))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n(x,G):= \min\{n\in\mathbb N:B(x,1/n)\subseteq G\}&lt;/math&gt;, and the trick is done without choice.

Case II: F is a non-Archimedean field.

For given &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt; where ''G'' is open, consider the set
&lt;math&gt;A(x,G):=\{a\in F\colon \forall n\in\mathbb N,B(x,n\cdot a)\subseteq G\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The  set ''A''(''x'', ''G'') is non-empty. For, as ''G'' is open, there is an open ball ''B''(''x'', ''k'') within ''G''. Now, as ''F'' is non-Archimdedean, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N_F&lt;/math&gt; is not bounded above, hence there is some &lt;math&gt;\xi\in F&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\forall n\in\mathbb N\colon n\cdot 1\le\xi&lt;/math&gt;. Putting &lt;math&gt;a=k\cdot (2\xi)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is in ''A''(''x'', ''G'').

Now define &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)=\bigcup\{B(x,a)\colon a\in A(x,G)\}&lt;/math&gt;. We would show that with respect to this mu operator, the space is monotonically normal. Note that &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''y'' is not in ''G''(open set containing ''x'') and ''x'' is not in ''H''(open set containing ''y''), then we'd show that &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)\cap\mu(y,H)&lt;/math&gt; is empty. If not, say ''z'' is in the intersection. Then

: &lt;math&gt;\exists a\in A(x,G)\colon d(x,z)&lt;a;\;\;
\exists b\in A(y,H)\colon d(z,y)&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

From the above, we get that &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\le d(x,z)+d(z,y)&lt;2\cdot\max\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is impossible since this would imply that either ''y'' belongs to &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt; or ''x'' belongs to &lt;math&gt;\mu(y,H)\subseteq H&lt;/math&gt;.

So we are done!

(Jacobson, 2013) The difference between the disability and impairment is that disability is the restriction of the ability caused by the actual decrement of functioning, aka impairment, of the individual.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=World Report on Disability.|last=World Health Organisation|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Geography of disability studies the experience of disabled people and examines the relationship between the disability and space, ranging from the accessibility, mobility and the landscape, in terms of socio-economic, environmental and political perspectives. Hawkesworth, a scholar refers the Geography of disability as “a set of discursive and performative practice”, which intersects more with in the social and cultural aspects, instead of solely on the physical impairment.

According to the World report on disability published by the World Health Organisation, around 15% of the world population, which is approximately 1.14billion people, lives with a disability, of whom 2-4% experience significant disability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Europe and America, the disability ratio is one in five people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are some major factors that give rise to the risk of non-congenital disability, which are age, their living environment, their gender and the access to healthcare. The report had shown that there is a strong correlation between age and the risk of disability, the elder tends to have a higher risk of disability such as Alzheimer, cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a global correlation between the disability and poverty due to the short of resources and government investment to medical service, and lack of access to healthcare. Inadequate infrastructure and investment could worsen the condition. In Australia, a research on disability conducted by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Canberra had demonstrated a strong correlation that the more economically disadvantaged area or community people living in, the higher probability of these people will suffer from disability problem or severe disability, justified by the social gradient of disability correlation coefficient. The likelihood of having severe disability of the population who live in the disadvantaged area in Sydney were 2.6% higher than the population who live in the most economically and socially advantaged area in Sydney&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/319908376|title=The geography of disability and economic disadvantage in Australian capital cities|last=Louise.|first=O'Rance,|date=2009|publisher=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|others=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.|isbn=9781740249102|location=Canberra|oclc=319908376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlation could also be seen in the United State. In the US, according to the 2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report conducted by Institute on Disability/UCED of University of New Hampshire, the distribution of people with disabilities aged from 18-64 has concentrated in the Southeast United States, including Georgia Tennesse, Louisiana and Arkansas etc, which are also the most economically disadvantaged area among the state. For examples, in Memphis, Tennesse, a city with 26.2% poverty rate is also one of the cities with the densest disabled population, 12.6%-17.8% of its working population (aged from 18-64) live with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/06/21/economic-blight-50-worst-american-cities-live/415609001/|title=These are America's worst cities for crime, employment, housing costs|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://disabilitycompendium.org/sites/default/files/user-uploads/2017_AnnualReport_2017_FINAL.pdf|title=2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report|last=Kraus, L., Lauer, E., Coleman, R., and Houtenville, A.|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures also indicated that female is riskier of being disability than male regardless of their age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Europe, according to the Eurostat, women are 3% more prone to suffering from a longstanding health problem, daily activity difficulties or both than men in Europe in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Disability_statistics_-_health|title=Disability statistics - health - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Recent development of Geography of Disability: [https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf] ===
Geography scholars had been recognizing the issues of disability since the 1930s. The study has then been extended to a range of socio-spatial processes relating to the issue arisen from disability, that interacts among power, space, and society. There were some analyses of disability within the socio-spatial perspectives, though these analyses tended to isolate from each other instead of integrating all ideas together as a critical discourse.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://research.gold.ac.uk/10412/2/GEO_DISPAPER%2520PROOFED-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also changed the definition of disability from a medical point of view towards the socio-spatial determinants.

Imrie, explained the recent development in ''The Geographies of Disability'' as follows:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

“An opening observation is that what has emerged, since the mid 1990’s, has been a broadening of the substantive focus of studies of space and disability, beyond some of the earlier foci of health, cognition and behaviour, welfare, design, and architecture. In particular, the study of disability is evident in most parts of human geography, and not just confined to a specialist or sub-part of the discipline.

However, up to the early 1990’s, the study of geography and disability had been the preserve of specific niche areas of research activity, with some scholars, like Park et al (1998), suggesting that human geography had rarely engaged with studies of 7 disability.’’

The narratives and discursive practices, suggested by Hawkesworth, is also emerged in the geography of disability studies. It has developed to the interrelationships between the body, the feeling of a place and disability, suggested by Imrie, which lead to a wider and deeper scope and the focus of the studies especially regarding to different age groups with different extent and types of disability, for examples, children with learning difficulties vs elderly people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The socio-economic of disability ==

The disabled are often seen as the oppressive socialization of a given form of physiological difference, experiencing who suffer the common socially.

=== The models of disability ===
(link to an external article: Social Model of disability [[Social model of disability|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability]] )

The medical model of refers Disability as the physical problem, the incapability of a disabled person to perform as ‘normal’ as a person that has no disability. Disability intrigues a further disclosure on easing the inconvenience and improving a disabled’s daily experience. For example, introducing advanced assistive devices or aids like mobile wheelchair for disabled individuals who live on their own. On the other hand,  the social model of disability evokes the idea of social integration through demonstrating the difficulties faced by the disabled in the wake of their physical or mental functioning decrement. The social model of disability encourages the mainstream social and cultural structure to accommodate the disabled individuals with more assistive infrastructure and social attitude.

In the Geography of disability, the research mainly focuses on discussing the relationships between the disabled, their basic human rights and the social development, as in the inclusion and the marginalization. This was one of the main study to research and approach the disabled’s need, address the problem without additional negative effects or embarrassment to the disabled pupils.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of the disabilities do not have equal access to the resources aka the materiality or the basic human rights aka the non-materiality inequality as ‘the normal’ population, such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. . Their weak and limited physical ability led to higher and extreme level of difficulty to make earning and accumulate wealth by their own power as a non-disabled. This, as a result, make it more difficult for them to live out of poverty or economic disadvantage. What’s more, discrimination, inequality and social exclusion reflected from the ‘mainstream’ society and thus received by the disabled population in different areas creates a virus circle of the disabled experience. Children and teenagers who has learning difficulties is more likely to cause them a discrimination, getting rejected by the mainstream school. The young disabled population aged 15–24 are 10 times more prone to receiving discrimination than the elder disabled population aged 65 and over. And it seems to them doomed to be/ inevitably be socially marginalized and excluded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Imrie(2007) further described in his article of how the geographical research methodology is carried out and work well for the social research on disabled people.

“Hall and Kearns (2001: 243), for example, comment that ‘traditional’ research methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, ‘can fail to represent the geographical lives of intellectually disabled people’ (also, see Hall, 2004). Similarly, a project by Kitchin (2000), about the opinions of disabled people about social research, shows that most do not like the use of methods that fail to capture the complexities of disability. Such methods include pre-set questions that collect quantitative data and statistics. These observations suggest that the use of particular qualitative or interpretative methods are a preferred way of giving voice to disabled people’s experiences, and open up scope for inclusive research practices. In this respect, there have been some important methodological developments in geographical research that seek to articulate the different ways that disabled people know and experience the world.“&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Environmental politics of Disability  ==

=== The environmental politics of Disability ===
A disabled person’s origin and living environment, including the mobility, accessibility, space, living condition, greatly determine and impact his daily experience, and even affect his physical and mental condition. Space, resources, and investment to be invested in the infrastructure needed by the disabled population are somehow considered to be ‘extra’, as the mainstream society has neglected, somehow judged and less inclined to put forward about it. One of the aim to be achieved through the geography studies of disability is to  highlight the issue and problem the disabled population come across on daily basis so as to create a more including and less-tension society and community.

=== Accessible Tourism ===
The concept of the Accessible tourism is one of the significant developments derived from the development of the geography of disability. The idea behind the accessible tourism is to strive for a basic human right for the disabled to participate in tourism, and to promote the best accessibility practices in tourism by engaging representatives of international tourism sector as well as the representatives of disabled individuals and also non-governmental parties to cooperate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zajadacz|first=Alina|date=2015-01-01|title=The Contribution Of The Geography Of Disability To The Development Of ‘Accessible Tourism’|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/tour/25/1/article-p19.xml|journal=Turyzm|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=19–27|doi=10.2478/tour-2014-0016|issn=0867-5856}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the development of disability researches, along with the awareness of the need of tourists, the concept and the idea of accessible tourism which aim to promote ‘tourism without barriers’ has gradually drawn people’s attention as well as the World Tourism Organisation’s publication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [http://ethics.unwto.org/content/accessible-tourism UNWTO] has since published a range of information including Manuals on Accessible Tourism for tourism stakeholders to ensure the quality and quantity of the supply of good accessible tourism practises, and recommendations on Accessible Tourism for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethics.unwto.org/content/accessible-tourism|title=Accessible Tourism {{!}} Ethics, Culture and Social Responsibility|website=ethics.unwto.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research results of the geography of disability intrigue a further studies of universe design of space in relation to the mobility and accessibility, and the improvement of the assistive technologies to confront the barriers encountered by the disabled. The geographical model of disability was created during research of the geography of disability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Zajadacz, he stated that: “In recent years, geographers have made significant strides towards understanding the spatially of disability. This research has presented disability as a characteristic of the population that inevitably leads to marginalization and spatial exclusion from otherwise normal social arenas and spaces within the built environment. Geographers claimed that throughout the research on the geography of disability, they connected the cause of disability in terms of social and spatial environment and helped the promotion of more accommodating resolution which “provide access to sites and the full scope of life within society taking different degrees and types of disability into consideration.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Gaining the idea of disability from the social model of disability and the geographical model of disability, the definition and the attitude towards Disability no longer limited only to the physical decrement of an individual, but evolve further to the consideration to disabled’s daily experience relating to social and spatial aspects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Discrimination Law and Policy ==
In WHO’s report about the disabling barriers, it said:

“Beliefs and prejudices constitute barriers to education, employment, health care, and social participation. For example, the attitudes of teachers, school administrators, other children, and even family members affect the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools. Misconceptions by employers that people with disabilities are less productive than their non-disabled counterparts, and ignorance about available adjustments to work arrangements limits employment opportunities.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Australia, The ''Disability Discrimination Act 1992(DDA)'' illegitimate any direct or indirect discriminating actions towards a person, either temporarily or permanently disabled, or with the future potential of being disabled, in areas including employment, education, access to services and public places and rights to purchase premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/employers/good-practice-good-business-factsheets/disability-discrimination|title=Disability discrimination|last=connie.kwan|date=2015-02-18|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A polynomial in several variables p(x,y,z,…) is called homogeneous [...] more generally, a function of several variables f(x,y,z,…) is homogeneous [...] Identifying homogeneous functions can be helpful in solving differential equations [and] any formula that represents the mean of a set of numbers is required to be homogeneous. In physics, the term homogeneous describes a substance or an object whose properties do not vary with position. For example, an object of uniform density is sometimes described as homogeneous."  
[http://www.fofweb.com/activelink2.asp?ItemID=WE40&amp;SID=5&amp;iPin=EMATH0406&amp;SingleRecord=True James. homogeneous (math).] 
(accessed: 2009-11-16)&lt;/ref&gt; A uniform [[electric field]] (which has the same strength and the same direction at each point) would be compatible with homogeneity (all points experience the same physics). A material constructed with different constituents can be described as effectively homogeneous in the [[electromagnetic field|electromagnetic]] materials domain, when interacting with a directed [[EM radiation|radiation field]] (light, microwave frequencies, etc.).&lt;ref name=homogeneity&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/homogeneity Homogeneity]. Merriam-webster.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Homogeneous&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Homogeneous Homogeneous]. Merriam-webster.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, homogeneity has the connotation of [[invariant (physics)|invariance]], as all components of the [[equation]] have the same degree of value whether or not each of these components are scaled to different values, for example, by multiplication or addition. Cumulative distribution fits this description. "The state of having identical cumulative distribution function or values".&lt;ref name=homogeneity/&gt;&lt;ref name=Homogeneous/&gt;

==Context==
The definition of homogeneous strongly depends on the context used. For example, a [[composite material]] is made up of different individual materials, known as "''constituents''" of the material, but may be defined as a homogeneous material when assigned a function. For example, [[asphalt]] paves our roads, but is a composite material consisting of asphalt binder and mineral aggregate, and then laid down in layers and compacted. However, homogeneity of materials does not necessarily mean [[Isotropic solid|isotropy]]. In the previous example, a composite material may not be isotropic.

In another context, a material is not homogeneous in so far as it is composed of [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s.  However, at the normal level of our everyday world, a pane of glass, or a sheet of metal is described as glass, or stainless steel. In other words, these are each described as a homogeneous material.

A few other instances of context are: ''Dimensional homogeneity'' (see below) is the quality of an equation having quantities of same units on both sides; ''Homogeneity (in space)'' implies [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation of momentum]]; and ''homogeneity in time'' implies [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation of energy]].

===Homogeneous alloy===
In the context of composite metals is an alloy. A blend of a metal with one or more metallic or nonmetallic materials is an alloy. The components of an alloy do not combine chemically but, rather, are very finely mixed. An alloy might be homogeneous or might contain small particles of components that can be viewed with a microscope. Brass is an example of an alloy, being a homogeneous mixture of copper and zinc. Another example is steel, which is an alloy of iron with carbon and possibly other metals. The purpose of alloying is to produce desired properties in a metal that naturally lacks them. Brass, for example, is harder than copper and has a more gold-like color. Steel is harder than iron and can even be made rust proof (stainless steel).&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Joe. "Alloy." Encyclopedia of Physics. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2004. Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. accessed 2009-11-16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homogeneous cosmology===
Homogeneity, in another context plays a role in [[cosmology]]. From the perspective of 19th-century cosmology (and before), the [[universe]] was [[Infinity|infinite]], unchanging, homogeneous, and therefore filled with [[star]]s. However, German astronomer [[Heinrich Olbers]] asserted that if this were true, then the entire night sky would be filled with light and bright as day; this is known as [[Olbers' paradox]]. Olbers presented a technical paper in 1826 that attempted to answer this conundrum. The faulty premise, unknown in Olbers' time, was that the universe is not infinite, static, and homogeneous. The [[Big Bang]] cosmology replaced this model (expanding, finite, and [[Inhomogeneous cosmology|inhomogeneous universe]]). However, modern astronomers supply reasonable explanations to answer this question. One of at least several explanations is that distant stars and [[galaxies]] are [[red shift]]ed, which weakens their apparent light and makes the night sky dark.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Deborah, and Joseph A. Angelo Jr. "''Olbers, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus''." A to Z of Scientists in Space and Astronomy. New York: Facts on File, Inc., 2005. Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. [http://www.fofweb.com/activelink2.asp?ItemID=WE40&amp;SID=5&amp;iPin=AZSSA0100&amp;SingleRecord=True Olbers, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus] (accessed 2009-11-16)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the weakening is not sufficient to actually explain Olbers' paradox. Many cosmologists think that the fact that the Universe is finite in time, that is that the Universe has not been around forever, is the solution to the paradox.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The fact that the night sky is dark is thus an indication for the Big Bang.

==Translation invariance==
{{main|translational invariance}}

By [[translation (geometry)|translation]] invariance, one means independence of (absolute) position, especially when referring to a law of physics, or to the evolution of a physical system.

Fundamental laws of physics should not (explicitly) depend on position in space. That would make them quite useless. In some sense, this is also linked to the requirement that experiments should be [[reproducible]].
This principle is true for all laws of mechanics ([[Newton's laws]], etc.), electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, etc.

In practice, this principle is usually violated, since one studies only a small subsystem of the universe, which of course "feels" the influence of rest of the universe. This situation gives rise to "external fields" (electric, magnetic, gravitational, etc.) which make the description of the evolution of the system depending on the position ([[potential well]]s, etc.). This only stems from the fact that the objects creating these external fields are not considered as (a "dynamical") part of the system.

Translational invariance as described above is equivalent to [[translational invariance|shift invariance]] in [[system analysis]], although here it is most commonly used in [[linear]] systems, whereas in physics the distinction is not usually made.

The notion of [[isotropy]], for properties independent of direction, is not a consequence of homogeneity. For example, a uniform electric field (i.e., which has the same strength and the same direction at each point) would be compatible with homogeneity (at each point physics will be the same), but not with [[isotropy]], since the field singles out one "preferred" direction.

===Consequences===

In [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] formalism, homogeneity in space implies conservation of [[momentum]], and homogeneity in time implies conservation of [[energy]]. This is shown, using [[variational calculus]], in standard textbooks like the classical reference [Landau &amp; Lifshitz] cited below. This is a particular application of [[Noether's theorem]].

==Dimensional homogeneity==
{{main|Dimensional analysis#Dimensional homogeneity}}

As said in the introduction, ''dimensional homogeneity'' is the quality of an equation having quantities of same units on both sides. A valid equation in [[physics]] must be homogeneous, since equality cannot apply between quantities of different nature. This can be used to spot errors in formula or calculations. For example, if one is calculating a [[speed]], units must always combine to [length]/[time]; if one is calculating an [[energy]], units must always combine to [mass]•[length]²/[time]², etc. For example, the following formulae could be valid expressions for some energy:
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac 12 m v^2 ;~~ E = m c^2 ;~~ E = p v ; ~~ E = hc/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
if ''m'' is a mass, ''v'' and ''c'' are velocities, ''p'' is a [[momentum]], ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], ''λ'' a length. On the other hand, if the units of the [[right hand side]] do not combine to [mass]•[length]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/[time]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it cannot be a valid expression for some energy.

Being homogeneous does not necessarily mean the equation will be true, since it does not take into account numerical factors. For example, ''E = m•v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' could be or could not be the correct formula for the energy of a particle of mass ''m'' traveling at speed ''v'', and one cannot know if ''h•c''/λ should be divided or multiplied by 2π.

Nevertheless, this is a very powerful tool in finding characteristic units of a given problem, see [[dimensional analysis]].

[[Theoretical physicist]]s tend to express everything in [[natural units]] given by [[constants of nature]], for example by taking ''c'' = ''ħ'' = ''k'' = 1; once this is done, one partly loses the possibility of the above checking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10915">{{distinguish|Hund's cases}}

In [[atomic physics]], '''Hund's rules''' refers to a set of rules that German physicist [[Friedrich Hund]] formulated around 1927, which are used to determine the [[term symbol]] that corresponds to the ground state of a multi-[[electron]] [[atom]]. The first rule is especially important in chemistry, where it is often referred to simply as [[Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity|Hund's Rule]].

The three rules are:&lt;ref&gt;G.L. Miessler and D.A. Tarr, Inorganic Chemistry (Prentice-Hall, 2nd edn 1999) {{ISBN|0138418918}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;358–360
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Engel and P. Reid, Physical Chemistry (Pearson Benjamin-Cummings, 2006) {{ISBN|080533842X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;477–479&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G.

# For a given [[electron configuration]], the [[Term symbol#Terms, levels, and states|term]] with maximum [[multiplicity (chemistry)|multiplicity]] has the lowest energy. The multiplicity is equal to &lt;math&gt; 2S + 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Spin quantum number#Total spin of an atom or molecule|total spin angular momentum]] for all electrons. Therefore, the term with lowest energy is also the term with maximum &lt;math&gt; S \, &lt;/math&gt;.
# For a given multiplicity, the term with the largest value of the total [[Azimuthal quantum number|orbital angular momentum quantum number]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; L \, &lt;/math&gt; has the lowest energy.
# For a given term, in an atom with outermost subshell half-filled or less, the level with the lowest value of the [[total angular momentum quantum number]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; J \, &lt;/math&gt; (for the operator &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}=\boldsymbol{L}+\boldsymbol{S}&lt;/math&gt;) lies lowest in energy. If the outermost shell is more than half-filled, the level with the highest value of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; J \, &lt;/math&gt; is lowest in energy.

These rules specify in a simple way how usual energy interactions determine which term includes the ground state. The rules assume that the repulsion between the outer electrons is much greater than the spin–orbit interaction, which is in turn stronger than any other remaining interactions.  This is referred to as the [[angular momentum coupling#LS coupling|LS coupling]] regime.

Full shells and subshells do not contribute to the quantum numbers for total&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|S}}, the total spin angular momentum and for&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}}, the total orbital angular momentum. It can be shown that for full orbitals and suborbitals both the residual [[electrostatic energy]] (repulsion between electrons) and the spin–orbit interaction can only shift all the energy levels together.  Thus when determining the ordering of energy levels in general only the outer valence electrons must be considered.

==Rule 1==
{{Main article|Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity}}

Due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], two electrons cannot share the same set of quantum numbers within the same system;  therefore, there is room for only two electrons in each spatial orbital.  One of these electrons must have, (for some chosen direction&amp;nbsp;''z'') ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = ½, and the other must have ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = −½.  Hund's first rule states that the lowest energy atomic state is '''the one that maximizes the [[Spin quantum number#Total spin of an atom or molecule|total spin quantum number]] for the electrons in the open subshell'''. The orbitals of the subshell are each occupied singly with electrons of parallel spin before double occupation occurs. (This is occasionally called the "bus seat rule" since it is analogous to the behaviour of bus passengers who tend to occupy all double seats singly before double occupation occurs.)

Two different physical explanations have been given&lt;ref name=Levine&gt;I.N. Levine, Quantum Chemistry (Prentice-Hall, 4th edn 1991) {{ISBN|0205127703}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;303–304&lt;/ref&gt; for the increased stability of high multiplicity states. In the early days of [[quantum mechanics]], it was proposed that electrons in different orbitals are further apart, so that electron–electron repulsion energy is reduced. However, accurate quantum-mechanical calculations (starting in the 1970s) have shown that the reason is that the electrons in singly occupied orbitals are less effectively screened or [[effective nuclear charge|shielded]] from the nucleus, so that such orbitals contract and electron–nucleus attraction energy becomes greater in magnitude (or decreases algebraically).

===Example===
[[Image:Si Hund.png|thumb|250px|Hund's rules applied to Si.  The up arrows signify [[electron]]s with up-[[Spin-½|spin]].  The boxes represent different [[magnetic quantum number]]s ]]
As an example, consider the ground state of [[silicon]]. The electronic configuration of Si is {{math|1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (see [[spectroscopic notation]]).  We need to consider only the outer 3p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;electrons, for which it can be shown (see [[Term symbol#Term symbols for an electron configuration|term symbols]]) that the possible terms allowed by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] are &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''D''&amp;nbsp;, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''P''&amp;nbsp;, and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''S''. Hund's first rule now states that the ground state term is &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''P'' [[triplet state|(triplet P)]], which has ''S'' = 1. The superscript&amp;nbsp;3 is the value of the multiplicity = 2''S'' + 1 = 3. The diagram shows the state of this term with ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.

==Rule 2==
This rule deals with reducing the repulsion between electrons.  It can be understood from the classical picture that if all electrons are orbiting in the same direction (higher orbital angular momentum) they meet less often than if some of them orbit in opposite directions. In the latter case the repulsive force increases, which separates electrons. This adds potential energy to them, so their energy level is higher.

===Example===
For silicon there is only one triplet term, so the second rule is not required. The lightest atom that requires the second rule to determine the ground state term is [[titanium]] (Ti, [[atomic number|{{mvar|Z}}]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;22) with electron configuration {{math|1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;  3d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In this case the open shell is {{math|3d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and the allowed terms include three singlets (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;D, and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G) and two triplets (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;F). (Here the symbols S, P, D, F, and G indicate that the total [[Angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum quantum number]] has values 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, analogous to the nomenclature for naming atomic orbitals.)

We deduce from Hund's first rule that the ground state term is one of the two triplets, and from Hund's second rule that this term is &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;F (with &lt;math&gt;L = 3&lt;/math&gt;) rather than &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P (with &lt;math&gt;L = 1&lt;/math&gt;). There is no &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G&amp;nbsp;term since its &lt;math&gt;(M_L = 4, M_S = 1)&lt;/math&gt; state would require two electrons each with &lt;math&gt;(M_L = 2, M_S = +1/2)&lt;/math&gt;, in violation of the Pauli principle. (Here &lt;math&gt;M_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_S&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the total orbital angular momentum L and total spin S along the z-axis chosen as the direction of an external magnetic field.)

==Rule 3==
This rule considers the energy shifts due to [[spin–orbit coupling]]. In the case where the spin–orbit coupling is weak compared to the residual electrostatic interaction, &lt;math&gt; L \, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; S \, &lt;/math&gt; are still [[good quantum number]]s and the splitting is given by:

&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \Delta E &amp; =  \zeta (L,S) \{ \mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{S} \} \\ 
\ &amp; =  \ (1/2) \zeta (L,S) \{ J(J+1)-L(L+1)-S(S+1) \} \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt; \zeta (L,S)\, &lt;/math&gt;  changes from plus to minus for shells greater than half full. This term gives the dependence of the ground state energy on the magnitude of &lt;math&gt; J \, &lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples===
The &lt;Math&gt; {}^3\!P \, &lt;/math&gt; lowest energy term of Si consists of three levels, &lt;math&gt; J = 2,1,0 \, &lt;/math&gt;.  With only two of six possible electrons in the shell, it is less than half-full and thus &lt;math&gt; {}^3\!P_0 \, &lt;/math&gt; is the ground state.

For [[sulfur]]&amp;nbsp;(S) the lowest energy term is again &lt;math&gt; {}^3\!P \, &lt;/math&gt; with spin–orbit levels &lt;math&gt; J = 2,1,0 \, &lt;/math&gt;, but now there are four of six possible electrons in the shell so the ground state is &lt;math&gt; {}^3\!P_2 \, &lt;/math&gt;.

If the shell is half-filled then &lt;math&gt; L = 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;, and hence there is only one value of &lt;math&gt; J \, &lt;/math&gt; (equal to &lt;math&gt; S \, &lt;/math&gt;), which is the lowest energy state. For example, in [[phosphorus]] the lowest energy state has &lt;math&gt; S = 3/2,\  L = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for three unpaired electrons in three 3p&amp;nbsp;orbitals. Therefore, &lt;math&gt; J = S = 3/2 &lt;/math&gt; and the ground state is &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Excited states==

Hund's rules work best for the determination of the [[ground state]] of an atom or molecule.

They are also fairly reliable (with occasional failures) for the determination of the lowest state of a given [[electron configuration#Energy — ground state and excited states|excited electronic configuration]]. Thus, in the helium atom, Hund's first rule correctly predicts that the 1s2s [[triplet state]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;S) is lower than the 1s2s singlet (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S). Similarly for organic molecules, the same rule predicts that the first triplet state (denoted by T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in [[photochemistry]]) is lower than the first excited singlet state (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), which is generally correct.

However Hund's rules should not be used to order states other than the lowest for a given configuration.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt; For example, the [[titanium]] atom ground state configuration is ...3d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for which a naïve application of Hund's rules would suggest the ordering &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;F &lt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;D &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S. In reality, however, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;D lies below &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G.

[[Image:Weights and Measures office.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The former Weights and Measures office in [[Seven Sisters, London]] (590 Seven Sisters Road).]]

The system of '''imperial units''' or the '''imperial system''' (also known as '''British Imperial'''&lt;ref name="Publishing2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Britannica Educational Publishing|title=The Britannica Guide to Numbers and Measurement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cuN7rH6RzikC&amp;pg=PA241|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=1 August 2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-61530-218-5|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Exchequer Standards''' of 1825) is the [[system of units]] first defined in the British [[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)|Weights and Measures Act]] of 1824, which was later refined and reduced. The Imperial units replaced the [[Winchester measure|Winchester Standards]], which were in effect from  1588 to 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chaney, Henry James|title=A Practical Treatise on the Standard Weights and Measures in Use in the British Empire with some account of the metric system|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BqVIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=11 September 2016|date=1897|publisher=Eyre and Spottiswoode|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system came into official use across the [[British Empire]]. By the late 20th century, most nations of the former empire had [[metrication|officially adopted]] the [[metric system]] as their main system of measurement, although some imperial units are still used in the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries formerly part of the British Empire. The imperial system developed from what were first known as [[English units]], as did the related system of [[United States customary units]].

==Implementation==
The Weights and Measures Act of 1824 was initially scheduled to go into effect on 1 May 1825.&lt;ref name="google339"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain|title=The statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1807-1865)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WLouAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA339|accessdate=31 December 2011|year=1824|publisher=His Majesty's statute and law printers|pages=339–354}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Weights and Measures Act of 1825 pushed back the date to 1 January 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Great Britain|author2=William David Evans|authorlink2=William David Evans|author3=Anthony Hammond|author4=Thomas Colpitts Granger|title=A collection of statutes connected with the general administration of the law: arranged according to the order of subjects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbcuAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA306|accessdate=31 December 2011|year=1836|publisher=W. H. Bond|pages=306–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1824 Act allowed the continued use of pre-imperial units provided that they were customary, widely known, and clearly marked with imperial equivalents.&lt;ref name="google339"/&gt;

===Apothecaries' units===
[[Image:Imperial standards of length 1876 Trafalgar Square.jpg|thumb|right|Imperial standards of length 1876 in [[Trafalgar Square]], London.]]

Apothecaries' units are mentioned neither in the act of 1824 nor 1825. At the time, apothecaries' weights and measures were regulated "in England, Wales, and [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]]" by the [[London College of Physicians]], and in Ireland by the [[Royal College of Physicians of Ireland|Dublin College of Physicians]]. In Scotland, apothecaries' units were unofficially regulated by the [[Edinburgh College of Physicians]]. The three colleges published, at infrequent intervals, [[pharmacopoeia]]e, the London and Dublin editions having the force of law.&lt;ref name="Edinburgh medical and surgical journal"&gt;{{cite book|title=Edinburgh medical and surgical journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwUbAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA398|accessdate=29 July 2012|year=1824|publisher=A. and C.

=== Volume ===
In 1824, the various different gallons in use in the British Empire were replaced by the imperial gallon, a unit close in volume to the [[gallon#History|ale gallon]]. It was originally defined as the volume of {{convert|10|lb|kg|1}} of distilled water weighed in air with brass weights with the barometer standing at {{convert|30|inHg|0|lk=in}} at a temperature of {{convert|62|°F|°C|0|lk=in}}. In 1963, the gallon was redefined as the volume of 10 pounds of distilled water of density {{val|0.998859|u=g/mL}} weighed in air of density {{val|0.001217|u=g/mL}} against weights of density {{val|8.136|u=g/mL}}, which works out to {{val|4.546096|u=l}} or {{val|277.4198|u=cuin}}. The Weights and Measures Act of 1985 switched to a gallon of exactly {{val|4.54609|u=L}} (approximately {{val|277.4194&lt;!-- 3279162… --&gt;|u=cuin}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/gallon_imperial.htm|title=imperial gallon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mass and weight ===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the UK used three different systems for mass and weight:&lt;ref&gt;The [[mass versus weight|distinction between mass and weight]] is not always clearly drawn. In certain contexts, the term ''[[pound-force|pound]]'' may refer to a unit of force rather than mass.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[troy weight]], used for precious metals;
* [[avoirdupois]] weight, used for most other purposes; and
* [[apothecaries' weight]], now virtually unused since the metric system is used for all scientific purposes.

The troy pound ({{val|373.2417216|u=g}}) was made the primary unit of mass by the 1824 Act; however, its use was abolished in the UK on 1 January 1879,&lt;ref name="Britain1878"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain|title=Statutes at large ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v39KAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA308|accessdate=12 September 2012|year=1878|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; with only the troy ounce ({{val|31.1034768|u=g}}) and its [[decimal]] subdivisions retained.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chisholm|first=Hugh|authorlink=Hugh Chisholm|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzkEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA480|accessdate=12 September 2012|year=1911|publisher=At the University Press|page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Weights and Measures Act 1855'' (18 &amp; 19 Victoria C72) made the avoirdupois pound the primary unit of mass.&lt;ref name="Britain1855"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain|title=A collection of public general statutes passed in the 18th and 19th years of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1YMAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA273|accessdate=5 January 2012|year=1855|pages=273–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all the systems, the fundamental unit is the [[Pound (mass)|pound]], and all other units are defined as fractions or multiples of it.

== Natural equivalents ==
Although the 1824 act defined the yard and pound by reference to the [[prototype]] standards, it also defined the values of certain [[physical constants]], to make provision for re-creation of the standards if they were to be damaged. For the yard, the length of a [[pendulum]] beating [[second]]s at the latitude of Greenwich at [[Mean Sea Level]] ''in vacuo'' was defined as {{val|39.01393}} inches. For the pound, the mass of a cubic inch of distilled water at an [[atmospheric pressure]] of 30 [[inches of mercury]] and a temperature of 62° [[Fahrenheit]] was defined as 252.458 grains, with there being 7,000 grains per pound.&lt;ref name="google339" /&gt;  However, following the destruction of the original prototypes in the [[Burning of Parliament|1834 Houses of Parliament fire]], it proved impossible to recreate the standards from these definitions, and a new [[Weights and Measures Acts of 1878 to 1893|Weights and Measures Act]] (18 &amp; 19 Victoria. Cap. 72) was passed in 1855 which permitted the recreation of the prototypes from recognized [[Standard (metrology)|secondary standards]].&lt;ref name="Britain1855" /&gt;

== Relation to other systems ==
[[File:English length units graph.png|thumb|English units of length]]

The imperial system is one of many systems of [[English units]]. Although most of the units are defined in more than one system, some subsidiary units were used to a much greater extent, or for different purposes, in one area rather than the other. The distinctions between these systems are often not drawn precisely.

One such distinction is that between these systems and older British/English units/systems or newer additions. The term ''imperial'' should not be applied to English units that were outlawed in the [[Weights and Measures Act 1824]] or earlier, or which had fallen out of use by that time, nor to post-imperial inventions, such as the [[slug (unit)|slug]] or [[poundal]].

The [[United States customary units|US customary system]] is historically derived from the English units that were in use at the time of settlement. Because the United States was already independent at the time, these units were unaffected by the introduction of the imperial system.

== Current use ==
[[Image:MetricImperialUSCustomaryUnits.jpg|thumb|175px|A baby bottle that measures in three measurement systems—metric, imperial (UK), and US customary.]]
&lt;!-- United States customary units are covered above. --&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{see also|Metrication in the United Kingdom}}
British law now defines each imperial unit in terms of the metric equivalent. The metric system is in official use within the United Kingdom for most official applications with Imperial units remaining in widespread use amongst the public.&lt;ref name="BBCNews December 2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=Will British people ever think in metric?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16245391|accessdate=26 February 2017|publisher=BBC|date=21 December 2011|first=Jon|last=Kelly|quote=...but today the British remain unique in Europe by holding onto imperial weights and measures. ...the persistent British preference for imperial over metric is particularly noteworthy...}}&lt;/ref&gt; All UK roads use the imperial system except for weight limits, and newer height or width restriction signs give metric alongside imperial.&lt;ref name="BBCNews November 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title=Height and width road signs to display metric and imperial|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29965935|accessdate=26 February 2017|publisher=BBC|date=8 November 2014 |quote=New road signs showing height and width restrictions will use both metric and imperial measurements from March 2015....Road signs for bridges, tunnels and narrow roads can currently show measurements in just feet and inches or only metres. Some already display both.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Units of measurement regulations require all measuring devices used in trade or retail to display measurements in metric quantities. Almost all traders in the UK will accept requests from customers specified in imperial units, and scales which display in both unit systems are commonplace in the retail trade. Metric price signs may be accompanied by imperial price signs provided that the imperial signs are no larger and no more prominent than the metric ones.

The United Kingdom completed its official partial transition to the metric system in 1995, with some imperial units still legally mandated for certain applications such as draught beer and cider,&lt;ref name=WMbeer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?type=RESOURCES&amp;itemId=1073792198 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720114311/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?type=RESOURCES&amp;itemId=1073792198 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |title=BusinessLink: Weights and measures: Rules for pubs, restaurants and cafes|accessdate=24 August 2009|format=online |publisher= Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills }}&lt;/ref&gt; road-signs,&lt;ref name=WMroads&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bwmaonline.com/Transport%20-%20DfT%20memo.htm |title=Department for Transport statement on metric road signs |accessdate=24 August 2009|date=12 July 2002 |format=online |publisher=BWMA }}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore the speedometers on vehicles sold in the UK must be capable of displaying miles per hour. Even though the [[troy weight|troy pound]] was outlawed in the UK in the Weights and Measures Act of 1878, the ''troy ounce'' ''may'' still be used for the weights of precious stones and metals. The original railways (many built in the Victorian era) are a big user of imperial units, with distances officially measured in miles and yards or miles and [[chain (length)|chains]], and also feet and inches, and speeds are in miles per hour, although more recent systems are metric, and [[London Underground]] uses metric.&lt;ref name="TfL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts &amp; Figures|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do/london-underground/facts-and-figures|website=Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most British people still use imperial units in everyday life for distance (miles, yards, feet and inches) and volume in some cases (especially milk and beer in pints) but rarely for canned or bottled soft drinks or petrol.&lt;ref name="BBCNews December 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Guardian |date=1 December 2006|title=In praise of ... metric measurements|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/dec/01/comment.britishidentity | location=London | accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though use of kilograms is increasing, most British people also still use imperial units in everyday life for body weight (stones and pounds for adults, pounds and ounces for babies).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Some government documents aimed at the public give body weight and height not only in metric units (kilograms centimetres) but also in imperial units (stones and pounds, feet and inches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BMI healthy weight calculator |url= http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Documents/BMI%20Healthy%20weight%20calculator.htm |publisher=[[National Health Service]] |accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in 2015 found that many people did not know their body weight or height in one system or the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |access-date=29 October 2017|date = 20 June 2015 |first1=Will |last1=Dahlgreen|url= https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/06/20/britains-metric-muddle/ |title=Britain’s metric muddle not changing any time soon|quote=even today [2015] most 18-24 year-olds still do not know how much they weigh in kilograms (60%) or how tall they are in metres and centimetres (54%). }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Unfortunately, they don't say how many people didn't know their weight /height in either system, and the alternative weight units were pounds, not the stones and pounds normally used in the UK; so a better source would be good)--&gt; People under the age of 40 preferred the metric system but people aged 40 and over preferred the imperial system. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |access-date=29 October 2017|date = 2015 |url= https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/vsi5u7fi74/InternalResults_150609_systems_of_measurement_Website.pdf|title=YouGov Survey Results }}&lt;/ref&gt; The height of horses in some English-speaking countries, including [[Australia]],&lt;sup&gt;[[Hand (unit)|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] is usually measured in hands, standardized to 4 inches (101.6&amp;nbsp;mm). Fuel consumption for vehicles is commonly stated in miles per gallon, though official figures always include litres per 100&amp;nbsp;km equivalents. When sold [[draught beer|draught]] in licensed premises, beer and cider must be sold in pints and half-pints. Cow's milk is available in both litre- and pint-based containers in supermarkets and shops. Areas of land associated with farming, forestry and real estate are commonly advertised in acres and square feet, but for official government purposes the units are always hectares and square metres.

Office space and industrial units are usually advertised in square feet. Steel pipe sizes are sold in increments of inches, while copper pipe is sold in increments of millimetres. Road bicycles have their frames measured in centimetres, while off-road bicycles have their frames measured in inches. The size (diagonal) of television and computer monitor screens is always denominated in inches. Food sold by length or width e.g. pizzas or sandwiches, is generally sold in inches. Clothing is always sized in inches, with the metric equivalent often shown as a small supplementary indicator. Gas is usually measured by the cubic foot or cubic metre, but is billed like electricity by the [[kilowatt hour]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gas-meter-readings-and-bill-calculation Government website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pre-packaged products show both metric and imperial measures and it is also common to see imperial pack sizes with metric only labels e.g. a 1&amp;nbsp;lb (i.e., 454 g) tin of Lyle's Golden Syrup is always labelled 454&amp;nbsp;g with no imperial indicator. Similarly most jars of jam and packs of sausages are labelled 454&amp;nbsp;g with no imperial indicator.

===India===
[[India]]'s conversion to the metric system from the imperial system occurred in stages between 1955 and 1962. The metric system in weights and measures was adopted by the [[Indian Parliament]] in December 1956 with the ''Standards of Weights and Measures Act'', which took effect beginning 1 October 1958. The ''Indian Coinage Act'' was passed in 1955 by the Government of India to introduce decimal coinage in the country. The new system of coins became legal tender on April 1957, where the [[rupee]] consists of 100 paise. For the next five years, both the previous and new systems were legal. In April 1962, all other systems were banned. This process of metrication is called "big-bang" route, which is to simultaneously outlaw the use of pre-metric measurement, metricise, reissue all government publications and laws, and change education systems to metric.&lt;ref name="lamar.colostate.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/internat.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990221223050/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/internat.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 February 1999 |title=internat.htm |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today all official measurements are made in the metric system. However, in common usage some older Indians may still refer to imperial units. Some measurements, such as the heights of mountains, are still recorded in feet. Additionally, the [[Indian numbering system]] of crores and lacs is used alongside otherwise metricated currency units, while tyre rim diameters are still measured in inches, as used worldwide.  Road widths are popularly measured in feet but official documents use metres. Body temperature is still sometimes measured in degrees [[Fahrenheit]]. Industries like the construction and the real estate industry still use both the metric and the imperial system though it is more common for sizes of homes to be given in square feet and land in acres. Bulk cotton is sold by the ''candy'' (0.35 imperial tons, or 355.62&amp;nbsp;kg) or the ''bale'' (170&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name="lamar.colostate.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Acharya, Anil Kumar 1958"&gt;Acharya, Anil Kumar. ''History of Decimalisation Movement in India'', Auto-Print &amp; Publicity House, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indian English|Standard Indian English]], as in [[Australian English|Australian]], [[Singaporean English|Singaporean]], and [[British English]], metric units such as the litre (liter), metre (meter), and metric tonne (ton) utilise the traditional spellings brought over from [[French language|French]], which differ from those used in the [[American English|United States]] and the [[Philippine English|Philippines]]. The imperial long ton is invariably spelt with one 'n'. (See [[English in the Commonwealth of Nations]] for more information).&lt;ref name="Acharya, Anil Kumar 1958"/&gt;

===Hong Kong===

[[Hong Kong]] has three main systems of [[units of measurement]] in current use:

* The [[Chinese units of measurement]] of the [[Qing Empire]] (no longer in widespread use in China);
* British imperial units; and
* The [[metric system]].

In 1976 the [[Hong Kong Government]] started the conversion to the metric system, and as of 2012 measurements for government purposes, such as road signs, are almost always in metric units. However, all three systems are officially permitted for trade,&lt;ref name="Ordinance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/68/sch2.html|title=CAP 68 WEIGHTS AND MEASURES ORDINANCE Sched 2 UNITS OF MEASUREMENT AND PERMITTED SYMBOLS  OR ABBREVIATIONS OF UNITS OF MEASUREMENT  LAWFUL FOR USE FOR TRADE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the wider society a mixture of all three systems prevails.

The Chinese system's most commonly used units for length are {{lang|zh|里}} (li), {{lang|zh|丈}} (tseung/cheung), {{lang|zh|尺}} (tsek/[[Shaku (unit)|chek]]), {{lang|zh|寸}} ([[tsun]]/chun), {{lang|zh|分}} ([[fen]]/fan) in descending scale order. These units are now rarely used in daily life, the imperial and metric systems being preferred. The imperial equivalents are written with the same basic Chinese characters as the Chinese system. In order to distinguish between the units of the two systems, the units can be prefixed with "Ying" ({{zh|t=英|y=Yīng}}) for the Imperial system and "Wa" ({{zh|t=華|y=Wàh}}) for the Chinese system. In writing, derived characters are often used, with an additional {{lang|zh|口}} (mouth) [[Kangxi radicals|radical]] to the left of the original Chinese character, for writing imperial units. The most commonly used units are the [[mile]] or "li" ({{zh|t=哩|y=léih}}), the [[yard]] or "ma" ({{zh|t=碼|y=máh}}), the [[Foot (unit)|foot]] or "chek" ({{zh|t=呎|y=chek}}), and the [[inch]] or "tsun" ({{zh|t=吋|y=chyun}}).

The traditional measure of flat area is the square foot ({{zh|t=方呎, 平方呎|y=fōng chek, pìhng fōng chek}}) of the imperial system, which is still in common use for real estate purposes. The measurement of agricultural plots and fields, however, is traditionally conducted in {{lang|zh|畝}} (mau) of the Chinese system.

For the measurement of volume, Hong Kong officially uses the metric system, though the gallon ({{lang|zh|加侖}}, ka-lun) is also occasionally used.

=== Canada ===
{{See also|Metrication in Canada}}
[[Image:GasCan.jpg|thumb|200px|A one US gallon gas can purchased near the US-Canada border. It shows equivalences in imperial gallons and litres.]]
During the 1970s, the metric system and SI units were introduced in Canada to replace the imperial system. Within the government, efforts to implement the metric system were extensive; almost any agency, institution, or function provided by the government uses SI units exclusively. Imperial units were eliminated from all road signs, although both systems of measurement will still be found on privately owned signs, such as the height warnings at the entrance of a [[Multi-storey car park|parkade]]. In the 1980s, momentum to fully convert to the metric system stalled when the government of [[Brian Mulroney]] was elected. There was heavy opposition to metrication and as a compromise the government maintains legal definitions for and allows use of imperial units as long as metric units are shown as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/W-6/sc:2//en#anchorsc:2 |title=Weights and Measures Act: Canadian units of measure |publisher=Justice Canada |accessdate=14 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605042528/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/W-6/sc%3A2//en |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there tends to be leniency in regards to fruits and vegetables being priced in imperial units only.
[[Environment Canada]] still offers an imperial unit option beside metric units, even though weather is typically measured and reported in metric units in the Canadian media. However, some radio stations near the United States border (such as [[CIMX]] and [[CIDR-FM|CIDR]]) primarily use imperial units to report the weather. Railways in Canada also continue to use Imperial units.

Imperial units are still used in ordinary conversation. Today, Canadians typically use a mix of metric and imperial measurements in their daily lives. However, the use of the metric and imperial systems varies by age. The older generation mostly uses the imperial system, while the younger generation more often uses the metric system. Newborns are measured in SI at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units. Drivers' licences use SI units. In livestock auction markets, cattle are sold in dollars per [[hundredweight]] (short), whereas hogs are sold in dollars per hundred kilograms. Imperial units still dominate in recipes, construction, house renovation and gardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwmaonline.com/Imperial%20Origins.htm|title=BRITISHWEIGHTS AND MEASURES ASSOCIATION|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Crepes+worth+savouring/4329610/story.html]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Scoring+brownie+points/4207369/story.html]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/news/Drinking+School/4367113/story.html]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homehardware.ca/en/cat/index.htm/Building-Supplies/Building-Materials/Fence-Products/_/N-nthr4|title=Home Hardware  - Building Supplies - Building Materials - Fence Products|publisher=|access-date=5 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629070126/http://www.homehardware.ca/en/cat/index.htm/Building-Supplies/Building-Materials/Fence-Products/_/N-nthr4|archive-date=29 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land is now surveyed and registered in metric units, although initial surveys used imperial units. For example, partitioning of farm land on the prairies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was done in imperial units; this accounts for imperial units of distance and area retaining wide use in the [[Prairie Provinces]]. The size of most apartments, condominiums and houses continues to be described in square feet rather than square metres, and carpet or flooring tile is purchased by the square foot. Motor-vehicle fuel consumption is reported in both litres per 100&amp;nbsp;km and statute miles per imperial gallon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oee.nrcan.gc.ca/transportation/tools/fuelratings/ratings-search.cfm?attr=8|title=Fuel Consumption Ratings Search Tool - Conventional Vehicles|first=Government of Canada, Natural Resources|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the erroneous impression that Canadian vehicles are 20% more fuel-efficient than their apparently identical American counterparts for which fuel economy is reported in statute miles per US gallon (neither country specifies which gallon is used). Canadian railways maintain exclusive use of imperial measurements to describe train length (feet), train height (feet), capacity ([[Short ton|tons]]), speed (mph), and trackage (miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/rail/1996/r96w0171/r96w0171.asp|title=Railway Investigation Report R96W0171|first=Government of Canada, Transportation Safety Board of|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imperial units also retain common use in firearms and ammunition. Imperial measures are still used in the description of cartridge types, even when the cartridge is of relatively recent invention (e.g., [[.204 Ruger]], [[.17 HMR]], where the calibre is expressed in decimal fractions of an inch). However, ammunition that is already classified in metric is still kept metric (e.g., [[9×19mm]]). In the manufacture of ammunition, bullet and powder weights are expressed in terms of [[grain (measure)|grains]] for both metric and imperial cartridges.

As in most of the western world, air navigation is based on ''nautical'' units, e.g., the nautical mile, which is neither imperial nor metric, though altitude is still measured in imperial feet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langleyflyingschool.com/Pages/Canadian%20Aviation%20Regulations.html#Altimeter%20Rules|title=Canadian Aviation Regulations, Langley Flying School.

===Australia===
[[Metrication in Australia]] has largely ended the official use of imperial units, though for particular measurements (such as flight altitudes{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and nominal sizes of computer and television screens) international use of imperial units is still followed.  In licensed venues, draught beer and cider is sold in glasses and jugs with [[beer in Australia#Sizes|sizes]] based on the imperial fluid ounce though rounded to the nearest 5&amp;nbsp;mL.

===New Zealand===
{{Main|Metrication in New Zealand}}
Although New Zealand completed metrication in the 1970s, a study of university students undertaken in 1992 found a continued use of imperial units for birth weight and human height alongside metric units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychology.org.nz/cms_show_download.php?id=785 "Human use of metric measures of length"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209034410/http://www.psychology.org.nz/cms_show_download.php?id=785 |date=9 February 2013 }}. Dignan, J. R. E., &amp; O'Shea, R. P. (1995). New Zealand Journal of Psychology, '''24''', 21–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In aviation, altitude and airport elevation are measured in feet whilst navigation is done in [[nautical mile]]s; all other aspects (fuel quantity, aircraft weight, runway length, etc.) use metric units.

Screen sizes for devices such as televisions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.noelleeming.co.nz/buying-guides/tv-buying-guide.html|title=TV buying guide|website=Noel Leeming|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, monitors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.harveynorman.co.nz/computers/monitors/|title=Shop for Monitor, Computer Monitors, Computer Monitor|website=Harvey Norman|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and phones&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spark.co.nz/shop/mobile/phones|title=Mobile Phones, Smartphones {{!}} Spark NZ|website=www.spark.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and wheel rim sizes for vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridgestonetyrecentre.co.nz/tyres/how-to-read-your-tyre-size|title=Tyre Sizes {{!}} How To Read Your Tyre Size {{!}} Dimensions Explained|website=www.bridgestonetyrecentre.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, are stated in inches, as is the convention in the rest of the world.

===Ireland===
{{Main|Metrication in Ireland}}
Ireland has officially changed over to the metric system since entering the [[European Union]], with distances on new road signs being metric since 1997 and speed limits being metric since 2005. The imperial system remains in limited use – for sales of beer in pubs (traditionally sold by the pint). All other goods are required by law to be sold in metric units, although old quantities are retained for some goods like butter and sausages, which are sold in 454-gram (1&amp;nbsp;lb) packaging. The majority of cars sold pre-2005 feature speedometers with miles per hour as the primary unit, but with a kilometres per hour display as well.

===Other countries===
Full imperial measurements are used in Palau, Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Belize. Some imperial measurements remain in limited use in [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[South Africa]]. Measurements in feet and inches, especially for a person's height, are frequently encountered in conversation and non-governmental publications.

Prior to metrication, it was a common practice in Malaysia for people to refer to unnamed locations and small settlements along major roads by referring to how many miles the said locations were located from the nearest major town. In some cases, these eventually became the official names of the locations; in other cases, such names have been largely or completely superseded by new names. An example of the former is Batu 32 (literally "Mile 32" in [[Malay language|Malay]]), which refers to the area surrounding the intersection between [[Malaysia Federal Route 22|Federal Route 22]] (the [[Tamparuli]]-[[Sandakan]] highway) and [[Malaysia Federal Route 13|Federal Route 13]] (the Sandakan-[[Tawau]] highway). The area is so named because it is 32 miles west of Sandakan, the nearest major town.

Petrol is still sold by the imperial gallon in [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Belize]], [[Myanmar]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Montserrat]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis|St Kitts and Nevis]] and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]. The [[United Arab Emirates]] Cabinet in 2009 issued the Decree No. (270 / 3) specifying that, from 1 January 2010, the new unit sale price for petrol will be the litre and not the gallon. This in line with the UAE Cabinet Decision No. 31 of 2006 on the national system of measurement, which mandates the use of International System of units as a basis for the legal units of measurement in the country.&lt;ref name="gas7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agriculture.gov.gd/newsitem.aspx?nid=375 |title=The Government of Grenada – The Ministry of Agriculture |accessdate=15 January 2008 |quote=he price of gasoline at the pumps was fixed at EC$7.50 per imperial gallon... |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324183215/http://agriculture.gov.gd/newsitem.aspx?nid=375 |archivedate=24 March 2008 }}, {{cite web|url=http://mof.gov.bz/faqresults.asp?category=SUPPLIES+CONTROL&amp;question=39 |title=Belize Ministry of Finance::FAQ |accessdate=15 January 2008 |publisher=Belize Ministry of Finance |quote=#Kerosene per US Gallon (per Imperial gallon)#Gasoline (Regular)(per imperial Gallon)# Gasoline (Premium) (per Imperial Gallon)#Diesel (per Imperial Gallon) }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gas5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antigua-barbuda.com/business_politics/budget_speeches/budget_speech_2001.asp |title=The High Commission Antigua and Barbuda |accessdate=15 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131213551/http://www.antigua-barbuda.com/business_politics/budget_speeches/budget_speech_2001.asp |archivedate=31 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, {{cite web|url=http://www.international-fuel-prices.com/downloads/FuelPrices2005.pdf |title=FuelPrices2005 |accessdate=15 January 2008 |format=PDF |page=96 |publisher=German Technical Cooperation }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sierra Leone switched to selling fuel by the litre in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Sierra Leone Embassy to the United States [http://embassyofsierraleone.net/node/54 INTRODUCTION OF THE METRIC SYSTEM AND THE PRICE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165159/http://embassyofsierraleone.net/node/54 |date=29 April 2015 }} Retrieved 23 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, the Antigua and Barbuda government announced the re-launch of the Metrication Programme in accordance with the Metrology Act 2007, which established the International System of Units as the legal system of units. The Antigua and Barbuda government has committed to a full conversion from the imperial system by the first quarter of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minister Lovell Addresses Metric Conversions |url=http://www.caribarena.com/antigua/news/economy/98673-minister-lovell-addresses-metric-conversions.html |newspaper=CARIBARENA Antigua |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020040638/http://www.caribarena.com/antigua/news/economy/98673-minister-lovell-addresses-metric-conversions.html |archivedate=20 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2594">'''Interpretivism''' is a school of thought in contemporary [[jurisprudence]] and the [[philosophy of law]]. 

==Overview==
[[File:Ronald Dworkin at the Brooklyn Book Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ronald Dworkin]] is often associated with interpretivism.]]
The main claims of interpretivism are that 
*Law is not a set of given data, [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] or physical facts, but what [[lawyer]]s aim to construct or obtain in their [[Practice_of_law|practice]]. This marks a first difference between interpretivism and [[legal positivism]]. But the refusal that law be a set of ''given'' entities opposes interpretivism to [[natural law]] too.
*There is no separation between law and [[morality]], although there are differences. This is not in accordance with the main claim of legal positivism.
*Law is not [[Immanence|immanent]] in nature nor do legal values and principles exist independently and outside of the legal practice itself. This is the opposite of the main claim of natural law theory.

In the [[English language|English]] speaking world, interpretivism is usually identified with [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s thesis on the nature of [[law]] as discussed in his text titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'', which is sometimes seen as a third way between natural law and legal positivism. 

The concept also includes continental [[legal hermeneutics]] and authors such as [[Helmut Coing]] and [[Emilio Betti]]. Legal hermeneutics can be seen as a branch of philosophical [[hermeneutics]], whose main authors in the 20th century are [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]], both drawing on [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Hermeneutics has now expanded to many varied areas of research in the [[social sciences]] as an alternative to a conventionalist approach.

In a wider sense, interpretivism includes even the theses of, in chronological order, [[Josef Esser]], [[Theodor Viehweg]], [[Chaim Perelman]], [[Wolfgang Fikentscher]], [[António Castanheira Neves|Castanheira Neves]], [[Friedrich Müller (jurist)|Friedrich Müller]], [[Aulis Aarnio]] and [[Robert Alexy]].

[[File:Love without locks campaign, Passerelle Debilly, Paris 1 November 2016.jpg|thumb|Love without locks campaign, Passerelle Debilly, Paris]]
A '''love lock''' or  '''love padlock''' is a [[padlock]] which [[Significant other|sweethearts]] lock to a [[bridge]], [[fence]], [[gate]], [[monument]], or similar public fixture to symbolize their love.&lt;ref name='bbc-rome'&gt;{{cite news | first = Dana | last = Enulescu | title = Rome mayor in 'love padlock' row | date = 1 March 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6408635.stm | work = [[BBC]] | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the sweethearts' names or initials, and perhaps the date, are inscribed on the padlock, and its key is thrown away (often into the nearby river) to symbolize unbreakable love.

Since the 2000s, love locks have proliferated at an increasing number of locations worldwide. They are now mostly treated by municipal authorities as litter or [[vandalism]], and there is some cost to their removal. However, there are authorities who embrace them, and who use them as fundraising projects or tourist attractions.

== History ==
[[File:Karlův most, removing love padlocks.jpg|thumb|Removing love locks at [[Charles Bridge]] in [[Prague]]]]
The history of love padlocks dates back at least 100 years to a melancholic Serbian tale of [[World War I]], with an attribution for the bridge [[Most Ljubavi]] (lit. the ''Bridge of Love'') in the [[Spa towns in Serbia|spa town]] of [[Vrnjačka Banja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rubin|first=Alissa|title=On Bridges in Paris, Clanking With Love|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/world/europe/on-bridges-in-paris-clanking-with-love.html?_r=0|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local schoolmistress named ''Nada'', who was from Vrnjačka Banja, fell in love with a Serbian officer named ''Relja''. After they committed to each other Relja went to war in [[Greece]] where he fell in love with a local woman from [[Corfu]]. As a consequence, Relja and Nada broke off their engagement. Nada never recovered from that devastating blow, and after some time she died due to heartbreak from her unfortunate love.{{citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=For All since the last citation}}

As young women from [[Vrnjačka Banja]] wanted to protect their own loves, they started writing down their names, with the names of their loved ones, on [[padlock]]s and affixing them to the railings of the bridge where Nada and Relja used to meet.&lt;ref name="vrnjackabanja.biz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most ljubavi |url=http://www.vrnjackabanja.biz/mostljubavi.php|website=Vrnjackabanja.biz|accessdate=6 October 2010|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ogrizović|first=Slobodan|title=Vrnjačka banja, najveće lečilište u Srbiji|url=http://www.b92.net/putovanja/destinacije/evropa.php?yyyy=2009&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=22&amp;nav_category=823&amp;nav_id=356735|accessdate=6 October 2010|newspaper=B92|date=22 April 2009|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rest of Europe, love padlocks started appearing in the early 2000s as a [[ritual]] or [[epidemy]].&lt;ref name='ind-paris'&gt;{{cite news | first = Louisa | last = Long | title = Love-locks return to the bridges of Paris | date = 6 June 2011 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/lovelocks-return-to-the-bridges-of-paris-2293506.html | work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons love padlocks started to appear vary between locations and in many instances are unclear. However, in [[Rome]], the ritual of affixing love padlocks to the bridge [[Ponte Milvio]] can be attributed to the 2006 book [[:it:Ho voglia di te (romanzo)|''I Want You'']] by Italian author [[Federico Moccia]], who made a [[film]] adaptation in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Ian Fischer |date=6 August 2007|title=In Rome, a New Ritual on an Old Bridge|journal=[[The New York Times|New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/world/europe/06rome.html|accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='ponte'&gt;{{cite news | first = Justin | last = Demetri | title = The Bridge of Love in Rome | year = 2008 | url = http://www.lifeinitaly.com/tourism/lazio/milvian-bridge.asp | website=Lifeinitaly.com | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to Get Your Ex-Girlfriend Back Advice|url=https://myrelationshipscenter.com/get-your-ex-girlfriend-back/|website=Myrelationshipscenter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable locations and controversies ==
[[File:Moscow-love-padlocks.jpg|thumb|right|One of many purpose-built iron trees on a bridge across the [[Vodootvodny Canal]] in Moscow completely covered in love padlocks.]]
In many cities, love locking has been classified an act of [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |url=http://theconversation.com/the-lock-of-love-how-leaving-padlocks-became-a-modern-day-romantic-ritual-72140 |title=Forbidden love|website=Theconversation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In several countries, the local authorities and owners of various landmarks have expressed concern often have the padlocks removed:
[[File:Telemly avant apres.png|thumb|Love padlocks in Algiers have been removed by youths]]
* In [[Algiers]] love padlocks were added in September 2013 to a bridge that was previously known as the "[[suicide bridge]]" in Telemly, a district of Algiers. Some youths brought tools to remove them by night a few days later,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algerie-focus.com/blog/2013/09/alger-le-pont-damour-redevient-le-pont-des-suicides/ Alger : le pont "d’amour" redevient le pont des "suicidés"] Algérie focus.2013-09-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Missous|first1=Naila|title=Algeria's controversial bridge of love|url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/features/algerias-controversial-bridge-of-love_18186|accessdate=14 July 2014|publisher=Your Middle East|date=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a video was made by an imam saying that love padlocks are forbidden in Islam.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
[[File:Love-locks in Suseong Lake, Daegu.jpg|thumb|Love locks in Suseong Lake, Daegu, South Korea]]
* Authorities in [[Canberra]], Australia, decided in February 2015 to remove love locks from a bridge that was becoming a popular location to affix them, and from other locations in Canberra. Justifications given for the decision were the possibility of future threats to public safety from eventual overloading of the bridge with a mass of padlocks, and structural interference resulting from corrosion. A bridge in Paris was mentioned by authorities as an example of an overloaded bridge, a probable reference to the [[Pont des Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Love locks to be removed from National Carillon footbridge in Canberra|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-02/love-locks-to-be-removed-from-carillion-footbridge-in-canberra/6064200|accessdate=2 February 2015|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation News]]|date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 2015, council authorities in [[Melbourne]], Australia, began removing love locks from Southgate footbridge due to safety concerns. Around 22,000 love locks were reported to have been fixed to the railings, causing cables to sag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Melbourne love locks: Council cuts padlocks off Southgate footbridge to save structure|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-20/melbourne-city-council-cuts-love-locks-off-southgate-footbridge/6483880|accessdate=20 May 2015|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation News]]|date=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Toowoomba]], Australia, love locks have been appearing at [[Picnic Point, Toowoomba|Picnic Point]], a heritage-listed tourist attraction featuring a park and lookout at the top of the [[Great Dividing Range]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Romantics secure their love locks|url=http://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/romantics-secure-their-love-locks/2071254/|accessdate=14 November 2014|newspaper=[[Toowoomba Chronicle]]|date=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, love padlocks appearing along the [[Wild Pacific Trail]] in [[Ucluelet]] on [[Vancouver Island]], have caused controversy as some{{who|date=October 2017}} regard them as a distraction from nature. Love padlocks were removed from the [[Humber Bay Arch Bridge]] in Toronto, due to concerns over aesthetics and structural concerns if the Bridge were to become a love padlock destination.&lt;ref name='can'&gt;{{cite news | first = Yasmin | last = Aboelsaud | title = Accidental locks of love on Wild Pacific Trail | date = 6 January 2011 | url = http://www2.canada.com/westerly/news/story.html?id=dfbfc1bc-6501-4258-9854-ad2afe035e68 | work = Westerly News | accessdate = 19 August 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120905142909/http://www2.canada.com/westerly/news/story.html?id=dfbfc1bc-6501-4258-9854-ad2afe035e68 | archivedate = 5 September 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Love Padlocks on the Corktown Footbridge in Ottawa, August 14th, 2017.jpg|thumb|Love padlocks attached to the railing of Corktown Footbridge]] 
* In the [[United States]], in [[De Pere, Wisconsin|De Pere]], Wisconsin, at Voyageur Park, locks are being attached to a lookout called Sunset Point. In [[Canfield, Ohio]], the BIG LOCK was installed in 2014 as a community art project at the Canfield Fairgrounds. Visitors are encouraged to add a personalized lock to the 12' x 12' steel-cage rooster.  The Canfield Fair is one of the largest county fairs in the country, and the rooster its official symbol. The name BIG LOCK is a play on words, referencing the Big Rock, which is also a highly referenced symbol of the Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Kalea|title=BIG LOCK encourages Canfield fairgoers to share fair love|url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2014/aug/27/big-lock-offers-chance-to-share-love-for|website=Vindy.com|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City a group of [[locksport]] enthusiasts organized to remove locks from the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/10/picking-the-bridge.html|title=Picking the Bridge|author=Geoff Manaugh|date=11 October 2013|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Las Vegas]], a 1/2 scale model of the [[Eiffel Tower]] located at the [[Paris Hotel]] on the famed [[Las Vegas Strip]] has inspired visitors to place lovers' locks on the walkway out to the elevators to the top of the tower. Visitors are told not to throw the key from the tower and locks sold in the lobby are opened and provided for a fee without a key to prevent this practice. People are actually encouraged to leave their locks on chains strung between posts at Lover's Lock Plaza in [[Lovelock, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loverslock.com|title=Lovelock Nevada|website=Loverslock.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the town is unrelated to the love locks, it was named after a family that settled in the area in the 1860s. The town didn't adopt the practice until much later. In San Angelo, TX, the city has erected a sculpture "Forever Love" inspired by other "love locks" such as (formerly) the bridge in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanangelolive.com/news/entertainment/2015-10-24/exploring-san-angelo%E2%80%99s-haunted-bridge|title=Exploring San Angelo’s Haunted Bridge|date=24 October 2015|website=Sanangleolive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/lone-wolf-bridge-home-to-new-public-art-work-ep-305688106-355143201.html|title=Lone Wolf Bridge home to new public art work|website=Gosanangelo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Discovery Bay, California|Discovery Bay]], a small town in Northern California, a lover's bridge was created by newlyweds Carolyn and Anthony George in 2011.  The couple was married on 11-11-11, and after seeing the movie "[[Now You See Me (film)|Now you see me]]" got the idea to create a location for lovers to be "locked in love", by putting a love lock on the bridge and throwing the keys into the California Delta waterways that surround Discovery Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thepress.net/news/romance-is-a-lock-in-discovery-bay/article_8e395e9a-3abf-11e4-8dc9-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Romance is a lock in Discovery Bay|last=Schrader|first=Amy|website=Thepress.net|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lovelocks on pont des Arts, Paris.jpg|thumb|Love padlocks on [[Pont des Arts]], Paris]]
* In France, in May 2010 the city of Paris expressed concern over the growing number of love-locks on the [[Pont des Arts]], [[Passerelle Léopold-Sédar-Senghor]], and the [[Pont de l'Archevêché]] bridges, stating: "they raise problems for the preservation of our architectural heritage". The lovelocks of the Pont des Arts disappeared during the night of 11 May 2010; they had been removed by a student of the nearby [[École des Beaux-Arts]] to make a sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kumo09.blogspot.ca/2010/07/500-ou-sont-passes-les-cadenas-du-pont.html « Où sont passés les cadenas du pont des Arts »], [[Les Nuages Bleus]], 20 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Love locks immediately began appearing on the [[Pont de l'Archevêché]]&lt;ref name='ind-paris' /&gt; and have since spread to at least 11 Seine bridges, the Canal Saint Martin footbridges, and to parks and monuments all over the city. Many tourists mistakenly believe this is a longstanding Parisian tradition, not realizing the practice only migrated into Paris in late 2008 after affecting cities in Italy and Asia. In January 2014, a campaign and petition, No Love Locks™,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nolovelocks.com|title=NO LOVE LOCKS™|website=Nolovelocks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by two Americans living in Paris in an effort to save the city's historic bridges and monuments from the overwhelming number of locks. The international media attention the campaign received has been credited with the actions begun in the summer and fall of 2014, when the city began seeking alternatives to love locks and asking the public to stop placing locks on Parisian bridges and monuments. On 9 May 2014, the weight of the padlocks on the Pont Des Arts bridge was blamed for the collapse of part of the [[parapet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Urquhart|first1=Wendy|title='Lovelocks' collapse Paris bridge rail|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27758940|accessdate=14 July 2014|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city began an experiment in September 2014 on the Pont des Arts, replacing three panels with a special type of glass that would prevent locks from being attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/world/europe/paris-falls-out-of-love-with-the-padlocks-on-its-bridges.html|title=Paris Falls Out of Love With the Padlocks on Its Bridges|date=21 September 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 2015, the locks were taken down due to the collapsing of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Paris Bridge's Love Locks Are Taken Down|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/world/europe/paris-bridges-locks-of-love-taken-down.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1 June 2015|access-date = 1 June 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Alissa J.|last = Rubin|first2 = Aurelien|last2 = Breeden}}&lt;/ref&gt; A website called Passion Locks exists, a tribute to [[Pont des Arts]], where users can send others a virtual love lock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Tarczynski|title=Passion Locks|url=http://www.passionlocks.com|website=Passionlocks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]], after inviting the public to attach love locks on the [[Chain Bridge (Bamberg)|Kettenbrücke]] in 2011, officials threatened to remove them during the same year due to rust. After public outrage and several township meetings, the locks remain. In [[Berlin]], applying a lock to a bridge is a misdemeanor and can generate cautionary fines up to 35 euros. Historical bridges are especially affected, as it disturbs the visual impression, and can even cause an electrolytic corrosion of noble brass of the locks against the baser iron bridges, leading to rust damage. Rust damage was noted in [[Lübeck]] at the [[Obertrave]] bridge. In addition, damage in removing the locks is seen by municipalities as a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/auf-ewige-liebe/4893848.html|title=Auf ewige Liebe – Welt – Tagesspiegel|website=Tagesspiegel.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deutsche Bahn]], the bridge's operator, threatened to have the locks removed from the [[Hohenzollern Bridge]] in [[Cologne]], but in the end relented in the face of public opposition.&lt;ref name='dw'&gt;{{cite news | first = Sarah | last = Stolarz | title = Cologne Gets a Lock on Love | date = 2 September 2009 | url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4008316,00.html | work = Deutsche Welle | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelocks are now embraced on the bridge, and visitors are directed to them on the city tourism site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cologne.de/what-to-do/sightseeing/love-locks.html|title=Love locks|website=Cologne.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hamburg]] this [[ritual]] was also spread among [[bridge]]s and [[lighthouse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamburg-travel.com/attractions/culture-in-hamburg/culture-from-a-to-z/schwanenwikbruecke/|title=Schwanenwikbrücke|website=Hamburg-travel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Florence]], Italy, 5,500 love padlocks affixed to the [[Ponte Vecchio]] bridge were removed by the city council. According to the council the padlocks both pose an aesthetic problem in addition to scratching and denting the metal of the bridge.&lt;ref name='flor'&gt;{{cite news | title = Florence tries to stamp out locks of love | date = 1 May 2006 | url = http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy/tuscany/florence-tries-stamp-out-locks-love | work = Italy Mag | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Venice]] is among cities where affixing padlocks to bridges is strictly prohibited.

* In [[Dublin]], Ireland, padlocks on the [[Ha'penny Bridge]] over the [[River Liffey]] were removed by the Dublin City Council in early 2012. The padlocks could damage the protected structure, the Council has said. "This seems to have only started happening in the last few months and we're asking people not to do it," said a spokesperson for Dublin City Council. Some locks have also been removed from the [[Millennium Bridge (Dublin)|Millennium Bridge]], close to the [[Ha'penny Bridge]] in the city centre, the Council said. The padlocks have been criticised for being an eyesore on public structures. They can also cause further damage when they have to be removed, the Council said. The spokesperson confirmed that the Council will continue to remove the locks from any bridges they appear on in the city centre.&lt;ref name='dub'&gt;{{cite news | title = Where's the love?

* In Scotland, a "Mark your Spot" campaign was launched by the Edinburgh City Council on the [[Forth Road Bridge]]. 4 sets of panels on the bridge itself were dedicated to Lovelocks, with both locals and tourists buying and affixing locks to them.

Couples are welcome to affix padlocks to the bridge there.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} To celebrate their meeting in Japan, Jonathan Montagu and [[Nathalie Daoust]] commissioned artist Clare Grotefeld to design and create a giant [[bonsai]] love lock tree for their wedding on 4 October 2014.

The 125-year-old delicate cast-iron Listed [[Ferry Bridge, Burton|Ferry Bridge, Burton-on-Trent]] was refurbished (2015-2016) at considerable expense. Within days a love lock was affixed to the bridge, but it was quickly removed, as such items are unsightly, a hazard, add to the load on the structure, and are not allowed under the Listing Regulations.  Any that do get affixed are removed at once.

== Legends and superstitions ==
On some locations the padlocks have been given almost legendary or superstitious character:
* In [[Fengyuan]], Taiwan, love padlocks affixed to an overpass at [[Fengyuan railway station|the city's train station]] are often affixed in pairs. These locks are known as "wish locks" and local legend holds that the magnetic field generated by trains passing underneath will cause energy to accumulate in the locks and fulfill the wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Chang Jui-chen |year=2009 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2009/06/08/2003445646 |title='Wish lock' phenomenon attracts youth to Fengyuan |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] |accessdate=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On a fountain in [[Montevideo]] in Uruguay, a plaque is affixed to the front of the fountain that provides an explanation in both English and Spanish. The English version of the text reads, "''The legend of this young fountain tells us that if a lock with the initials of two people in love is placed in it, they will return together to the fountain and their love will be forever locked.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inspiringtravellers.com/montevideos-locks-fountain/|title=Montevideo's Locks Fountain|website=Inspiringtravellers.com|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the carnal desire}}

[[File:Jheronimus Bosch Table of the Mortal Sins (Luxuria).jpg|thumb|right|280px|Detail: ''Luxuria'' (Lust), in ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'', by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]]]
{{emotion}}
'''Lust''' is a psychological force producing intense wanting for an object, or circumstance fulfilling the emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lazarus with Bernice N Lazarus, ''Passion and Reason: Making Sense of Our Emotions'', 1994, New York: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-19-510461-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lust can take any form such as the lust for sexuality, money or power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food as distinct from the need for food.

==In religion==

Religions, especially Christianity, tend to draw a distinction between passion and lust by further categorizing lust as an inappropriate desire or a desire that is inappropriately strong, and therefore morally wrong, whereas passion (for proper purposes)  is maintained to be something God-given and moral.

===Buddhism===
{{Main article|tanha}}

Lust holds a critical position in the philosophical underpinnings of Buddhist reality.  It is named in the second of the [[Four Noble Truths]], which are that 
# Suffering ([[dukkha]]) is inherent in all life.
# Suffering is caused by ''lust''.
# There is a natural way to eliminate all suffering from one's life.
# The [[Noble Eightfold Path]] is that way.

Lust is the, attachment to, identification with, and passionate desire for certain things in existence, all of which relate to the [[Five skandhas#The five skandhas|form, sensation, perception, mentality, and consciousness]] that certain combinations of these things engender within us. Lust is thus the ultimate cause of general imperfection and the most immediate ''root'' cause of a certain suffering.

The passionate desire for either non-existence or for freedom from lust is a common misunderstanding. For example, the headlong pursuit of lust (or other "[[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]]") in order to fulfill a [[death instinct|desire for death]] is followed by a reincarnation accompanied by a self-fulfilling [[karma]], resulting in an endless [[wheel of life]], until the right way to live, the right worldview, is somehow discovered and practiced. Beholding an [[endless knot]] puts one, symbolically, in the position of the one with the right worldview, representing that person who attains freedom from lust.

In existence are four kinds of things that engender the clinging: rituals, worldviews, pleasures, and the self.  The way to eliminate lust is to learn of its unintended effects and to pursue righteousness as concerns a worldview, intention, speech, behavior, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration, in the place where lust formerly sat.
[[File:Sankt_Bartholomäus_(Reichenthal)_04.jpg|left|thumb|156x156px|Detail of ''Lust'' at the [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Sankt Bartholomäus]] church ([[Reichenthal]]), [[Pulpit]] (1894)]]

===Christianity===
==== New Testament ====
In many translations of the [[New Testament]], the word "lust" translates the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω, particularly in [[Matthew 5:27-28]]:
{{"|Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust (ἐπιθυμέω) after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.}}

In English-speaking countries, the term "lust" is often associated with [[sexual desire]], probably because of this verse. But just as the English word was originally a general term for ''desire'', the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω was also a general term for desire. The [[LSJ]] lexicon suggests "set one's heart upon a thing, long for, covet, desire" as glosses for ἐπιθυμέω, which is used in verses that clearly have nothing to do with sexual desire. In the [[Septuagint]], ἐπιθυμέω is the word used in the commandment to not covet:

{{"|You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; you shall not covet your neighbor's house or his field or his male slave or his female slave or his ox or his draft animal or any animal of his or whatever belongs to your neighbor.|Exodus 20:17, New English Translation of the Septuagint}}

While coveting your neighbor's wife may involve sexual desire, it's unlikely that coveting a neighbor's house or field is sexual in nature. And in most New Testament uses, the same Greek word, ἐπιθυμέω, does not have a clear sexual connotation. For example, from the [[American Standard Version]] the same word is used outside of any sexual connotation:

# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#13:17|Matthew 13:17]]: For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men ''desired'' to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:15|Luke 22:15-16]]: And he said unto them, With ''desire'' I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#20:33|Acts 20:33]]: I ''coveted'' no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#15:14|Luke 15:14-16]]: And when [the [[prodigal son]]] had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he ''would fain'' have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

====Catholicism====
[[File:Daemon.jpg|left|thumb|A demon [[masturbation|satiating his lust]] in a 13th-century manuscript]]
[[File:La Luxure dans l'art roman.JPG|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] representing lust]]

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], a Christian's heart is lustful when "venereal satisfaction is sought for either outside wedlock or, at any rate, in a manner which is contrary to the laws that govern marital intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Lust}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] said that lust devalues the eternal attraction of male and female, reducing personal riches of the opposite sex to an object for gratification of sexuality.&lt;ref name="PopeJohn"&gt;Pope John Paul II, ''Mutual Attraction Differs from Lust''.L'Osservatore Romano, Weekly Edition in English, 22 September 1980, p. 11. Available at http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2tb39.htm .&lt;/ref&gt;

Lust is considered by [[Catholicism]] to be a disordered desire for [[sexual pleasure]], where sexual pleasure is "sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes".&lt;ref&gt;'Catechism of the Catholic Church, n° 2351 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; In Catholicism, sexual desire in itself is good, and is considered part of God's plan for humanity. However, when sexual desire is separated from God's love, it becomes disordered and self-seeking. This is seen as lust.

The Latin for ''extravagance'' (Latin: ''luxuria'') was used by St [[Jerome]] to translate a variety of biblical sins, including drunkenness and sexual excess.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory the Great]] placed ''luxuria'' as one of the seven capital sins (it is often considered the least serious of the seven deadly sins), narrowing its scope to disordered desire,&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 39-40; [https://www.academia.edu/8268216/_Luxure_cléricale_gouvernement_de_l_Église_et_royauté_capétienne_au_temps_de_la_Bible_de_saint_Louis_Revue_Mabillon_25_2014_p._165-194 Julien Théry, "Luxure cléricale, gouvernement de l’Église et royauté capétienne au temps de la 'Bible de saint Louis'", ''Revue Mabillon'', 25, 2014, p. 165-194]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was in this sense that the Middle Ages generally took ''luxuria'', (although the [[Old French]] [[cognate]] was [[loan word|adopted]] into English as ''luxury'' without its sexual meaning by the 14th century{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}).

In [[Romanesque art]], the [[Anthropomorphism|personified]] Luxuria is generally feminine,&lt;ref&gt;J. Jerman/A. Weir, ''Images of Lust'' (2013) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; often represented by a [[siren (mythology)|siren]] or a naked woman with breasts being bitten by snakes. [[Prudentius]] in his [[Psychomachia]] or Battle of the Soul had described&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1968) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; Luxury, lavish of her ruined fame, Loose-haired, wild-eyed, her voice a dying fall, Lost in delight....&lt;/blockquote&gt; For [[Dante]], Luxuria was both the first of the circles of incontinence (or self-indulgence) on the descent into hell, and the last of the cornices of Mount Purgatory, representing the excessive (disordered) love of individuals;&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Hell' (1975) p. 101; Dante, ''Purgatory'' (1971) p. 67 and p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; while for [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] luxuria was synonymous with the power of desire.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Berry, ''The Idea of Luxury'' (1994) p. 97-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughters (by-products) of Luxuria, for Gregory and subsequent [[Thomism]], included mental blindness, self-love, haste and excessive attachment to the present:&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 37-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marianne Dashwood]] has been seen as embodying such characteristics for a later age – as a daughter of Luxuria.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Liddell, ''The Novels of Jane Austen'' (London 1963) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Lord [[Krishna]], an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], declared in verse 21 that lust is one of the gates to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] or hell.

{{Quote|[[Arjuna]] said: O descendant of Vrsni, by what is one impelled to [[sin]]ful acts, even unwillingly, as if engaged by force? Then Krishna said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into [[wrath]], and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world. As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust. Thus the wise living entity's pure [[consciousness]] becomes covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire. The [[senses]], the [[mind]] and the [[intelligence]] are the sitting places of this lust. Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him. Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bharatas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of [[sin]]—(lust) by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of [[knowledge]] and [[self-realization]]. The working [[senses]] are superior to dull [[matter]]; [[mind]] is higher than the [[senses]]; [[intelligence]] is still higher than the [[mind]]; and he [the soul] is even higher than the [[intelligence]]. Thus knowing oneself to be [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] to the material senses, mind and intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one should steady the mind by deliberate [[Spirituality|spiritual]] intelligence and thus—by spiritual strength—conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust. ([[Bhagavad-Gita]], 3.36–43)}}

In this ancient manuscript the idea behind the word 'Lust' is best comprehended as the psychological force called 'Wanting'.

====Brahma Kumaris====
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]], a spiritual organization which is based on [[Hindu philosophy]], sexual lust is the greatest enemy to all mankind&lt;ref&gt;''Through open doors: a view of Asian cultures in Kenya''. Cynthia Salvadori, Andrew Fedders, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and the gateway to hell.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring New Religions''. p. 196, George D. Chryssides, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason followers do not eat onions, garlic, eggs, or non-vegetarian food, as the "sulphur" in them can excite sexual lust in the body, otherwise bound to celibacy.

The physical act of sex is "impure", leading to body-consciousness and other crimes. This impurity "poisons" the body and leads to many kinds of "diseases".

The Brahma Kumaris teach that sexuality is like foraging about in a dark sewer. Students at Spiritual University must conquer lust in order to find the [[Golden Age]], a heaven on earth, where children are conceived by an asexual power of mind, and lasting for 2,500 years in the peace and purity of a holy swan moving on earth, over water, and in air.&lt;ref&gt;Peace &amp; purity: the story of the Brahma Kumaris : a spiritual revolution By [[Liz Hodgkinson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A history of celibacy'', p. 172. Elizabeth Abbott, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], intentional lascivious glances are forbidden. Lascivious thoughts are disliked, for they are the first step towards adultery, rape and other antisocial behaviors. [[Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] also stressed the magnitude of the "second glance", as the first glance towards an attractive member of the opposite sex could be just accidental or observatory, the second glance could be that gate into lustful thinking.&lt;ref&gt; [[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]],2701 "The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: "O Ali, do not follow a glance with another, for you will be forgiven for the first, but not for the second.".&lt;/ref&gt; Islam does not advocate [[celibacy]] but it requires marriage to conduct sex legally.

===Judaism===

{{main article|Yetzer hara#The evil inclination in Jewish tradition}}
In [[Judaism]], all evil inclinations and lusts of the flesh are characterized by ''[[Yetzer hara]]'' (Hebrew, יצר הרע, the evil inclination). Yetzer hara is not a demonic force; rather, it is man's misuse of the things which the physical body needs to survive, and is often contrasted with ''yetzer hatov'' (Hebrew, יצר הטוב, the positive desire).

''Yetzer HaRa'' is often identified with [[Satan]] and the angel of death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bava Bathra|pages=16a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is sometimes a tendency to give a personality and separate activity to the ''yetzer''. For the ''yetzer'', like Satan, misleads man in this world, and testifies against him in the world to come. The ''yetzer'' is, however, clearly distinguished from Satan, and on other occasions is made exactly parallel to sin. The [[Torah]] is considered the great antidote against this force. Though, like all things which God has made, the ''yetzer hara'' (evil inclination) can be manipulated into doing good: for without it, man would never marry, beget a child, build a house, or occupy himself in a trade.

===Paganism===

Few ancient, [[Paganism|pagan religions]] actually considered lust to be a vice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The most famous example of a widespread religious movement practicing lechery as a ritual is the [[Bacchanalia]] of the [[Ancient Roman]] [[Bacchantes]]. However, this activity was soon outlawed by the [[Roman Senate]] in 186 BC in the decree ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]''. The practice of sacred prostitution, however, continued to be an activity practiced often by the [[Dionysian]]s.

===Sikhism===

In [[Sikhism]], lust is counted among the five cardinal sins or sinful propensities, the others being [[Wrath]], ego, [[greed (deadly sin)|greed]] and [[Attachment theory|attachment]]. Uncontrollable expression of sexual lust, as in rape or [[sexual addiction]], is an evil.

===Meher Baba's teachings===

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] described the differences between lust and love:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In lust there is reliance upon the object of sense and consequent spiritual subordination of the soul to it, but love puts the soul into direct and co-ordinate relation with the reality which is behind the form. Therefore lust is experienced as being heavy and love is experienced as being light. In lust there is a narrowing down of life and in love there is an expansion in being...If you love the whole world you vicariously live in the whole world, but in lust there is an ebbing down of life and a general sense of hopeless dependence upon a form which is regarded as another. Thus, in lust there is the accentuation of separateness and suffering, but in love there is the feeling of unity and joy....&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org/ ''Discourses'']. Volume I. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. pp. 159–160. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In culture==

===Medieval prostitutes===

Medieval prostitutes lived officially sanctioned in "red light districts." In Ruth Mazo Karras' book ''Common Women'', she discusses the meaning of prostitution and how people thought the proper use of prostitutes by unmarried men helped contain male lust. Prostitution was thought of as having a beneficial effect by reducing the [[sexual frustration]] in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Karras, Ruth Mazo. Common Women: Prostitution and Sexuality in Medieval England. New York: Oxford UP, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In art ==

[[File:Mujeres riendo.jpg|right|thumb|[[Goya]]'s [[Man Mocked by Two Women]] (''Dos Mujeres y un hombre''), c. 1820]]

=== Literature ===

From [[Ovid]] to the works of ''[[poète maudit|les poètes maudits]]'', characters have always been faced with scenes of lechery, and long since has lust been a common motif in world literature. Many writers, such as [[Georges Bataille]], [[Casanova]] and [[Prosper Mérimée]], have written works wherein scenes at bordellos and other unseemly locales take place.

[[Baudelaire]], author of ''[[Les fleurs du mal]]'', had once remarked, in regard to the artist, that:

{{cquote|The more a man cultivates the arts, the less randy he becomes... Only the brute is good at coupling, and copulation is the lyricism of the masses. To copulate is to enter into another—and the artist never emerges from himself.}}

The most notable work to touch upon the sin of lust, and all of the Seven Deadly Sins, is Dante's ''[[la Divina Commedia]]''. Dante's criterion for lust was an "excessive love of others," insofar as an excessive love for man would render one's love of God secondary.

In the first canticle of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'', the lustful are punished by being continuously swept around in a whirlwind, which symbolizes their passions. The damned who are guilty of lust, like the two famous lovers, Paolo and Francesca, receive what they desired in their mortal lives, their passions never give them rest for all eternity. In ''[[Purgatorio]]'', of the selfsame work, the penitents choose to walk through flames in order to purge themselves of their lustful inclinations.

==In philosophy==

The link between [[love]] and lust has always been a problematic question in philosophy.

===Schopenhauer===

[[Schopenhauer]] notes the misery which results from [[sexual relationship]]s. According to him, this directly explains the sentiments of shame and sadness which tend to follow the act of sexual intercourse. For, he states, the only power that reigns is the inextinguishable desire to face, at any price, the blind love present in human existence without any consideration of the outcome. He estimates that a genius of his species is an industrial being who wants only to produce, and wants only to think. The theme of lust for Schopenhauer is thus to consider the horrors which will almost certainly follow the culmination of lust.

===St. Thomas Aquinas===

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]] defines the sin of Lust in questions 153 and 154 of his Summa Theologica. Aquinas says the sin of lust is of "voluptuous emotions," and makes the point that sexual pleasures, "unloosen the human spirit," and set aside right reason (Pg.191). Aquinas restricts lust's subject matter to physical desires specifically arising from sexual acts, but Aquinas does not assume all sex-acts are sinful. Sex is not a sin in marriage, because sex is the only way for humans to reproduce. If sex is used naturally and the end purpose is reproduction there is no sin. Aquinas says, "if the end be good and if what is done is well-adapted to that, then no sin is present," (Pg.193). However, sex simply for the sake of pleasure is lustful and therefore, a sin. A man who uses his body for lechery wrongs the Lord.

Sex may have the attributes of being sinless; however, when a person seeks sex for pleasure, he or she is sinning with lust. Lust is best defined by its specific attribute of rape, adultery, wet dreams, seduction, unnatural vice, and simple fornication.

[[Wet dreams]]: St. Thomas Aquinas defined and discussed the topic of nocturnal emission, which occurs when one dreams of physical pleasure. Aquinas argues those who say that wet dreams are a sin and comparable to the actual experience of sex are wrong. Aquinas believes that such an action is sinless, for a dream is not under a person's control or free judgment. When one has a "nocturnal orgasm," it is not a sin, but it can lead to sins (Pg. 227). Aquinas says that wet dreams come from a physical cause of inappropriate pictures within your imagination, a psychological cause when thinking of sex while you fall asleep and a demonical cause where by demons act upon the sleepers body, "stirring the sleeper's imagination to bring about a orgasm," (Pg. 225).  In the end, though, dreaming of lustful acts is not sinful. The "mind's awareness is less hindered," as the sleeper lacks right reason; therefore, a person cannot be accountable for what they dream while sleeping, (Pg. 227).

[[Adultery]]: One of the main forms of lust seen frequently during the Middle Ages was the sin of adultery. The sin of adultery occurs when a person is unfaithful to his or her spouse, hence "invading of a bed not one's own," (Pg.235). Adultery is a special kind of ugliness and many difficulties arise from it. When a man enters the bed of a married woman it not only is a sin, but it "wrongs the offspring," because the woman now calls into question the legitimacy of children. (Pg.235). If a wife has committed adultery before, then, her husband will question if all his wife's children are his offspring. 
	
[[Fornication|Simple fornication]]: Simple fornication is having sex with one's wife for enjoyment rather than for bearing children. Fornication is also sex between two unmarried people, which is also a mortal sin. Aquinas says, "fornication is a deadly crime," (Pg.213). Fornication is a mortal sin, but as Aquinas notes, "Pope Gregory treated sins of the flesh as less grievous than those of the spirit" (Pg. 217). Fornication was a grave sin such as that against property. Fornication, however, is not as grave as a sin directly against God and human life; therefore, murder is much worse than fornication. Property in this case means that a daughter is the property of her father, and if you do wrong to her, you then do wrong to him; therefore seducing a virgin or seeking pleasure from an unmarried woman is an invasion of a father's property.

[[Rape]]: Rape is a kind of lust that often coincides with seduction and is defined as a type of lechery. Rape comes with force and violence: Rape occurs when a person craves the pleasures of sex so intensely that he uses force to obtain it. Rape is committed when violence is used to seduce, or deflower a virgin. Rape harms both the unmarried girl and her father, because the girl is property of her father. Rape and seduction can be discussed together, because both sins involve the deflowering of a virgin; however, rape can happen without seduction, as when a man attacks a widow or a sexually experienced woman and violates her. Therefore, wherever violence accompanies sex, you have the quality of rape and the sin of lust.

[[Seduction]]: Seduction is a type of lust, because seduction is a sex act, which ravishes a virgin. Lust is a sin of sexual activity, and, "…a special quality of wrong that appears if a maid still under her father's care is debauched" (Pg.229). Seduction involves a discussion of property, as an unmarried girl is property of her father. A virgin, even though free from the bond of marriage, is not free from the bond of her family. When a virgin is violated without a promise of engagement, she is prevented from having honorable marriage, which is shameful to herself and her family. A man who performs sexual acts with a virgin must "endow her and have her to wife," and if the father, who is responsible for her, says no, then a man must pay a dowry to compensate for her loss of virginity and future chance of marriage. (Pg.229)

'''Unnatural vice:''' Unnatural vice is the worst kind of lust because it is unnatural in act and purpose. Unnatural vice happens variously, but Aquinas provides several examples including [[bestiality]] or intercourse with a "thing of another species," for example animals. Aquinas said, "bestiality goes beyond the bands of humanity" and is therefore, unnatural.

==Contemporary spiritual perspective==

[[Barry Long]] states that lusting is simply thinking or fantasising about an [[sexual fantasy|imagined sexual scene]] and private parts of the body. The action of thinking or fantasising stirs the natural, pure sexual energy into a coarser, more degraded emotional form (lust).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrylong.org/statements/manschallenge.shtml |title=Barry Long Foundation International |publisher=Barrylong.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'MAKING LOVE Sexual Love the Divine Way' Barry Long, Book {{ISBN|978-1-899324-14-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Long, Gold Coast Talks audio, February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Long encourages lovemaking as the practice of converting sexual energy into the knowledge of love: "You don’t need a celibate body, you need a celibate mind".&lt;ref&gt;Gold Coast Talks audio April 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychoanalysis and psychology==

{{Main article|libido}}
Lust, in the domain of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychology]], is often treated as a case of "heightened [[libido]]".

A person is more likely to lust after someone who does not resemble themself. Self-relatedness is a cue of kinship and causes an instinctual reaction to not be attracted. Therefore, self-resemblance decreases attractiveness and sexual desire in a person, while less resemblance increases attractiveness and sexual desire, creating a higher possibility of lust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.3003| title = Trustworthy but not lust-worthy: Context-specific effects of facial resemblance| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 272| issue = 1566| pages = 919–22| year = 2005| last1 = Debruine | first1 = L.

'''Mahābhūta''' is [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]] for "great element."&lt;ref&gt;Or, more literally, "Great Natures." See Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 507, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3646.pali entry for "Bhūta."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Further|The 36 tattvas}}

In Hinduism's sacred literature, the "great" or "gross" elements (''mahābhūta'') are fivefold: space (or "ether"), air, fire, water and earth.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Monier-Williams]] Sanskrit Dictionary where ''Mahābhūta'' is defined as: "a great element, gross el[ement] (of which 5 are reckoned, viz. ether, air, fire, water, earth ..., as distinguished from the subtle el[ement] or ''Tanmātra''...)."  Monier-Williams (1899), p. 798, entry for "Mahā-," retrieved 24 Dec 2008 from "U. Cologne" at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0798-mahApheTkArIya.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 79|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the [[Taittiriya Upanishad|{{IAST|Taittirīya Upaniṣad}}]] describes the five "sheaths" of a person (Sanskrit: ''[[purusha|puru{{IAST|ṣ}}a]]''), starting with the grossest level of the five evolving great elements:
:From this very self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|{{IAST|ā}}tman]]'') did space come into being; from space, air; from air, fire; from fire, the waters, from the waters, the earth; from the earth, plants; from plants, food; and from food, man.... Different from and lying within this man formed from the essence of food is the self (''{{IAST|ā}}tman'') consisting of lifebreath....  Different from and lying within this self consisting of breath is the self (''{{IAST|ā}}tman'') consisting of mind.... Different from and lying within this self consisting of mind is the self (''{{IAST|ā}}tman'') consisting of perception.... Different from and lying within this self consisting of perception is the self (''{{IAST|ā}}tman'') consisting of bliss....&lt;ref&gt;[[Taittiriya Upanishad|TU]] 2.1–2.5, trans. Olivelle (1996), pp. 185–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|{{IAST|Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad}}]], God is identified as the source of the great elements:
:Some wise men say it is inherent nature, while others say it is time – all totally deluded.  It is rather the greatness of God present in the world by means of which this wheel of ''[[brahman]]'' goes around.  Who always encompasses this whole world – the knower, the architect of time, the one without qualities, and the all-knowing one – it is at his command that the work of creation, to be conceived of as earth, water, fire, air, and space, unfolds itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|SU]] 6.1–6.2, trans. Olivelle (1996), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same Upanishad also mentions, "When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death." (Verse 2.12).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/upanishads/svetasvatara_upanishad.php Shvetashvatara Upanishad]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, the four Great Elements (Pali: ''cattāro mahābhūtāni'') are earth, water, fire and air.  Mahābhūta is generally synonymous with '''catudhātu''', which is Pāli for the "Four Elements."&lt;ref&gt;Note that the Pāli word ''dhātu'' is used in multiple contexts in the [[Pali canon|Pāli canon]].  For instance, Bodhi (2000), pp. 527–8, identifies four different ways that ''dhātu'' is used including in terms of the "eighteen elements" and, as in this article, in terms of "the four primary elements."&lt;/ref&gt;  In early [[Buddhism]], the Four Elements are a basis for understanding that leads one through unbinding of 'Rupa' or materiality to the supreme state of pure 'Emptiness' or Nirvana.

===Definitions===

In the [[Pali canon]],&lt;ref&gt;These elaborations on the elements can be found in the [[Majjhima Nikaya]] discourses nos. 28, 62, 140.  See below for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; the most basic elements are usually identified as four in number but, on occasion, a fifth and, to an even lesser extent, a sixth element may be also be identified.

====Four primary elements====

In canonical texts, the four Great Elements refer to elements that are both "external" (that is, outside the body, such as a river) and "internal" (that is, of the body, such as blood).  These elements are described as follows:

*'''Earth element''' (''pru{{IAST|ṭ}}havī-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Earth element represents the quality of solidity or attractive forces. Any matter where attractive forces are in prominence (solid bodies) are called earth elements. Internal earth elements include head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bone, organs, intestinal material, etc.&lt;ref&gt;The traditional list of body parts associated with the earth element are the first 19 of 31 body parts – from head hair to feces – identified in the Pali Canon with the contemplation of [[Patikulamanasikara]], with the catch all phrase of "or whatever else internal, within oneself, is hard, solid, &amp; sustained" (trans. [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.028.than.html Thanissaro, 2003b)] added.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Water (or liquid) element''' (''āpa-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Water element represents the quality of Liquidity or relative motion. Any matter where relative motion of particles is in prominence are called water elements. Internal water elements include bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, nasal mucus, urine, semen, etc.&lt;ref&gt;The traditional list of water-element body parts are the latter twelve of 31 body parts – from bile to urine – identified in [[Patikulamanasikara]] contemplations, with the catch all phrase of "or whatever else internal, within oneself, is liquid, watery, &amp; sustained" (trans. [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.028.than.html Thanissaro, 2003b)] added.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Fire element''' (''teja-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Fire element represents the quality of heat or energy. Any matter where energy is in prominence are called fire elements. Internal fire elements include those bodily mechanisms that produce physical warmth, ageing, digestion, etc.
*'''Air (or wind) element''' (''vāyu-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Air element represents the quality of expansion or repulsive forces. Any matter where repulsive forces are in prominence are called air elements. Internal air elements includes air associated with the pulmonary system (for example, for breathing), the intestinal system ("winds in the belly and ... bowels"), etc.

Any entity that carry one or more of these qualities (attractive forces, repulsive forces, energy and relative motion) are called matter (''rupa''). The material world is considered to be nothing but a combination of these qualities arranged in space (''akasa''). The result of these qualities are the inputs to our five senses, color (''warna''), smell (''ghandda''), taste (''rasa'') and sensation of body (''ojha''). The matter that we perceive in our mind are just a mental interpretation of these qualities.

====Fifth and sixth elements====

In addition to the above four elements of underived matter, two other elements are occasionally found in the Pali Canon:&lt;ref&gt;The "space element" is encountered more frequently in the canonical discourses than is the "consciousness element."  Examples of discourses that include both of these latter elements are [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 33 (Walshe, 1995, p. 500, para. 16), [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 140 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.140.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997c)], and [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 27.9 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn27/sn27.001-010.than.html#sn27.009 (Thanissaro, 1994).]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Space element''' (''ākāsa-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Internal space elements includes bodily orifices such as the ears, nostrils, mouth, anus, etc.
{{see also|Prayer flag#Colour and order}}

*'''Consciousness element''' (''[[Vijñāna|viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a]]-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Described as "pure and bright" (''parisuddha{{IAST|ṃ}} pariyodāta{{IAST|ṃ}}''), used to cognise the three feelings (''[[vedana]]'') of pleasure, pain and neither-pleasure-nor-pain, and the arising and passing of the sense contact (''[[phassa]]'') upon which these feelings are dependent.

According to the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]], the "space element" is identified as "secondary" or "derived" (''upādā'').&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2001), pp. 5, 35 ''n''. 9.  For more information regarding "primary/underived" and "secondary/derived" matter, see the article [[Rupa (Buddhism)|Rupa]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensory qualities, not substances===

[[Rūpa]] (matter) means both materiality and sensibility—it signifies, for example, a tactile object both insofar as that object is tactile and that it can be sensed. Rūpa is never a materiality which can be separated or isolated from cognizance; such a non-empirical category is incongruous in the context of early Buddhism. Rūpa is not a substratum or substance which has sensibility as a property. It functions in early Buddhist thought as perceivable physicality. Matter, or rūpa, is defined in its function; what it does, not what it is.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Chʼeng Wei-shih Lun.'' Routledge, 2002, page 183.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the four great elements are conceptual abstractions drawn from the sensorium. They are sensorial typologies, and are not metaphysically materialistic.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Chʼeng Wei-shih Lun.'' Routledge, 2002, page 184.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not meant to give an account of matter as constitutive of external, mind-independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;Noa Ronkin, ''Early Buddhist Metaphysics the Making of a Philosophical Tradition.'' Routledge, 2005, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soteriological uses===

The Four Elements are used in [[Buddhist]] texts to both elucidate the concept of suffering (''[[dukkha]]'') and as an object of meditation. The earliest Buddhist texts explain that the four primary material elements are the sensory qualities solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility; their characterisation as earth, water, fire, and air, respectively, is declared an abstraction – instead of concentrating on the fact of material existence, one observes how a physical thing is sensed, felt, perceived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Lusthaus]], "What is and isn't Yogacara." He specifically discusses early Buddhism as well as Yogacara. {{cite web|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331102337/http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Understanding suffering====

The Four Elements pertinence to the Buddhist notion of suffering comes about due to:

:* The Four Elements are the primary component of "form" (''[[rūpa]]'').

:* "Form" is first category of the "Five Aggregates" (''[[khandhas]]'').

:* The Five Aggregates are the ultimate basis for suffering (''dukkha'') in the "[[Four Noble Truths]]."

Schematically, this can be represented in reverse order as:

:Four Noble Truths → Suffering → Aggregates → Form → Four Elements

Thus, to deeply understand the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, it is beneficial to have an understanding of the Great Elements.

====Meditation object====

In the [[Mahasatipatthana Sutta]] ("The Greater Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness," [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 22), in listing various bodily meditation techniques, the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] instructs:

:"...Just as if a skilled butcher or his assistant, having slaughtered a cow, were to sit at a crossroads with the carcass divided into portions, so a monk reviews this very body ... in terms of the elements: 'There are in this body the earth-element, the water-element, the fire-element, the air-element.' So he abides contemplating body in body internally...."&lt;ref&gt;Walshe (1995), p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Visuddhimagga's well-known list of forty meditation objects (''[[Kammaṭṭhāna|kamma{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hāna]]''), the great elements are listed as the first four objects.

[[B. Alan Wallace]] compares the Theravada meditative practice of "attending to the emblem of consciousness" to the practice in [[Mahamudra]] and [[Dzogchen]] of "maintaining the mind upon non-conceptuality", which is also aimed at focusing on the nature of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;B. Alan Wallace, ''The bridge of quiescence: experiencing Tibetan Buddhist meditation.'' Carus Publishing Company, 1998, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{criminal law}}
'''Malice''' is a [[legal]] term referring to a party's [[intent (law)|intent]]ion to do [[injury]] to another party.  Malice is either ''expressed'' or ''implied''.  Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to unlawfully take away the life of a human being. Malice is implied when no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart. Cal. Pen. Code § 188. Malice, in a legal sense, may be inferred from the evidence and [[imputation (law)|imputed]] to the [[defendant]], depending on the nature of the case.

In many kinds of cases, malice must be found to exist in order to convict (for example malice is an element of the crime of [[arson]] in many jurisdictions). In [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] cases, a finding of malice allows for the award of greater [[damages]], or for [[punitive damages]].  The legal concept of malice is most common in Anglo-American law, and in legal systems derived from the English [[common law]] system.

In [[English law|English]] civil law (being the law of England and Wales), relevant case law in [[negligence]] and misfeasance in a public office includes ''Dunlop v. Woollahra Municipal Council'' [1982] A.C. 158; ''Bourgoin S.A. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food'' [1986] Q.B. 716; ''Jones v Swansea City Council'' [1990] 1 WLR 1453; ''Three Rivers District Council and Others v Governor and Company of The Bank of England'' [2000]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000518/rivers-1.htm Parliament.the-stationary-office.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313092450/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000518/rivers-1.htm |date=2006-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Elguzouli-Daf v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis'' [1995] 2 QB 335 in which Steyn LJ. found that malice could be made out if the acts were done with an actual intention to cause injury. Malice could be shown if the acts were done in the knowledge of invalidity or lack of power and with knowledge that it would cause or be likely to cause injury. Malice would also exist if the acts were done with reckless indifference or deliberate blindness to that invalidity or lack of power and that likely injury. These elements, with respect, are consistent with the views of the majority albeit that some of those views were expressed tentatively having regard to the basis upon which the case before them was presented.

In English criminal law on ''[[mens rea]]'' ([[Latin]] for "guilty mind"), ''R v. Cunningham'' (1957) 2 AER 412 was the pivotal case in establishing both that the test for "maliciously" was subjective rather than objective, and that malice was inevitably linked to [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]]. In that case, a man released gas from the mains into adjoining houses while attempting to steal money from the pay-meter:
:In any statutory definition of a crime, malice must be taken ... as requiring either:
# an actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that in fact was done; or
# recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or not (i.e. the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm might be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it).

Lord Diplock confirmed the relationship to recklessness in ''R v Mowatt'' (1968) 1 QB 421:
:In the offence under section 20 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], the word "maliciously" does import upon the part of the person who unlawfully inflicts the wound or other [[grievous bodily harm]] an awareness that his act may have the consequence of causing some physical harm to some other person … It is quite unnecessary that the accused should have foreseen that his unlawful act might cause physical harm of the gravity described in the section, i.e. a wound or serious physical injury. It is enough that he should have foreseen that some physical harm to some person, albeit of a minor character, might result.

In the [[United States]], the malice standard was set in the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] case of ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', allowing free reporting of the civil rights campaign. The malice standard decides whether press reports about a [[public figure]] can be considered defamation or libel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5628">In economics, the '''marginal rate of substitution''' ('''MRS''') is the rate at which a consumer can give up some amount of one good in exchange for another good while maintaining the same level of [[utility]].  At equilibrium consumption levels (assuming no externalities), marginal rates of substitution are identical.

==As the slope of indifference curve==
Under the standard assumption of [[neoclassical economics]] that goods and services are continuously divisible, the marginal rates of substitution will be the same regardless of the direction of exchange, and will correspond to the slope of an [[indifference curve]] (more precisely, to the slope multiplied by −1) passing through the consumption bundle in question, at that point: mathematically, it is the [[implicit derivative]]. MRS of X for Y is the amount of Y which a consumer can exchange for one unit of X locally. The MRS is different at each point along the indifference curve thus it is important to keep locus in the definition. Further on this assumption, or otherwise on the assumption that utility is [[Measure (mathematics)|quantified]], the marginal rate of substitution of good or service Y for good or service X (MRS&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;) is also equivalent to the [[marginal utility]] of X over the marginal utility of Y. Formally,

:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{xy}=-m_\mathrm{indif}=-(dy/dx) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{xy}=MU_x/MU_y \,&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that when comparing bundles of goods X and Y that give a constant utility (points along an [[indifference curve]]), the [[marginal utility]] of X is measured in terms of units of Y that is being given up.

For example, if the MRS&lt;sub&gt;''xy''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the consumer will give up 2 units of Y to obtain 1 additional unit of X.

As one moves down a (standardly convex) indifference curve, the marginal rate of substitution decreases (as measured by the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve, which decreases). This is known as the law of diminishing marginal rate of substitution.

Since the indifference curve is convex with respect to the origin and we have defined the MRS as the negative slope of the indifference curve,

:&lt;math&gt;\ MRS_{xy} \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

==Simple mathematical analysis==
{{See|Implicit differentiation}}

Assume the consumer [[utility function]] is defined by &lt;math&gt;U(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''U'' is consumer utility, ''x'' and ''y'' are goods. Then the marginal rate of substitution can be computed via [[partial differentiation]], as follows.

Also, note that:

:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_x=\partial U/\partial x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_y=\partial U/\partial y &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ MU_x &lt;/math&gt; is the [[marginal utility]] with respect to good ''x'' and &lt;math&gt;\ MU_y &lt;/math&gt; is the marginal utility with respect to good ''y''.

By taking the [[total differential]] of the utility function equation, we obtain the following results:
:&lt;math&gt;\ dU=(\partial U/\partial x)dx + (\partial U/\partial y)dy &lt;/math&gt;, or substituting from above,

:&lt;math&gt;\ dU= MU_xdx + MU_ydy &lt;/math&gt;, or, without loss of generality, the total derivative of the utility function with respect to good ''x'',
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dx}= MU_x\frac{dx}{dx}+ MU_y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dx}= MU_x + MU_y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.
Through any point on the indifference curve, ''dU/dx'' = 0,    because ''U''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'', where ''c'' is a constant. It follows from the above equation that:
::&lt;math&gt; 0 = MU_x + MU_y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;, or rearranging
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{MU_x}{MU_y}&lt;/math&gt;

The marginal rate of substitution is defined as the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve at whichever commodity bundle quantities are of interest.  That turns out to equal the ratio of the marginal utilities:
:&lt;math&gt;\ MRS_{xy}= MU_x/MU_y.\, &lt;/math&gt;.

----

When consumers maximize utility with respect to a budget constraint, the indifference curve is tangent to the [[budget line]], therefore, with ''m'' representing slope:

:&lt;math&gt;\ m_\mathrm{indif}=m_\mathrm{budget} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ -(MRS_{xy})=-(P_x/P_y) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ MRS_{xy}=P_x/P_y &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, when the consumer is choosing his utility maximized market basket on his budget line,

:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_x/MU_y=P_x/P_y &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_x/P_x=MU_y/P_y &lt;/math&gt;

This important result tells us that utility is maximized when the consumer's budget is allocated so that the marginal utility per unit of money spent is equal for each good. If this equality did not hold, the consumer could increase his/her utility by cutting spending on the good with lower marginal utility per unit of money and increase spending on the other good. To decrease the marginal rate of substitution, the consumer must buy more of the good for which he/she wishes the marginal utility to fall for (due to the law of diminishing marginal utility).

The applications of mindfulness meditation are well established, however the mechanisms that underlie this practice are yet to be fully understood.

[[File:Image of Mindfulness and Wisdom (8392104320).jpg|thumb|right|Mindfulness Meditation]]

Four components of [[mindfulness meditation]] have been proposed to describe much of the mechanism of action by which mindfulness meditation may work: [[attention]] regulation, body awareness, emotion regulation, and change in perspective on the self.&lt;ref name=Holzel2011/&gt; All of the components described above are connected to each other. For example, when a person is triggered by an external stimulus, the executive [[attention]] system attempts to maintain a mindful state. There is also a heightened body awareness such as a rapid heartbeat which triggers an emotional response. The response is then regulated so that it does not become habitual, but constantly changes from moment to moment experience. This eventually leads to a change in the perspective of the self.

== Attention regulation ==
[[File:MRI anterior cingulate.png|thumb|right|Anterior cingulate cortex]]

Attention regulation is the task of focusing attention on an object, acknowledging any distractions, and then returning your focus back to the object. Some evidence for mechanisms responsible for attention regulation during mindfulness meditation are shown below.
 
* Mindfulness meditators showed greater activation of rostral [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) and dorsal [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (MPFC).&lt;ref name =Holzel2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hölzel B.K. |author2=Ott U. |author3=Hempel H. |author4=Hackl A. |author5=Wolf K. |author6=Stark R. |author7=Vaitl D. | year = 2007 | title = Differential engagement of anterior cingulate cortex and adjacent medial frontal cortex in adept meditators and nonmeditators | url = | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 421 | issue = | pages = 16–21 | doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2007.04.074 | pmid=17548160}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that meditators have a stronger processing of conflict/distraction and are more engaged in emotional regulation. However, as the meditators become more efficient at focused attention, regulation becomes unnecessary and consequentially decreases activation of ACC in the long term.&lt;ref name =Lewis2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brefczynski-Lewis J.A. |author2=Lutz A. |author3=Schaefer H.S. |author4=Levinson D.B. |author5=Davidson R.J. | year = 2007 | title = Neural correlates of attentional expertise in long-term meditation practitioners | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = | pages = 11483–11488 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0606552104 | pmid=17596341 | pmc=1903340}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The cortical thickness in the dorsal ACC was also found to be greater in the [[gray matter]] of experienced meditators.&lt;ref name =Grant2010&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grant J.A. |author2=Courtemanche J. |author3=Duerden E.G. |author4=Duncan G.H. |author5=Rainville P. | year = 2010 | title = Cortical thickness and pain sensitivity in Zen meditators | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 43–53 | doi=10.1037/a0018334}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is an increased frontal [[midline theta rhythm]], which is related to attention demanding tasks and is believed to be indicative of ACC activation.&lt;ref name=Asada1999&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Asada H. |author2=Fukuda Y. |author3=Tsunoda S. |author4=Yamaguchi M. |author5=Tonoike M. | year = 1999 | title = Frontal midline theta rhythms reflect alternative activation of prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex in humans | url = | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 274 | issue = | pages = 29–32 | doi=10.1016/s0304-3940(99)00679-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; High midline theta rhythm has been associated with lowest anxiety score in the Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS), the highest score in the extrovertive scale of the Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI) and the lowest score in the neurotic scale of MPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=9895201 | doi=10.1046/j.1440-1819.1998.00452.x | volume=52 | title=Frontal midline theta rhythm and mental activity | year=1998 | author=Inanaga K | journal=Psychiatry Clin Neurosci | pages=555–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACC detects conflicting information coming from distractions. When a person is presented with a conflicting stimulus, the brain initially processes the stimulus incorrectly. This is known as [[error-related negativity]] (ERN). Before the ERN reaches a [[Sensory threshold|threshold]], the correct conflict  is detected by the [[frontocentral N2]]. After the correction, the rostral ACC is activated and allows for executive attention to the correct stimulus.&lt;ref name=Veen2002&gt;{{cite journal |author1=van Veen V. |author2=Carter C.S. | year = 2002 | title = The anterior cingulate as a conflict monitor: FMRI and ERP studies | url = | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 77 | issue = | pages = 477–482 | doi=10.1016/s0031-9384(02)00930-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[mindfulness meditation]] could potentially be a method for treating [[attention]] related disorders such as [[ADHD]] and [[bipolar disorder]].

== Body awareness ==
[[File:Gray717-emphasizing-insula.png|thumb|right|Gray matter &amp; insula]]

Body awareness refers to focusing on an object/task within the body such as breathing. From a qualitative interview with ten mindfulness meditators, some of the following responses were observed: "When I'm walking, I deliberately notice the sensations of my body moving" and "I notice how foods and drinks affect my thoughts, bodily sensations, and emotions”.&lt;ref name=Holzel2006&gt;Hölzel, B.K., Ott, U., Hempel, H., &amp; Stark, R.

Paper presented at the 24th Symposium of the Section for Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the German Society for Psychology, Würzburg, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; The two possible mechanisms by which a mindfulness meditator can experience body awareness are discussed below.

* Meditators showed a greater cortical thickness &lt;ref name=Lazar2005&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lazar S.W. |author2=Kerr C.E. |author3=Wasserman R.H. |author4=Gray J.R. |author5=Greve D.N. |author6=Treadway M.T. |author7=Fischl B. | year = 2005 | title = Meditation experience is associated with increased cortical thickness | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 1893–1897 | doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000186598.66243.19 | pmid=16272874 | pmc=1361002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and greater [[gray matter]] concentration in the right anterior [[insular cortex|insula]].&lt;ref name=Holzel2008&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hölzel B.K. |author2=Ott U. |author3=Gard T. |author4=Hempel H. |author5=Weygandt M. |author6=Morgen K. |author7=Vaitl D. | year = 2008 | title = Investigation of mindfulness meditation practitioners with voxel-based morphometry | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 55–61 | doi=10.1093/scan/nsm038 | pmid=19015095 | pmc=2569815}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* On the contrary, subjects who had undergone 8 weeks of mindfulness training showed no significant change in gray matter concentration of the insula, but rather an increase [[gray matter]] concentration of the [[temporo-parietal junction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hölzel B.K. |author2=Carmody J. |author3=Vangel M. |author4=Congleton C. |author5=Yerramsetti S.M. |author6=Gard T. |author7=Lazar S.W. | year = 2011 | title = Mindfulness practice leads to increases in regional brain gray matter density | url = | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 191 | issue = | pages = 36–43 | doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2010.08.006 | pmid=21071182 | pmc=3004979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[insular cortex|insula]] is responsible for awareness to stimuli and the thickness of its [[gray matter]] correlates to the accuracy and detection of the stimuli by the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Craig A.D. | year = 2003 | title = Interoception: The sense of the physiological condition of the body | doi = 10.1016/s0959-4388(03)00090-4 | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 500–505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Critchley H.D. |author2=Wiens S. |author3=Rotshtein P. |author4=Ohman A. |author5=Dolan R.J. | year = 2004 | title = Neural systems supporting interoceptive awareness | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 189–195 | doi=10.1038/nn1176 | pmid=14730305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualitative evidence suggests that mindfulness meditation impacts body awareness, however this component is not well characterized.&lt;ref name=Holzel2011/&gt;

== Emotion regulation ==
[[File:Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) Abnormal Brain Structures.png|thumb|right|Prefrontal cortex &amp; amygdala]]

Emotions can be regulated cognitively or behaviorally. Cognitive regulation (in terms of mindfulness meditation) means having control over giving attention to a particular stimuli or by changing the response to that stimuli. The cognitive change is achieved through [[reappraisal]] (interpreting the stimulus in a more positive manner) and [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] (reversing the response to the stimulus). Behavioral regulation refers to inhibiting the expression of certain behaviors in response to a stimulus. Research suggests two main mechanisms for how [[mindfulness meditation]] influences the emotional response to a stimulus.
  
* [[Mindfulness meditation]] regulates emotions via increased activation of the dorso-medial PFC and rostral ACC.&lt;ref name =Holzel2007/&gt;
* Increased activation of the ventrolateral PFC can regulate emotion by decreasing the activity of the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Harenski C.L. |author2=Hamann S. | year = 2006 | title = Neural correlates of regulating negative emotions related to moral violations | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 313–324 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.09.034 | pmid=16249098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beauregard M. |author2=Levesque J. |author3=Bourgouin P. | year = 2001 | title = Neural correlates of conscious self-regulation of emotion | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 21 | issue = | page = RC165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schaefer S.M. |author2=Jackson D.C. |author3=Davidson R.J. |author4=Aguirre G.K. |author5=Kimberg D.Y. |author6=Thompson-Schill S.L. | year = 2002 | title = Modulation of amygdalar activity by the conscious regulation of negative emotion | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 913–921 | doi=10.1162/089892902760191135 | pmid=12191458}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also predicted by a study that observed the effect of a person's mood/attitude during mindfulness on brain activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Creswell J.D. |author2=Way B.M. |author3=Eisenberger N.I. |author4=Lieberman M.D. | year = 2007 | title = Neural correlates of dispositional mindfulness during affect labeling | url = | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 560–565 | doi=10.1097/psy.0b013e3180f6171f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lateral prefrontal cortex]] (lPFC) is important for selective attention while ventral [[prefrontal cortex]] (vPFC) is involved in inhibiting a response. As noted before, the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) has been noted for maintaining attention to a stimulus. The [[amygdala]] is responsible for generating emotions. [[Mindfulness meditation]] is believed to be able to regulate negative thoughts and decrease emotional reactivity through these regions of the brain. Emotion regulation deficits have been noted in disorders such as [[borderline personality disorder]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Silbersweig D. |author2=Clarkin J.F. |author3=Goldstein M. |author4=Kernberg O.F. |author5=Tuescher O. |author6=Levy K.N. |author7=Rauch S.L. | year = 2007 | title = Failure of frontolimbic inhibitory function in the context of negative emotion in borderline personality disorder | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = | pages = 1832–1841 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.06010126 | pmid=18056238}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Abercrombie H.C. |author2=Schaefer S.M. |author3=Larson C.L. |author4=Oakes T.R. |author5=Lindgren K.A. |author6=Holden J.E. |author7=Davidson R.J. | year = 1998 | title = Metabolic rate in the right amygdala predicts negative affect in depressed patients | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 3301–3307 | doi=10.1097/00001756-199810050-00028}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deficits have been associated with reduced prefrontal activation and increased [[amygdala]] activity, which mindfulness meditation might be able to attenuate.

== Pain ==
*{{see also|Meditation and pain}}
Pain is known to activate the following regions of the brain: the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], anterior/posterior [[insular cortex|insula]], primary/secondary [[somatosensory]] cortices, and the [[thalamus]].&lt;ref name=Zeidan2012&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zeidan F. |author2=Grant J. A. |author3=Brown C. A. |author4=McHaffie J. G. |author5=Coghill R. C. | year = 2012 | title = Mindfulness meditation-related pain relief: Evidence for unique brain mechanisms in the regulation of pain | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 520 | issue = 2| pages = 165–173 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2012.03.082 | pmid=22487846 | pmc=3580050}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mindfulness meditation may provide several methods by which a person can consciously regulate pain.&lt;ref name=Zeidan2012/&gt;
 
* Brown and Jones found that mindfulness meditation decreased pain anticipation in the right parietal cortex and mid-cingulate cortex. Mindfulness meditation also increased the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ventromedial-prefrontal cortex (vm-PFC). Since the vm-PFC is involved in inhibiting emotional responses to stimuli, anticipation to pain was concluded to be reduced by cognitive and emotional control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brown C.A. |author2=Jones A.K. | year = 2010 | title = Meditation experience predicts less negative appraisal of pain: electrophysiological evidence for the involvement of anticipatory neural responses | url = | journal = Pain | volume = 150 | issue = 3| pages = 428–438 | doi=10.1016/j.pain.2010.04.017 | pmid=20494517}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another study by Grant revealed that meditators showed greater activation of insula, thalamus, and mid-cingulate cortex while a lower activation of the regions responsible for emotion control (medial-PFC, OFC, and amygdala). Meditators were believed to be in a mental state that allowed them to pay close attention to the sensory input from the stimuli and simultaneously inhibit any appraisal or emotional reactivity.&lt;ref name=Grant2010/&gt;

Brown and Jones found that meditators showed no difference in pain sensitivity but rather the anticipation in pain. However, Grant's research showed that meditators experienced lower sensitivity to pain. These conflicting studies illustrate that the exact mechanism may vary with the expertise level or meditation technique.&lt;ref name=Zeidan2012/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7975">'''Multilingual Education''' typically refers to "first-language-first" education, that is, schooling which begins in the mother tongue and transitions to additional languages.  Typically MLE programs are situated in developing countries where speakers of minority languages, i.e. non-dominant languages, tend to be disadvantaged in the mainstream education system. There are increasing calls to provide first-language-first education to immigrant children from immigrant parents who have moved to the developed  world.

== Components of Multilingual Education (MLE) ==

* '''"Strong Foundation"''' - Research shows that children whose early education is in the language of their home tend to do better in the later years of their education ([https://archive.is/20040627111339/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/resource/effectiveness/ Thomas and Collier, 1997]).  For more information about the effect of "Language of Instruction", see [[Bilingual education]].
* '''"Strong Bridge"''' - an essential difference between MLE programs and rural "mother tongue education" programs is the inclusion of a guided transition from learning through the mother tongue to learning through another tongue.

Related to the emphasis on a child's mother tongue is the implicit validation of her cultural or ethnic identity by taking languages which were previously considered "non-standard" and making active use of them in the classroom.  Multilingual Education in that sense underscores the importance of the child's worldview in shaping his or her learning.

== Stages of an MLE Program  ==

A widespread understanding of MLE programs (UNESCO, 2003, 2005) suggests that instruction take place in the following stages:

# '''Stage I''' - learning takes place entirely in the child's home language
# '''Stage II''' - building fluency in the mother tongue.  Introduction of oral L2.
# '''Stage III''' - building oral fluency in L2. Introduction of literacy in L2.
# '''Stage IV''' - using both L1 and L2 for lifelong learning.

MLE proponents stress that the second language acquisition component is seen as a "two-way" bridge, such that learners gain the ability to move back and forth between their mother tongue and the other tongue(s), rather than simply a transitional literacy program where reading through the mother tongue is abandoned at some stage in the education.

Based  on the  theories of  Multilingual Education  that are spelled out  here, Andhra Pradesh  and Orissa have adopted a thematic approach  to multilingual education. Using a seasonal calendar within a relevant cultural context has  provided a space to the tribal children of  Orissa  and Andhra Pradesh to rediscover their culture through their language. The Multilingual  Education  in this approach  emphasizes  first  language first  in the  child  taking  the  socio- cultural curriculum  in to classroom  culture  and   then  bridge  to  second  language.
In addition to the  basic theory of Paulo Freire on critical pedagogy, Gramscian  theory on education,  Lev  Vigostky's scaffolding  and Piaget's  theory  of cognition is applied in the  Multilingual Education. The unique  thing in  this  approach is to  involve the community   in creating their  own  curriculum  and  minimise the  theoretical hegemony, thereby  creating  a new set of people who believe in the ethics of creating  and  sharing knowledge for the society than to  limit  it to the  theoreticians.
 
===Multilingual Education in Odisha===
  
Odisha  is a multilingual state having  more than  40  ethnic language  among the 62  scheduled tribes, along with the   Modern  Indian  Languages like  Hindi, Bengali and  Telugu. To   address  the  language-  education of  ethnic minorities  children in  schools, Odisha government  started  Multilingual Education programme,ten tribal languages. Led by  Dr MAhendra Kumar Mishra, as the  Director of Multilingual Education  and   guided by Prof. D P Pattanayak and  Prof Khageswar  Mahapatra, the eminent multilingual  Experts, the state   government  started  MLE  programme in te tribal languages in 547  schools. 10 tribal languages were adopted. These are Santali, Saora,  Kui, Kuvi, Koya, Kishan, Oroam, Juang, Bonda  and   Ho.  Culturally responsive curriculum  and text books were prepared for class i to   Class  V  to maintain  mother tongue based multilingual education to   educate the  tribal children.  State government appointed  teachers from the same language community in  the schools  to  teach the tribal children.A language policy was also formulated. The programme  was also supported by Summer Institute of Linguistics led by Mr Steve Simpson  and Vicky Simpson, Pamela Mackenzie.  The curriculum and text books were prepared by the   tribal teachers guided by the MLE resource groups.  It was initiated in  2005  and  isnow  running in   2250 schools  with majority tribal children.  This  is a sustained MLE programme in Asian countries.About  7  Asian countries have  visited the  MLE schools. 
 Dr Mahendra  Kumar Mishra, started  MLE programme in Chhatishgarh adopting  Durua  language  in  MLE programme.

'''Negative-bias temperature instability''' ('''NBTI''') is a key reliability issue in [[MOSFET]]s. NBTI manifests as an increase in the [[threshold voltage]] and consequent decrease in drain current and [[transconductance]] of a MOSFET. The degradation exhibits a [[power law|power-law]] dependence on time. It is of immediate concern in p-channel [[MOSFET|MOS]] devices (pMOS), since they almost always operate with negative gate-to-source voltage; however, the very same mechanism also affects nMOS transistors when biased in the accumulation regime, i.e. with a negative bias applied to the gate.

== Physics ==
The details of the mechanisms of NBTI have been debated, but two effects are believed to contribute: trapping of positively charged [[Electron hole|holes]], and generation of interface states. 

* preexisting traps located in the bulk of the dielectric are filled with holes coming from the channel of pMOS. Those traps can be emptied when the stress voltage is removed, so that the Vth degradation can be recovered over time.
* interface traps are generated, and these interface states become positively charged when the pMOS device is biased in the "on" state, i.e. with negative gate voltage.  Some interface states may become deactivated when the stress is removed, so that the Vth degradation can be recovered over time. 

The existence of two coexisting mechanisms has resulted in scientific controversy over the relative importance of each component, and over the mechanism of generation and recovery of interface states. 

In sub-micrometer devices [[nitrogen]] is incorporated into the silicon [[gate oxide]] to reduce the gate leakage current density and prevent [[boron]] penetration. It is known that incorporating nitrogen enhances NBTI. For new technologies (45&amp;nbsp;nm and shorter nominal channel lengths), [[high-K]] metal gate stacks are used as an alternative to improve the gate current density for a given equivalent oxide thickness (EOT). Even with the introduction of new materials like hafnium oxides, NBTI remains.

With the introduction of high K metal gates, a new degradation mechanism appeared, referred to as PBTI (for positive bias temperature instabilities), which affects nMOS transistor when positively biased. In this case, no interface states are generated and 100% of the Vth degradation may be recovered.

In [[Indian philosophy]], action or [[Karma]] has been divided into three categories, according to their intrinsic qualities or [[guna]]s. Here Nishkam Karma belongs to the first category, the ''[[Sattva]]'' (pure) or actions which add to calmness; the Sakam Karma (Self-centred action) comes in the second ''[[rajas|rājasika]]'' (aggression) and Vikarma (bad-action) comes under the third,  ''[[tamas (philosophy)|tāmasika]]'' which correlates to darkness or inertia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Speaking_Tree/All_Work_And_No_Play_Makes_You_Dull/articleshow/2983723.cms Relaxation, a must for better mind power] ''[[Times of India]], July 28, 2008.''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hindu philosophy}}

The opposite of ''Sakam Karma'' (Attached Involvement) or actions done with results in mind,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindubooks.org/samskars/krishna_bhatta/sakamkarma/index.htm Sakam Karma]&lt;/ref&gt; Nishkam Karma has been variously explained as 'Duty for duty's sake' &lt;ref&gt;''Psychology in Human and Social Development: Lessons from Diverse Cultures : a Festschrift for Durganand Sinha'', by Durganand Sinha, John W. Berry, R. C. Mishra, Rama Charan Tripathi. Published by SAGE, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7619-9535-8}}. ''Page 61''.&lt;/ref&gt; and  as 'Detached Involvement', which is neither negative attitude or indifference; and has today found many advocates in the modern business area where the emphasis has shifted to [[ethical business|ethical business practices]] adhering to intrinsic [[human values]] and reducing stress at the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6FpCMSAt52sC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=%22Nishkam+Karma%22&amp;as_brr=0 Human Values and Indian Ethos] ''Human Action in Business: Praxiological and Ethical Dimensions'', by Wojciech Gasparski, Leo V. Ryan. Published by Transaction Publishers, 1996. {{ISBN|1-56000-258-1}}. ''Page 181''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hUidsEFUoYEC&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=%22Nishkam+Karma%22&amp;as_brr=0 Nishkama Karma] ''Ethics in International Management'', by Brij Kumar, Brij Nino Kumar, Horst Steinmann. Published by Walter de Gruyter, 1998. {{ISBN|3-11-015448-X}}. ''Page 296''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect that differentiates it from Sakam or selfish action, is that while the former is guided by inspiration, the latter is all about motivation, and that makes the central difference in its results, for example Sakam Karma might lead to excessive work pressure and workaholism as it aims at success, and hence creates more chances of physical and psychological burn outs. On the other hand Nishkam Karma, means more balanced approach to work, and as work has been turned into a pursuit of personal excellence, which results in greater personal satisfaction, which one would have otherwise sought in job satisfaction coming from external rewards. One important fallout of the entire shift is that where one is essentially an ethical practice inside-out leading to the adage, ‘Work is worship’ show itself literally at workplace, leading to greater work commitment, the other since it is so much result oriented can lead to unethical business and [[professional ethics]], as seen so often at modern work place &lt;ref&gt;''Globalisation Managing Org. Adaptation'', by Murthi. Published by Anmol Publications PVT. LTD..{{ISBN|8126104961}}. ''Mantra of Karma Yoga -Page 333-334''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the central tenet of practicing Nishkam Karma is [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|Mindfulness]] in the present moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/OPINION/Editorial/Mindfulness_with_Present_Is_Nishkama_Karma/articleshow/1564920.cms Mindfulness with Present Is Nishkama Karma] ''[[Times of India]], February 6, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this practice leads to not only [[equanimity]] of mind as it allows the practitioner to stay detached from results, and hence from ups and downs of business that are inevitable in any business arena, while maintaining constant work commitment since work as now been turned into a personal act of worship.&lt;ref name=eco&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2091131.cms How are CEOs beating the crunch factor?] Lalbhai Shah ([[Arvind Mills]]), ''[[The Economic Times]], June 1, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/19968512/the_guru_of_google/5 The Guru of Google] ''[[Rolling Stone]], April 17, 2008''.&lt;/ref&gt; Further in the long run it leads to cleansing of the heart but also spiritual growth and holistic development.&lt;ref&gt;''Human Values and Ethics: Achieving Holistic Excellence'', by SK Chakraborty, D Chakraborty.

== Nishkam Karma in Bhagavad Gita ==
Nishkam Karma, gets an important place in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', the central text of [[Mahabharata]],&lt;ref&gt;''Critical Perspectives on the Mahābhārata
By Arjunsinh K. Parmar. Published by Sarup &amp; Sons, 2002. {{ISBN|81-7625-273-5}}. ''Page 111''.&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Krishna]] advocates 'Nishkam Karma Yoga' (the Yoga of Selfless Action) as the ideal path to realize the Truth. Allocated work done without expectations, motives, or thinking about its outcomes tends to purify one's mind and gradually makes an individual fit to see the value of reason and the benefits of renouncing the work itself. These concepts are vividly described in the following verses:

* ''To action alone hast thou a right and never at all to its fruits; let not the fruits of action be thy motive; neither let there be in thee any attachment to inaction''.  &lt;br /&gt;- &lt;small&gt;Verse 47, Chapter 2-Samkhya theory and Yoga practise, The Bhagavadgita&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''verse 47, Chapter 2-Samkhya theory and Yoga practise, The Bhagavadgita - [[Radhakrishnan]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Essence of Maharishi Patanjali's Ashtang Yoga'', by J.M. Mehta, Published by Pustak Mahal, 2006. {{ISBN|81-223-0921-6}}. ''Page 23''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''"Fixed in yoga, do thy work, O Winner of wealth (Arjuna), abandoning attachment, with an even mind in success and failure, for evenness of mind is called yoga"''&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;small&gt;Verse 2.48&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''verse 48, Chapter 2-Samkhya theory and Yoga practise, The Bhagavadgita - [[Radhakrishnan]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''"With the body, with the mind, with the intellect, even merely with the senses, the Yogis perform action toward self-purification, having abandoned attachment. He who is disciplined in Yoga, having abandoned the fruit of action, attains steady peace..."&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;small&gt;Verse 5.11&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

]]

The ritual for making necropants is described as follows:&lt;ref name="stave"/&gt;
{{quote|If you want to make your own necropants (literally; ''nábrók''), you have to get permission from a living man to use his skin after his death.

After he has been buried, you must dig up his body and flay the skin of the corpse in one piece from the waist down. As soon as you step into the pants, they will stick to your own skin. A coin must be stolen from a poor widow and placed in the scrotum along with the [[Icelandic magical staves|magical sign]], ''nábrókarstafur'', written on a piece of paper. Consequently, the coin will draw money into the scrotum so that it will never be empty, as long as the original coin is not removed. To ensure salvation, the owner has to convince someone else to take ownership of the pants and step into each leg as soon as he gets out of it. The necropants will thus keep the money-gathering nature for generations.

'''Physical model''' (most commonly referred to simply as a '''model''' but in this context distinguished from a [[conceptual model]]) is a smaller or larger physical copy of an object. The object being modelled may be small (for example, an atom) or large (for example, the [[Solar System]]).

The geometry of the model and the object it represents are often [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] in the sense that one is a rescaling of the other; in such cases the [[Scale (measurement)|scale]] is an important characteristic. However, in many cases the similarity is only approximate or even intentionally distorted. Sometimes the [[distortion]] is systematic with e.g. a fixed scale horizontally and a larger fixed scale vertically when modelling [[topography]] of a large area (as opposed to a model of a smaller mountain region, which may well use the same scale horizontally and vertically, and show the true [[slope]]s).

Physical models allow visualization, from examining the model, of information about the thing the model represents.  A model can be a physical object such as an architectural model of a building. Uses of an architectural model include visualization of internal relationships within the structure or external relationships of the structure to the environment.  Other uses of models in this sense are as [[toy]]s.

Instrumented physical models are an effective way of investigating fluid flows for [[Engineering]] design.  Physical models are often coupled with [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] models to optimize the design of equipment and processes.  This includes external flow such as around buildings, vehicles, people, or [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic structures]]. [[Wind Tunnel]] and Water Tunnel testing is often used for these design efforts.  Instrumented physical models can also examine internal flows, for the design of ductwork systems, pollution control equipment, food processing machines, and mixing vessels.  Transparent flow models are used in this case to observe the detailed flow phenomenon.  These models are scaled in terms of both geometry and important forces, for example using [[Froude number]] or [[Reynolds number]] scaling (see [[Similitude (model)]]).

A physical model of something large is usually smaller, and of something very small is larger. A physical model of something that can move, like a [[vehicle]] or [[machine]], may be completely static, or have parts that can be moved manually, or be powered. A physical model may show inner parts that are normally not visible. The purpose of a physical model on a smaller scale may be to have a better overview, for testing purposes, as [[hobby]] or [[toy]]. The purpose of a physical model on a larger scale may be to see the structure of things that are normally too small to see properly or to see at all, for example a model of an [[insect]] or of a [[molecule]].

A physical model of an [[animal]] shows the animals physical composition without it walking or flying away, and without danger, and if the real animal is not available. A soft model of an animal is popular among children and some adults as [[cuddly toy]].some models can be used in different ways as of like prototypes for cars.

A model of a [[person]] may e.g. be a [[doll]], a [[statue]], and in fiction a [[robot]]ic [[humanoid]], e.g. the mechas in the movie ''[[A.I. (movie)|A.I.]]''.

A model is a [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] alternative for a 2D representation such as a [[drawing]] or [[photograph]], or in the case of a [[globe]], a 3D, undistorted alternative for a flat world [[map]].

[[File:Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Privacy may be lessened by [[surveillance]] – in this case through [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]].]]
'''Privacy''' is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a ''person'', it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them. The domain of privacy partially overlaps with [[security]] (confidentiality), which can include the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of [[bodily integrity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Herring, ''Medical Law and Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the [[government]], [[corporation]]s or [[individual]]s is part of many countries' [[#Privacy law|privacy laws]], and in some cases, [[constitution]]s. All countries have laws which in some way limit privacy. An example of this would be law concerning [[taxation]], which normally requires the sharing of information about personal [[income]] or [[earnings]]. In some countries individual privacy may conflict with [[freedom of speech]] laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures. This was a major concern in the United States, with the Supreme Court passage of [[Citizens United]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Privacy may be [[Communication privacy management theory|voluntarily sacrificed]], normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships. For example, people may be ready to reveal their name, if that allows them to promote trust by others and thus build meaningful social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaudeul|first=Alexia|last2=Giannetti|first2=Caterina|title=The effect of privacy concerns on social network formation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167268117301853|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=141|pages=233–253|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2017.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that people are more willing to voluntarily sacrifice privacy if the data gatherer is seen to be transparent as to what information is gathered and how it is used.&lt;ref name="transparency"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oulasvirta |first=Antti |last2=Suomalainen |first2=Tiia |last3=Hamari |first3=Juho |last4=Lampinen |first4=Airi |last5=Karvonen |first5=Kristiina |date=2014 |title=Transparency of Intentions Decreases Privacy Concerns in Ubiquitous Surveillance |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264638054_Transparency_of_Intentions_Decreases_Privacy_Concerns_in_Ubiquitous_Surveillance |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=633–38 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0585}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details (often for [[advertising]] purposes) in order to gamble on winning a prize. A person may also disclose personal information as part of being an executive for a publicly traded company in the USA pursuant to federal securities law.&lt;ref&gt;Undressing the CEO: Disclosing Private, Material Matters of Public Company Executives, 11 Penn. Journal of Bus. Law 383 (2009), available at:http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040940&lt;/ref&gt; Personal information which is voluntarily shared but subsequently stolen or misused can lead to [[identity theft]].

The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct primarily associated with [[Western culture]], British and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. According to some researchers, this concept sets [[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American]] culture apart even from Western European cultures such as French or Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zemskaya|first=E. A.|title=Особенности русской речи эмигрантов четвертой волны (Features of the Russian language of fourth wave immigrants)|url=http://www.gramota.ru/biblio/magazines/gramota/28_520|publisher=Gramota.ru|accessdate=24 February 2009|language=Russian|date=9 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cultures, however, recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of their personal information from wider society—closing the door to one's home, for example.

The distinction or overlap between [[secrecy]] and privacy is [[ontology|ontologically]] subtle, which is why the word "privacy" is an example of an [[Untranslatability|untranslatable]] [[lexeme]],&lt;ref name="TranslationToday"/&gt; and many languages do not have a specific word for "privacy". Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combining the meaning of ''уединение''—solitude, ''секретность''—secrecy, and ''частная жизнь''—private life) or borrow from English "privacy" (as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''privasi'' or [[Italian language|Italian]] ''la privacy'').&lt;ref name="TranslationToday"&gt;{{cite book|title=Translation Today: Trends and Perspectives |last=Anderman |first=Gunilla M. |author2=Rogers, Margaret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJxVffwZEDgC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=privacy&amp;f=false |publisher=Multilingual Matters |year=2003 |accessdate=1 January 2012|isbn=9781853596186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction hinges on the discreteness of [[wikt:interest#Noun|interests]] of parties (persons or groups), which can have [[emic and etic|emic]] variation depending on cultural mores of [[individualism]], [[collectivism]], and the negotiation between [[individual and group rights]]. The difference is sometimes expressed humorously as, "when ''I'' withhold information, it is privacy; when ''you'' withhold information, it is secrecy."

==Concepts==
A broad multicultural literary tradition going to the beginnings of recorded history discusses the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=12–13}} One way of categorizing all concepts of privacy is by considering all discussions as one of these concepts:{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=12–13}}

# the right to be let alone
# the option to limit the access others have to one's personal information
# [[secrecy]], or the option to conceal any information from others
# control over others' use of information about oneself
# states of privacy
# [[personhood]] and autonomy
# self-identity and personal growth
# protection of [[intimate relationships]]

===Right to be let alone===
In 1890 the United States [[jurists]] [[Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]] wrote ''[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]'', an article in which they argued for the "right to be let alone", using that phrase as a definition of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}} There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being "let alone", and among other ways, it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose [[seclusion]] from the attention of others if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings, such as one’s own home.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}} Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}}

===Limited access===
Limited access refers to a person’s ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}

Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one’s personal information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}} [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] wrote in the late 19th century that "nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godkin|first1=E.L.|authorlink1=Edwin Lawrence Godkin|title=Libel and its Legal Remedy|journal=[[Atlantic Monthly]]|date=December 1880|volume=46|issue=278|pages=729–39|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=atla;cc=atla;rgn=full%20text;idno=atla0046-6;didno=atla0046-6;view=image;seq=0735;node=atla0046-6%3A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison&lt;ref name="transparency" /&gt; 9 years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gavison|first1=Ruth|authorlink1=Ruth Gavison|title=Privacy and the Limits of Law|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=1980|pages=421–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sissela Bok]] said that privacy is "the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others—either physical access, personal information, or attention."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bok|first1=Sissela|authorlink1=Sissela Bok|title=Secrets : on the ethics of concealment and revelation|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0679724735|pages=10–11|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control over information===
Control over one's personal information is the concept that "privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=24}}&lt;ref&gt;The quotation is from Alan Westin.{{cite book|last1=Westin|first1=Alan F.|last2=Blom-Cooper|first2=Louis|authorlink1=Alan Westin|authorlink2=Louis Blom-Cooper|title=Privacy and freedom|date=1970|publisher=Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-0370013251|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Fried]] said that "Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves. Nevertheless, in the era of [[big data]], control over information is under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/46935|title=Predicting Data that People Refuse to Disclose; How Data Mining Predictions Challenge Informational Self-Determination|last=B.H.M.|first=Custers,|last2=Metajuridica|first2=Instituut voor|website=openaccess.leidenuniv.nl|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== States of privacy ===
Alan Westin defined four states—or experiences—of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. Solitude is a physical separation from others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privacy and Freedom|last = Westin|first = Alan|publisher = Atheneum|year = 1967|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimacy is a "close, relaxed, and frank relationship between two or more individuals" that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Anonymity is the "desire of individuals for times of 'public privacy.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, reserve is the "creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion"; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual's need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning himself or herself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative. Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Behavioural Understanding of Privacy and Its Implications for Privacy Law|last = Hughes|first = Kirsty|date = 2012|journal = The Modern Law Review|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (In this sense, "accessing" an individual includes accessing personal information about him or her.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Behavioral barriers communicate to others—verbally, through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing—that an individual does not want them to access or experience him or her.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Secrecy===
Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy. Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to "conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage".{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=21}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|authorlink1=Richard Posner|title=The economics of justice|date=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674235267|page=271|edition=5. print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion if privacy is secrecy then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=22–23}} When privacy-as-secrecy is discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=22–23}}

===Personhood and autonomy===
Privacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood. Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of one's ownership of his or her physical and mental reality and a moral right to his or her self-determination.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Privacy, Intimacy, and Personhood|last = Reiman|first = Jeffrey|date = 1976|journal = Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the "social ritual" of privacy, or the social practice of respecting an individual's privacy barriers, the social group communicates to the developing child that he or she has exclusive moral rights to his or her body—in other words, he or she has moral ownership of his or her body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This entails control over both active (physical) and cognitive appropriation, the former being control over one's movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience one's physical existence and when.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Alternatively, Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency—as an individual with the capacity to choose.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Philosophical Dimensions of Privacy: An Anthology|last = Benn|first = Stanley|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = |isbn = |location = New York|pages = |editor-first = Ferdinand|chapter = Privacy, freedom, and respect for persons|editor-last = Schoeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy is required to exercise choice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a "determinate character" and "limited probabilities."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Covert observation, on the other hand, changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition, privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy, a concept closely connected to that of personhood. According to Joseph Kufer, an autonomous self-concept entails a conception of oneself as a "purposeful, self-determining, responsible agent" and an awareness of one's capacity to control the boundary between self and other—that is, to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Privacy, Autonomy, and Self-Concept|last = Kufer|first = Joseph|date = 1987|journal = American Philosophical Quarterly|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, others must acknowledge and respect the self's boundaries—in other words, they must respect the individual's privacy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that, as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent, they develop an autonomous self-concept.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, studies of adults in particular institutions, such as Erving Goffman's study of "total institutions" such as prisons and mental institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates|last = Goffman|first = Erving|publisher = Doubleday|year = 1968|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate one's sense of autonomy over time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Self-identity and personal growth ===
Privacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self-identity. Privacy barriers, in particular, are instrumental in this process. According to Irwin Altman, such barriers "define and limit the boundaries of the self" and thus "serve to help define [the self]."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Environment and Social Behavior: Privacy, Personal Space, Territory, and Crowding|last = Altman|first = Irwin|publisher = Brooks/Cole Publishing Company|year = 1975|isbn = |location = Monterey|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Control over the "permeability" of the self's boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In addition, privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth, a process integral to the development of self-identity. Hyman Gross suggested that, without privacy—solitude, anonymity, and temporary releases from social roles—individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self-discovery and self-criticism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such self-discovery and self-criticism contributes to one's understanding of oneself and shapes one's sense of identity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Intimacy===
In a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual, the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or [[intimate relationships]] with other humans.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}} Because part of human relationships includes individuals volunteering to self-disclose some information, but withholding other information, there is a concept of privacy as a part of the process by means of which humans establish relationships with each other.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}}

[[James Rachels]] advanced this notion by writing that privacy matters because "there is a close connection between our ability to control who has access to us and to information about us, and our ability to create and maintain different sorts of social relationships with different people."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rachels|first1=James|authorlink1=James Rachels|title=Why Privacy is Important|journal=[[Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs]]|date=Summer 1975|volume=4|issue=4|pages=323–33|jstor=2265077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concepts in popular media===
Privacy can mean different things in different contexts; different people, cultures, and nations have different expectations about how much privacy a person is entitled to or what constitutes an [[invasion of privacy]].

====Personal privacy====
Most people have a strong sense of privacy in relation to the exposure of their body to others. This is an aspect of personal [[modesty]]. A person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty, the main way being the wearing of [[clothing|clothes]]. Other ways include erection of [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, screens, use of [[cathedral glass]], partitions, by maintaining a distance, beside other ways. People who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others. At the same time, people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of [[physical intimacy]], but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing. Even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome.

Physical privacy could be defined as preventing "intrusions into one's physical space or solitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwQBT2Mr1YoC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=physical+privacy&amp;sig=dvybgqk6wfkf_xGimY8lvtWVV3I|title=Managing Privacy: Information Technology and Corporate America|first=H. Jeff|last=Smith|date=14 April 1994|publisher=UNC Press Books|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This would include concerns such as:
* Preventing intimate acts or hiding one's body from others for the purpose of [[modesty]]; apart from being [[clothing|dressed]] this can be achieved by [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, privacy screens, [[cathedral glass]], partitions between [[urinal (restroom)|urinals]], by being far away from others, on a bed by a [[bed sheet]] or a [[blanket]], when changing clothes by a [[towel]], etc.; to what extent these measures also prevent acts being ''heard'' varies
* Video, of aptly named graphic, or intimate, acts, behaviors or body parts
* Preventing searching of one's personal possessions
* Preventing unauthorized access to one's home or vehicle
* [[Medical privacy]], the right to make fundamental medical decisions without governmental coercion or third-party review, most widely applied to questions of contraception

An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U.S. [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which guarantees "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310024937/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-03-10 |work=Georgetown Law Journal |title=Fixing the Fourth Amendment with trade secret law: A response to Kyllo v. United States |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries have laws regarding [[trespassing]] and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy.

Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness. There may also be concerns about safety, if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |title=Security Recommendations For Stalking Victims |publisher=Privacyrights.org |accessdate=2012-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111081006/http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |archive-date=2012-01-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil inattention]] is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd.

====Informational====
{{Main|Information privacy}}

Information or data privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation of, privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one's self. Privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored, in digital form or otherwise. In some cases these concerns refer to how data are collected, stored, and associated. In other cases the issue is who is given access to information. Other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them, and/or the right to view, verify, and challenge that information.

Various types of [[personal information]] are often associated with privacy concerns. Information plays an important role in the decision-action process, which can lead to problems in terms of privacy and availability. First, it allows people to see all the options and alternatives available. Secondly, it allows people to choose which of the options would be best for a certain situation. An information landscape consists of the information, its location in the so-called network, as well as its availability, awareness, and usability. Yet the set-up of the information landscape means that information that is available in one place may not be available somewhere else. This can lead to a privacy situation that leads to questions regarding which people have the power to access and use certain information, who should have that power, and what provisions govern it. For various reasons, individuals may object to personal information such as their religion, sexual orientation, political affiliations, or personal activities being revealed, perhaps to avoid [[discrimination]], personal embarrassment, or damage to their professional reputations.

[[Financial privacy]], in which information about a person's financial transactions is guarded, is important for the avoidance of [[fraud]] including [[identity theft]]. Information about a person's purchases, for instance, can reveal a great deal about their preferences, places they have visited, their contacts, products (such as medications) they use, their activities and habits, etc. In addition to this, financial privacy also includes privacy over the bank accounts opened by individuals. Information about the bank where the individual has an account with, and whether or not this is in a country that [[Bank secrecy|does not share this information with other countries]] can help countries in fighting [[tax avoidance]].

[[Internet privacy]] is the ability to determine what information one reveals or withholds about oneself over the Internet, who has access to such information, and for what purposes one's information may or may not be used. For example, web users may be concerned to discover that many of the web sites which they visit collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about them. Similarly, Internet email users generally consider their emails to be private and hence would be concerned if their [[email]] was being accessed, read, stored or forwarded by third parties without their consent. Tools used to protect privacy on the Internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].

[[Medical privacy]] Protected Health Information OCR/HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others, perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment, or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments. Medical information could also reveal other aspects of one's personal life, such as sexual preferences or proclivity. A right to sexual privacy enables individuals to [[contraceptive security|acquire and use contraceptives]] without family, community or legal sanctions.

[[Political privacy]] has been a concern since [[voting system]]s emerged in ancient times. The [[secret ballot]] helps to ensure that voters cannot be coerced into voting in certain ways, since they can allocate their vote as they wish in the privacy and security of the voting booth while maintaining the anonymity of the vote. Secret ballots are nearly universal in modern [[democracy]], and considered a basic right of [[citizenship]], despite the difficulties that they cause (for example the inability to trace votes back to the corresponding voters increases the risk of someone stuffing additional fraudulent votes into the system: additional security controls are needed to minimize such risks).

Corporate privacy refers to the privacy rights of corporate actors like senior executives of large, publicly traded corporations. Desires for corporate privacy can frequently raise issues with obligations for public disclosures under securities and corporate law.

====Organizational====

Government agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various [[security]] practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential. Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets. For example, a government administration may be able to invoke [[executive privilege]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/amar/20040416.html |title=FindLaw's Writ – Amar: Executive Privilege |publisher=Writ.corporate.findlaw.com |date=2004-04-16 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or declare certain information to be [[Classified information|classified]], or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

====Spiritual and intellectual====

The earliest legislative development of privacy rights began under [[British common law]], which protected "only the physical interference of life and property." Its development from then on became "one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law."&lt;ref name=Solove&gt;Solove, Daniel J., Rotenberg, Marc, Schwartz, Paul M. ''Privacy, Information, and Technology'', Aspen Publ. (2006) pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy rights gradually expanded to include a "recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect."&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt; Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic "right to be let alone", and the former definition of "property" would then comprise "every form of possession—intangible, as well as tangible." By the late 19th century, interest in a "right to privacy" grew as a response to the growth of print media, especially newspapers.&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt;

==History==
{{further|Privacy laws of the United States}}
Privacy has historical roots in philosophical discussions, the most well-known being Aristotle's distinction between two spheres of life: the public sphere of the ''polis'', associated with political life, and the private sphere of the ''oikos'', associated with domestic life.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2015|title = Privacy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/privacy/|date = 2015-01-01|first = Judith|last = DeCew|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; More systematic treatises of privacy in the United States did not appear until the 1890s, with the development of privacy law in America.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Technology===
[[File:IllinoisTelephoneAndTelegraphAd.png|thumb|200px|Advertisement for dial telephone service available to delegates to the 1912 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] convention in [[Chicago]]. A major selling point of dial telephone service was that it was "secret", in that no operator was required to connect the call.]]

As technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. In the case of some technologies, such as the [[printing press]] or the [[Internet]], the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached. It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the article by [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]], "[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]", [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html 4 ''Harvard Law Review'' 193 (1890)], that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Information Privacy, Official Reference for the Certified Information privacy Professional (CIPP), Swire, P.&amp;nbsp;P. [https://www.amazon.com/s?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;sort=relevancerank&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Peter%20P.%20Swire]. and Bermann, S. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/privacy.htm |title=Privacy Law in the United States |publisher=Rbs2.com |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. For example, in the United States it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana-growing operations would be acceptable. However, in 2001 in ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'' (533 U.S. 27) it was decided that the use of [[thermal imaging]] devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/ |title=Privacy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy. As large-scale [[information systems]] become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access. Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned. The concept of [[information privacy]] has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear. Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe. [[Privacy law]] in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and, to some extent, maintain privacy rights. But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient. Proposals such as the [[APEC]] Privacy Framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy.

There are various theories about privacy and privacy control. The Invasion Paradigm defines privacy violation as the hostile actions of a wrongdoer who causes direct harm to an individual. This is a reactive view of privacy protection as it waits until there is a violation before acting to protect the violated individual, sometimes through criminal punishments for those who invaded the privacy of others. In the Invasion Paradigm this threat of criminal punishment that is supposed to work as deterrent. The Secrecy paradigm defines a privacy invasion as someone’s concealed information or hidden world being revealed through surveillance. The Negative Freedom Paradigm views privacy as freedom from invasion rather than a right, going against the more popular view of a "right to privacy." Finally, the Inaccessibility Paradigm states that privacy is the state where something is completely inaccessible to others. Daniel Solove, a law professor at George Washington University also has a theory of privacy. He believes that a conceptualized view of privacy will not work because there is no one core element. There are many different, interconnected elements involved in privacy and privacy protection. Therefore, Solove proposes looking at these issues from the bottom up, focusing on privacy problems. People may often overlook the fact that certain elements of privacy problems are due to the structure of privacy itself. Therefore, the architecture must change wherein people must learn to view privacy as a social and legal structure. He also states that people have to redefine the relationship between privacy and businesses and the government. Participation in certain privacy elements of the government and businesses should allow people to choose whether they want to be a part of certain aspects of their work that could be considered privacy invasion.

===Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}

The Internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything: "where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever", writes law professor and author [[Jeffrey Rosen]].&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology "The Web Means the End of Forgetting"] ''New York Times'', July 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This currently has an effect on employment. [[Microsoft]] reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and [[Twitter]]. They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information. This has created a need by many to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade. [[Facebook]] for example, as of August 2015, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 1,490 million members, who upload over 4.75 billion pieces of content daily. Over 83.09 million accounts were fake. [[Twitter]] has more than 316 million registered users and over 20 million are fake users. The [[Library of Congress]] recently announced that it will be acquiring—and permanently storing—the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006, reports Rosen.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

Importantly, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.&lt;ref name="Kosinski 2013 5802–5805"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Stillwell, D. |author3=Graepel, T. |title=Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2013|volume=110|issue=15|pages=5802–05|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1073/pnas.1218772110|pmid=23479631|pmc=3625324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Bachrach, Y. |author3=Stillwell, D.J. |author4=Kohli, P. |author5=Graepel, T. |title=Manifestations Of User Personality In Website Choice And Behaviour On Online Social Networks|journal=Machine Learning Journal|date=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, individual views and preferences can be revealed even if they were not directly expressed or indicated (e.g. by stating their political views on their Facebook profile, or visiting a gay community website).

According to some experts, many commonly used communication devices may be mapping every move of their users. Senator [[Al Franken]] has noted the seriousness of [[iPhones]] and [[iPads]] having the ability to record and store users' locations in unencrypted files,&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, Helen A.&amp;nbsp;S., [https://archive.is/20120714202126/http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/04/21/6508416-govt-officials-want-answers-to-secret-iphone-tracking "Gov't officials want answers to secret iPhone tracking"] ''MSNBC'', "Technology", April 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; although Apple denied doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9216210/Apple_denies_tracking_iPhone_users_but_promises_changes?taxonomyId=84 "Apple denies tracking iPhone users, but promises changes"], ''Computerworld'', April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Grove]], co-founder and former CEO of [[Intel Corporation]], offered his thoughts on internet privacy in an interview published in May 2000:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/learned-andy-grove-0500 "What I've Learned: Andy Grove"], ''Esquire'' magazine, May 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Privacy is one of the biggest problems in this new electronic age. At the heart of the Internet culture is a force that wants to find out everything about you. And once it has found out everything about you and two hundred million others, that's a very valuable asset, and people will be tempted to trade and do commerce with that asset. This wasn't the information that people were thinking of when they called this the information age.}}

==Actions which take away privacy==
As with other concepts about privacy, there are various ways to discuss what kinds of processes or actions remove, challenge, lessen, or attack privacy. In 1960 legal scholar [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]] created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection:{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prosser|first1=William|authorlink1=William Prosser (academic)|title=Privacy|journal=[[California Law Review]]|date=1960|volume=48|issue=383|page=389|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol48/iss3/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Intrusion into a person’s private space, own affairs, or wish for solitude{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Public disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Promoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect beliefs about them{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Encroaching someone’s personality rights, and using their likeness to advance interests which are not their own{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}

Building from this and other historical precedents, [[Daniel J. Solove]] presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy, including collection of information which is already somewhat public, processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}}

===Collecting information===
In the context of harming privacy, information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Surveillance is an example of this, when someone decides to begin watching and recording someone or something, and interrogation is another example of this, when someone uses another person as a source of information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Examples of information collection agencies include the [[NSA]] and the participants in the [[Five Eyes]] program.

===Aggregating information===
It can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available, but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set then processed in a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following:{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* [[data aggregation]], which is connecting many related but unconnected pieces of information{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* identification, which can mean breaking the [[de-identification]] of items of data by putting it through a [[de-anonymization]] process, thus making facts which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* insecurity, such as lack of [[data security]], which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a [[data breach]] which harms the people whose data it held{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* secondary use, which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose, but then the data is used in ways without the data donors’ [[informed consent]]{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* exclusion is the use of a person's data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in its usage{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

===Information dissemination===
{{quote|''Count not him among your friends who will retail your privacies to the world.''|[[Publilius Syrus]]}}
Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

There are various examples of this.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person’s information private, then breaks that promise.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information, regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share, such as revealing their private life experiences, their nudity, or perhaps private body functions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it, as in the case of doxxing.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Blackmail is making a threat to share information, perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Appropriation is an attack on the [[personhood]] of someone, and can include using the value of someone's reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

===Invasions===
Invasion of privacy, a subset of [[expectation of privacy]], is a different concept from the collecting, aggregating, and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data, whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} An invasion is an attack in which information, whether intended to be public or not, is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

An intrusion is any unwanted entry into a person's private personal space and solitude for any reason, regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} "Decisional interference" is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision making process of another person, perhaps to influence that person's private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

==Right to privacy==
{{main|Right to privacy}}

Privacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In North America, [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis D. Brandeis]] wrote that privacy is the "right to be let alone" (Warren &amp; Brandeis, 1890) focuses on protecting individuals. This citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as [[yellow journalism]].&lt;ref name=Brandeis&gt;Warren and Brandeis, [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 "The Right To Privacy"], 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his [[Louis Brandeis#Creating a Right to Privacy|''Harvard Law Review'' article]] in 1890. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to [[constitutional law]], going so far as saying "the government [was] identified .... as a potential privacy invader." He writes, "Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet." At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].

===Definitions===

In recent years there have been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define a "right to privacy." Some experts assert that in fact the right to privacy "should not be defined as a separate legal right" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Haifa&gt;Yael Onn, et al., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yeVRrrJw-zAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=right+to+privacy+tel+aviv&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T0IhTaWhEI-msQOizMWZCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=right%20to%20privacy%20tel%20aviv&amp;f=false ''Privacy in the Digital Environment''], Haifa Center of Law &amp; Technology, (2005) pp. 1–12&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Dean Prosser]], have attempted, but failed, to find a "common ground" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of "privacy in the digital environment", suggests that the "right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself." It has therefore proposed a working definition for a "right to privacy":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.''&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===An individual right===

[[Alan Westin]] believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as "the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. These states must balance participation against norms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.
— Alan Westin, Privacy and Freedom, 1968&lt;ref&gt;Westin, A. (1968). Privacy and freedom (Fifth ed.). New York: Atheneum.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic [[Freedom of association|freedoms of association]] and [[Freedom of speech|expression]].

David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy. He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves "the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information". This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, "[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used".&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, D. (1989). Protecting privacy in surveillance societies: The federal republic of Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and the United States. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posner | first1 = R. A. | year = 1981 | title = The economics of privacy | url = | journal = The American Economic Review | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 405–09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims "the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right", and that "individuals should be able to control information about themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.

===A collective "value" and a "human right"===

There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental [[Human rights|human right]], whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Deborah|title=Ethical theory and business.|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0136126022|pages=428–42|edition=8th|authorlink=Privacy|editors=Beauchamp, Bowie, Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amitai Etzioni]] suggests a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] approach to privacy. This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2006). Communitarianism. In B. S. Turner (Ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology (pp. 81–83). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Etzioni believes that "[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others",&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2007). Are new technologies the enemy of privacy? Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy, 20, 115–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight (ibid). He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance by weakening informal social controls.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2000). A communitarian perspective on privacy. Connecticut Law Review, 32(3), 897–905.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the government is no longer the only or even principle threat to people's privacy. Etzioni notes that corporate data miners, or "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130905184715/http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf Privacy Merchants]," stand to profit by selling massive dossiers personal information, including purchasing decisions and Internet traffic, to the highest bidder. And while some might not find collection of private information objectionable when it is only used commercially by the private sector, the information these corporations amass and process is also available to the government, so that it is no longer possible to protect privacy by only curbing the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etzioni |first=Amitai |title=The Privacy Merchants: What is to be done? |journal=The Journal of Constitutional Law |date=March 2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=950 |url=http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905184715/http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and [[Collectivism|collective]] components. Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power. Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided. Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: "if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection".&lt;ref&gt;Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]]: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (1948). Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Retrieved October 7, 2006 from {{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208080853/http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |archivedate=2014-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, L. R. (2008). Reconsidering the right to privacy in Canada. Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society, 28(1), 80–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection==
[[File:Privacy International 2007 privacy ranking map.png|thumb|300px|[[Privacy International]] 2007 privacy ranking&lt;br /&gt;green: Protections and safeguards&lt;br /&gt;red: Endemic surveillance societies]]

Most countries give citizen rights to privacy in their constitutions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} Representative examples of this include the ''[[Constitution of Brazil]]'', which says "the privacy, private life, honor and image of people are inviolable"; the ''[[Constitution of South Africa]]'' says that "everyone has a right to privacy"; and the ''[[Constitution of the Republic of Korea]]'' says "the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed."{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights, court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

Many countries have broad privacy laws outside their constitutions, including Australia’s [[Privacy Act 1988]], Argentina’s Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000, Canada’s 2000 [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and Japan’s 2003 Personal Information Protection Law.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

Beyond national privacy laws, there are international privacy agreements.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3}} The United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] says "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation."{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] published its Privacy Guidelines in 1980. The [[European Union]]'s 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] guides privacy protection in Europe.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} The 2004 Privacy Framework by the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

In the 1960s people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} [[Vance Packard]]’s ''[[The Naked Society]]'' was a popular book on privacy from that era and led discourse on privacy at that time.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

===Free market versus consumer protection approaches===
Approaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection.&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ethics for the Information Age | author=Quinn, Michael J. | year=2009 | isbn=0-321-53685-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share. Such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market, by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user, or by lack of information about actual privacy practices. Claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify, except when they have already been violated.

In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available. In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Privacy policies as decision-making tools: an evaluation of online privacy notices | author=Jensen, Carlos | year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards.

===Privacy law===
{{Main|Privacy law}}

Privacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals. While there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries, some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries. For example, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], article 12, states:

:''No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.''

====Australia====
{{main |Privacy in Australian law}}

The ''Privacy Act 1988'' is administered by the [https://www.oaic.gov.au Office of the Australian Information Commissioner].

Privacy law has been evolving in Australia for a number of years. The initial introduction of privacy law in 1998 extended to the public sector, specifically to Federal government departments, under the Information Privacy Principles. State government agencies can also be subject to state based privacy legislation. This built upon the already existing privacy requirements that applied to telecommunications providers (under Part 13 of the ''Telecommunications Act 1997''), and confidentiality requirements that already applied to banking, legal and patient / doctor relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/|title=Privacy Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Privacy Act 1988'' was then extended to include the private sector in 2000 with the introduction of the National Privacy Principles. These took effect in 2001. Small businesses with an annual turnover of $3m were excluded from meeting the obligations specified in the National Privacy Principles with some exceptions such as those whose primary business was dealing in personal information.

In 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) conducted a review of Australian Privacy Law. The resulting report [http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/report-108 For Your Information] was one of the largest reports ever released by the ALRC. Amongst its many recommendations were the consolidation of both the Information Privacy Principles and the National Privacy Principles to form what is now known as the Australian Privacy Principles.

This recommendation, and many others, were taken up and implemented by the Australian Government via the [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00197 Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012].

The Australian Privacy Principles, along with other key changes to the overall Act, took effect on 12 March 2014. The new structure of the privacy principles follow the information cycle and incorporate key emerging privacy concepts including privacy by design.

There are currently 14 Australian Privacy Principles:

# open and transparent management of personal information
# anonymity and pseudonymity
# collection of solicited personal information
# dealing with unsolicited personal information
# notification of the collection of personal information
# use or disclosure of personal information
# direct marketing
# cross-border disclosure of personal information
# adoption, use or disclosure of government related identifiers
# quality of personal information
# security of personal information
# access to personal information
# correction of personal information

As of 22 February 2018, the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 will introduce a mandatory data breach notification obligations for all organisations that are subject to Australia’s Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). This includes all Australian-registered companies and foreign-registered companies that carry on business in Australia or that interact with Australian data subjects.

===== Other Australian privacy laws =====

There are a range of other laws that provide privacy protection in Australia. These include, but are not limited to, the ''Telecommunications Act 1997'', ''Spam Act 2006'', the ''Do Not Call Register Act 2009'', general confidentiality obligations arising from certain professional relationships including with doctors, lawyers and other health providers, state based legislation including NSW [[Employee monitoring|workplace surveillance]] laws, state based laws that apply in NSW, Queensland and other states for the handling of health information and the handling of information by state government agencies.

====Brazil====
The [[Constitution of Brazil]] sets privacy as a major fundamental right. Even the State is not allowed to violate personal data, intimacy, private life, honor and image (article 5, incise X). In extreme situations, a judicial order can authorize some level of disclosure. But some data, such as correspondence, are absolutely inviolable, and not even judicial order can authorize the disclosure.

====China====

Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China

Article 245 Whoever unlawfully subjects another person to a body search or a search of his residence or unlawfully intrudes into another person's residence shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention. Any judicial officer who abuses his power and commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be given a heavier punishment.

Article 246 Whoever, by violence or other methods, publicly humiliates another person or invent stories to defame him, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public surveillance or deprivation of political rights. The crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be handled only upon complaint, except where serious harm is done to public order or to the interests of the State.

Article 252 Whoever conceals, destroys or unlawfully opens another person's letter, thereby infringing upon the citizen's right to freedom of correspondence, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than one year or criminal detention.

Article 253 Any postal worker who opens without authorization or conceals or destroys mail or telegrams shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years or criminal detention. Whoever steals money or property by committing the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be convicted and given a heavier punishment in accordance with the provisions of Article 264 of this Law.

====Canada====
{{main |Canadian privacy law}}

[[Canadian privacy law]] is governed federally by multiple acts, including the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and the [[Privacy Act (Canada)]]. Mostly this legislation concerns privacy infringement by government organizations. [[Data privacy]] was first addressed with the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and provincial-level legislation also exists to account for more specific cases personal privacy protection against commercial organizations.

====European Union====
For [[Europe]], Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] guarantees the right to respect for private and family life, one's home and correspondence. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] has developed a large body of jurisprudence defining this fundamental right to privacy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The [[European Union]] requires all member states to legislate to ensure that citizens have a right to privacy, through directives such as the 1995 [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data]]. It is regulated in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] and in France [[data protection]] is also monitored by the [[CNIL]], a governmental body which must authorize legislation concerning privacy before it can be enacted. In civil law jurisdictions, the right to privacy fell within the ambit of the right to a private life (droit a la vie privee) from which the tort could be claimed. Personality rights and the broader tort based
interpretation of the right to privacy protected correspondence, personal information and dignity. These rights gave rise to causes for damages in most civil law jurisdictions and common law jurisdictions prior to the sui generis development of Data Protection.

Although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection, some studies show that despite the laws, there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws.&lt;ref&gt;Burghardt, Buchmann, Böhm, Kühling, Sivridis ''A Study on the Lack of Enforcement of Data Protection Acts'' Proceedings of the 3rd int. conference on e-democracy, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union is also championing for the 'Right to be Forgotten' concept (which allows individuals to ask that links leading to information about themselves be removed from internet search engine results) to be adopted by other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/french-official-campaigns-to-make-right-to-be-forgotten-global/|title=French Official Campaigns to Make 'Right to be Forgotten' Global|first=Mark|last=Scott|date=3 December 2014|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''India'''

Due to the introduction of the Aadhaar project inhabitants of India were afraid that their privacy could be invaded. The project was also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masiero|first=Silvia|date=2018-09-24|title=Explaining Trust in Large Biometric Infrastructures: A Critical Realist Case Study of India's Aadhaar Project|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/isd2.12053|journal=The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|language=en|pages=e12053|doi=10.1002/isd2.12053|issn=1681-4835}}&lt;/ref&gt; To tackle the fear amongst the people, India’s supreme court put a new ruling into action that stated that privacy from then on was seen as a fundamental right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gemalto.com/govt/customer-cases/aadhaar|title=Aadhaar: 7 changes transforming India in 2018 {{!}} Gemalto|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gemalto.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24th of August 2017 this new law was established.

====Italy====
In [[Italy]] the [[right to privacy]] is enshrined in Article 15 of the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and of every other form of communication is inviolable. Limitations may only be imposed by judicial decision stating the reasons and in accordance with the guarantees provided by the law."

====United Kingdom====
{{main |Privacy in English law}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy. An action may be brought under another [[tort]] (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4482073.stm Does Beckham judgment change rules?], from [[BBC News]] (retrieved 27 April 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
There is, however, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information. They do this by promoting good practice, ruling on eligible complaints, giving information to individuals and organisations, and taking action when the law is broken. The relevant UK laws include: [[Data Protection Act 1998]]; [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]]; [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]; [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003|Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003]]. The ICO has also provided a "Personal Information Toolkit" online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf "Personal Information Toolkit"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103165639/http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf |date=2009-01-03 }} prepared by the Information Commissioner’s Office, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{main |Privacy laws of the United States}}

Although the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]] does not explicitly include the right to privacy, individual as well as locational privacy are implicitly granted by the Constitution under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has found that other guarantees have "penumbras" that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965). In the United States, the right of [[freedom of speech]] granted in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the US by the [[Privacy Act of 1974]], and various state laws. The Privacy Act of 1974 only applies to Federal agencies in the executive branch of the Federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://foia.state.gov/Learn/PrivacyAct.aspx|title = The Privacy Act|date = 2015-05-22|accessdate = 2015-11-19|website = Freedom of Information Act|publisher = US Department of State|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA),&lt;ref&gt;Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLB), and the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA).
&lt;ref&gt;[[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy Index===
The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]'s Privacy Index puts Brazil, Australia, Japan and South Africa in the higher level of privacy (around 2.2). On the bottom of the list are the United States and United Kingdom (around 1.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chartsbin.com/view/by8|title=International Privacy Index |publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy on the Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}
{{see also|Right to be forgotten}}
There are many means to protect one's privacy on the internet. For example, e-mails can be encrypted (via [[S/MIME]] or [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]) and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] can be used to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates. Covert collection of personally identifiable information has been identified as a primary concern by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref name="FederalTrade"&gt;Federal Trade Commission (2010), "Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers," Preliminary FTC Staff Report (December), available at [http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Although some privacy advocates recommend the deletion of original and third-party [[HTTP cookies]], Anthony Miyazaki, marketing professor at [[Florida International University]] and privacy scholar, warns that the "elimination of third-party cookie use by Web sites can be circumvented by cooperative strategies with third parties in which information is transferred after the Web site's use of original domain cookies."&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, Anthony D. (2008), "Online Privacy and the Disclosure of Cookie Use: Effects on Consumer Trust and Anticipated Patronage," ''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'', 23 (Spring), 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010, the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing policy regarding this issue as it relates to [[behavioral advertising]].&lt;ref name="FederalTrade" /&gt;
Another aspect of privacy on the Internet relates to online social networking. Several online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals' privacy of online social networking show the following results: "first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short".&lt;ref&gt;Hugl, Ulrike (2011), "Reviewing Person’s Value of Privacy of Online Social Networking," ''Internet Research'', 21(4), in press, http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1066-2243&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=4&amp;articleid=1926600&amp;show=abstract.&lt;/ref&gt; This is exacerbated by the research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, personality, or intelligence can be inferred based on the wide variety of digital footprint, such as samples of text, browsing logs, or Facebook Likes.&lt;ref name="Kosinski 2013 5802–5805" /&gt;

===Privacy and location-based services===

Increasingly, mobile devices facilitate location tracking.  This creates user privacy problems.  A user's location and preferences constitute personal information.  Their improper use violates that user's privacy.  A recent MIT study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A. Hidalgo |author3=Michel Verleysen |author4=Vincent D. Blondel |title=Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility|journal=Scientific Reports|date=March 25, 2013|doi=10.1038/srep01376|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html|accessdate=12 April 2013 |volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Jason|title=Mobile location data 'present anonymity risk'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21923360|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by de Montjoye et al. showed that 4 spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5M people in a mobility database. The study
further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.

Several methods to protect user privacy in [[location-based service]]s have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers, blurring of information e.a. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Athanasios S. Voulodimos and Charalampos Z. Patrikakis, "Quantifying Privacy in Terms of Entropy for Context Aware Services", special issue of the Identity in the Information Society journal, "Identity Management in Grid and SOA", Springer, vol. 2, no 2, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Users of such services may also choose to display more generic location information (i.e. "In the City" or "Philadelphia" or "Work") to some of their more casual acquaintances while only displaying specific location information, such as their exact address, to closer contacts like spouse, relatives, and good friends.

In recent years, seen with the increasing importance of mobile devices and paired with the ''[[National Do Not Call Registry]]'', telemarketers have turned attention to mobiles.&lt;ref name = "Telemarketers and Mobiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sneaky-tactics-used-by-telemarketers-and-debt-collectors-to-get-your-cell-phone-number-2011-6 |title=Sneaky tactics used by telemarketers and debt collectors to get your cell phone number |publisher=Businessinsider.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of telemarketers to use mobile devices have been met with both ''[[Federal Trade Commission]]'' and companies like PrivacyStar. Each year, thousands of complaints are filed to the FTC database with the help of companies and consumers.

===Privacy by design===

The principle of [[privacy by design]] states that privacy and [[data protection]] are embedded throughout the entire life cycle of [[technologies]], from the early [[design]] stage to their deployment, use and ultimate disposal.

===Privacy engineering===

The practice of constructing, ostensibly, software or information systems that adhere to given privacy policies and relevant compliances is a developing area and is known as [[Privacy engineering]]

===Privacy self-synchronization===

Privacy self-synchronization is the mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program's maximum success. The stakeholders may be customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners or investors. When self-synchronization is reached, the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Popa, C., et. all., "Managing Personal Information: Insights on Corporate Risk and Opportunity for Privacy-Savvy Leaders", Carswell (2012), Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privacy paradox ==
The privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not.&lt;ref name="Swartz, J. 2000"&gt;Swartz, J., "'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox", The Washington Post, 03 Sep 2000, H.1.&lt;/ref&gt; While this term was coined as early as 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Bedrick, B., Lerner, B., Whitehead, B."The privacy paradox: Introduction", "News Media and the Law", Washington, D.C., Volume 22, Issue 2, Spring 1998, pp. P1-P3.&lt;/ref&gt; it wasn't used in its current popular sense until the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Sweat, J. "Privacy paradox: Customers want control—and coupons", InformationWeek, Manhasset Iss, 781, April 10, 2000, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swartz, J. 2000"/&gt; In his article titled "'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox," John Schwartz wrote that "It's one of the more puzzling conundrums of online life. While companies that capitalize on the Internet's powerful potential to invade privacy are denounced as villains of the information age, millions of people type out highly personal data and send it off to Web sites they've barely heard of, with no strong legal protection against misuse of the information. …The paradox helps illustrate the complexity of the debate over privacy."

Susan B. Barnes similarly used the term “privacy paradox” to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, S., "A privacy paradox: Social networking in the United States", 
First Monday, volume 11, number 9 (September 2006), URL: http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue11_9/barnes/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to adults, young people tend to disclose more information on social media. However, this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy. Susan B. Barnes gave a case in her article: in a television interview about Facebook, a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online. However, when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page, she put her home address, phone numbers, and pictures of her young son on the page.

Privacy paradox has been studied and scripted in different research settings. Although several studies have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users, the reason for the paradox still remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taddicken | first1 = M | year = 2014 | title = The 'Privacy Paradox'in the Social Web: The Impact of Privacy Concerns, Individual Characteristics, and the Perceived Social Relevance on Different Forms of Self-Disclosure | url = | journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 248–73 | doi=10.1111/jcc4.12052}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main explanation for the privacy paradox is that users lack awareness of the risks and the degree of protection.&lt;ref&gt;Acquisti, A., &amp; Gross, R. (2006, June). Imagined communities: Awareness, information sharing, and privacy on the Facebook. In ''Privacy enhancing technologies'' (pp. 36–58). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;boyd, D., &amp; Hargittai, E. (2010). Facebook

On the other hand, some researchers argue the privacy paradox comes from lack of technology literacy and from the design of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Livingstone | first1 = S | year = 2008 | title = Taking risky opportunities in youthful content creation: teenagers' use of social networking sites for intimacy, privacy and self-expression | url = | journal = New media &amp; society | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 393–411 |
doi=10.1177/1461444808089415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, users may not know how to change their default settings even though they care about their privacy.  Psychologists particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox occurs because users must trade-off between their privacy concerns and impression management.&lt;ref&gt;Utz, S., &amp; Kramer, N. (2009). The privacy paradox on social network sites revisited: The role of individual characteristics and group norms. ''Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace,'' ''3''(2), article 1.

&lt;/ref&gt; Other individual factors such as gender, age, trust and personality, may also account for the paradox.

== The right to privacy in popular culture ==

The 1993 film ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]'', based on the [[The Pelican Brief|novel of the same name]], touches on privacy.  In one scene, a law professor discusses the Constitutional right to privacy. One of his students, played by [[Julia Roberts]], argues that the majority opinion in [[Bowers v. Hardwick|Bowers v Hardwick]] was wrongly decided.

In the TV series [[West Wing]], in the 1999 episode ''Short List'', the right to privacy arises during the appointment of a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] judge.  [[Sam Seabourne]] ventures the opinion that [[Internet]] privacy will be a major social issue in the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westwingtranscripts.com/search.php?flag=getTranscript&amp;id=9|title=Search or Browse The West Wing Transcripts -- View or Search transcripts and summaries|author=|date=|website=westwingtranscripts.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selfie culture ===
[[Selfies]] are popular today; a search for photos with the hashtag #selfie retrieves over 23 million results on Instagram and "a whopping 51 million with the hashtag #me"  However, due to modern corporate and governmental surveillance, this may pose a risk to privacy.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giroux|first=Henry A.|date=2015-05-04|title=Selfie Culture in the Age of Corporate and State Surveillance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09528822.2015.1082339|journal=Third Text|volume=29|issue=3|pages=155–164|doi=10.1080/09528822.2015.1082339|issn=0952-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a research which takes a sample size of 3763, researchers found that for selfies, females generally have greater concerns than male social media users. Users who have greater concerns inversely predict their selfie behavior and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhir|first=Amandeep|last2=Torsheim|first2=Torbjørn|last3=Pallesen|first3=Ståle|last4=Andreassen|first4=Cecilie S.|date=2017|title=Do Online Privacy Concerns Predict Selfie Behavior among Adolescents, Young Adults and Adults?|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00815/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00815|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''rights of Englishmen''' are the perceived traditional rights of citizens of England. In the 18th century, some of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|colonists who objected to British rule]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colonies in North America]] argued that their traditional{{sfnp|Zuckert|2003}} rights as [[Englishmen]] were being violated. The colonists wanted and expected the rights that they (or their forebears) had previously enjoyed in England: a local, representative government, with regards to judicial matters (some colonists were being sent back to England for trials) and particularly with regards to taxation.{{sfnp|Tindall |1984}} Belief in these rights subsequently became a widely-accepted justification for the [[American Revolution]].{{sfnp|Swindler|1976}}{{sfnp|Miller|1959}}

The American colonies had since the 17th century been fertile ground for liberalism within the center of European political discourse.{{sfnp|Heale|1986}} However, as the ratification of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] approached, the issue among the colonists of which particular rights were significant became divisive. [[George Mason]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], stated that "We claim nothing but the liberty and privileges of Englishmen in the same degree, as if we had continued among our brethren in Great Britain."{{sfnp|Miller|1959}}

==Historical background== 
{{Further information|Fundamental Laws of England}}
[[File:Sir William Blackstone from NPG.jpg|alt=|thumb|18th-century English jurist William Blackstone attempted to explain the rights of English citizens.]]
In the tradition of [[Whig history]], Judge [[William Blackstone]] called them "The absolute rights of every Englishman", and explained how they had been established slowly over centuries of [[English history]], in his book on ''[[Fundamental Laws of England]]'', which was the first part of his influential ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.&lt;ref name=Blackstone&gt;[[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], ''[[Fundamental Laws of England]]'', the first part of ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', pp. 123–24. Scanned in text available at [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Yale Law School Libraries online]. Retrieved 26 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They were certain basic rights that all subjects of the [[English monarch]] were understood to be entitled to,&lt;ref name="Blackstone"/&gt; such as those expressed in [[Magna Carta]] since 1215, the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628, the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Billias|first1=George Athan|title=American constitutionalism heard round the world, 1776–1989: a global perspective|date=2011|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814725177|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ku0TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpnefZzqfMAhXC1hoKHcjFAG0Q6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a legal case in 1608 that came to be known as ''[[Calvin's Case]]'', or the ''Case of the Postnati'', the [[Law Lords]] decided in 1608 that [[Scotsmen]] born after [[King James I]] united [[Scotland]] and England (the ''postnati'') had all the rights of Englishmen. This decision would have a subsequent effect on the concept of the "rights of Englishmen" in British America.{{sfnp|Price|1997}}{{sfnp|Hulsebosch|2003}}{{sfnp|Pearson|2005}}

Some scholars believed that the case did not fit British America's situation, and thus reasoned that the 18th-century colonists could "claim all the rights and protections of English citizenship."&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite book | author = Ellen Holmes Pearson | chapter = Revising Custom, Embracing Choice: Early American Legal Scholars and the Republicanization of Common Law | editor = Eliga H. Gould, Peter S. Onuf | title = Empire And Nation: The American Revolution In The Atlantic World | location = Baltimore | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University]] Press | isbn = 0-8018-7912-4 | page = 102, n. 33 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zaZuwRLHGCAC&amp;pg=PA102 | accessdate = 21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal apologists for the [[American Revolution]] even claimed they had "''improved'' on the rights of Englishmen" by creating additional, purely American rights.&lt;ref name=Pearson /&gt;{{sfnp|Pearson|2005}}

==Legacy in United States law==
Owing to its inclusion in the standard legal treatises of the 19th century,{{efn|Compiled by [[Edward Coke]], [[William Blackstone]], and [[James Kent]].}} ''Calvin's Case'' was well known in the early judicial history of the United States.{{sfnp|Hulsebosch|2003}} Consideration of the case by the [[United States Supreme Court]] and by state courts transformed it into a rule regarding American citizenship and solidified the concept of ''[[jus soli]]''&amp;nbsp;– the right by which nationality or citizenship can be recognised to any individual born in the territory of the related state&amp;nbsp;– as the primary determining factor controlling the acquisition of citizenship by birth.{{sfnp|Price|1997|pages=138–39}}

The Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph P. Bradley]] asserted that the "rights of Englishmen" were a foundation of American law in his dissenting opinion on the [[Slaughter-House Cases]], the first Supreme Court interpretation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], in 1873.{{efn|In his dissenting decision, Bradley wrote:{{quote|The people of this country brought with them to its shores the rights of Englishmen, the rights which had been wrested from English sovereigns at various periods of the nation's history.... England has no written constitution, it is true, but it has an unwritten one, resting in the acknowledged, and frequently declared, privileges of Parliament and the people, to violate which in any material respect would produce a revolution in an hour. A violation of one of the fundamental principles of that constitution in the Colonies, namely, the principle that recognizes the property of the people as their own, and which, therefore, regards all taxes for the support of government as gifts of the people through their representatives, and regards taxation without representation as subversive of free government, was the origin of our own revolution.}}}}

'''Rāhula''' ([[Pāli]] and Sanskrit) was the only son of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama (commonly known as the Buddha)]]  ({{nowrap|{{circa}} 563 or 480 {{en dash}}}} {{nowrap|483 or 400 BCE}}), and his wife and princess [[Yasodharā|Yaśodharā]]. He is mentioned in numerous Buddhist texts, from the [[Early Buddhist Texts|early period]] onward. Accounts about Rāhula indicate a mutual impact between Prince Siddhārtha's life and those of his family members. According to the [[Pali Canon|Pāli tradition]], Rāhula is born on the day of Prince Siddhārta's [[great renunciation|renunciation]], and is therefore named ''Rāhula'', meaning a fetter on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. According to the [[Mūlasarvāstivāda]] tradition, and numerous other [[post-canonical Buddhist texts|later sources]], however, Rāhula is only ''conceived'' on the day of Prince Siddhārtha, and is born six years later, when Prince Siddhārtha becomes enlightened as the [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]]. This long gestation period is explained by bad [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] from previous lives of both Yaśodharā and of Rāhula himself, although more [[religious naturalism|naturalistic]] reasons are also given. As a result of the late birth, Yaśodharā needs to prove that Rāhula is really Prince Siddhārtha's son, which she eventually does successfully by an [[sacca-kiriya|act of truth]]. Historian {{ill|Wolfgang Schumann|de|Wolfgang Schumann (Historiker)}} has argued that Prince Siddhārtha conceived Rāhula and waited for his birth, to be able to leave the palace with the king and queen's permission, but Orientalist {{ill|Noël Péri|fr}} considered it more likely that Rāhula was born after Prince Siddhārtha left his palace.

Between seven and fifteen years after Rāhula is born, the Buddha returns to his [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|hometown]], where Yaśodharā has Rāhula ask the Buddha for the throne of the [[Shakya|Śākya]] clan. The Buddha responds by having Rāhula [[pabbajja|ordain]] as the first Buddhist [[samanera|novice monk]]. He teaches the young novice about [[sacca|truth]], self-reflection, and [[anatta|not-self]], eventually leading to Rāhula's enlightenment. Although early accounts state that Rāhula dies before the Buddha does, later tradition has it that Rāhula is one of the disciples that outlives the Buddha, guarding the Buddha's dispensation until the rising of the [[Maitreya|next Buddha]]. Rāhula is known in Buddhist texts for his eagerness for learning, and was honored by novice monks and [[samaneri|nuns]] throughout Buddhist history. His accounts have led to a perspective in Buddhism of seeing children as hindrances to the spiritual life on the one hand, and as people with potential for enlightenment on the other hand.

== Accounts ==
Some early texts such as those of the [[Pali Canon|Pāli tradition]] do not mention Rāhula at all;{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=139}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=113}} but he is mentioned in later Pāli texts such as the [[Apadana|Apadāna]] and the [[atthakatha|commentaries]], as well as in the texts on [[Vinaya|monastic discipline]] of the [[Mūlasarvāstivāda]] and [[Mahasanghika|Mahāsaṇghika]] traditions.{{refn |For the [[Apadana|Apadāna]], see {{harvtxt |Crosby |2013 |page = 105}}. The other information is mentioned in {{harvtxt |Meeks |2016 |p=139}}.}} Earliest texts do not describe Rāhula in much detail, and he remains an ideal figure without much depth in character.{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=109}} Because of the lack of detail, especially after Rāhula's ordination, some scholars have argued Rāhula did not have an important role in Buddhism.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}} Apart from the early texts, there are many [[post-canonical Buddhist texts]] that contain accounts about Rāhula.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=139}} The accounts about Rāhula reveal that when Prince Siddhārtha leaves his palace to become a monk, his decision and subsequent spiritual quest is not just a personal matter, but also affects his family every step during the way, as they respond to and affect the prince on his path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. Thus, the prince's life before enlightenment is about two parallel spiritual lives, that of the Buddha and that of his family.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |pp=122{{en dash}}4}}

=== Birth ===
==== Pāli tradition ====
[[File:Siddhartha leaving sleeping Yashodhara and Rahula Roundel 17 buddha ivory tusk.jpg|thumb|Just before the prince leaves the palace for the spiritual life, he takes one look at his wife Yaśodharā and his just-born child.|alt=Ivory tusk showing a woman and a child sleeping on a bed, and a man standing besides the bed.]]
Rāhula is born on same day Prince [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]] renounces the throne by leaving the palace,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} when the prince is 29 years old,{{sfn |Keown |2004 |page=233}}{{sfn |Irons |2007 |p=400}}{{refn |group=note |According to some traditional sources, the prince is sixteen then.{{sfn |Keown |2004 |p=267}} Furthermore, some sources say that Rāhula is born seven days before Prince Siddhārtha leaves the palace.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/rahulamata.htm Rāhulamātā]}}{{sfn |Sarao |2017 |loc=Biography of the Buddha and Early Buddhism}}}} on the full moon day of the eight [[lunar month]] of the [[Hindu calendar|ancient Indian calendar]].{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} That day, Prince Siddhārtha is preparing himself to leave the palace. The Pāli account claims that when he receives the news of his son's birth he replies "{{IAST|rāhulajāto bandhanaṃ jātaṃ}}", meaning 'A ''rāhu'' is born, a fetter has arisen',{{sfn |Powers |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} that is, an impediment to the search for enlightenment. Accordingly, [[Suddhodana|Śuddhodana]], Prince Siddhārtha's father and king of the [[Shakya|Śākya clan]], names the child ''Rāhula'',{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} because he does not want his son to pursue a spiritual life as a mendicant.{{sfn |Irons |2007 |p=400}} In some versions, Prince Siddhārtha is the one naming his son this way, for being a hindrance on his spiritual path.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}} Just before the prince leaves the palace for the spiritual life, he takes one look at his wife Yaśodharā and his just-born child. Fearing his resolve might waver, Prince Siddhārtha resists to hold his son and leaves the palace as he has planned.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} Rāhula therefore becomes Prince Siddhārtha's first, but also last and only son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Violatti |first1=Cristian |title=Siddhartha Gautama |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Siddhartha_Gautama/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825002210/http://www.ancient.eu:80/Siddhartha_Gautama |archive-date=25 August 2014 |deadurl=no |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=29 October 2018 |date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Powers |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}

==== Other traditions ====
Other texts derive ''rāhu'' differently. For example, the Pāli ''[[Apadana|Apadāna]]'', as well as another account found in the texts of [[vinaya|monastic discipline]] of the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, derive ''rāhu'' from the eclipse of the moon, which traditionally was seen to be caused by the [[asura (Buddhism)|asura]] (demon) [[Rāhu]].{{sfn |Gnoli |1977 |page = 119}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} The ''Apadāna'' states that just like the moon is obstructed from view by Rāhu, Prince Siddhārtha is obstructed by Rāhula's birth.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=105}} The Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition relates, however, that Rāhula is conceived on the evening of the [[great renunciation|renunciation]] of Prince Siddhārtha, and born six years later, on the day that his father achieves enlightenment,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} which was during a lunar eclipse.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=119}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=105}} Further credence is given to the astrological theory of Rāhula's name by the observation that sons of [[list of Buddhas|previous Buddhas]] are given similar names, related to constellations.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}}

Mūlasarvāstivāda and later Chinese texts such as the ''[[Dharmaguptaka#Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra|Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra]]'' give two types of explanation for the long gestation period.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=139{{en dash}}40}}{{sfn |Sasson |Law |2008 |p=69}} The first type involves the [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] of Princess Yaśodharā and Rāhula himself.&lt;!--139-40--&gt; According to this interpretation, Yaśodharā has to bear the suffering of carrying a child in her womb for six years, because in a previous life as a cow herder she had refused to help her mother to carry a pail of milk and left it for her mother to carry the extra pail for six [[yojana|leagues]].{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=139{{en dash}}40}}{{sfn |Sasson |Law |2008 |pp=69{{en dash}}70}} As for Rāhula, his karma was that in a previous life as a king he unintentionally had a sage wait for six days.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=140}}{{sfn |Ohnuma |2012 |p=143}} In this life, he was a king and his brother, [[Bodhisattva#Early and Theravāda Buddhism|a previous life of the Buddha]],{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}} was a [[rishi|hermit]] who had taken a vow he would only live from what was given by people. One day, the brother broke his vow to take some water, and feeling guilty, asked the king to punish him.{{refn |group=note |In the texts of the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, the brother is another hermit, not the king, but he sends his brother to see the king for punishment.{{sfn |Péri |1918 |p=8}}}} The king refused to issue a punishment for such a trivial matter, but had his brother wait for his final decision and constrained in the royal gardens. After six days, the king suddenly realized he had forgotten about the hermit and immediately set him free, including apologies and gifts. As a result, Rāhula had to wait for six years before being born.{{sfn |Sasson |Law |2008 |p=69}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=117}} In some versions, the king did not allow a sage to enter his kingdom and accumulated the same bad karma of a long gestation period.{{sfn |Shirane |2013 |pp=168{{en dash}}9}} The later Mahāyāna commentary ''[[Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa]]'' ({{zh|t=大智度論|p=Dazhidulun}}) does not blame Yaśodharā's karma for the six years gestation period, but does mention Rāhula's same karma as a king. However, in the 13th-century Japanese devotional text ''Raun Kōshiki'', Rāhula's late birth is seen as evidence of a miracle, rather than a result of karma.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=141}}{{refn |group=note |In the Pāli texts, no long gestation period of Rāhula is mentioned, but a similar motif occurs in the story of Suppāvāsā, with a similar karma in a past life.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}}}}

The second type of explanation consists of the more [[Religious naturalism|naturalistic]] argument that Yaśodharā is practicing [[Asceticism#Buddhism|religious austerities]] involving fasting and sleeping on a straw bed, which causes Rāhula's growth to slow down. She is involved in these practices during the time when Siddhārtha is practicing self-mortification. Later, King Śuddhodana prevents Yaśodharā from hearing any news of her former husband, and she gradually becomes healthier, as the pregnancy continues normally. However, some time later, the false rumor spreads that the former prince has died of his ascetism.&lt;!--118--&gt; Yaśodharā becomes very desperate and depressed, endangering her own pregnancy. When the news reaches the palace that Siddhārtha has attained enlightenment, Yaśodharā is overjoyed and gives birth to Rāhula. Buddhist Studies scholar [[John S. Strong]] notes that this account draws a parallel between the quest for enlightenment and Yaśodharā's path to being a mother, and eventually, they both are accomplished at the same time.&lt;!--119--&gt;{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=140}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |pp=118{{en dash}}9}}

The late childbirth leads to doubts in the Śākya clan as to who is the father, as told in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, in the ''Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa'' and in the later Chinese ''Zabaozang jing'' ({{zh|t=雜寶藏經}}).{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=139}} Since Rāhula's birth was not regarded by Buddhists to be a virginal or miraculous birth, tradition had to explain that Prince Siddhārtha was actually the father.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=119}} Yaśodharā responds by putting her child on a stone in a pond of water and making an [[sacca-kiriya|act of truth]] that if Rāhula is really her child, that he and the stone may not sink, but rather float back-and-forth. After she makes the declaration, the child floats according to her vow.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2012 |p=142}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=120}} Strong notes that this is a symbolic parallel with the attainment of enlightenment by the Buddha, described as the "further shore", and coming back to teach humankind.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=140}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=120}} The ''Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa'' contains another account, in which Prince Siddhārtha has several wives,&lt;!--140--&gt; and a wife other than Yaśodharā is the one defending her, being witness of her innocence.&lt;!--141--&gt;{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=139{{en dash}}41}}

Furthermore, in both the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts and the ''Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa'', there is a third account that proves Yaśodharā's innocence: the Buddha makes everyone around him look identical to him, through a [[ṛddhi|supernatural accomplishment]]. Rāhula proves that the Buddha is his true father when he manages to approach the real Buddha straight away.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=120}}{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pp=32{{en dash}}3}}{{refn |group=note |Yaśodharā had Rāhula present a gift to his real father, and he manages to find him straight away.

In this account, King Śuddhodana orders that she be killed by burning her alive as punishment for her alleged impurity. Instead of being hurt by the flames, however, she performs an act of truth and the fire transforms into a pond of water. Śuddhodana welcomes her and her son back into the clan, and later becomes very fond of Rāhula.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=142}} Some Chinese [[Jataka|Jātakas]] say that he recognizes his son Siddhārtha in the child, and manages to better cope with the loss of Prince Siddhārtha.{{sfn |Péri |1918 |p=22}} Religion scholar Reiko Ohnuma sees the fire ordeal as a metaphor that parallels the Buddha's enlightenment, a similar argument that Strong makes.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2012 |p=142}}

==== Historical analysis ====
Historian {{ill|Wolfgang Schumann|de|Wolfgang Schumann (Historiker)}} hypothesized that Prince Siddhārtha conceived Rāhula to please his parents, obtain their permission for leaving the palace and becoming a mendicant. He further speculated that the prince only conceived a son thirteen years after his marriage, because Yaśodharā initially did not want to bear a child, for fear that the prince would leave the palace and the throne as soon as the child was conceived.{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=46}} Orientalist and missionary {{ill |Noël Péri |fr}} believed that a late gestation period was more historically probable than the birth on the same day as in the Pāli tradition. She believed that if Prince Siddhārtha had left an heir to the throne, there would have been no sound reason for him to leave secretly at night. She further argued that there are many sources that try to explain the long gestation period, indicating an established tradition.{{sfn |Péri |1918 |pp=34{{en dash}}5}}

Besides historical speculations, Buddhist Studies scholar Kate Crosby argues that Prince Siddhārtha conceiving or giving birth to a son before his renunciation functions as a motif to prove that he is the best at each possible path in life: after having tried the life of a father to the fullest, he decides to leave it behind for a better alternative.&lt;!--108--&gt; In [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist]] India, being a father and bearing a son was seen as a spiritual and religious path as well as that of renouncing one's family, and Prince Siddhārtha's bringing a son in the world before renunciation proves he is capable of both.&lt;!--108-9--&gt;{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=108{{en dash}}9}}

=== Ordination ===

The accounts continue and describe that Rāhula is raised by his mother Yaśodharā and grandfather King Śuddhodana.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} When Rāhula is seven,{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} nine{{sfn |Meeks|2016 |p=136}}{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=123}} or fifteen{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=110}} years old, the Buddha returns to his home city of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]] at the request of Śuddhodana.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} The [[Mahavastu|Mahāvastu]] text from the [[Lokottaravāda]] tradition states that the royals try to prevent Rāhula from learning about the return of his father, but eventually he insists to know who the "Great Ascetic" about to arrive is, and he is told&lt;!--133-4--&gt;{{em dash}}indologist Bhikkhu Telwatte Rahula {{sic}} argues that the child was conscious of being without father.&lt;!--134--&gt;{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |pp=133{{en dash}}4}} Next, the Mahāvastu and the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts relate that Yaśodharā tries to tempt the Buddha back into his life as a prince by having Rāhula offer the Buddha an [[aphrodisiac]].{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=121}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=134}} Mūlasarvāstivāda texts continue and tell that her plan backfires when the Buddha has Rāhula eat it himself, and Rāhula therefore becomes enamored by his father and wishes to follow him.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2012 |p=145}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=121}} In the Pāli version of the story, on the seventh day of the Buddha's return, Yaśodharā takes Rāhula to see his father, the Buddha.

Most traditions relate that the Buddha then calls [[Sariputta|Śāriputra]] and asks him to ordain Rāhula. Rāhula ordains and is the first [[Samanera|''śrāmaṇera'']] (novice monk),{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} and probably the first person in the [[sangha|monastic order]] to [[pabbajja|ordain in a formal way]].{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=83}} In some versions of the story, such as the 9th century Chinese ''Weicengyou Yinyuan Jing'' ({{zh|t=未曾有因緣經}}), a group of young boys ordain together with him.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=143}}{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pp=34{{en dash}}5}} The king discovers that now his grandson, [[Nanda (half-brother of Buddha)|his son Nanda]] and a number of other young men in the royal family have ordained and left the palace. Seeing his daughter grieve, he asks the Buddha that from now on, he only ordain people with the consent of his parents.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Keown |2004 |p=281}} Śuddhodana explains that Rāhula's ordination was a great shock to him. The Buddha assents to the proposal.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} This rule is later expanded in the case of women ordaining, as both parents and the husband have to give permission first to allow women to join the order of monks and nuns.{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=163}} In some versions of the story of Rāhula's ordination, Yaśodharā also protests, but relents in the end.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |p=34}} The Mahāvastu states, however, that Rāhula asks to ordain himself, and is eventually granted permission by Yaśodharā and Śuddhodana.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=134}}

Archaeologist Maurizio Taddei has noted that in many [[Gandhara]]n art depictions, Rāhula's life is linked to that of a previous life of the Buddha, the hermit [[Sumedho (Buddhist figure)|Sumedho]]. The Buddha giving his spiritual heritage to his son is compared to that of Sumedho allowing the [[Dipankara|Buddha Dīpaṃkara]] to walk over him, which is followed by Dipaṃkara predicting that Sumedho will become a [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]] in a future life.&lt;!--119--&gt; Both the figure of Gautama Buddha giving his inheritance to his son, and the figure of Dīpaṃkara Buddha giving his inheritance of [[Buddhahood]] to Sumedho are depicted with flames emitting from their bodies; both scenes are depictions of inheritance, [[filial piety|filial]] and disciple piety; both may have been considered by 5th-century Buddhists to be representations of "eager youth".&lt;!--120--&gt;{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=119{{en dash}}20}}

=== Enlightenment and death ===
[[File:Ping Sien Si - 036 Rahula Thera (Thinking) (15638059169).jpg|thumb |Statue of Rāhula as monk at Ping Sien Si, [[Pasir Panjang]], [[Perak]], Malaysia |alt=Image of older monk with large eyebrows, sitting, with his hands hidden in his sleeves |upright=.8]]
According to the Pāli texts, once Rāhula has become novice, the Buddha teaches Rāhula regularly.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} His instructions are very age-specific, using vivid metaphors&lt;!--113--&gt; and simple explanations.&lt;!--115--&gt;{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=113, 115}} The Buddha's teachings have led to numerous [[sūtra|discourses]] being named after Rāhula in the [[Early Buddhist Texts]].{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} Pāli texts relate how Rāhula grows up to become a novice that is diligent,&lt;!--Nakagawa--&gt; dutiful, amenable and eager for learning,&lt;!--Malalasekera--&gt;{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |p=34}} but there are also some early medieval Chinese and Japanese accounts which relate that Rāhula initially struggles with being a novice and only later appreciates the Buddha's teaching.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=143}} Besides the Buddha, Śāriputra and [[Maudgalyayana|Maugalyayāna]] also help to teach Rāhula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |author2=Stefon, Matt |title=Shariputra {{en dash}} Disciple of the Buddha |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shariputra |website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |accessdate=30 October 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114220448/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shariputra |archive-date=14 November 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |p=34}} Rāhula often assists Śāriputra on his rounds for [[alms (Buddhism)|alms]] in the morning, and sometimes on other travels.{{refn |Both {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} and {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} mention the alms, but only {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} mentions the other travels.}} Every morning, Rāhula wakes up and throws a handful of sand in the air, making the wish that he may be counselled by good teachers as much as those grains of sand.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}}

Still in the same year as Rāhula's ordination, the Buddha teaches his son the importance of telling the truth in a discourse known as the ''Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta''.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} In this discourse, the Buddha teaches and encourages consistent self-reflection, to help let go of all evil actions that lead to harm to oneself and others, and to develop self-control and a moral life.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}}{{sfn |Schlieter |2014 |p=319}} He encourages reflection before, during and after one's actions,{{sfn |Schlieter |2014 |p=319}} and explains that lying makes the spiritual life void and empty,{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} leading to many other evils.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/am/ambalatthika_raahulovaada_s.htm Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta]}}

When Rāhula becomes eighteen years old, the Buddha instructs Rāhula in a [[Kammaṭṭhāna|meditation technique]] to counter the desires that hinder him during his tours for alms. Rāhula has grown enamored with his own and his father's handsome appearance. To help Rāhula, the Buddha teaches another discourse to him. He tells Rāhula that all [[rūpa|matter]] is [[anatta|not-self]], and the same holds for the [[skandhas|different parts of one's mental experience]].{{refn |For the part on alms rounds, see {{harvtxt|Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}}. For the part about not-self, see {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} and {{harvtxt|Crosby |2013 |p=115}}.}} Having heard the discourse, Rāhula starts to practice meditation. His teacher Śāriputra recommends him to practice [[anapanasati|breathing meditation]],{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |pp=189{{en dash}}93}} but is unable to give Rāhula the instructions he needs.{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=110}} Rāhula therefore asks the Buddha to explain the meditation method in more detail and the Buddha responds by describing several meditation techniques to him.{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |pp=189{{en dash}}93}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=115}} On a similar note, the Buddha teaches Rāhula at a place called Andhavana about the [[anicca|impermanence]] of all things, and instructs him how to overcome the [[asava|"taints"]] inside the mind. As a result, Rāhula attains enlightenment.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |pp=482{{en dash}}3}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=116}} Pāli tradition has it that the sermon is also attended by a [[crore]] of [[deva (Buddhism)|heavenly beings]], who once had vowed to witness the enlightenment of the son of the Buddha. Rāhula obtains the name "Rāhula the Lucky" ({{lang-pi|Rāhula-bhadda|italic=no |link=no}}; {{lang-sa|Rāhula-bhadra|link=no}}), which he himself explains is because of being the son of the Buddha, and because of having attained enlightenment.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} and {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}.

Later, the Buddha declares that Rāhula is [[etatagga|foremost]] among all disciples in eagerness in learning ({{lang-pi|sikkhākamānaṃ|italic=yes |link=no}}).{{sfn |Powers |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} and in the Pāli [[Udana|Udāna]], the Buddha includes him as one of eleven particularly praiseworthy disciples.{{sfn |Sarao |2004 |p=720}} Chinese sources add that he is also known for his [[khanti|patience]], and that he is foremost in 'practicing with discretion' ({{zh|p=mixing diyi}}), meaning practicing the Buddha's teaching consistently, dedication to the [[śila|precepts]] and study, but without seeking praise or being proud because of being the son of the Buddha.{{refn |For the aspect of dedication to the [[śila|precepts]] and to study, as well as avoiding being proud, see {{harvtxt |Irons |2007 |p=163}}; for the aspect of seeking praise, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}.}} Pāli texts give examples of Rāhula's strictness in monastic discipline. E.g. after there was a rule established that no novice could sleep in the same room as a [[bhikkhu|fully ordained monk]], Rāhula is said to have slept in an outdoor toilet.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} When the Buddha becomes aware of this, he admonishes the monks for not taking proper care of the novices. After that, the Buddha adjusts the rule.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/t/tipallatthamiga_jat_16.htm Tipallatthamiga Jātaka (No.16)]}}

Pāli texts state that despite Rāhula being his son, the Buddha did not particularly favor him: he is said to have loved problematic disciples such as [[Aṅgulimāla]] and [[Devadatta]] as much as his own son, without any bias.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}

Later in Rāhula's life his mother Yaśodharā becomes ordained as a [[bhikkhuni|nun]]. In one story, the nun Yaśodharā falls ill with [[flatulence]]. Rāhula helps her recover by asking his teacher Śāriputra to find sweetened mango juice for her, which is the medicine she is used to and requires. Therefore, with Rāhula's help, she eventually recovers.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/rahulamata.htm Rāhulamātā]}} and {{harvtxt |Crosby |2013 |p=112}}. Only Malalasekera mentions the mango juice and the recovery.}}

When he is 20 years old, Rāhula [[upasampada|fully ordains]] as a monk in [[Savatthi|Sāvatthī]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Baroni |2002 |p=261}} and {{harvtxt |Schumann |2004 |p=123}}. For the information that he was fully ordained in Sāvatthī, see {{harvtxt |Sarao |2013 |p=157}}.}}

Rāhula's death receives little attention in the earliest sources.{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=106}} Rāhula dies before the Buddha and his teacher Śariputra do. According to Pāli{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} and Chinese{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} sources, this happens as he is travelling through the [[Tavatimsa|second Buddhist heaven]] ({{lang-sa|Trāyastriṃśa|link=no}}). According to the early ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara Āgama]]'' ([[Sarvastivada|Sārvastivāda]] or Mahāsaṅghika tradition) and the later ''Śāriputrapṛcchā'', however, Rāhula is one the four [[arhat|enlightened disciples]] whom Gautama Buddha asks to prolong their lives to stay in the world until the [[Maitreya|next Buddha Maitreya]] has risen, to protect the current Buddha's dispensation.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=121}}

=== Previous lives ===
Following the Pāli and Sanskrit language sources, Rāhula is the son of the [[Bodhisattva#Early and Theravāda Buddhism|Buddha-to-be]] throughout many lifetimes.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} He develops his habit of being amenable and easy to teach in previous lives.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} Pāli texts explain that in a previous life he was impressed by the son of a previous Buddha, and vowed to be like him in a future life.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}

[[File:Rahula - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Rāhula on a Tibetan painting, 16th century |alt=Elderly monk in green and red robes, holding his hands in front of his chest.]]
Texts in the [[Mahayana|Mahayāna]] tradition describe that Rāhula is the eleventh of the [[16 arhats|16 Elders]] ({{lang-sa|Ṣoḍaśasthavira|italic=yes}}; Chinese tradition added two elders in the 10th century, making for 18 Elders{{sfn |Dong |2010 |p=33}}), enlightened disciples that have been entrusted with taking care of the Buddha's dispensation until the rising of Maitreya Buddha. Tradition states therefore that Rāhula is still alive, and resides with 1,100 of his pupils in an island called the 'land of chestnuts and grains' ({{zh|t=畢利颺瞿洲|p=Biliyangqu zhou}}).{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} and {{harvtxt |Meeks |2016 |pp=137{{en dash}}8}}.

For the information that ''Biliyangqu zhou'' is an island, see {{harvtxt |Dong |2010 |p=59 n.11}}.}} The pilgrim [[Xuan Zang]] ({{circa}}602{{en dash}}664) heard a [[brahmin]] claim that he met Rāhula as an old man, who had delayed his passing into [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]] and was therefore still alive.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=146}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=122}} On a similar note, Rāhula is considered one of the [[Ten Principal Disciples]],{{sfn |Keown |2004 |p=298}} known for his dedication to training new monks and novices.{{sfn |Baroni |2002 |p=262}} Moreover, he is considered to be one of the 23{{en dash}}28 masters in the lineage of the [[Tiantai]] tradition, one of the 28 in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] lineage,{{refn |{{harvtxt |Welter |2004 |pp=462{{en dash}}3}} says [[Tiantai]] has only 23 patriarchs, whereas {{harvtxt |Irons |2007 |p=526}} states they later expanded to 28.}} and one of the [[eight arahants (Burma)|eight enlightened disciples]] in the Burmese tradition.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=122}}

As one of the enlightened disciples responsible for protecting the Buddha's dispensation, Rāhula has often been depicted in East Asian art. He is depicted with a large, "umbrella-shaped" head, prominent eyes and a hooked nose.{{sfn |Watters |1898 |p=340}}

The Chinese monks Xuan Zang and [[Faxian]] ({{circa}}320{{en dash}}420 CE) noted during their pilgrimages in India that a cult existed that worshiped Rāhula, especially in the [[Madhura]] area. Whereas monks would worship certain early male disciples following their particular specialization, and nuns would honor [[Ānanda]] in gratitude for helping to set up the nun's order, novices would worship Rāhula.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=135{{en dash}}6}} The two Chinese pilgrims noted that Emperor [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] built a [[stupa|monument]] in honor of Rāhula, especially meant for novices to pay their respects.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} Religious studies scholar Lori Meeks points out with regard to Japan, however, that Rāhula was not the individual object of any devotional cult, but was rather honored as part of a group of enlightened disciples, such as the 16 Elders.&lt;!--132--&gt; Exception to this was the 13th{{en dash}}14th century, when the figure of Rāhula became an important part of a revival of devotion to early Buddhist disciples among the old [[Nara prefecture|Nara]] schools,&lt;!--131--&gt; as [[kōshiki|chanted lectures]] (''kōshiki'') rites,&lt;!--137--&gt; and images&lt;!--147--&gt; were used in dedication to Rāhula. On regular [[uposatha|days of religious observance]],&lt;!--137--&gt; male&lt;!--133--&gt; and [[samaneri|female]]&lt;!--134--&gt; novices performed rites and gave lectures in honor of Rāhula. These were popular with the laypeople,&lt;!--133--&gt; as well as with priests that aimed to revive early Buddhist [[vinaya|monastic discipline]].&lt;!--134--&gt;{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=131{{en dash}}3, 147}} In the ''kōshiki'' Rāhula was praised extensively, and was described as the "Eldest Child", ''eldest'' being a devotional term, since Prince Siddhārtha had no other children.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=137, n.2}}

The ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sūtra]]'', as well as later East Asian texts such as the ''Raun Kōshiki'', relate that Gautama Buddha predicts Rāhula will become a [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]] in a future life,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} named "Stepping on Seven Treasure Flowers" ({{lang-sa|Saptaratnapadmavikrama |link=no}}). In these texts, Rāhula was seen as a [[Bodhisattva#In_Mahāyāna_Buddhism|Mahāyāna type of Buddha-to-be]], who would save many [[sentient being (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] and live in a [[Pure Land]].{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=144}}

The exhortations the Buddha gives to Rāhula have also become part of his legacy. The ''Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta'' became one of the seven Buddhist texts recommended for study in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|inscriptions]] of the Emperor Aśoka.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/am/ambalatthika_raahulovaada_s.htm Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta]}}{{sfn |Hazzra |1995 |p=38}} This discourse has been raised by modern ethicists as evidence for [[consequentalism|consequentalist]] ethics in Buddhism, though this is disputed.{{sfn |Schlieter |2014 |p=319}}

Rāhula is mentioned as one of the founders of a system of Buddhist philosophy called the ''[[Vaibhāṣika]]'', which was part of the Sarvāstivāda schools.{{sfn |Burnouf |2010 |p=418}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=107}} He is also considered by some Thai schools of Buddhist [[Tantric Theravada|''boran'']] meditation to be the patron of their tradition, which is explained by referring to Rāhula's gradual development in meditation as opposed to the instant enlightenment of [[disciples of the Buddha|other disciples]].{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=121}}

=== Childhood in Buddhism ===
[[File:Novices_studying_Dhamma_and_Pali_language.jpg |The acceptance of Rāhula in the monastic order as a child set a precedent, which later developed into a widespread Buddhist tradition of educating children in monasteries.|thumb |alt=Teenage novices studying in class. |upright=1.2]]
From the narratives surrounding Rāhula several conclusions have been drawn with regard to Buddhist perspectives on childhood. Several scholars have raised Rāhula's example to indicate that children in Buddhism are seen as an obstacle to spiritual enlightenment,{{sfn |Thompson |Mauk |Kelly |Cook |2012 |p=61}} or that Buddhism, being a monastic religion, is not interested in children.{{sfn |Sasson |2014 |pp=594{{en dash}}5}} Education scholar Yoshiharu Nakagawa argues, however, that Rāhula's story points at two ideals of childhood which exist parallel in Buddhism: that of the common child, subject to the [[human condition]], and that of the child with a potential for enlightenment, who Crosby describes as a heroic disciple.{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |p=41}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=119, 121}} Religion scholar Vanessa Sasson notes that although Prince Siddhārtha initially abandons his son, he comes back for him and offers a spiritual heritage to him as opposed to a material one. This heritage is given from a viewpoint of trust in the potential of the child Rāhula, presuming that the Buddhist path can also be accessed by children.{{sfn |Sasson |2014 |p=595}}

The acceptance of Rāhula in the monastic order as a child set a precedent, which later developed into a widespread Buddhist tradition of educating children in monasteries.{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |pp=34{{en dash}}5}} The numerous teachings given to Rāhula have left behind teaching material which could be used for teaching children of different ages,&lt;!--117--&gt; and were sophisticated for the time period.&lt;!--118--&gt; [[Theravada|Theravāda]] tradition further built on this genre, with Pāli manuals of religious teaching for novices.&lt;!--117--&gt;{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=117{{en dash}}8}}

A '''shot clock''' is used in basketball to quicken the pace of the game. It is usually displayed above the backboard behind each goal. The shot clock times a play and provides that a team on offense that does not promptly try to score points loses possession of the ball. It is distinct from the [[game clock]], which times the entire game. The shot clock may be referred to by its initial value. For example, in the [[National Basketball Association]], it may be called the "24-second clock".

Shot clocks are also used in [[snooker]], [[Major League Lacrosse|pro]] [[lacrosse]], [[water polo]], [[korfball]], and [[ten-pin bowling]]. It is analogous with the [[play clock]] used in [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]].

==Definition==
The shot clock is set to a certain number of seconds when possession of the ball switches to the other team. The initial setting varies by country, level of play, and league; see the table [[#Shot clock length in basketball|below]]. In special cases, such as situations where the new offensive team does not have to travel the entire length of the court, the initial setting may be lower.

The shot clock counts down the seconds. In some leagues, the shot clock displays tenths of seconds. When the count reaches zero, a buzzer or horn sounds.

The offensive team must shoot the ball before the shot clock expires. The shot must either touch the [[breakaway rim|rim]] or enter the basket. If the shot clock expires before the ball leaves the player's hand, the team has committed a '''shot clock violation''' that results in a [[Turnover (basketball)|turnover]] to their opponents. The buzzer may sound after the ball leaves the shooter's hand; this is not a violation.

When the ball touches the rim or goes into the basket, the shot clock is reset to its initial value. However, it does not start to count down until a player achieves control of the ball, or in the case of a made basket, a player achieves control of the in-bounds pass.

The '''shot clock operator''' sits at the scorer's table. He or she is usually a different person from the scoreboard operator, as the task requires concentration during and after the shot attempt.

The [[National Basketball Association]] has had a 24-second limit since first introducing the clock in the 1950s; and college basketball for both men and women has a 30-second limit. The [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] had a 30-second clock originally; since 2006, the limit is 24 seconds.

==History==

===Background=== 
[[File:GeorgeMikan.jpg|thumb|Stall tactics to limit big man [[George Mikan]] (#99) led to the shot clock's creation by the NBA.]]
The NBA (National Basketball Association) had problems attracting fans (and positive media coverage) before the shot clock's inception.&lt;ref name="Pluto"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pluto |first=Terry |year=1992 |title=Tall Tales: The Glory Years of the NBA, in the Words of the Men Who Played, Coached, and Built Pro Basketball}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23–31}} This was due to teams [[running out the clock]] once they were leading in a game; without the shot clock, teams passed the ball nearly endlessly without penalty. If one team chose to stall, the other team (especially if behind) would often commit fouls to get the ball back following the free throw. Very low-scoring games with many fouls were common, which bored fans. The most extreme case occurred on November 22, 1950, when the [[Fort Wayne Pistons]] defeated the [[Minneapolis Lakers]] by a record-low score of 19–18, including 3–1 in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref name="nbahistory"/&gt; The Pistons held the ball for minutes at a time without shooting (they attempted 13 shots for the game) in order to limit the impact of the Lakers' dominant [[George Mikan]].  The Pistons' performance led the ''[[St. Paul Dispatch]]'' to write "[The Pistons] gave pro basketball a great black eye."&lt;ref name=Pomerantz&gt;{{cite book |last=Pomerantz |first=Gary M. |year=2005 |title=Wilt, 1962: The Night of 100 Points and the Dawn of a New Era |location=New York |publisher=Crown |isbn=1-4000-5160-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31–2}} NBA President [[Maurice Podoloff]] said, "In our game, with the number of stars we have, we of necessity run up big scores."&lt;ref name=Pomerantz /&gt;{{rp|33}} A few weeks after the Pistons/Lakers game, the [[Rochester Royals]] and [[Indianapolis Olympians]] played a six-overtime game with only one shot in each overtime: in each overtime period, the team that had the ball first held it for the entirety of the period before attempting a last-second shot.  The NBA tried several rule changes in the early 1950s to speed up the game and reduce fouls before eventually adopting the shot clock.

===Creation===
The shot clock first came to use in 1954 in [[Syracuse, New York]], where [[Syracuse Nationals]] (now the Philadelphia 76ers) owner [[Daniel Biasone|Danny Biasone]] and general manager [[Leo Ferris]] experimented using a 24-second version during a scrimmage game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NBA.com: 24-Second Shot Clock Rescues League|url = http://www.nba.com/history/season/19541955.html|website = www.nba.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National efforts to honor Syracuse hoops pioneers: Good day to remember Earl Lloyd, Leo Ferris|url = http://www.syracuse.com/kirst/index.ssf/2015/10/syracuse_nationals_leo_ferris_earl_lloyd.html|website = syracuse.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Andrews, longtime basketball writer for The Syracuse Post-Standard, often recalled how Ferris would sit at Danny Biasone's Eastwood bowling alley, scribbling potential shot clock formulas onto a napkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A question for a Hall of Fame dinner in Syracuse: When will Leo Ferris make it in?|url = http://www.syracuse.com/kirst/index.ssf/2012/10/post_337.html|website = syracuse.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Biasone, "I looked at the box scores from the games I enjoyed, games where they didn't screw around and stall. I noticed each team took about 60 shots. That meant 120 shots per game. So I took 2,880 seconds (48 minutes) and divided that by 120 shots. The result was 24 seconds per shot."&lt;ref name="nbahistory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Long-forgotten Leo Ferris helped devise NBA's 24-second clock, first used 61 years ago today|url = http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14007640/long-forgotten-leo-ferris-helped-devise-nba-24-second-clock-first-used-61-years-ago-today|website = ESPN.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pluto" /&gt;{{rp|29}} Ferris was singled out by business manager Bob Sexton at the 1954 team banquet for pushing the shot clock rule. Biasone and Ferris then convinced the NBA to adopt it for the [[1954–55 NBA season|1954–55 season]], a season in which the Nationals won the [[1955 NBA Finals|NBA Championship]].

===Use and reaction===
[[Image:Syracuse Shot Clock Monument.jpg|thumb|300px|The Shot Clock Monument in [[Syracuse, New York]].]]
[[Image:Syracuse Shot Clock Monument Close-Up.jpg|thumb|300px|Close-up of Syracuse's Shot Clock Monument.]]
When it was first introduced by the NBA, the 24-second shot clock made players so nervous that it hardly came into play, as players were taking fewer than 20 seconds to shoot. According to [[Syracuse Nationals|Syracuse]] star [[Dolph Schayes]], "We thought we had to take quick shots – a pass and a shot was it – maybe 8–10 seconds...  But as the game went on, we saw the inherent genius in Danny's 24 seconds – you could work the ball around [the offensive zone] for a good shot."&lt;ref name="Pluto"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

The shot clock, together with some rule changes concerning fouls, revolutionized NBA basketball. In the last pre-clock season [[1953–54 NBA season|(1953–54)]], teams averaged 79 points per game; in the first year with the clock [[1954–55 NBA season|(1954–55)]], the average was 93 points,&lt;ref name="nbahistory"/&gt; which went up to 107 points by its fourth year in use [[1957–58 NBA season|(1957–58)]].&lt;ref name="Pluto" /&gt;{{rp|28}} The advent of the shot clock (and the resulting increase in scoring) coincided with an increase in attendance, which increased 40% within a few years to an average of 4,800 per game.&lt;ref name=Pomerantz /&gt;{{rp|33–4}}

The shot clock received near-universal praise for its role in improving the style of play in the NBA. Coach and referee [[Charley Eckman]] said, "Danny Biasone saved the NBA with the 24-second rule."&lt;ref name="nba19541955"&gt;"[http://www.nba.com/history/season/19541955.html 1954–55 SEASON OVERVIEW]" NBA.&lt;/ref&gt; Boston Celtic all-star [[Bob Cousy]] said, "Before the new rule, the last quarter could be deadly. The team in front would hold the ball indefinitely, and the only way you could get it was by fouling somebody. In the meantime, nobody dared take a shot and the whole game slowed up. With the clock, we have constant action. I think it saved the NBA at that time. It allowed the game to breathe and progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Shot Clock |url=http://www.nba.com/analysis/00422949.html |publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC |accessdate=8 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/651DP4PzV?url=http://www.nba.com/analysis/00422949.html |archivedate=28 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  League president [[Maurice Podoloff]] called the adoption of the shot clock "the most important event in the NBA."&lt;ref name="nbahistory"&gt;[http://www.nba.com/analysis/00422949.html "History of the Shot Clock"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/651DP4PzV?url=http://www.nba.com/analysis/00422949.html |date=2012-01-28 }} NBA.&lt;/ref&gt;  The league itself states, "Biasone's invention rescue[d] the league."&lt;ref name="nba19541955"/&gt;

===Adoption by other leagues===
Two later pro leagues that rivaled the NBA adopted a modified version of the shot clock.  The [[American Basketball League (1961–1963)|American Basketball League]] used a 30-second shot clock for its two years in existence (1961–1963).  The [[American Basketball Association]] also adopted a 30-second clock when it launched in 1967–68, switching to the NBA's 24-second length for its final season [[1975–76 ABA season|(1975–76)]].

In the 1969–70 season, women's collegiate basketball (at the time sanctioned by the [[Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]]) used a 30-second shot clock on an experimental basis, officially adopting it for the 1970–71 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/w_basketball_RB/2008/2008RB.pdf Official 2008 NCAA Women's Basketball Records Book], p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the women's side, there was initial resistance to the implementation of a shot clock for men's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] basketball, due to fears that smaller colleges would be unable to compete with powerhouses in a running game.  However, after extreme results like an 11–6 [[Tennessee Volunteers basketball|Tennessee]] win over [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple]] in 1973, support for a men's shot clock began to build.&lt;ref name="tntempleshotclock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govolsxtra.com/news/2007/nov/07/night-crawler-temple-set-stage-for-time-clock-in/|title=Temple set stage for shot clock|last=Strange|first=Mike|date=2007-11-07|publisher=[[E.

From its inception in [[1975 PBA season|1975]], the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] adopted a 25-second shot clock. This was because the shot clocks then installed at the league's main venues, the [[Araneta Coliseum]] and [[Rizal Memorial Coliseum]] (the latter no longer used by the league), could only be set at 5-second intervals. The league later adopted a 24-second clock starting from the [[1995 PBA season|1995 season]]. The [[Metropolitan Basketball Association]] in the Philippines used the 23-second clock from its maiden season in 1998. In Filipino college basketball, the [[NCAA Basketball Championship (Philippines)]] and the [[UAAP Basketball Championship]] adopted a 30-second clock; they switched to 24 seconds starting with the 2001–02 season, the first season to start after the FIBA rule change in 2001.

==Operation==
In the NBA (since 1954), [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (since 2006), and [[FIBA]] play (since 2000; 30-second from 1956 to 2000), the shot clock counts down 24 seconds. If a shot is attempted and hits or enters the rim, or if the defensive team gains possession via a [[Rebound (basketball)|rebound]], [[Steal (basketball)|steal]], or out-of-bounds play, the shot clock resets.  Failure by the offense to attempt a shot that hits the rim within the prescribed time results in a "shot clock violation" and a [[turnover (basketball)|loss of possession]] to the other team. Three signals indicate when the shot clock expires—a shot clock signal, illuminated lights on the shot clock (NBA, FIBA, Euroleague, and many venues using an NBA-style transparent shot clock), and in the NBA and FIBA play (starting in July 2018), a yellow [[LED]] light strip on the backboard. In the [[2011–12 NBA season]] and [[2014–15 Euroleague]], the last five seconds of the shot clock were modified to include tenths of a second, allowing offensive players to see precisely how much time they have to shoot and officials to determine any last-second shots easily.  The rule has been adopted by FIBA starting in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zillgitt|first=Jeff|title=New points of emphasis in NBA officiating|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/story/2011-12-24/New-points-of-emphasis-in-NBA-officiating/52208690/1|work=USA Today|accessdate=February 4, 2012|date=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2016-17 NBA season]], a new 'official timekeeper' deal for the NBA with Swiss watch manufacturer [[Tissot]] introduced a new united official game clock/shot clock system, putting both timing systems under the same system for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA, watchmaker Tissot announce multiyear partnership|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13813208/nba-watchmaker-tissot-announce-multi-year-partnership|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tissot also became official timekeeper for the WNBA in the 2017 season. 

===14-second clock===
If the offensive team is fouled and the penalty does not include free throws but just an in-bounds pass, the shot clock is reset. There are several cases where the play has already begun to develop and the offense does not need another full 24 seconds. These exceptions work by resetting the shot clock to a given number of seconds if it showed fewer seconds, topping it up to give the offense the given number of seconds as a minimum. Time is never taken off the shot clock by rule.

One such exception, in the NBA since 1998 and in FIBA after 2010, is that on a foul in the frontcourt, the shot clock is increased to 14.

In FIBA and the WNBA, the shot clock is also reset to 14 seconds after an offensive rebound.

On a jump ball, the state of the shot clock depends on which team wins the jump. If the offensive team retains the ball, the shot clock resumes from the time at which it stopped, because there was no change of possession. If the defensive team acquires possession, the shot clock is reset. However:
*In Euroleague, if the offense retains possession, the shot clock is increased to 14 seconds (as above in the case of a non-shooting foul in the forecourt).
*In the NBA, if the defense causes the jump ball, the shot clock is increased to 5.0 seconds.

===Collegiate and scholastic rules===
American college basketball uses a 30-second shot clock, while Canadian university basketball uses a 24-second clock. The American women's game has used a 30-second clock since the 1970s, but the men's game did not adopt a shot clock until 1985. The men's limit was originally 45 seconds, and was shortened to 35 seconds in 1993 before going to 30 seconds in 2015.

The [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS), which sets rules for high school basketball in the U.S., does not mandate the use of a shot clock, instead leaving the choice to use a clock and its duration up to each individual state association. Proposals to adopt a national shot clock for high school basketball have been voted down by the NFHS as recently as 2011.&lt;ref name=usat&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/basketball/2011-05-15-high-school-shot-clock_N.htm |title=Focus on high school shot clock heats up as states make move – USATODAY.com |first= Jim |last=Halley |work=[[USA Today]] |date=5 May 2011|issn=0734-7456 |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, eight U.S. states require the use of a shot clock of 30/35 seconds in high school competition: California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Washington.&lt;ref name=usat/&gt; The District of Columbia also uses a 30-second shot clock for public school [[District of Columbia Interscholastic Athletic Association|(DCIAA)]] competition and for the [[District of Columbia State Athletic Association|DCSAA]] State Tournament, where public, private, and charter schools compete for the championship of the District of Columbia.

===Time line===
A related rule to speed up play is that the offensive team has a limited time to advance the ball across the half-court line (the "time line"). Failure to do so is a "backcourt violation" resulting in a [[turnover (basketball)|turnover]] to the other team. This [[10-second basketball rule|rule]] was introduced in 1933, predating the shot clock by over 2 decades.

In men's college basketball, the interval is 10 seconds. [[FIBA]] and the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] specified 10 seconds, but adopted an 8-second limit in 2000 and 2001, respectively. The violation may be referred to using this limit: a "10-second violation" or "8-second violation".

Generally, the time limit is not marked off by the shot clock; a referee counts the seconds through a visible motion of his hand or arm. However, women's college basketball introduced the 10-second limit in 2013–2014, and provided that officials will not count the ten seconds but "will use the shot clock to determine if a 10-second violation has occurred." The referee calls a violation if the offense still has the ball in the backcourt when the shot clock has counted down from 30 to 20 and now shows 19 (which first occurs at 19.9 seconds left).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9338">The term '''singularity''' for an explanation of unstable systems was first, and in a most general meaning used in 1873 by [[James Clerk Maxwell]].  Maxwell does not differentiate between [[dynamical system]]s and [[social system]]s. Therefore, a singularity refers to a context in which a small change can cause a large effect. The existence of singularities is primarily an argument against [[determinism]] and absolute [[causality]] for Maxwell. Indeed, following the same initial conditions will always achieve the same results, but such a statement is of little value in a world in which the same initial conditions are never repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C.: “Does the Progress of Physical Science tend to give any Advantage to the Opinion of Necessity (or Determinism) over that of the Contingency of Events and the Freedom of the Will?” in: L. Champbell/ W. Garnett: “The Life of James Clerk Maxwell”. London 1882, S. 440ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
In summary, singularities are determined by the following characteristics which can vary in strength:
# Instability: Singularities are related to effect in which small causes produce great effects.
# System relatedness: Singularities represent a peculiarity based on a system and affect its identity.
# Uniqueness: Singularities do not stand out from quantitative singularity, but rather by qualitative uniqueness.
# Irreversibility: The caused changes of systems are largely irreversible.
# Subjectivity: The awareness is dependent on the human perception and experience.
# Randomness: Singularities are often considered as random because generally either the causes or their effects are not well known.
# Complexity: Their occurrence is often connected to the complexity of the system and its environment.
# Interaction: Singularities often arise when unexpected interactions occur between two systems.&lt;ref&gt;Holzkämpfer, H.: Management von Singularitäten und Chaos, Wiesbaden 1996, S. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singularities in dynamical systems ==
A further development of Maxwell's thoughts in relation to dynamic systems was carried out first by the French mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]]. Poincaré distinguished four different simple singularities (points singuliers) of differential equations. These are the node (les noeuds), the saddle (les cols), the focus (les foyers) and the center (les centers).&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré, H.: Mémoire sur les courbes définies par une équation différentielle, in: Journal de mathématiques, 1881. S. 375-422.&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent times, the [[chaos theory]] found special attention. However, deterministic chaos is just a special case of a singularity, in which a small cause produces a large observable effect due to a nonlinear dynamic behavior. In contrast the singularities raised by Maxwell, such as a loose rock at a singular point on a slope, show a linear dynamic behavior as it was demonstrated by Poincaré.
Singularities are the common staple of the chaos theory, [[catastrophe theory]] and [[bifurcation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Tu, P.N.V.: Dynamical Systems: An Introduction with Applications in Economics and Biology, 2. überarb. und erw. Aufl., Berlin, Heidelberg u.a. 1994, S.195ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singularities in social systems ==
In social systems, a deterministic chaos is unlikely, because the elements of the system are some individuals that engage with awareness, will and foresight purposefully into the dynamic behavior of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Weizsäcker, C. C. von: Ordnung und Chaos in der Wirtschaft, in: W. Gerock/ H. Haken u.a. (Hrsg.): Ordnung und Chaos in der unbelebten und belebten Natur. Stuttgart 1989. S. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not exclude that approaches deterministic chaos in social systems are available. Rather, there is also an increase in the social development of nonlinear dynamics and instabilities .&lt;ref&gt;Bühl, W.L.: Sozialer Wandel im Ungleichgewicht: Zyklen, Fluktuationen, Katastrophen, Stuttgart 1990, S. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
Chaos in the colloquial sense of complete disorder or confusion, however, is to be found. It is often the basis for singularities, where cause-and-effect relationships are not clear. There are already numerous examples of singularities in social systems with Maxwell and Poincaré. Maxwell states that a word can start a war and all the great discoveries of man based on singular states. Poincaré gives the example of a roofer who drops a brick and randomly kills a passing man.

== Singularities in natural history ==
The development of systems provides the science currently so before that by a singular [[Big Bang]] uniformly dispersed plasma spread after the creation of the universe in space, which is cooled with increasing expansion, so that formed atoms and finally for very small (singular) fluctuations in the uniform density inhomogeneities created self-reinforcing. They subsequently led to the formation of galaxies, stars and other systems in the universe, from which humans emerged at the end. Even if the singularity of the Big Bang can be avoided in the mathematical models, singularities remain an essential element of history.
The evolutionary history shows that not only successful mutations can be perceived as positive singularities, but the humanization and the human becoming, the singular most important event in the evolution and represents a jump from the continuum of past evolutionary development of the planet Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Hagemann, R.: Mutationen als produktive Singularitäten, in: J.-H. Scharf (Hrsg.): Singularitäten, Nova Acta Leopoldina, Abhandlungen der Deutschen Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, Vorträge anläßlich der Jahresversammlung vom 30. März bis 2. April 1985 zu Halle (Saale), Leipzig 1989, S. 155-169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, C.: Die Hominisation, ein singulärer Sprung aus dem Kontinuum der Evolution?, in: J.-H. Scharf (Hrsg.): Singularitäten, Nova Acta Leopoldina, Abhandlungen der Deutschen Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, Vorträge anläßlich der Jahresversammlung vom 30. März bis 2. April 1985 zu Halle (Saale). Leipzig 1989, S. 141–154.&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently, Ward and Kirschvink show that the history of life has been more influenced by disasters than by continuous evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, P., Kirschvink, J .: A New History of Life, Munich 2016, S.30.&lt;/ref&gt; Disasters are here first destructive singularities that create space for new developments in the sense of innovations as productive singularities.&lt;ref&gt;Holzkämpfer, H .: Management of Singularities and Chaos, Wiesbaden 1996, pp. 133ff and 139ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singularities and complexity==
Closely related is the notion of singularity with the concept of [[complexity]]. J.C. Maxwell has already pointed out that a system has all the more singular points, the more complex it is. Complexity is also the basis of perceived chaos and singularities. 
Suppose a seemingly insignificant event that produces a great effect, even in a simple context, how difficult would it be to detect the reason in a complex situation with tremendously many elements and relationships.
Complexity that is kind of a breeding ground for singularities, shows the downfall of ancient cultures. Causes such as intruders, internal conflicts or natural disasters are not sufficient alone to justify the destruction of a culture. Rather requirement is an increasing complexity and associated declining marginal returns.&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, J.A.: The Collapse of Complex Societies, Cambridge, New York u.a. 1988, S. 42ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]] shows how difficult decisions are in a very complex environment. Thus, the complexity of financial systems and financial products is a major challenge of the financial markets and institutions to look at.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, J.-P.: Complexity and the financial crisis, Introductory remarks at the Conference on The Macroeconomy and Financial Systems in Normal Times and in Times of Stress, jointly organized by Banque de france and the Bundesbank, 8. June, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; One solution is to reduce complexity and increase the potential for adaptation and robustness. In a complex world with increasing singularities, it is therefore necessary to abandon optimization potential to gain adaptability to external shocks and disasters.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, M.: Adaptability: The Significance of Variability from Molecule to Ecosystem, New York, London 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sobol sequences''' (also called LP&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt; sequences or (''t'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') sequences in base&amp;nbsp;2) are an example of quasi-random [[low-discrepancy sequence]]s. They were first introduced by the Russian mathematician [[Ilya M. Sobol]] (Илья Меерович Соболь) in 1967.&lt;ref name=Sobol67&gt;Sobol,I.M.

(1967), "Distribution of points in a cube and approximate evaluation of integrals". ''Zh. Vych. Mat. Mat. Fiz.'' '''7''': 784–802 (in Russian); ''U.S.S.R Comput. Maths. Math. Phys.'' '''7''': 86–112 (in English).&lt;/ref&gt;

These sequences use a base of two to form successively finer uniform partitions of the unit interval and then reorder the coordinates in each dimension.

== Good distributions in the ''s''-dimensional unit hypercube ==

Let ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' = [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; be the ''s''-dimensional unit hypercube, and ''f'' a real integrable function over ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;''. The original motivation of Sobol was to construct a sequence ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' so that
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) = \int_{I^s} f &lt;/math&gt;
and the convergence be as fast as possible.

It is more or less clear that for the sum to converge towards the integral, the points ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' should fill ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' minimizing the holes. Another good property would be that the projections of ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' on a lower-dimensional face of ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' leave very few holes as well. Hence the homogeneous filling of ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' does not qualify because in lower dimensions many points will be at the same place, therefore useless for the integral estimation.

These good distributions are called (''t'',''m'',''s'')-nets and (''t'',''s'')-sequences in base ''b''. To introduce them, define first an elementary ''s''-interval in base ''b'' a subset of ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' of the form
:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{j=1}^s \left[ \frac{a_j}{b^{d_j}}, \frac{a_j+1}{b^{d_j}} \right], &lt;/math&gt;
where ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are non-negative integers, and &lt;math&gt; a_j &lt; b^{d_j} &lt;/math&gt; for all ''j'' in {1, ...,s}.

Given 2 integers &lt;math&gt;0\leq t\leq m&lt;/math&gt;, a (''t'',''m'',''s'')-net in base ''b'' is a sequence ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''b&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' points of ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' such that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Card} P \cap \{x_1, ..., x_{b^m}\} = b^t&lt;/math&gt; for all elementary interval ''P'' in base ''b'' of hypervolume ''λ''(''P'') = ''b&lt;sup&gt;t−m&lt;/sup&gt;''.

Given a non-negative integer ''t'', a (''t'',''s'')-sequence in base ''b'' is an infinite sequence of points ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that for all integers &lt;math&gt;k \geq 0, m \geq t&lt;/math&gt;, the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{x_{kb^m}, ..., x_{(k+1)b^m-1}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a (''t'',''m'',''s'')-net in base ''b''.

In his article, Sobol described ''Π&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;-meshes'' and ''LP&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt; sequences'', which are (''t'',''m'',''s'')-nets and (''t'',''s'')-sequences in base 2 respectively. The terms (''t'',''m'',''s'')-nets and (''t'',''s'')-sequences in base ''b'' (also called Niederreiter sequences) were coined in 1988 by [[Harald Niederreiter]].&lt;ref name=Nied88&gt;[[Harald Niederreiter|Niederreiter, H.]] (1988). "Low-Discrepancy and Low-Dispersion Sequences", ''Journal of Number Theory'' '''30''': 51–70.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Sobol sequences'' was introduced in late English-speaking papers in comparison with [[Halton sequence|Halton]], Faure and other low-discrepancy sequences.

== A fast algorithm for the construction of Sobol sequences ==

A more efficient [[Gray code]] implementation was proposed by Antonov and Saleev.&lt;ref name=AS79&gt;Antonov, I.A. and Saleev, V.M. (1979) "An economic method of computing LP&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;-sequences". ''Zh. Vych. Mat. Mat. Fiz.'' '''19''': 243–245 (in Russian); ''U.S.S.R. Comput. Maths. Math. Phys.'' '''19''': 252–256 (in English).&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the generation of Sobol numbers, they are clearly aided by the use of Gray code &lt;math&gt;G(n)=n \oplus \lfloor n/2 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; instead of ''n'' for constructing the ''n''-th point draw.

Suppose we have already generated all the Sobol sequence draws up to ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 and kept in memory the values ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1,''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for all the required dimensions. Since the Gray code ''G''(''n'') differs from that of the preceding one ''G''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) by just a single, say the ''k''-th, bit (which is a rightmost bit of ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1), all that needs to be done is a single [[XOR]] operation for each dimension in order to propagate all of the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;
x_{n,i} = x_{n-1,i} \oplus v_{k,i}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Additional uniformity properties ==

Sobol introduced additional uniformity conditions known as property A and A’.&lt;ref name=Sobol76&gt;Sobol, I. M. (1976) "Uniformly distributed sequences with an additional uniform property". ''Zh. Vych. Mat. Mat. Fiz.'' '''16''': 1332–1337 (in Russian); ''U.S.S.R. Comput. Maths. Math. Phys.'' '''16''': 236–242 (in English).&lt;/ref&gt;

;Definition: A low-discrepancy sequence is said to satisfy '''Property A''' if for any binary segment (not an arbitrary subset) of the ''d''-dimensional sequence of length 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; there is exactly one draw in each 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; hypercubes that result from subdividing the unit hypercube along each of its length extensions into half.

;Definition: A low-discrepancy sequence is said to satisfy '''Property A’''' if for any binary segment (not an arbitrary subset) of the ''d''-dimensional sequence of length 4&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; there is exactly one draw in each 4&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; hypercubes that result from subdividing the unit hypercube along each of its length extensions into four equal parts.

There are mathematical conditions that guarantee properties A and A'.

;Theorem: The ''d''-dimensional Sobol sequence possesses Property A iff
::&lt;math&gt;
\det(\mathbf{V}_d) \equiv 1 (\mod 2),
&lt;/math&gt;
:where '''V'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''d''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''d'' binary matrix defined by
::&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{V}_d := \begin{pmatrix}
{v_{1,1,1}}&amp;{v_{2,1,1}}&amp;{\dots}&amp;{v_{d,1,1}}\\ 
{v_{1,2,1}}&amp;{v_{2,2,1}}&amp;{\dots}&amp;{v_{d,2,1}}\\ 
{\vdots}&amp;{\vdots}&amp;{\ddots}&amp;{\vdots}\\ 
{v_{1,d,1}}&amp;{v_{2,d,1}}&amp;{\dots}&amp;{v_{d,d,1}}
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
:with ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt; denoting the ''m''-th digit after the binary point of the direction number ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = (0.''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j'',1&lt;/sub&gt;''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j'',2&lt;/sub&gt;...)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

;Theorem: The ''d''-dimensional Sobol sequence possesses Property A' iff
::&lt;math&gt;
\det(\mathbf{U}_d) \equiv 1 \mod 2,
&lt;/math&gt;
:where '''U'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; is the 2''d''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2''d'' binary matrix defined by
::&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{U}_d := \begin{pmatrix}
{v_{1,1,1}}&amp;{v_{1,1,2}}&amp;{v_{2,1,1}}&amp;{v_{2,1,2}}&amp;{\dots}&amp;{v_{d,1,1}}&amp;{v_{d,1,2}}\\ 
{v_{1,2,1}}&amp;{v_{1,2,2}}&amp;{v_{2,2,1}}&amp;{v_{2,2,2}}&amp;{\dots}&amp;{v_{d,2,1}}&amp;{v_{d,2,2}}\\ 
{\vdots}&amp;{\vdots}&amp;{\vdots}&amp;{\vdots}&amp;{\ddots}&amp;{\vdots}&amp;{\vdots}\\ 
{v_{1,2d,1}}&amp;{v_{1,2d,2}}&amp;{v_{2,2d,1}}&amp;{v_{2,2d,2}}&amp;{\dots}&amp;{v_{d,2d,1}}&amp;{v_{d,2d,2}}
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
:with ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt; denoting the ''m''-th digit after the binary point of the direction number ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = (0.''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j'',1&lt;/sub&gt;''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j'',2&lt;/sub&gt;...)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Tests for properties A and A’ are independent. Thus it is possible to construct the Sobol sequence that satisfies both properties A and A’ or only one of them.

== The initialization of Sobol numbers ==

To construct a Sobol sequence, a set of direction numbers ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; needs to be selected. There is some freedom in the selection of initial direction numbers.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;These numbers are usually called ''initialisation numbers''.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is possible to receive different realisations of the Sobol sequence for selected dimensions. A bad selection of initial numbers can considerably reduce the efficiency of Sobol sequences when used for computation.

Arguably the easiest choice for the initialisation numbers is just to have the ''l''-th leftmost bit set, and all other bits to be zero, i.e. ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 for all ''k'' and ''j''. This initialisation is usually called ''unit initialisation''. However, such a sequence fails the test for Property A and A’ even for low dimensions and hence this initialisation is bad.

== Implementation and availability of Sobol sequences ==

Good initialisation numbers for different numbers of dimensions are provided by several authors.  For example, Sobol provides initialisation numbers for dimensions up to 51.&lt;ref name=SobLev76&gt;Sobol, I.M. and Levitan, Y.L. (1976). "The production of points uniformly distributed in a multidimensional cube" ''Tech. Rep. 40, Institute of Applied Mathematics, USSR Academy of Sciences'' (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; The same set of initialisation numbers is used by Bratley and Fox.&lt;ref name=BF88&gt;Bratley, P. and Fox, B. L. (1988), "Algorithm 659: Implementing Sobol’s quasirandom sequence generator". ''ACM Trans. Math. Software'' '''14''': 88–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initialisation numbers for high dimensions are available on Joe and Kuo.&lt;ref name=JK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~fkuo/sobol/ |title=Sobol sequence generator |publisher=[[University of New South Wales]] |date=2010-09-16 |accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Jaeckel|Peter Jäckel]] provides initialisation numbers up to dimension 32 in his book "[[Monte Carlo methods in finance]]".&lt;ref name=Jackel&gt;Jäckel, P. (2002) "Monte Carlo methods in finance". New York: [[John Wiley and Sons]]. ({{ISBN|0-471-49741-X}}.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other implementations are available as C, Fortran 77, or Fortran 90 routines in the [[Numerical Recipes]] collection of software.&lt;ref name=NumRec&gt;Press, W.H., Teukolsky, S. A., Vetterling, W. T., and Flannery, B. P. (1992) "Numerical Recipes in Fortran 77: The Art of Scientific Computing, 2nd ed." ''Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K.''&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Free and open-source software|free/open-source]] implementation in up to 1111 dimensions, based on the Joe and Kuo initialisation numbers, is available in C&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt/blob/master/src/util/sobolseq.c C implementation of the Sobol sequence] in the [http://ab-initio.mit.edu/nlopt NLopt library] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/stevengj/Sobol.jl Sobol.jl] package: Julia implementation of the Sobol sequence.&lt;/ref&gt;  A different free/open-source implementation is available for [[C++]], [[Fortran 90]], [[Matlab]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/sobol/sobol.html The Sobol Quasirandom Sequence], code for C++/Fortran 90/Matlab/Python by J.

In [[abstract algebra]], the set of all [[partial bijection]]s on a set ''X'' ({{aka}} one-to-one partial transformations) forms an [[inverse semigroup]], called the '''symmetric inverse semigroup'''&lt;ref name="Grillet1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre A. Grillet|title=Semigroups: An Introduction to the Structure Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yM544W1N2UUC&amp;pg=PA228|year=1995|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-9662-4|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; (actually a [[monoid]]) on ''X''. The conventional notation for the symmetric inverse semigroup on a set ''X'' is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hollings 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;252&lt;/ref&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{IS}_X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ganyushkin and Mazorchuk 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;v&lt;/ref&gt; In general &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_X&lt;/math&gt; is not [[Commutative semigroup|commutative]].

Details about the origin of the symmetric inverse semigroup are available in the discussion on the [[Inverse_semigroup#Origins|origins of the inverse semigroup]].

==Finite symmetric inverse semigroups==
When ''X'' is a finite set {1, ..., ''n''}, the inverse semigroup of one-one partial transformations is denoted by ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and its elements are called '''charts''' or '''partial symmetries'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lipscomb 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of chart generalizes the notion of [[permutation]]. A (famous) example of (sets of) charts are the hypomorphic mapping sets from the [[reconstruction conjecture]] in graph theory.&lt;ref&gt;Lipscomb 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cycle notation]] of classical, group-based permutations generalizes to symmetric inverse semigroups by the addition of a notion called a ''path'', which (unlike a cycle) ends when it reaches the [[Partial_function#In_category_theory|"undefined" element]]; the notation thus extended is called ''path notation''.&lt;ref&gt;Lipscomb 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10333">[[File:To young men only.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cover of the 1980 pamphlet, which printed the sermon.]]'''"To Young Men Only"''' (also known as '''"Message to Young Men"'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Conference: October 1976|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/10/?lang=eng|website=lds.org|publisher=LDS Church|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a sermon delivered by [[Mormon]] [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Boyd K. Packer]] on October 2, 1976, at the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] session of the 146th Semiannual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The sermon is addressed to young men of the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] (ages 12 to 18) and discusses issues of [[human sexuality]], [[puberty]], and morality. From 1980 to 2016, the sermon was published as a pamphlet by the LDS Church. It has been criticized on various grounds, such as that it encourages [[Violence against LGBT people|violence against homosexuals]]. In 2016, the church discontinued the pamphlet.&lt;ref name = 2016retired&gt;[[Peggy Fletcher Stack]], [http://www.sltrib.com/home/4584556-155/lds-church-retires-mormon-apostles-little "LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet"], ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', November 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Packer described his remarks as matters that "fathers should discuss with their sons."&lt;ref name = TYMO/&gt; Packer stated that "because some young men do not have fathers and because some fathers (and some bishops) do not know how to proceed", he would be addressing sensitive subjects.&lt;ref name=TYMO&gt;{{cite web |last1=Packer |first1=Boyd |title=To Young Men Only |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021234056/https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |dead-url=yes |website=lds.org |publisher=LDS Church |archive-date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sermon compares the [[male reproductive system]] to a "little factory" and teaches that [[masturbation]], use of [[pornography]], and [[homosexuality|homosexual activities]] are immoral and forbidden by God.&lt;ref name = TYMO/&gt; It encourages young male Latter-day Saints to "vigorously resist" homosexual advances, even with violence, if necessary.&lt;ref name=Quote /&gt; Packer teaches that [[nocturnal emission]] is natural and designed by God and that young men "should not feel guilty" when it happens.&lt;ref name = TYMO/&gt; The sermon also offers suggestions on how to control one's thoughts and resist temptation.&lt;ref name = TYMO/&gt;

==Publication==
Unlike most general conference sermons, "Message to Young Men" was not published in the church's official magazine, ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|The Ensign]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Report of the 146th Semiannual Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|date=November 1976|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1976/11?lang=eng|magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]|volume=6|issue=11|type=Magazine|access-date=2018-10-24}}. Note that the table of contents for this issue lacks any reference to this address.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the sermon was published in 1980 as a 14-page pamphlet, entitled "To Young Men Only", that was available for church leaders to distribute to members.&lt;ref name="TYMO" /&gt;

In 2016, the pamphlet was discontinued and it was removed from the LDS Church's website.&lt;ref name="2016retired" /&gt; The video of the sermon remains available on the LDS Church's website.&lt;ref name="2016retired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TYMO" /&gt;

==Criticism==

[[File:ToYoungMenOnly.png|thumb|right|150px|Packer's conference address published here has been criticized of condoning anti-gay violence.&lt;ref name="Multiply"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corcoran|first1=Brent|last2=O'Donovan|first2=Rocky|title=Multiply and Replenish: Mormon Essays on Sex and Family|date=1994|publisher=Signature Books|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|isbn=1560850507|url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/the-abominable-and-detestable-crime-against-nature/|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|150}}&lt;ref name="Criticism" &gt;Hilary Groutage Smith, "Mormon Pamphlets on Gays Criticized", ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 2000-08-06, p.

Hardy, "BYU's Dismissal of Gay Students Continues Confusion for Gays, Parents" [opinion], ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', p. AA3.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One controversial part of the sermon states that some men entice others to join them in sexual behaviors and gives an example of a missionary who punched his companion to the floor for making sexual advances to which Packer responded, "Somebody had to do it".&lt;ref name=Quote&gt;{{cite web |last1=Packer |first1=Boyd |title=To Young Men Only |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021234056/https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |dead-url=yes |website=lds.org |publisher=LDS Church |archive-date=21 October 2015 |quote=There are some men who entice young men to join them in these immoral acts. If you are ever approached to participate in anything like that, it is time to vigorously resist. While I was in a mission on one occasion, a missionary said he had something to confess. I was very worried because he just could not get himself to tell me what he had done. After patient encouragement he finally blurted out, 'I hit my companion.' 'Oh, is that all,' I said in great relief. 'But I floored him,' he said. After learning a little more, my response was 'Well, thanks. Somebody had to do it, and it wouldn't be well for a General Authority to solve the problem that way.' I am not recommending that course to you, but I am not omitting it. You must protect yourself.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience is heard laughing after this statement in the original broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Packer, Boyd |date=October 1976 |title=Message to Young Men |time=11:21 |url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/10/media/session_5_talk_1/2680671857001?lang=eng |location=Salt Lake Tabernacle |publisher=LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2001, gay Mormon historian [[D. Michael Quinn]] described the sermon as "[t]he low point in the Mormon hierarchy's homophobia since the 1950s";&lt;ref name="Dynamics"&gt;[[D. Michael Quinn]], ''Same-sex Dynamics Among Nineteenth-century Americans: A Mormon Example'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2001) p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; Quinn argued that Packer's words constituted an endorsement of [[gay bashing]] and that the church itself endorsed such behavior by continuing to publish Packer's speech.&lt;ref name=dialogue&gt;[[D. Michael Quinn]], [https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V33N03_13.pdf "Prelude to the National 'Defense of Marriage' Campaign: Civil Discrimination Against Feared or Despised Minorities"], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' vol. 33 no. 3 (Fall 2000) pp. 1–52.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2000 and 2001, David E. Hardy, a [[Salt Lake City]] lawyer who is the father of a gay son, criticized the sermon for "demoniz[ing]" gays and implying that "[[homosexuality]] is a matter of choice".&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Groutage Smith, "Mormon Pamphlets on Gays Criticized", ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 2000-08-06, p. B2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David E. Hardy, "BYU's Dismissal of Gay Students Continues Confusion for Gays, Parents" [opinion], ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', p. AA3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Packer |first1=Boyd |title=To Young Men Only |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021234056/https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/to-young-men-only/to-young-men-only |dead-url=yes |website=lds.org |publisher=LDS Church |archive-date=21 October 2015 |quote=There is a falsehood that some are born with an attraction to their own kind, with nothing they can do about it. They are just 'that way' and can only yield to those desires. That is a malicious and destructive lie. While it is a convincing idea to some, it is of the devil. No one is locked into that kind of life. From our premortal life we were directed into a physical body. There is no mismatching of bodies and spirits. Boys are to become men—masculine, manly men—ultimately to become husbands and fathers. No one is predestined to a perverted use of these powers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, Samantha Allen, a columnist for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', wrote that the sermon "typifies organized religion’s approach to curtailing male masturbation", calling it "deeply paternalistic" and criticizing it for employing "a noxious mixture of condescension and euphemism".&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Allen, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/01/tim-ferriss-is-bro-culture-s-anti-masturbation-crusader.html "Tim Ferriss Is Bro Culture's Anti-Masturbation Crusader"], ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', August 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9777">The '''two-state vector formalism''' ('''TSVF''') is a description of [[quantum mechanics]] in terms of a [[causality|causal]] relation in which the present is caused by quantum states of the past and of the future taken in combination.

==Theory==
The two-state vector formalism is one example of a time-symmetric interpretation of quantum mechanics (see [[Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics]]). Time-symmetric interpretations of quantum mechanics were first suggested by [[Walter Schottky]] in 1921,&lt;ref name="Schottky1921"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Schottky, Walter
 | title = Das Kausalproblem der Quantentheorie als eine Grundfrage der modernen Naturforschung überhaupt
 | journal = Naturwissenschaften
 | volume = 9

 | doi = 10.1007/bf01494985
 | pmid = 
| bibcode = 1921NW......9..492S
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later by several other scientists. The two-state vector formalism was first developed by [[Satosi Watanabe]]&lt;ref name="Watanabe1955"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Watanabe, Satosi
 | title = Symmetry of physical laws. Part III. Prediction and retrodiction
 | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics
 | volume = 27
 | issue = 2
 | pages = 179–186
 | year = 1955
 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.27.179
 | pmid = 
| bibcode = 1955RvMP...27..179W
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1955, who named it the Double Inferential state-Vector Formalism (DIVF). Watanabe proposed that information given by forwards evolving [[quantum state]]s is not complete; rather, both forwards and backwards evolving quantum states are required to describe a quantum state: a first state vector that evolves from the initial conditions towards the future, and a second state vector that evolves backwards in time from future boundary conditions. Past and future measurements, taken together, provide complete information about a quantum system. Watanabe's work was later rediscovered by [[Yakir Aharonov]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and [[Joel Lebowitz]] in 1964, who later renamed it the Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF).&lt;ref&gt;Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''Protective measurements of two-state vectors'', in: Robert Sonné Cohen, Michael Horne, John J. Stachel (eds.): ''Potentiality, Entanglement and Passion-At-A-Distance'', Quantum Mechanical Studies for A. M. Shimony, Volume Two, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0792344537}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–8, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DsNoIcQemTsC&amp;pg=PA2 p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional [[prediction]], as well as [[retrodiction]], can be obtained formally by separating out the initial conditions (or, conversely, the final conditions) by performing sequences of coherence-destroying operations, thereby cancelling out the influence of the two state vectors.&lt;ref&gt;Yakir Aharonov, Peter G. Bergmann, Joel L. Lebowitz: ''Time symmetry in the quantum process of measurement'', Physical Review B., vol.&amp;nbsp;134, no.&amp;nbsp;6, pp.&amp;nbsp;1410–1416, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''two-state vector'' is represented by:
{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\langle\Phi| \ \ \ |\Psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}
where the state &lt;math&gt;\langle\Phi|&lt;/math&gt; evolves backwards from the future and the state &lt;math&gt;|\Psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; evolves forwards from the past.

In the example of the [[double-slit experiment]], the first state vector evolves from the electron leaving its source, the second state vector evolves backwards from the final location of the electron on the detection screen, and the combination of forwards and backwards evolving state vectors determines what occurs when the electron passes the slits.

The two-state vector formalism provides a time-symmetric description of quantum mechanics, and is constructed such as to be [[time-reversal invariance|time-reversal invariant]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dickson: ''Non-relativistic quantum mechanics'', [[Jeremy Butterfield]], [[John Earman]] (eds.): ''Philosophy of Physics'', Handbook of the Philosophy of Science, North-Holland, Elsevier, pp.&amp;nbsp;275–416, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2oSn5I70WW0C&amp;pg=PA327 Footnote on p. 327]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be employed in particular for analyzing pre- and post-selected quantum systems. Building on the notion of two-state, Reznik and Aharonov constructed a time-symmetric formulation of quantum mechanics that encompasses probabilistic observables as well as nonprobabilistic weak observables.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reznik, and Y. Aharonov: ''Time-symmetric formulation of quantum mechanics'', Phys. Rev. A, vol.&amp;nbsp;52, no.&amp;nbsp;4, pp.&amp;nbsp;2538–2550, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other work==

In view of the TSVF approach, and in order to allow information to be obtained about quantum systems that are both pre- and post-selected, Yakir Aharonov, [[David Albert]] and [[Lev Vaidman]] developed the theory of [[weak value]]s.

In TSVF, causality is time-symmetric; that is, the usual chain of causality is not simply reversed. Rather, TSVF combines causality both from the past (forward causation) and the future (backwards causation, or [[retrocausality]]).

Similarly as the [[de Broglie–Bohm theory]], TSVF yields the same predictions as standard quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidmann: ''About position measurements which do not show the Bohmian particle position'', in: [[James T. Cushing]], Arthur Fine, Sheldon Goldstein (eds.): ''Bohmian mechanics and quantum theory: an appraisal'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;141–154,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=EFrDTg3ztfEC&amp;pg=PA141 p. 141], [https://books.google.com/books?id=EFrDTg3ztfEC&amp;pg=PA147 147]&lt;/ref&gt; Lev Vaidman emphasizes that TSVF fits very well with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''. In: Juan Gonzalo Muga, Rafael Sala Mayato, Íñigo Egusquiza (eds.): ''Time in Quantum Mechanics'', Volume 1, Lecture Notes in Physics 734, pp.&amp;nbsp;399–447, 2nd ed., Springer, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3540734727}}, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-73473-4_13, [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105101v2 arXiv:quant-ph/0105101v2] (submitted 21 May 2001, version of 10 June 2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=InKru6zHQWgC&amp;pg=PA443 p. 443]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-state vector formalism has similarities with the [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics proposed by [[John G. Cramer]] in 1986, although Ruth Kastner has argued that the two interpretations (Transactional and Two-State Vector) have important differences as well.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth E. Kastner, talk presented at Cambridge 2014 Conference, ''Free Will and Retrocausality in the Quantum World,'' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMZuBbW6Rcg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Avshalom Elitzur|Avshalom C. Elitzur]], Eliahu Cohen: ''The Retrocausal Nature of Quantum Measurement Revealed by Partial and Weak Measurements'', AIP Conf. Proc. 1408: ''Quantum Retrocausation: Theory and Experiment (13–14 June 2011, San Diego, California)'', pp.&amp;nbsp;120-131, {{DOI|10.1063/1.3663720}} ([https://archive.is/20120713100902/http://proceedings.aip.org/resource/2/apcpcs/1408/1/120_1 abstract])&lt;/ref&gt; It shares the property of [[Time reversal symmetry|time symmetry]] with the [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]] by [[Richard Feynman]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and with the ''time–symmetric quantum mechanics'' of K. B. Wharton.

The '''urial''' (''[[Ovis orientalis vignei|Ovis orientalis]] vignei''&lt;ref&gt;ICZN ([[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]]) [http://www.iczn.org/BZNMar2003opinions.htm opinion 2027] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517133446/http://www.iczn.org/BZNMar2003opinions.htm |date=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), also known as the '''arkars''' or '''shapo''', is a subspecies group of the wild [[Ovis|sheep]] ''Ovis orientalis''. Noticeable features are the reddish-brown long fur that fades during winter; males are characterized by a black ruff stretching from the neck to the chest and large horns.  It is found in western [[central Asia]].  The other subspecies group of ''O. orientalis'' is the [[mouflon]] (''Ovis orientalis orientalis'' group). The two groups have often been considered separate species.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Grubb (zoologist)|Grubb, Peter]] (2005). Order Perissodactyla. Pp. 708-710 in: Wilson, Don E., and DeeAnn, M. (2005). ''Mammal Species of the World. A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference''. 3d edition. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. {{ISBN|0-8018-8221-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==
Urial males have large horns, curling outwards from the top of the head turning in to end somewhere behind the head; females have shorter, compressed horns. The horns of the males may be up to {{Convert|100|cm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long. The [[shoulder]] height of an adult male urial is between {{Convert|80|and|90|cm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}.

== Distribution ==
The urial is found in western central [[Asia]] from northeastern [[Iran]] and western [[Kazakhstan]] to [[Pakistan]]'s [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] and [[Chitral]], as well as being found in [[Ladakh]], [[India]]. To the east it is replaced by the bigger [[argali]] and to the southwest by the [[Asiatic mouflon]]. Its habitat consists of [[grass]]y slopes below the [[tree line|timberline]]. Urials rarely move to the rocky areas of the mountains. For example, in northern Iran they produce hybrids with Asiatic mouflon under natural conditions. Urials feed mainly on grass but are able to eat leaves of trees and bushes if needed.

The [[conservation status]] of the urial is threatened as their habitat is perfectly suitable for [[human]] development; however the urial [[population]] has been recovering in recent years.

The Afghan urial is found in Musakhel district in Surghar and Torghar. A 2005-2006 survey by WWF Pakistan shows 145 urials found in Surghar, Srakhowa District Musakhe. Yahay Musakhel ''et al.'' 2006)

== Behaviour ==
The [[mating]] season begins in September. Rams (which live separately at other times) select four or five ewes, which will each give birth to a lamb after a [[gestation]] of five months.

== Subspecies ==
[[File:Ovis ammon vignei arkal Pretoria 3bis.jpg|thumbnail|Transcaspian arkals (''O. o. arkal'') at [[Pretoria Zoo]]]]

A '''webcam''' is a [[video camera]] that feeds or [[Streaming media|streams]] its image in real time to or through a [[computer]] to a [[computer network]]. When "captured" by the computer, the video stream may be saved, viewed or sent on to other networks travelling through  systems such as the internet, and e-mailed as an attachment. When sent to a remote location, the video stream may be saved, viewed or on sent there. Unlike an [[IP camera]] (which connects using [[Ethernet]] or [[Wi-Fi]]), a webcam is generally connected by a [[USB]] cable, or similar cable, or built into computer hardware, such as laptops.

The term "webcam" (a [[clipped compound]]) may also be used in its original sense of a [[video camera]] connected to the [[World Wide Web|Web]] continuously for an indefinite time, rather than for a particular session, generally supplying a view for anyone who visits its [[web page]] over the Internet.  Some of them, for example, those used as online [[traffic camera]]s, are expensive, rugged [[professional video camera]]s.

== Characteristics ==
Webcams are known for their low [[manufacturing]] cost and their high flexibility,&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Negash, Michael E. Whitman. Editors: Solomon Negash, Michael E. Whitman, Amy B. Woszczynski, Ken Hoganson, Herbert Mattord. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz4aIXq5z8YC Handbook of Distance Learning for Real-Time and Asynchronous Information Technology Education], Idea Group Inc (IGI), 2008, p. 17, {{ISBN|1-59904-964-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59904-964-9}}. Note costing: "students had the option to install a webcam on their end (a basic webcam costs about $40.00) to view the class in session."&lt;/ref&gt; making them the lowest-cost form of [[videotelephony]]. Despite the low cost, the [[Image resolution|resolution]] offered at present (2015) is rather impressive, with low-end webcams offering resolutions of 320×240, medium webcams offering 640×480 resolution, and high-end webcams offering 1280×720 (aka [[720p]]) or even 1920×1080 (aka [[1080p]]) resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebay.com/gds/How-Much-Resolution-is-Enough-Picking-a-Webcam-/10000000177742678/g.html|title=How Much Resolution is Enough?

They have also become a source of security and privacy issues, as some built-in webcams can be remotely activated by [[spyware]].

== Uses ==
The most popular use of webcams is the establishment of [[videotelephony|video links]], permitting computers to act as [[videophone]]s or [[video conferencing|videoconference station]]s. Other popular uses include security surveillance, [[computer vision]], video broadcasting, and for recording social videos.

The video streams provided by webcams can be used for a number of purposes, each using appropriate software:

=== Health care ===
Most modern webcams are capable of [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pulsecapture/ capturing arterial pulse rate] by the use of a simple algorithmic trick. Researchers claim that this method is accurate to ±5 bpm.

=== Video monitoring ===
Webcams may be installed at places such as childcare centres, offices, shops and private areas to monitor security and general activity.

=== Commerce ===
Webcams have been used for [[augmented reality]] experiences online.  One such function has the webcam act as a "magic mirror" to allow an online shopper to view a virtual item on themselves. The [[Webcam Social Shopper]] is one example of software that utilizes the webcam in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techland.time.com/2011/08/05/augmented-reality-lets-you-try-on-clothes-from-online-shops/ "Augmented Reality Lets You Try On Clothes from Online Shops"] [[TIME]], 5 August 2011, retrieved 4 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Videocalling and videoconferencing ===
{{Further information|Videophone|Videoconferencing|Videotelephony}}
Webcam can be added to [[instant messaging]], text chat services such as [[AOL Instant Messenger]], and [[VoIP]] services such as [[Skype]], one-to-one live video communication over the Internet has now reached millions of mainstream [[Personal computer|PC]] users worldwide. Improved video quality has helped webcams encroach on traditional video conferencing systems. New features such as automatic lighting controls, real-time enhancements (retouching, wrinkle smoothing and vertical stretch), automatic [[Facial motion capture|face tracking]] and autofocus, assist users by providing substantial ease-of-use, further increasing the popularity of webcams.

Webcam features and performance can vary by [[computer program|program]], [[operating system|computer operating system]], and also by the computer's [[Central processing unit|processor]] capabilities. Video calling support has also been added to several [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Software clients –free instant messaging programs|popular instant messaging programs]].

=== Video security ===
Webcams can be used as [[security camera]]s. Software is available to allow PC-connected cameras to watch for movement and sound,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-consystems.com/PR/PressRelease_e-con_Announces_3MP_AutoFocus_Camera.pdf USB Camera with integrated UVC+UAC and Autofocus CMOS OV3640 CMOS Image sensor]&lt;/ref&gt; recording both when they are detected. These recordings can then be saved to the computer, e-mailed, or uploaded to the Internet. In one well-publicised case,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/4272041.stm Serial burglar caught on webcam] [[BBC News]], February 16, 2005, retrieved January 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; a computer e-mailed images of the burglar during the theft of the computer, enabling the owner to give police a clear picture of the burglar's face even after the computer had been stolen.

Unauthorized access of webcams can present significant privacy issues (see "Privacy" section below).

In December 2011, Russia announced that 290,000 Webcams would be installed in 90,000 polling stations to monitor the [[Russian presidential election, 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2012/01/16/russia-election-webcams-linked-to-site-blamed-for-piracy/ Russia Election Webcams] ''The Wall Street Journal'', January 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video clips and stills===
Webcams can be used to take [[video clip]]s and [[Digital photography|still pictures]]. Various software tools in wide use can be employed for this, such as [[PicMaster]] (for use with [[Windows]] operating systems), [[Photo Booth]] ([[Mac (computer)|Mac]]), or [[Cheese (software)|Cheese]] (with [[Unix]] systems). For a more complete list see [[Comparison of webcam software]].

=== Input control devices ===
Special software can use the video stream from a webcam to assist or enhance a user's control of applications and games. Video features, including faces, shapes, models and colors can be observed and tracked to produce a corresponding form of control. For example, the position of a single light source can be tracked and used to emulate a mouse pointer, a head-mounted light would enable [[hands-free computing]] and would greatly improve [[computer accessibility]]. This can be applied to games, providing additional control, improved interactivity and immersiveness.

[[FreeTrack]] is a free webcam motion-tracking application for [[Microsoft Windows]] that can track a special head-mounted model in up to six [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] and output data to mouse, keyboard, joystick and [[List of games compatible with FreeTrack|FreeTrack-supported games]]. By removing the IR filter of the webcam, IR LEDs can be used, which has the advantage of being invisible to the naked eye, removing a distraction from the user. [[TrackIR]] is a commercial version of this technology.

The [[EyeToy]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Eye]] for the [[PlayStation 3]], and the [[Xbox Live Vision]] camera and [[Kinect]] motion sensor for the [[Xbox 360]] and are color digital cameras that have been used as control input devices by some games.

Small webcam-based [[PC Games (magazine)|PC games]] are available as either standalone executables or inside web browser windows using [[Adobe Flash]].

=== Astro photography ===
With very-low-light capability, a few specific models of webcams are very popular to photograph the night sky by astronomers and astro photographers. Mostly, these are manual-focus cameras and contain an old CCD array instead of comparatively newer CMOS array. The lenses of the cameras are removed and then these are attached to telescopes to record images, video, still, or both. In newer techniques, videos of very faint objects are taken for a couple of seconds and then all the frames of the video are "stacked" together to obtain a still image of respectable contrast.

===Laser beam profiling===

A webcam's CCD response is linear proportional to the incoming light. &lt;ref&gt;Cignoli F, De Iuliis S, Zizak GA. Webcam as a light probe beam profiler. Appl. Spectrosc. 58, (2004), 1372.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, webcams are suitable to record laser beam profiles, after the lens is removed. The resolution of a [[laser beam profiler]] depends on the pixel size. Commercial webcams are usually designed to record color images. The size of a webcam's color pixel depends on the model and may lie in the range of 5 to 10µm. However, a color pixel consists of four black and white pixels each equipped with a color filter (for details see [[Bayer filter]]). Although these color filters work well in the visible, they may be rather transparent in the near infra-red. By switching a webcam into the Bayer-mode it is possible to access the information of the single pixels and a resolution below 3µm was possible. &lt;ref&gt;G. Langer et al., A webcam in Bayer-mode as a light beam profiler for the near infra-red, Optics and Lasers in Engineering 51 (2013) 571–575 &lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|History of videotelephony}}

=== Early development ===
First developed in 1991, a webcam was pointed at the [[Trojan Room coffee pot]] in the [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] Computer Science Department (initially operating over a local network instead of the web). The camera was finally switched off on August 22, 2001. The final image captured by the camera can still be viewed at its homepage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/coffee.html CoffeeCam], University of Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/static/popup/coffeecam/cam2.html|title=Trojan Room Coffee Pot - SPIEGEL ONLINE|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the oldest webcam still operating was FogCam at [[San Francisco State University]], which had been running continuously since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xpress.sfsu.edu/archives/life/001905.html "Happy Birthday Fogcam"] by Anjuli Elais in ''Golden Gate XPress'', September 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Connectix QuickCam ===
The first commercial webcam, the black-and-white [[QuickCam]], entered the marketplace in 1994, created by the U.S. computer company [[Connectix]] (which sold its product line to [[Logitech]] in 1998). QuickCam was available in August 1994 for the [[Apple Macintosh]], connecting via a [[serial port]], at a cost of $100.  Jon Garber, the designer of the device, had wanted to call it the "Mac-camera", but was overruled by Connectix's marketing department; a version with a PC-compatible parallel port and software for  [[Microsoft Windows]] was launched in October 1995.  The original QuickCam provided 320x240-pixel resolution with a grayscale depth of 16 shades at 60 frames per second, or 256 shades at 15 frames per second.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Benj. [http://www.pcworld.com/article/199112/victorian_scifi.html History of Video Calls: From Fantasy to Flops to Facetime], [[PC World (magazine)|PC World Magazine]], June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  These cam were tested on several Delta II launch using a variety of communication protocols including CDMA, TDMA, GSM and HF.

In 2010, [[Time Magazine]] named the QuickCam as one of the top computer devices of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Ha, Peter. [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2023689_2023703_2023628,00.html Computing: Connectix QuickCam], [[Time Magazine]], October 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Videoconferencing]] via computers already existed, and at the time [[Client–server model|client-server]] based videoconferencing software such as [[CU-SeeMe]] had started to become popular.

=== Later developments ===
One of the most widely reported-on webcam sites was [[JenniCam]], created in 1996, which allowed Internet users to observe the life of its namesake constantly, in the same vein as the [[Reality television|reality TV series]] ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', launched four years later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1115262,00.html "Plug pulled on live website seen by millions"] by Oliver Burkeman in ''The Guardian'', January 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cameras are mounted overlooking bridges, public squares, and other public places, their output made available on a public web page in accordance with the original concept of a "webcam".  Aggregator websites have also been created, providing thousands of live video streams or up-to-date still pictures, allowing users to find live video streams based on location or other criteria.

Around the turn of the 21st century, computer hardware manufacturers began building webcams directly into [[laptop]] and desktop screens, thus eliminating the need to use an external USB or [[FireWire]] camera.  Gradually webcams came to be used more for telecommunications, or [[videotelephony]], between two people, or among several people, than for offering a view on a Web page to an unknown public.

For less than US$100 in 2012, a [[three-dimensional|three-dimensional space]] webcam became available, producing videos and photos in 3D [[anaglyph image]] with a resolution up to 1280 × 480 pixels. Both sender and receiver of the images must use 3D glasses to see the effect of three dimensional image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lanxon |first=Nate |url=http://crave.cnet.co.uk/gadgets/3d-photos-minoru-3d-webcam-hands-on-49303012/ |title=3D photos: Minoru 3D webcam hands-on &amp;#124; CNET UK |publisher=Crave.cnet.co.uk |date=2009-07-16 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
[[File:Sweex USB webcam PCB with without lens close up.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Webcams typically include a lens (shown at top), an image sensor (shown at bottom), and supporting circuitry]]

Webcams typically include a lens, an [[image sensor]], support electronics, and may also include a [[microphone]] for sound. Various lenses are available, the most common in consumer-grade webcams being a plastic [[Lens (optics)|lens]] that can be screwed in and out to focus the camera. [[Fixed-focus lens]]es, which have no provision for adjustment, are also available. As a camera system's [[depth of field]] is greater for small image formats and is greater for lenses with a large [[f-number]] (small aperture), the systems used in webcams have a sufficiently large depth of field that the use of a fixed-focus lens does not impact image sharpness to a great extent.

Image sensors can be [[CMOS]] or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]], the former being dominant for low-cost cameras, but CCD cameras do not necessarily outperform CMOS-based cameras in the low-price range. Most consumer webcams are capable of providing [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]]-resolution video at a [[frame rate]] of 30 frames per second. Many newer devices can produce video in multi-[[megapixel]] resolutions, and a few can run at high frame rates such as the [[PlayStation Eye]], which can produce [[Quarter VGA|320×240]] video at 120 frames per second.

Support electronics read the image from the sensor and transmit it to the host computer. The camera pictured to the right, for example, uses a Sonix SN9C101 to transmit its image over [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]. Typically, each frame is transmitted uncompressed in [[RGB]] or [[YUV]] or compressed as [[JPEG]]. Some cameras, such as [[camera phone|mobile-phone cameras]], use a CMOS sensor with supporting electronics "on die", i.e. the sensor and the support electronics are built on a single [[Integrated circuit|silicon chip]] to save space and manufacturing costs. Most webcams feature built-in [[microphone]]s to make [[videotelephone|video calling]] and [[videoconferencing]] more convenient.

The [[USB video device class]] (UVC) specification allows interconnectivity of webcams to computers without the need for proprietary device drivers. Microsoft [[Windows XP]] SP2, [[Linux]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_26#head-6d4ee1ddea983f5c8ac491b8685a94ea6fa4132b|title=Linux 2 6 26|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mac OS X]] (since October 2005) have UVC support built in and do not require extra device drivers, although they are often installed to add additional features.

== Privacy ==
Many users do not wish the continuous exposure for which webcams were originally intended, but rather prefer privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://br.noticias.yahoo.com/jogador-esquece-webcam-ligada-transmite-sexo-namorada.html|title=Jogador esquece webcam ligada e transmite sexo com namorada|date=13 November 2012|work=Yahoo Notícias|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such privacy is lost when [[malware]] allow [[Hacker (computer security)|malicious hackers]] to activate the webcam without the user's knowledge, providing the hackers with a live video and audio feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Leon|title=Virtual crime! : solving cybercrime|year=2009|publisher=Enslow Publishers|location=Berkeley Heights, NJ|isbn=0766033767|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=B2utHHdYJOcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=ivacy+is+lost+when+Trojan+horse+programs+allow+malicious+hackers+to+activate+the+webcam+&amp;ots=6xUolQ_x9M&amp;sig=uUxTma9QTdwOzn1sma4bgzUAqkU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a particular concern on many laptop computers, as such cameras normally cannot be physically disabled if hijacked by such a [[Trojan Horse]] program or other similar [[spyware]] programs.

Cameras such as [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s older external [[iSight]] cameras include lens covers to thwart this. Some webcams have built-in hardwired [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] indicators that light up whenever the camera is active, sometimes only in video mode{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}. However, it is possible for [[malware]] to circumvent the indicator and activate the camera surrepticiously, as researchers demonstrated in the case of a [[MacBook]]'s built-in camera in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/06/surveillance-camera-laptop-smartphone-cover-tape|title=Why is everyone covering up their laptop cameras?|last=Yadron|first=Danny|date=2016-06-06|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various companies sell sliding lens covers and stickers that allow users to retrofit a computer or smartphone to close access to the camera lens as needed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One such company reported having sold more than 250,000 such items from 2013 to 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, any opaque material will work. Prominent users include former FBI director [[James Comey]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fraudulent process of attempting to hack into a person's webcam and activate it without the webcam owner's permission has been called [[camfecting]]. The remotely activated webcam can be used to watch anything within the webcam's field of vision, sometimes the webcam owner itself. Camfecting is most often carried out by infecting the victim's computer with a virus that can provide the hacker access to the victim's webcam. This attack is specifically targeted at the victim's webcam, and hence the name ''camfecting'', a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''cam'' and ''infecting''. 

In January 2005, some [[Web search engine|search engine]] queries were published in an online forum&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/08/web_surveillance_cams_open_to_all/ "Google exposes web surveillance cams"] by Kevin Poulsen, ''The Register'', January 8, 2005, retrieved September 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; which allow anyone to find thousands of [[Panasonic]]- and [[Axis Communications|Axis]] high-end web cameras, provided that they have a web-based [[Interface (computing)|interface]] for remote viewing. Many such cameras are running on default configuration, which does not require any [[password]] login or [[IP address]] verification, making them viewable by anyone.

In the 2010 ''[[Robbins v. Lower Merion School District]]'' "WebcamGate" case, plaintiffs charged that two suburban Philadelphia high schools secretly spied on students - by surreptitiously remotely activating iSight webcams embedded in school-issued [[MacBook]] laptops the students were using at home — and thereby infringed on their privacy rights.  School authorities admitted to secretly snapping over 66,000 photographs, including shots of students in the privacy of their bedrooms, including some with teenagers in various state of undress.&lt;ref name="USATODAY"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/02/school-district-accused-of-issuing-webcam-laptops-to-spy-on-students/1|author=Doug Stanglin|title=School district accused of spying on kids via laptop webcams|date=February 18, 2010|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;[http://lmsd.org/documents/news/100503_l3_report.pdf "Initial LANrev System Findings"], LMSD Redacted Forensic Analysis, L-3 Services – prepared for [[Ballard Spahr]] (LMSD's counsel), May 2010.

== Effects on modern society ==
Webcams allow for inexpensive, real-time [[video chat]] and [[webcasting]], in both amateur and professional pursuits. They are frequently used in [[online dating]] and for online personal services offered mainly by women when [[camgirl]]ing. However, the ease of webcam use through the Internet for video chat has also caused issues. For example, moderation system of various video chat websites such as [[Omegle]] has been criticized as being ineffective, with sexual content still rampant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Problems with Omegle Girls and Free Chat Services|url=http://www.omeglegirlschat.com/omegle-controversy|publisher=OmegleGirlsChat|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 case, the transmission of nude photos and videos via Omegle from a teenage girl to a schoolteacher resulted in a [[child pornography]] charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-band teacher pleads guilty to porn charge with girl, 16|url=http://www.jconline.com/article/20130426/NEWS03/304260027/child-porn-former-teacher-nude-photos|publisher=jconline.com|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[YouTube]] is a popular website hosting many videos made using webcams. News websites such as the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] also produce professional live news videos using webcams rather than traditional cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/webcams/bbclondon_studio_webcam.shtml|title=BBC - London - In Pictures - BBC London Radio Studio 1|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2013|reason=The link says nothing about the type of camera.}}

Webcams can also encourage [[telecommuting]], enabling people to work from home via the Internet, rather than traveling to their office.

The popularity of webcams among teenagers with Internet access has raised concern about the use of webcams for [[cyber-bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;Poeter, Damon. "[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2401701,00.asp Webcam Peeper Convicted in Rutgers Cyberbullying Case]," ''[[PC Magazine]],'' March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Webcam recordings of teenagers, including underage teenagers, are frequently posted on popular Web forums and [[imageboard]]s such as [[4chan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/4chan-reports-child-pornographer-769123 Tip From 4chan Leads To Arrest Of Site Visitor On Child Porn Charges]," ''[[The Smoking Gun]],'' February 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodin, Dan.

== Descriptive names and terminology ==
''Videophone calls'' (also: ''[[videocalls]]'' and ''[[video chat]]''),&lt;ref&gt;PC Magazine.

Pg. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as [[Broadband Internet access|increased bandwidth]] and sophisticated [[software client]]s that can allow for multiple parties on a call. In general everyday usage the term ''videoconferencing'' is now frequently used instead of ''videocall'' for point-to-point calls between two units. Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a ''video link''.

Webcams are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers, and can be used with many [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Software Client brands|software clients]] for both video calls and videoconferencing.&lt;ref&gt;

A [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Video conferencing systems meant for multiple participants|videoconference system]] is generally higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities. A ''videoconference'' (also known as a ''videoteleconference'') allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. This is often accomplished by the use of a [[multipoint control unit]] (a centralized distribution and call management system) or by a similar non-centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit. Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web-based applications.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Stephen.

A separate webpage article is devoted to [[videoconferencing]].

A [[Telepresence|telepresence system]] is a high-end videoconferencing system and service usually employed by [[company|enterprise-level]] corporate offices. Telepresence conference rooms use state-of-the art room designs, video cameras, displays, sound-systems and processors, coupled with high-to-very-high capacity bandwidth transmissions.

Typical use of the various technologies described above include calling or conferencing on a one-on-one, one-to-many or many-to-many basis for personal, business, educational, [[Video Relay Service|deaf Video Relay Service]] and [[telemedicine|tele-medical, diagnostic]] and [[telerehabilitation|rehabilitative]] use or services.

'''World Kindness Day''' is an [[international observance]] on [[13 November]].  It was introduced in 1998 by the [[World Kindness Movement]], a coalition of nations' kindness [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. It is observed in many countries, including [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Nigeria]] and [[United Arab Emirates]]. In 2009, [[Singapore]] observed the day for the first time.  [[Italy]] and [[India]] also observed the day. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is fronted by [[David Jamilly]], who co-founded [[Kindness Day UK]]. In 2010 at the request of Michael Lloyd-White, the NSW Federation Parents and Citizens Association wrote to the Minister of The NSW Department of Education to place World Kindness Day on the NSW School Calendar. In 2012 At the request of the Chairman of World Kindness Australia, World Kindness Day was placed on the Federal School Calendar and the then Minister of School Education, Early Childhood, and Youth. The Hon [[Peter Garrett]] provided a Declaration of Support for World Kindness Australia and placed World Kindness Day on the National School Calendar for over 9000 schools. Schools across the globe are now celebrating World Kindness Day and work with local NGOs such as the Be Kind People Project and [[Life Vest Inside]] In the USA. In 2012 in Australia, [[Marie Bashir]], Governor of NSW, hosted an event for the first time at [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] to celebrate World Kindness Day and accepted a Cool To Be Kind Award from year 3&amp;4 students. Australian Councils representing over 1.3 million residents have also signed Declarations of Support for World Kindness Australia placing World Kindness Day on the Council Calendar of Events. Events include THE BIG HUG, handing out Kindness Cards, Global Flashmob, which was coordinated by [[Orly Wahba]] from USA which was held in 15 countries and 33 cities with its images of the event making the big screens in [[New York City]]. [[Canada]] celebrates with The Kindness Concert and in Singapore in 2009, 45,000 yellow [[flower]]s were given away. In 2017 World Kindness day was also celebrated in [[Slovenia]], organised by volunteering organisation Humanitarcek as part of their project Randomised Kindess.

World Kindness Day is to highlight good deeds in the community focusing on the positive power and the common thread of kindness which binds us. Kindness is a fundamental part of the [[human condition]] which bridges the divides of race religion, politics, gender and zip codes. Kindness Cards are also an ongoing activity which can either be passed on to recognize an act of kindness and or ask that an act of kindness be done. Approaches are being made to the [[United Nations]] by the peak global body, the World Kindness Movement, to have World Kindness Day officially recognized and its members unanimously sign a Declaration of Support for World Kindness.

According to [[Gulf News]], "it is a day that encourages individuals to overlook boundaries, race and religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/gulf-news-readers-celebrate-world-kindness-day-1.526824|title=Gulf News readers celebrate World Kindness Day|last=Al Theeb|first=Alia|date=November 13, 2009|work=Gulf News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yun Chi-ho''' ([[Hangul|Korean]]: 윤치호, [[hanja]]: 尹致昊, 1864 – 1945) was an important political activist and thinker during the late 1800s and early 1900s in [[Joseon]] Korea. His penname was '''Jwa-ong''' (좌옹, 佐翁&lt;ref&gt;Korean spelling for Sitdown is old man&lt;/ref&gt;); his courtesy name was '''Sungheum''' (성흠;聖欽), '''Sungheum''' (성흠;成欽). a member of Korean early NGO's [[Independence Club]] (독립협회;獨立協會) and [[People's joint association]] (만민공동회;萬民共同會), [[Shinminhwae]] (신민회;新民會). He was a strong nationalist especially in his early years; pushing for reform and modernization in the Joseon government.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"&gt;Clark, Donald N. Yun Ch'i-ho (1864-1945): “Portrait of a Korean Intellectual in an Era of Transition”. Source: Occasional Papers on Korea, No. 4 (September 1975),pp 37-42, 46-50, 54-56, 57, 58&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in important organizations such as the [[Independence Club]] led by [[Seo Jae-pil]]. He also served in various government positions and was a strong supporter of Christianity in Korea.&lt;ref name="Chandra, Vipan 1988 pp 89-91"&gt;Chandra, Vipan. “Imperialism, Resistance, and Reform in Late Nineteenth-Century Korea: Enlightenment and the Independence Club”. (1988) Regents of the University of California {{ISBN|0-912966-99-8}}, pp 89-91, 137, 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Yun's early years were filled with strong support of patriotic and nationalist movements, there seemed to have been a change in Yun’s approach to Korean independence in the wake of the Japanese dominance in Korea, starting with Korea becoming a protectorate of Japan in 1904, and then fully annexed into the [[Japanese Empire]] in 1910. Because of Yun’s apparent change in attitude toward Korean independence and his lack of support of nationalist movements, like the 1919 Samil Movement, many Koreans today see him as a collaborator with the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Caprio, Mark 2007"&gt;Caprio, Mark (2007). "Loyal Patriot? Traitorous Collaborator? The Yun Ch'iho Diaries and the Question of National Loyalty." ''Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History'', Volume 7, Number 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yun Chi-ho was a member of one of the prominent ''[[yangban]]'' families of Korea.&lt;ref name="nyt1913"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/03/21/100257080.pdf  "100 Koreans Freed; But Baron Yun Chi-ho and Other Prominent Men Are Found Guilty,"] ''New York Times.'' March 21, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Son of General [[Yun Ung-nyeol]], who served as a minister in the [[Joseon]] government.&lt;ref name="ng2003"&gt;"Changing Sides," ''National Geographic.'' July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; he attended [[Vanderbilt University]] in Tennessee&lt;ref name="nyt1913"/&gt; before transferring to [[Emory University]] in Georgia.&lt;ref name="emory"&gt;Loftus, Mary J.  [http://www.yunposun.com/technote/read.cgi?board=doc&amp;y_number=19&amp;nnew=1  "A Search for Truth; Yun Chi-Ho's Legacy is Rediscovered by his Great-granddaughter,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718150204/http://www.yunposun.com/technote/read.cgi?board=doc&amp;y_number=19&amp;nnew=1 |date=July 18, 2011 }} ''Emory Magazine,''  Vol 80, No. 1, Spring 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an early leader of the Korean [[YMCA]] and a South Korean [[Methodist]].

==Early life==
Yun Chi-ho was born on December 26, 1864 in a small village in Dunpo-myeon, [[Asan]], [[Chungcheong Province]]. His father, [[Yun Ung-yeol]], was an official in the Joseon government and as a member of the [[yangban]] aristocracy saw that Chi-ho received a proper education. Yun Chi-ho excelled in his studies of the [[Confucian classics]] at the local seodang and even tried to apply to take the civil-service exams ([[gwageo]]) at age twelve.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"/&gt;

Yun's family was one of [[Joseon dynasty]]'s most illustrious noble families; his 9G-Great grandfather [[Yun Doo-su]] (윤두수;尹斗壽) was [[Yeonguijeong]] under [[King Seonjo]]. But his father Yun Ung-ryeol was an illegitimate son of his grandfather Yun Chui-dong (윤취동;尹取東).

From 1871 to 1878, Yun studied Confucianism at Chang's private village school.

===Trip to Japan===
Because of Yun Ung-yeol’s position in the government, he was able to arrange for Yun Chi-ho’s participation in a delegation of representatives from Korea to observe the process of modernization in Japan in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Schmid, Andre. “Korea Between Empires”. (2002) Columbia University Press {{ISBN|0-231-12538-0}} pp. 47, 49, 76, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Yun was only sixteen years old at the time, but this experience greatly influenced his thoughts on modernization and opened his eyes to world beyond the isolated “Hermit Kingdom” that Korea had become. He frequently compared the lack of progress in Joseon Korea to the rapid modernization of Japan and often lamented in his diaries that he wanted nothing more than for Korea to become the kind of advanced, modern nation that Japan had become.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Yun, Chi-ho. "Yun Chi-Ho's Diaries". Vol I-X. 1975 National History Compilation Committee. Seoul, Korea&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studying in China===
Yun would later travel to [[Shanghai]], [[China]] in 1885 where he would attend the Anglo-Chinese College studying English and mathematics, among other things. While in Shanghai he also converted to Christianity, something that would play a major role throughout the rest of his life. Yun Chi-ho viewed Christianity as a strong progressive philosophy that could help Korea catch up with the advancements of Japan and the West.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Time in America===
He eventually even studied in America, starting in 1888 at [[Vanderbilt University]] and then [[Emory University]]. He strongly admired many aspects of American culture, but was also frustrated with the racial prejudices he experienced while living in the South. In particular, he would identify tensions and contradictions between Christian universalism, and the belief that any individual could earn respect and equality as long as they were pious, and the arbitrary demonstrations of white supremacy that he routinely witnessed and experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Urban|first1=Andrew|title=Yun Ch’i-ho’s Alienation by Way of Inclusion: A Korean International Student and Christian Reform in the 'New' South, 1888–1893|journal=Journal of Asian American Studies|date=October 2014|volume=17|issue=3|pages=305–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While in America he studied English, theology and speech and he gained a great deal of proficiency in the English language; writing most of his diaries in English.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Yun Chiho Emory Univ 1892.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Yun Chi-ho as a student at [[Emory University]] (1892).]]

==Government Service==

===Interpreter===
Yun served in several important government positions throughout his life. He served as an interpreter for the first American Foreign Minister in Korea, [[Lucius Foote]]. Upon arriving in Korea Foote had inquired to the Japanese Foreign Minister [[Inoue Kaoru]] about finding someone to interpret for him while in Seoul, and Minister Inoue, who knew Yun Chi-ho from his days in Japan, recommended Yun to help serve Minister Foote. It was also Foote who helped Yun with arranging his studies in Shanghai.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"/&gt;

===Vice President of the Privy Council and banishment===
Yun also served as the Vice President of the Privy Council of the Joseon Court from 1898 until he was banished in 1899 due to pressure from opposing factions in the government. While banished to the countryside, Yun served as magistrate for a town called Wonsan in Northern Korea. His banishment was not long lived and in 1903 he was called to serve as the Vice Foreign Minister.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"/&gt;

==Korean Independence Movements==

===The Independence Club===
When Yun arrived back in Korea from his studies abroad, there were small groups of scholars who were beginning to call for social and political reform in Korea. One such group was the Independence club, which Yun began to participate in. Among other things, the club promoted educating the Korean people on their unique history, promoted the use of Hangeul, the Korean vernacular alphabet, and pushed for government reform. While in the Independence Club Yun called for the government to be more representative of its people and even supported the elevation of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Kojong]] to the title of Gwangmu Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Neff, Robert D. “Korea through Western Eyes”. (2009) Seoul National University Press. {{ISBN|978-89-521-1003-9}} pp 137&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the group was met with pressure from opposing factions in the government that believed the club was gaining too much influence and so in 1899, the club disbanded.&lt;ref name="Chandra, Vipan 1988 pp 89-91"/&gt;

===The Enlightenment Movement===
As Japanese influence on the Korean peninsula began to tighten, Yun also began to support groups that were part of the Enlightenment movement. These groups, such as the Korean Self-Strengthening Society and the New People’s Society, were picking up the pieces where the independence club had left off, and Yun Chi-ho helped them out by giving speeches and writing pamphlets for them. During his time of Banishment, these groups gave Yun something to work for in the hopes of creating a stronger Korean society.&lt;ref name="Chandra, Vipan 1988 pp 89-91"/&gt;

=== Japanese Annexation of Korea ===
{{Main|105-Man Incident}}

{{quote|Joseon people are 10 percent rationality and 90 percent emotion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2001022101011830074004 The Yun Chi-ho's Diary] The Munhwa 2001.02.21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From his early years, he was disappointed in the Joseon people for always having an emotional response and frustrated in their irrationality.
In January 1910, he participated in the World Missionary Conference in America and that May, he attended to [[Edinburgh World Missionary Conference]] in [[England]]. In December 1910, he returned to his country.

When the [[Korean Empire]] was overrun by Japanese military forces in 1910 (see [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910]]), Yun Chi-ho joined with others in resisting Japanese occupation. He became an anti-Imperialist speaker and independence activist.&lt;ref name="ng2003"/&gt; In 1911, he was Judgment for alleged assassination of the Governor General of Korea. He suffered from malicious punishment and torture as a result of the [[105-Man Incident]].

In 1913, along with 104 others, he was charged with conspiracy against the Japanese Governor-General at the time, [[Count Terauchi]]. He was one of six who were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms.&lt;ref name="nyt1913"/&gt;  His experiences in prison tempered his willingness to express his nationalist ardor,&lt;ref name="ng2003"/&gt; but he was still considered active in the independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Henry. (1921). ''The Case of Korea,'' p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy Trial and Imprisonment==
In 1911 Yun was implicated in assisting with an assassination attempt on Japanese governor-general, Terauchi Masatake. Sources from within some of the Enlightenment Movement groups that Yun had taken part in had informed Japanese officials that he had a hand in planning this attempted assassination. He was put on trial and given the maximum sentence. However, after a series of retrials his sentence was shortened and he eventually gained amnesty after only six years in jail.&lt;ref name="Caprio, Mark 2007"/&gt; During this time, he didn’t write down anything in his diaries, but his experience in the Japanese prison system seemed to have a significant effect on his actions after his release. In fact, his release can be seen as a turning point for Yun Chi-ho where he began to make many pro-Japanese statements and gives much less support to Korean nationalistic movements.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"/&gt;

==March 1 Movement==
Inspired by Woodrow Wilson’s idea of “self-determination” presented at the Paris Peace Conference the previous year, on March 1, 1919 many Koreans took to the streets in a peaceful protest to demonstrate that Korea was ready for independence from Japan. Yun knew that the European nations would not take this demonstration seriously. Yun said the following about the movement:
“He who buys a field and keeps it from falling into irredeemable hands is a wiser patriot than he who sells his lands to finance the independent movement. He who sends a poor boy to school to become more intelligent than his fathers is doing a greater service than he who stirs up students for political agitations. He who leads an erring man into decent religious life is serving the Korean race better than he who sends ignorant folks to jail for yelling ‘mansei.’ Now is the time for Koreans to learn and wait.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Japanese Support==
Yun’s reversal in opinion took an even larger turn from his previous nationalistic rhetoric when he began supporting the Japanese war efforts during WWII. He urged the young men of Korea to help the Japanese to victory by assisting in the war effort. He celebrated as the Japanese pushed Western imperialist powers out of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Hyung-chan. “Portrait of a Troubled Korean Patriot: Yun Ch'i-ho's Views of the March First Independence Movement and World War II”. Korean Studies, Volume 13, 1989, pp. 76-91 (Article) Published by University of Hawai'i Press. DOI: 10.1353/ks.1989.0014&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yun the Korean people’s part in the Japanese Empire them opportunity and access to education and resources they previously never had. Yun said, “The intellectuals of Korea today all realize that destiny of the Korean people can be promoted by becoming one with the Japanese people and that Manchuria and North China have opened up a field for the development of the Korean people never before dreamed of.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
