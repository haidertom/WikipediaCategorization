An '''aerospace manufacturer''' is a company or individual involved in the various aspects of [[Aircraft design process|designing]], building, testing, selling, and maintaining [[aircraft]], [[aircraft part]]s, [[missile]]s, [[rocket]]s, or [[spacecraft]]. [[Aerospace]] is a [[high tech]]nology industry.{{according to whom|date=September 2017}}

The '''aircraft industry''' is the [[industry]] supporting [[aviation]] by building [[aircraft]] and manufacturing [[aircraft parts]] for their maintenance.  This includes aircraft and parts used  for [[civil aviation]] and [[military aviation]]. Most production is done pursuant to [[type certificate]]s and [[Defense Standard]]s issued by a government body. This term has been largely subsumed by the more encompassing term: "[[aerospace]] industry".

== Market ==

In 2015 the Aircraft Production was worth $180.3 Billion: 61% [[airliner]]s, 14% business and [[general aviation]], 12% [[Military aircraft]], 10% military [[rotary wing]] and 3% civil rotary wing; while their [[aircraft maintenance|MRO]] was worth $135.1 Bn or ${{#expr:180.3+135.1}} Bn combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.aeromontreal.ca/download/fca8adddfff353/01-MRO+Industry+Outlook_Kevin+Michaels.pdf |title= MRO Industry Outlook |author= Kevin Michaels |publisher= ICF International |date= April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global aerospace industry was worth $838 billion in 2017: Aircraft &amp; Engine [[OEM]]s represented 28% (${{#expr:838*.28round0}} Bn), Civil &amp; Military MRO &amp; Upgrades 27% (${{#expr:838*.27round0}} Bn), Aircraft Systems &amp; Component Manufacturing 26% (${{#expr:838*.26round0}} Bn), [[Satellite]]s &amp; Space 7% (${{#expr:838*.07round0}} Bn), [[Missile]]s &amp; [[UAV]]s 5% (${{#expr:838*.05round0}} Bn) and other activity, including [[flight simulator]]s, defense electronics, public research accounted for 7% (${{#expr:838*.07round0}} Bn).&lt;ref name=Industry-2017/&gt;
The countries with the largest industry were led by the [[United States]] with $408.4 Bn ({{#expr:408.4/8.38round0}}%) followed by [[France]] with $69 Bn ({{#expr:69/8.38round1}}%) then [[China]] with $61.2 Bn ({{#expr:61.2/8.38round1}}%), [[United Kingdom]] with $48.8 Bn ({{#expr:48.4/8.38round1}}%), [[Germany]] with $46.2 Bn ({{#expr:46.2/8.38round1}}%), [[Russia]] with $27.1 Bn ({{#expr:27.1/8.38round1}}%), [[Canada]] with $24 Bn ({{#expr:24/8.38round1}}%) and [[Japan]] with $21 Bn ({{#expr:21/8.38round1}}%).&lt;ref name=Industry-2017&gt;{{cite web |url= https://aerodynamicadvisory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AeroDynamic-Teal_Global-Aerospace-Industry_16July2018.pdf |title= The Global Aerospace Industry Size &amp; Country Rankings |date= 16 July 2018 |publisher= The Teal Group / AeroDynamic Advisory |authors= [[Richard Aboulafia]] and Kevin Michaels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the new commercial aircraft value is projected for $270.4 billion while [[business aircraft]] will amount for $18 billion and civil helicopters for $4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/commercial-spending-will-lead-mro-field-2018 |title= Commercial Spending Will Lead MRO Field In 2018 |at= Comparing civil, helicopter, business aviation and military MRO forecasts for 2018 |date= Jan 2, 2018 |author= Lee Ann Shay |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
In September 2018, [[PwC]] ranked aerospace manufacturing attractiveness: the most attractive country was the [[United States]], with $240 billion in sales in 2017, due the sheer size of the industry (#1) and educated [[workforce]] (#1), low [[geopolitical]] risk (#4, #1 is [[Japan]]), strong [[transportation infrastructure]] (#5, #1 is [[Hong Kong]]), a healthy [[economy]] (#10, #1 is [[China]]), but high [[costs]] (#7, #1 is [[Denmark]]) and average [[tax policy]] (#36, #1 is [[Qatar]]).&lt;!--&lt;ref name=PwCsep2018&gt;--&gt;
Following were [[Canada]], [[Singapore]], [[Switzerland]] and [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=PwCsep2018&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industrial-products/publications/assets/pwc-aerospace-manufacturing-attractiveness-rankings-2018.pdf |title= Aerospace manufacturing attractiveness rankings |date= September 2018 |publisher= PwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the US, the most attractive was [[Washington state]], due to the best Industry (#1), leading Infrastructure (#4, [[New Jersey]] is #1) and Economy (#4, [[Texas]] is #1), good labor (#9, [[Massachusetts]] is #1), average tax policy (#17, [[Alaska]] is #1) but is costly (#33, [[Montana]] is #1).&lt;!--&lt;ref name=PwCsep2018&gt;--&gt;
Washington is tied to [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]], earning $10.3 billion, is home to 1,400 aerospace-related businesses, and has the highest aerospace jobs concentration.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=PwCsep2018&gt;--&gt;
Following are Texas, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Arizona]] and [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name=PwCsep2018/&gt;

In the [[European Union]], aerospace companies such as [[Airbus]], [[BAE Systems]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], [[Dassault Group|Dassault]], [[Saab AB]], [[Terma A/S]] and [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo]] are participants in the global aerospace industry and research effort.

In [[Russia]], large aerospace companies like [[Oboronprom]] and the [[United Aircraft Corporation]] (encompassing [[Mikoyan]], [[Sukhoi]], [[Ilyushin]], [[Tupolev]], [[Yakovlev]], and [[Irkut (company)|Irkut]], which includes [[Beriev]]) are among the major global players in this industry.

In the US, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[NASA]] are the two biggest consumers of aerospace technology and products.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} The Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States reported that the aerospace industry employed 444,000 wage and salary jobs in 2004, many of which were in Washington and California,{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} this marked a steep decline from the peak years during the [[Reagan Administration]] when total employment exceeded 1,000,000 aerospace industry workers.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Dana T. ''Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II,'' pp. 131-2, Cypress, CA, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

During that period of recovery a special program to restore U.S. competitiveness across all U.S. industries, [[Project Socrates]], contributed to employment growth as the U.S. aerospace industry captured 72 percent of world aerospace market.  By 1999 U.S. share of the world market fell to 52 percent.

=== Cities ===

Important locations of the civil aerospace industry worldwide include [[Seattle]], [[Wichita, Kansas]], [[Dayton, Ohio]] and [[St. Louis]] in the United States ([[Boeing]]), [[Montreal]] and [[Toronto]] in Canada ([[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada]]), [[Toulouse]] in France and [[Hamburg]] in Germany ([[Airbus]], [[EADS]]), the North-West of England and [[Bristol]] in Britain ([[BAE Systems]], [[Airbus]] and [[AgustaWestland]]), [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] and [[Irkutsk]] in Russia ([[Sukhoi]], [[Beriev]]), [[Kiev]] and [[Kharkiv]] in Ukraine ([[Antonov]]), [[Nagoya]] in Japan ([[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Aerospace]] and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Aerospace]]), as well as [[São José dos Campos]] in Brazil where [[Embraer]] is based.

== Consolidation ==

Several consolidations took place in the aerospace and defense industries over the last few decades.

[[BAE Systems]] is the successor company to numerous British aircraft manufacturers which merged throughout the second half of the 20th century. Many of these mergers followed the [[1957 Defence White Paper]].

[[Airbus]] prominently illustrated the European airliner manufacturing consolidation in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name=AvWeek12jul2018/&gt;

Between 1988 and 2010, more than 5,452 [[mergers and acquisitions]] with a total known-value of US$579 billion were announced worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/#mergers-acquisitions-industry-Aerospace-Defense |title= Mergers &amp; Acquisitions - Aerospace &amp; Defense |work= Thomson Financial, Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, then [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Les Aspin]] and his deputy [[William J. Perry]] held the "Last Supper" at [[the Pentagon]] with contractors executives who were told that there were twice as many military suppliers as he wanted to see: $55 billion in military-industry mergers took place from 1992 to 1997, leaving mainly  [[Boeing]], [[Lockheed Martin]] and [[Raytheon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/27/business/shrinking-military-complex-after-cold-war-pentagon-just-another-customer.html |title= The Shrinking Military Complex; After the Cold War, the Pentagon Is Just Another Customer |author= Leslie Wayne |newspaper= New York Times |date= Feb 27, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Boeing]] bought [[McDonnell Douglas]] for US$13.3 billion in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/16/business/boeing-offering-13-billion-to-buy-mcdonnell-douglas-last-us-commercial-rival.html |title=

[[Raytheon]] acquired [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] for $9.5 billion in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/raytheon-wins-bidding-war-for-hughes-aircraft-1467/ |title= Raytheon wins bidding war for Hughes Aircraft |date= 22 January 1997 |work= Flight International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marconi Electronic Systems]], a subsidiary of the [[General Electric Company plc]], was acquired by [[British Aerospace]] for US$12.3 billion in 1999 merger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/all-uk-merger-sends-european-defence-into-disarray-47309/ |title= All-UK merger sends European defence into disarray |date= 27 January 1999 |work= Flight International}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form [[BAE Systems]].

In 2002, when [[Fairchild Dornier]] was [[bankrupt]], Airbus, Boeing or Bombardier declined to take the [[728JET]]/928JET large [[regional jet]] program as [[Mainline (aeronautics)|mainline]] and regional aircraft manufacturers were split and Airbus was digesting its ill-fated [[Fokker]] acquisition a decade earlier.&lt;ref name=AvWeek12jul2018/&gt;

On September 4, 2017, [[United Technologies]] acquired [[Rockwell Collins]] in cash and stock for $23 billion, $30 billion including Rockwell Collins' net debt, for $500+ million of synergies expected by year four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.utc.com/News/News-Center/Pages/United-Technologies-To-Acquire-Rockwell-Collins-For-30-Billion.aspx |title= United Technologies To Acquire Rockwell Collins For $30 Billion |date= September 4, 2017 |publisher= United Technologies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oct. 16, 2017 announcement of the [[CSeries]] partnership between [[Airbus]] and [[Bombardier Aerospace]] could trigger a daisy chain of reactions towards a new order.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18oct2017/&gt;--&gt; 
Airbus gets a new, efficient model at the lower end of the [[narrowbody]] market which provides the bulk of [[airliner]] profits and can abandon the slow selling [[Airbus A319|A319]] while Bombardier benefits from the growth in this expanded market even if it holds a smaller residual stake.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18oct2017/&gt;--&gt;
Boeing could forge a similar alliance with either [[Embraer]] with its [[E-jet E2]] or [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] and its [[Mitsubishi Regional Jet|MRJ]].&lt;ref name=AvWeek18oct2017&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/opinion-c-series-deal-ends-aerospace-status-quo |title= Opinion: C Series Deal Ends Aerospace Status Quo |date= Oct 18, 2017 |author= Jerrold T. Lundquist |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December, Boeing and Embraer confirmed to be discussing a potential combination with a transaction subject to Brazilian government regulators, the companies’ boards and shareholders approvals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/boeing-embraer-mull-combination-could-reset-oem-industry |title= Boeing, Embraer Mull Combination That Could Reset OEM Industry |date= Dec 21, 2017 |author=  Michael Bruno and Guy Norris |work= Aviation Week Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The weight of [[Airbus and Boeing]] could help E2 and CSeries sales but the 100-150 seats market seems slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-mergers-may-fuel-long-awaited-e2-and-cseri-449225/ |title= Mergers may fuel long-awaited E2 and CSeries sales bump |date= 6 June 2018 |author= Jon Hemmerdinger |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the CSeries, renamed A220, and E-jet E2 are more capable than their predecessors, they moved closer to the lower end of the [[narrowbody|narrowbodies]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek12jul2018&gt;--&gt;
In 2018, the four Western airframers combined into two within nine months as Boeing acquired 80% of Embraer's airliners for $3.8 billion on July 5.&lt;ref name=AvWeek12jul2018&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/aerospace-consolidation-anew-now-it-s-commercial-airframers |title= Aerospace Consolidation Anew: Now It’s The Commercial Airframers |date= Jul 12, 2018 |author= Jens Flottau |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suppliers ==

The largest aerospace suppliers are [[United Technologies]] with $28.2 Billion of revenue, followed by [[GE Aviation]] with $24.7 Billion, [[Safran]] with $22.5 Billion, [[Rolls-Royce Holdings]] with $16.9 Billion, [[Honeywell Aerospace]] with $15.2 Billion and [[Rockwell Collins]] including  [[B/E Aerospace]] with $8.1 Billion.&lt;ref name=AW170120&gt;{{cite new |url= http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/tier-1-consolidation-continues-safran-takes-over-zodiac |title= Tier 1 Consolidation Continues As Safran Takes Over Zodiac |date= Jan 20, 2017 |author= Thierry Dubois and Jens Flottau |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[electric aircraft]] development could generate large changes for the aerospace suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/industry-landscape-could-reboot-under-aircraft-electrification |title= Industry Landscape Could Reboot Under Aircraft Electrification |date= Dec 6, 2017 |author= Michael Bruno |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 2018, United Technologies announced the completion of its Rockwell Collins acquisition, renaming systems supplier UTC Aerospace Systems as [[Collins Aerospace]], for $23 billion of sales in 2017 and 70,000 employees, and $39.0 billion of sales in 2017 combined with engine manufacturer [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.utc.com/News/News-Center/Pages/United-Technologies-Announces-Intention-to-Separate-Into-Three-Independent-Compan.aspx |title= United Technologies Announces Intention to Separate Into Three Independent Companies; Completes Acquisition of Rockwell Collins |date= November 26, 2018 |publisher= United Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supply chain==

Before the 1980s/1990s, aircraft and aeroengine manufacturers were [[vertically integrated]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18may2017/&gt;--&gt;
Then [[Douglas aircraft]] outsourced large [[aerostructure]]s and the [[Bombardier Global Express]] pioneered the “Tier 1” [[supply chain]] model inspired by [[automotive industry]], with 10-12 risk-sharing [[limited partners]] funding around half of the development costs.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18may2017/&gt;--&gt;
The [[Embraer E-Jet]] followed in the late 1990s with fewer than 40 primary suppliers. &lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18may2017/&gt;--&gt;

[[Boeing]] embraced an aggressive Tier 1 model for the [[B787]] but with its difficulties began to question why it was earning lower margins than its suppliers while it seemed to take all the risk, ensuing its 2011 ''Partnering for Success'' initiative, as [[Airbus]] initiated its own ''Scope+'' initiative for the [[A320]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18may2017/&gt;--&gt;

Entrants begin at the local level through more than 140 local AAF affiliate chapters in competitions usually held in January and February. Local ADDY Award winners are then eligible to advance to one of 15 regional AAF District competitions. Winners at the District level are then entered in the National competition, and National ADDY Award winners are recognized at ADMERICA, the AAF's national conference held each June. 

The AAF and its local and district affiliates use the proceeds to enhance advertising through programs such as public service, internships, advocacy groups, advertising education, and consumer awareness.{{Cn|date=February 2018}}

'''Antonio Andrónico Luksic Abaroa''' (5 November 1926 &amp;ndash; 18 August 2005) was a [[Chile]]an businessman of [[Croats|Croatian]] origin. He founded the Luksic Group, becoming the richest person in [[Chile]], the fourth in [[Latin America]], and the 132nd in the world, with a [[net worth]] in 2005 of {{US$|4.2 billion|link=yes}} according to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Billionaires 2005"/&gt; The Luksic Group has interests in the [[mining]], [[financial]], [[Industry|industrial]], and [[beverages]] sectors. Major holdings include, or have included, [[Banco de Chile]], [[Compañía de las Cervecerías Unidas|Compañia de Cervecerias Unidas]] (CCU), and [[Antofagasta Plc]], a UK-listed [[copper]] mining company. In Croatia, he was involved in the tourist industry.{{clarify|date=March 2017}}

On September 2002, the Chilean newspaper ''[[El Mercurio]]'' published an interview with Andrónico Luksic titled "Don Andrónico cuenta su historia" (''Don Andrónico shares his story''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/economia/2005/08/19/192641/la-entrevista-que-andronico-luksic-abaroa-dio-a-el-mercurio.html|title=La entrevista que Andrónico Luksic Abaroa dio a El Mercurio|date=19 August 2005|accessdate=9 March 2017|publisher=El Mercurio}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he explains how, after a life of hard work, he had decided to retire and "dedicate himself to what he liked the most: his family, his beloved Croatia and social assistance".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Family==
Luksic was born in [[Antofagasta]], to a [[Bolivia]]n mother, Elena Abaroa (great-grandchild of Bolivian [[War of the Pacific]] hero [[Eduardo Abaroa]]), and a [[Croatia]]n immigrant father, Policarpo, who had arrived in Chile from the Adriatic island of [[Brač]] in 1910 and had made a living in the nitrate industry.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Luksic married Ena Craig and they had two sons: Andrónico (born 16 April 1954&lt;ref name="El Mercurio"/&gt;) and Guillermo (born 14 January 1956&lt;ref name="El Mercurio"/&gt;). Luksic was widowed when Ena died in 1959. He married Iris Fontbona in 1961, when she was 18 years old.&lt;ref name="La Segunda"/&gt; They had two daughters: Paola (born 1961/1962) and Gabriela (born 1962/1963), and one son: [[Jean-Paul Luksic Fontbona]] (born 31 May 1964).&lt;ref name="El Mercurio"/&gt;)&lt;ref name="Telegraph obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times obit"/&gt;

{{Wiktionary|listenership|readership|viewership}}

'''Audience measurement''' measures how many people are in an [[audience]], usually in relation to [[radio]] '''listenership''' and [[television]] '''viewership''', but also in relation to [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] '''readership''' and, increasingly, [[web traffic]] on [[website]]s. Sometimes, the term is used as pertaining to practices which help [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] and [[advertising|advertisers]] determine ''who'' is listening rather than just ''how many'' people are listening. In some parts of the world, the resulting relative numbers are referred to as '''audience share''', while in other places the broader term [[market share]] is used. This broader meaning is also called '''audience research'''.

Measurements are broken down by [[media market]], which for the most part corresponds to [[metropolitan area]]s, both large and small.

==Methods==

===Diaries===
The [[diary]] was one of the first methods of recording information.  However, this is prone to [[Error|mistakes]] and [[forgetting|forgetfulness]], as well as [[subjectivity]].  Data is also collected down to the level of listener opinion of individual songs, cross referenced against their age, race, and economic status in listening sessions sponsored by oldies and mix formatted stations. [[Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics|IBOPE]] was the first realtime service for audience measurement of the world, it started in [[São Paulo]] in 1942.

===Electronic===
{{See also|Nielsen ratings}}
The audience measurement of [[U.S. television]] has relied on sampling to obtain estimated audience sizes in which advertisers determine the value of such acquisitions.  According to The Television Will Be Revolutionized, [[Amanda D. Lotz]] states that during the 1960s and 1970s, Nielsen introduced the Storage Instantaneous Audimeter, a device that daily sent viewing information to the company's computers using phone lines and made national daily ratings available by 1973.  Although the audimeters did not supply sufficient information regarding [[demographics]] of the audience, it did however allow Nielsen to establish diary reports that presented some insight on the audience.  According to Lotz, the Nielsen sample included approximately 1,700 audimeter homes and a rotating panel of approximately 850 diary respondents.  Nielsen was the controlling factor of audience measurement for national network television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lotz|first=Amanda|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|year=2007|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2000s, networks cried foul, blaming Nielsen for inaccurate rating measurements. This public attention was just the beginning, as Nielsen implemented its automated Local [[People Meter]] (LPM) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Napoli|first=Philip M.|title=Audience Economics: Media Institutions and the Audience Marketplace|year=2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LPM marked the shift from active, diary based local measurement to more passive, meter-monitored measurement of local markets. Technologically, the LPM is very similar to the original Nielsen People Meter. The key advancement was that the LPM provided accurate measurements of particular local markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2009/people-meter-technology-brings-miami-more-accurate-ratings.html|title=People Meter Technology Brings Miami More Accurate Ratings|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316170800/http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2009/people-meter-technology-brings-miami-more-accurate-ratings.html|archivedate=16 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silcock|first1=B. William|last2=Heider|first2=Don|last3=Rogus|first3=Mary T.|title=Managing Television News: A Handbook for Ethical and Effective Producing|year=2009|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Mahwah, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LPM system has also allowed the industry to measure year-round, rather than the quarterly "sweeps" periods. Researchers believed that the LPM more accurately reported the full range of programming viewers watched, including that while channel-surfing. [[Arbitron]]'s [[Portable People Meter]] uses a [[microphone]] to pick up and record [[subaudible tone]]s embedded in broadcasts by an [[encoder]] at each station or [[broadcast network|network]].  It has even been used to track in-store [[radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soc.northwestern.edu/webster/pubs/Webster%20%282008%29%20People-Meter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312214806/http://www.soc.northwestern.edu/webster/pubs/Webster%20(2008)%20People-Meter.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the digital terrestrial television (DTT) around the world brings new problems to the television audience measurement process. In a multisignal context, with the emergence of new contents and squarely in front of the contemporary technological convergence, the correct representation of the viewing behaviors faces methodological challenges. New methodologies (Audio or Video Matching, Water Marketing) are needed in order to measure the digital television audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buzeta|first1=Cristian|last2=Moyano|first2=Patricio|url=http://cuadernos.info/index.php/CDI/article/view/503/pdf_1|title=The Television Audience Measurement in the Digital Age|year=2013|issue=33|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213090326/http://cuadernos.info/index.php/CDI/article/view/503/pdf_1|archivedate=2017-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The measurement using audimeters enters a new era, facing the dual challenge of analog and digital measurement in a mixed television broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Portilla|first1=Idoia|url=http://www.tripodos.com/index.php/Facultat_Comunicacio_Blanquerna/article/viewFile/243/201|title=Television Audience Measurement: Proposals of the Industry in the Era of Digitalization|year=2015|issue=36|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213003807/http://www.tripodos.com/index.php/Facultat_Comunicacio_Blanquerna/article/viewFile/243/201|archivedate=2017-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the internet, many businesses are no longer constrained to establishing sales to just their local markets, but alternatively can serve customers across much larger territories. The arising development of [[market (economics)|markets]] boosts the likelihood of offering low-occurrence [[niche market|niche]] items that would go through challenges in order to encounter the ideal customers in a specific area of markets. In his Journal of Advertising Research, author [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] remarks: "for some internet-based businesses, locality no longer regulates the market."
When [[consumers]] obtain access to a greater range of choices, they gravitate toward exercising those choices, awarding fewer of their "votes" to the big hits and more of their "votes" to specialized niche choices. Anderson argues that people always wanted more choices, but their desires previously were obscured by distributional bottlenecks imposed by cost or locality.

===Software===
New digital technologies initially complicated in-home measurement systems. The [[digital video recorder|DVR]], for example, initially seemed incompatible with a Nielsen box, which was designed to register the frequency of the television signal in order to measure the channel being viewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/10/18/fall-tv-2012-dvr-ratings-increases/|title=Why DVR Ratings Increases Matter, and Why They Don’t – TVLine|work=TVLine|accessdate=13 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017201935/http://tvline.com/2012/10/18/fall-tv-2012-dvr-ratings-increases/|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a DVR always produces the same frequency, an A/P or active/passive meter could be developed to read audio tracks of a particular program rather than the frequency of the television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tngresearch.com/old_articles/active_passive.htm|title=Dave Zornow Articles: Nielsen's Active/Passive Digital Meter|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316165448/http://www.tngresearch.com/old_articles/active_passive.htm|archivedate=2014-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another challenge to the industry was consumers' turning to [[digital cable]], the [[internet]] and devices other than their television sets to view entertainment content. As new ways of measurement were becoming readily available and people could easily be tracked and monitored for content and use, the industry worried that traditional sampling techniques might become obsolete. Furthermore, the increasing fragmentation of viewing across different technologies posed difficulties in reporting actual viewer numbers for a content piece. In 2010 Nielsen began rolling out its "anytime anywhere media measurement" initiative, which includes DVR views in the television figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Straubhaar|first1=Joseph|last2=LaRose|first2=Robert|last3=Davenport|first3=Lucinda|title=Media Now: Understanding Media, Culture, and Technology|year=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Stamford, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed “GTAM,” which stands for Global Television Audience Metering, is based on the development of new audience metering technologies aimed at dealing with all of the conceivable challenges involved in measuring the video viewing behavior of contemporary consumer households across multiple platforms (TV, Internet, mobile devices). Existing A/P meters will be replaced by so-called GTAM meters which are expected to utilize a combination of active and passive measurement technologies. However, unlike A/P meters, they will not require a physical connection to any media devices to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/174443/nielsen-unveiling-suite-of-next-generation-tv-mete.html|title=Nielsen Unveiling Suite Of Next-Generation TV Meters: Designed To Enhance Compliance, Cross-Platform Measurement Too|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017060812/http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/174443/nielsen-unveiling-suite-of-next-generation-tv-mete.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New media==
Nielsen//NetRatings measures [[Internet]] and [[digital media]] audiences through a telephone and Internet survey. Nielsen BuzzMetrics measures [[user-generated content|consumer-generated media]]. Other companies collecting information on internet usage include [[comScore]], [[Wakoopa]], and [[Hitwise]], who measure hits on internet pages. Companies like Visible Measures focus on measuring specific types of media; in the case of Visible Measures, they measure online video consumption and distribution across all video advertising and content. [[GfK]] offers Cross Media Measurement Solutions that allows to attribute offline sales to media exposure across TV, Internet and Mobile utilizing its proprietary LEOtrace technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mrs.org.uk/article/item/356|title=Awards case study:The GfK NOP Media Efficiency Panel|publisher=The Market Research Society|accessdate=9 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328185554/http://www.mrs.org.uk/article/item/356|archivedate=28 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sightcorp, TruMedia, Quividi, relEYEble, stickyPiXEL, Cognitec, goCount and [[CognoVision]] provide real-time audience data including size, [[attention span]] and [[demographics]] by using [[video analytics]] technology to automatically detect, track and classify viewers watching [[display device|digital displays]]. Networked Insights measures online audiences, and released [http://www.socialsights.com/post/56628872/measuring-the-social-tv a report] ranking [[television shows]], based on people's interactions within social media. The study showed that half of the shows on Networked Insights' top 10 list did not appear on the [[Nielsen Media Research]] (NMR) list.

According to "The Television Will Be Revolutionized" by Amanda D. Lotz, one of the most challenging aspects of audience measurement during the multi-channel transition resulted from the intermediary nature of new technologies and distribution systems. The sampling techniques that most audience research relied upon were based on a fairly uniform nationwide availability of technologies and programming, and thus reflected a network-era experience with television. The arrival of varied programming tiers of cable channels challenged the system as US television homes began having highly descriptive access to technology and programming and consequently began using television in significantly different ways. Although the A/P meter solved the problem of DVR use, programming on video on demand systems did not include the "audio watermark" used by the device. The nation's many cable providers also limited access to the proprietary data recorded by their set top boxes, which reduced the informational gain offered by this technology. Video on demand desperately needed to establish measurement matrices to prove its economic viability, but the lack of shared and consistent information further confounded knowledge about use. Likewise, the erosion of the thirty- second advertisement's dominance and the new advertising strategies that became increasingly common required the creation of new methods and matrices to determine value and pricing.

The goal of these leading providers in automated audience measurement solutions is to deliver results to inquiries such as: The nature of the audience, the number of viewers, the content viewed, the amount of time spent on viewing, the type of display utilized and the audience interest in those displays. In "The Television Will be Revolutionized", Amanda Lotz clearly indicates how technological development in the audience measurement practice provides a multitude of technological advancements such as the DVR, Video-On-Demand portable devices such as the iPod and even a boost in mobile phone proficiencies. These improvements comply with television viewing not to be restrained to be "home-watched". Internet measurement is taken to the next level through its sophistication and high tech distribution. This allows several audiences measurement companies to refer to the Internet as the most measurable media.

==Demographics==
{{expand section|date=April 2011}}

The [[demographic]] of a particular show's audience is also measured. This is often notated in an abbreviated form,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcuniversal.presscentre.com/content/detail.aspx?newsareaid=2&amp;releaseid=1827 NBC Universal Press release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923112949/http://www.nbcuniversal.presscentre.com/content/detail.aspx?newsareaid=2&amp;releaseid=1827 |date=September 23, 2010 }}, accessed 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g.:

* P2+    = Persons aged 2 or more
* P12–34 = Persons aged 12 to 34
* P18–49 = Persons aged 18 to 49
* A18–34 = Adults aged 18 to 34
* Men 18–34
* Women 18–34

==Ratings point==

Ratings point is a measure of viewership of a particular [[television programme]].

One single [[television]] ratings point (Rtg or TVR) represents 1% of television households in the surveyed area in a given minute. As of 2004, there are an estimated 109.6 million television households in the [[United States]]. Thus, a single national ratings point represents 1%, or 1,096,000 television households for the 2004–05 season. When used for the broadcast of a program, the average rating across the duration of the show is typically given. Ratings points are often used for specific demographics rather than just households. For example, a ratings point among the key 18- to 49-year-olds demographic is equivalent to 1% of all 18- to 49-year-olds in the country.

A Rtg/TVR is different from a share point in that it is the percentage of all possible households, while a share point is 1% of all households watching television at the time. Hence the share of a broadcast is often significantly higher than the rating, especially at times when overall TV viewing is low. A low TRP can have an adverse effect on a TV program eventually leading to its closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://tech-bie.blogspot.com/2011/06/what-is-television-rating-point-trp.html |title=What is Television Rating Point TRP ? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830142418/http://tech-bie.blogspot.com/2011/06/what-is-television-rating-point-trp.html |archivedate=2011-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GRPs/TRPs===
[[Gross rating point]]s (GRPs) or [[target rating point]]s (TRPs) are chiefly used to measure the performance of TV-based advertising campaigns, and are the sum of the TVRs of each commercial spot within the campaign. An ad campaign might require a certain number of GRPs among a particular demographic across the duration of the campaign. The GRP of a campaign is equal to the percentage of people who saw, multiplied by the average number of spots that these viewers saw.  Targeted Rating Points are a refinement of GRPs to express the reach time frequency of only the most likely prospects. For example, if a campaign buys 150 GRPs for a television spot, but only half of that audience is actually in the market for the campaign's product, then the TRP would be stated as 75 to calculate the net effective buy [https://web.archive.org/web/20090611172153/http://forum.researchinfo.com/showthread.php?t=1217].

Gross rating point, a standard measure in advertising, it measures advertising impact. It is a percent of the target market reached multiplied by the exposure frequency. Thus, a program which advertises to 30% of the target market and gives them 4 exposures, will have 120 GRP.

GRPs as a measure has some limitations. People like to think of it as a measure of impact, but that is really overstated. Impact should measure sales; this measures exposures, which is in fact assumed not actual exposures.

* Basics of TAM (television advertising measurement):

'''Universe''': Universe is the total or actual number of people in a defined target audience.

'''Reach''': Reach is the number of individuals from the universe who are exposed to the medium or vehicle.

Reach is normally expressed in terms of % (percentages)

* Calculation of reach:

If universe is: 1,000,000 individuals (this is approx. data, it is usually defined through sampling through people-meter):

For a single episode of a program (30 minutes or 1 hour)
If out of above 1,000,000 of individuals 600,000 saw at least 1 minute of programme then:

Reach = (600,000/1,000,000) x 100

Reach = 60%

Variations of the reach concept:

;'''Gross reach''':
Gross reach is the summation of all audiences who have been exposed to the vehicle.
* Week 1: 1,000
* Week 2: 2,000
* Week 3: 1,500
* Week 4: 1,200
* Hence, gross reach = Week 1 + Week 2 + Week 3 + Week 4
* Gross reach = 5,700

;'''Cumulative reach'''

{{disputed-section|date=January 2017}}
Cumulative reach: The audiences accumulate over the time
* The number of individuals within the TG who are exposed to the medium or vehicle over a certain period of time
* Total time = Total average minutes (universe) x Universe
* Total time/reach = Avg minutes viewers
* Net reach

;'''Net reach''': Net reach is the summation of all audiences who have been exposed to the vehicle and excludes the duplication of the viewership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moyano|first=Patricio|author2=Muñoz, Orlando|author3=Selman, Elias|title=Estimation method for media audience duplication|journal=ESOMAR Worldwide Audience Measurement Cross Media/Television Conference|date=2005|url=http://www.ibope.com.br/pt-br/conhecimento/artigospapers/Documents/05%20-%20Estimation%20method%20for%20media%20audience%20duplication%20-%20IBOPE%20Time%20Chile.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424120029/http://www.ibope.com.br/pt-br/conhecimento/artigospapers/Documents/05%20-%20Estimation%20method%20for%20media%20audience%20duplication%20-%20IBOPE%20Time%20Chile.pdf|archivedate=24 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* What is a '''TVR''' (television rating point):
TVR = Reach x Time spent

TVR = (minutes viewed/minutes available) + (minutes viewed / minutes available) /N  X100

N = Number of individuals

* '''Gross rating points''' (GRPs)
The sum of all ratings achieved in a campaign
GRP levels are generally measured and reported on a 4-week basis
It is a measure of the media plan's trust

* '''CPRP'''
Measurement used in planning a television media buy based on the cost of a commercial time slot and the rating of the program where the time slot is positioned. If, for example, the cost of a commercial time slot during prime time was 1000 and the program rating for that time was 10 (which means that 10% of the total potential audience was tuned to that program), then the cost per GRP would be 1000 divided by 10%, or 100. The CPRP measurement is a way of measuring the efficiency of media cost, as compared to measuring the cost per thousand (CPT) and is generally used when making comparisons of the various broadcast vehicles. When the actual buy is made, the advertiser will still want to know the cost of reaching people on a cost-per-thousand basis.

==Terminology==
The ratings industry breaks their statistics down in several ways, to express different measurements:

;Share
:The Share is the percentage of radio listeners tuned into a given station at a given time. For example – a "1.4 Share" means that 1.4% of all people listening to the radio at a specified time are tuned into the specified station or program.

;Rating
:Rating is the percentage of potential audience members – whether tuned into any program or not – who are tuned into a particular program or station at a given time.

;Cume
:Cume or Cumulative Audience is the number of unique people tuned into a program or station at a given time. Cume is usually expressed as the estimated number of listeners in any given quarter-hour.

;Average Quarter Hour (AQH)
{{Main|AQH Share}}
:The AQH figure is the average number of audience members during a typical quarter-hour (measured as quarters of the hour from :00 to :15, :15 to :30, :30 to :45, and :45 after the hour to the top of the hour, respectively.

;Time Spent Listening (TSL)
:The amount of time an average listener spends listening to the station or program before [[channel surfing]]. This measurement drives both the frequency of [[radio commercial]] breaks, as well as the station's programming strategy.  Stations whose [[radio format]]s tend to have short TSLs (music stations) as well as dayparts (see below) with short TSLs (morning drive time, for example) will have more frequent commercial breaks; formats and times with longer TSLs will schedule breaks less frequently.

===Demographics===
All of the other ratings are broken down by [[demographics]]. Stations that might have weak overall ("12+") demographics may have strong enough ratings within a given, desired "demographic" to be attractive to advertisers, and thus profitable.

For example, [[talk radio]] stations frequently have lower-than-average "12+" ratings, but much higher numbers among males age 35-54.  Since the 35-54 male demographic is highly coveted by advertisers, such a station can be quite profitable.

===Dayparts===
{{Main|Dayparting|Broadcast programming}}

In addition to demographics, a key breakdown in ratings is the "Daypart", or segment of the broadcast day.

In radio (and to a lesser extent television), the key dayparts are:
* Morning Drive: characterized by short TSLs (the time a person spends in their car) and, for the well-programmed station, high cumes, Morning Drive (usually from 5AM to around 9AM) is a key revenue generator.
* Mid-Mornings, Mid-Days: With lower listenership (measured by lower average quarter hours) but generally longer TSLs, the middle of the day is a place where stations frequently experiment with longer music, television programming, and longer [[television commercial]] sets.
* Afternoon Drive: Again, high listenership but short TSL, combined with a more-tired listenership that is driving home from work, combines to make afternoon drive time (usually from 3PM to 7PM) a time of short sweeps and, in talk radio, brief conversational snips.
* Evenings and Overnights: Lower listenership means lower revenues – but a standout program frequently can draw a niche audience that, if it shows up in the ratings book, can mean solid revenue.

==Criticisms==

There have been many criticisms of audience measurement. These criticisms tend to refer to methodological problems, sampling issues and reporting issues.

A major issue for media owners and advertisers is that the standard audience surveys only collect data on audience size and basic demographic composition. Audience quality is inferred from the demographic profile of an audience. However, current metrics fail to capture audience engagement. Increasingly advertisers are demanding better measures of media engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, pp 123-124&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, audience research methods generally were thrown into question with the arrival of [[new media]], especially digital media and changes to the public's media habits. [[People meter]]s, which recorded the household's viewing by noting the station to which a TV was tuned, failed to capture new viewing habits such as recording programs for playback at a later time or watching a [[podcast]] / download on another device such as a tablet or computer. The proliferation of new media has given consumers much greater control over where and when they access content. For instance, [[Video on Demand]] (VoD) enables consumers to decide ''when'' to watch programs while [[smartphone]]s enable consumers to decide ''where'' to access content.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, J., Phalen, P. and Lichty, L., "'Ratings Analysis: Audience Measurement and Analytics,''  New York, Routledge, 2014, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Media research companies have been forced to devise new methologies capable of tracking new and unprecedented viewing habits across a diverse range of different platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue which has presented challenges for media measurement is the consumer habit of ''[[media multitasking|simultaneous]] [[media consumption]]''. Modern audiences are often consuming multiple media at the same time. For example, a teeanger might be plugged into radio via earphones while working on the Internet, where he or she is scanning online newspapers and magazines. Thus the user may be consuming three or more media alternatives at the same time. Media research companies, which historically specialised in a single media such as radio or TV, were poorly equipped to respond to the challenge of simultaneous consumption across multiple platforms. However, media research is slowly devising methods designed to capture simultaneous media consumption habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/news/exclusive-simultaneous-media-rife-study-finds/51148|title=Exclusive: Simultaneous media use rife, new study finds|last=Cuneo|first=A.Z.|date=7 October 2002|work=AdAge|access-date=2018-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105123125/http://adage.com/article/news/exclusive-simultaneous-media-rife-study-finds/51148/|archive-date=2018-01-05|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timing of audience reports is a major issue for both the networks and advertisers. Data collected by people-meters is available on the morning after programs have aired. However, data collected by diary methods requires much more time to collate and analyse. Radio surveys, for example, which are still used for radio ratings in many countries, are normally only available on a quarterly basis. The time lag in reporting fails to provide advertisers with sufficient lead times to take corrective action during a campaign.

Other questions have been raised about diary-based data collection methods. The expectation that diarists participating in the radio sample will accurately record their listening at 15 minute intervals has been challenged by many analysts. Many analysts suspect that diarists only fill in their diaries at the end of each week, or perhaps less often which forces them to recall their radio usage thereby raising concerns about reliability. In addition the diary based method appears to inflate average audience size, because the total audience is captured by recording any person who was listening during a quarter-hour counts as listening for the entire duration, even if the actual time was just for a minute or two.

The process of surveying listeners for their preferences has also been criticised for its lack of flexibility. Listeners complain that modern radio lacks variety and depth but the measurement methods only facilitate further refinement of already minutely programmed formats rather than the overhaul that many listeners are asking for. Radio in the US, is where listeners hear their old favorites rather than are exposed to new music. Data obtained by some audience measurement methods is detailed to individual songs and how they are reacted to by each age, racial, and economic group the station is seeking to attract. This statistical approach leads to highly recognizable songs (such as those from [[the Beatles]]) which score well with a cross-section of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = Marc | authorlink = | title = Something in the Air | publisher = Random House | location = | pages = 271–277 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-375-50907-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/16/AR2007011601081.html|title=The Songs You Want to Hear|author=Fisher, Marc|publisher=The Washington Post|date=January 21, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113094159/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/16/AR2007011601081.html|archivedate=November 13, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement conferences==
The world's largest audience measurement conference, AM X.0, is presented annually by the [[Advertising Research Foundation]]. Each year, hundreds of attendees from around the world gather to hear a collection of experts speak on [[Social Media]], [[Mobile phone|Mobile]] and [[Multimedia|Cross-Platform]] issues.

==Measurement companies==

In most countries the advertising industry, via its peak [[industry association]]s, endorses a single media research company as the official provider of audience measurement. The methodology used by the official provider then becomes known as the ''industry currency'' in audience measurement. Industry members fund the audience research and share the findings.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, pp 119-120&lt;/ref&gt; In a few countries, where the industry is more fragmented or where there is no clear peak industry association, two or more competing organisations may provide audience measurement services. In such countries, there is said to be no industry currency.

Four basic methods of data collection are used to survey broadcast audiences, namely  interviews, diaries, meters or scanning and modelling. Research companies employ different methodologies depending on where  and  when  media is  used  and  the cost of data collection. All these methods involve  [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] – that is taking a representative sample of the population and recording their media usage which is then extrapolated to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kantar Group|Kantar Media]] network (including [[Taylor Nelson Sofres|TNS]]) currently measures TV, radio, and internet audiences in over 40 countries. [[Nielsen Media Research]] is also very active in the provision of radio survey data globally, collecting  TV audience measures in 27 countries, people meter technology in more than 58,000 homes. [[GfK]], a global market research company, provides similar Media Measurement services in Europe and other parts of the world.

* In [[Australia]], television ratings are collected by three main organizations. [[OzTAM]] serves [[metropolitan area]]s, Regional TAM serves regional areas serviced by three commercial networks.

==Early life and education==

Bernard Charlès was born and grew up in [[Brittany]], [[France]].

He is a graduate from the Ecole Normale Supérieure engineering school in Cachan ([[ENS Cachan]]) and has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[mechanical engineering]] majoring in [[automation engineering]] and [[information science]]. He also holds an [[agrégation]] — the most senior teaching qualification achievable in [[France]] (specializing in [[mechanical engineering]]).&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;[http://www.3ds.com/about-3ds/management/bernard-charles/], Bernard Charles, Creating the Future, Biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

Bernard Charlès joined [[Dassault Systèmes]] in 1983 to develop new design technology – less than two years after the company was created. In 1986 he founded a New Technologies, Research and Strategy department. In 1988 he was named to the position of President of Strategy, Research &amp; Development.

In 1989, he initiated the creation of the [[Digital mockup|digital mock-up]]  (DMU), complete virtual [[3D modeling|3D model]] of a product that replaced physical [[prototype]]s.

Charlès was appointed president and [[chief executive officer]] of [[Dassault Systèmes]] in September 1995. In 1996, he became a member of the [[board of directors]]. The same year he organized the [[Initial public offering|flotation]] of [[Dassault Systèmes]] on the [[stock market]].

In 2000, with the idea of [[Product lifecycle|Product Lifecycle Management]] (PLM), he extended the concept of the [[Digital mockup|digital mock-up]] to the entire lifecycle of a product. In parallel he made a series of acquisitions and brand creation: [[ENOVIA]] in 1998, DELMIA in 2000 and [[SIMULIA]] in 2005.
To reinforce the company’s business scope and sales capabilities, he decided to acquire [[SolidWorks]] in 1997, and to gain control of [[Dassault Systèmes]]’ entire distribution network, previously managed by [[IBM]].

In 2012, with '''3D'''EXPERIENCE, Charlès announced a new vision for the company based on the idea that 3D should also include the [[Computer simulation|simulation]] of the consumer experience. He set a specific purpose to “The '''3D'''EXPERIENCE Company”: “[[Dassault Systèmes]] provides business and people with '''3D'''EXPERIENCE universes to imagine sustainable innovations capable of harmonizing product, nature and life.”&lt;ref name="3DEXPERIENCE announcement"&gt;[http://www.3ds.com/press-releases/single/dassault-systemes-opens-new-horizons-with-3d-experience/?xtmc=%23all&amp;xtcr=56], Dassault Systèmes Opens New Horizons with '''3D'''EXPERIENCE, February 9, 2012,&lt;/ref&gt;

To support this ambition, he carried on an acquisition (Gemcom&lt;ref name="Gemcom"&gt;[http://www.3ds.com/press-releases/single/dassault-systemes-announces-gemcom-software-international-transaction-completed/?xtmc=GEOVIA_2012&amp;xtcr=41], Dassault Systèmes Announces Gemcom Software International Transaction Completed, July 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012, Apriso in 2013,&lt;ref name="Apriso"&gt;[http://www.3ds.com/press-releases/single/dassault-systemes-completes-apriso-acquisition/?xtmc=apriso&amp;xtcr=3], Dassault Systèmes Completes Apriso Acquisition, July 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; RTT,&lt;ref name="RTT"&gt;[http://www.3ds.com/press-releases/single/dassault-systemes-announces-the-completion-of-the-acquisition-of-a-84-controlling-interest-in-rea/?xtmc=RTT&amp;xtcr=4], Dassault Systèmes Announces the completion of the acquisition of a 84% controlling interest in Realtime Technology AG, January 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quintiq]]&lt;ref name="Quintiq"&gt;[http://www.3ds.com/press-releases/single/dassault-systemes-completes-quintiq-acquisition/?xtmc=quintiq&amp;xtcr=2], Dassault Systèmes Completes Quintiq Acquisition, September 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Accelrys]]&lt;ref name="Accelrys"&gt;[http://www.3ds.com/press-releases/single/dassault-systemes-successfully-completes-tender-offer-for-accelrys/?xtmc=accelrys&amp;xtcr=3], Dassault Systèmes Successfully Completes Tender Offer for Accelrys, April 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014) and diversification strategy with 3DSWYM for [[social innovation]], [[Exalead|EXALEAD]] and [[Netvibes|NETVIBES]] for data intelligence, GEOVIA in the [[Natural resource|Natural Resources]] sector, [[3dvia|3DVIA]] for a B2C approach, BIOVIA&lt;ref name="BIOVIA"&gt;[http://www.3ds.com/press-releases/single/dassault-systemes-introduces-biovia-combines-accelrys-and-bioplm-powered-by-the-3dexperience-pla/?xtmc=accelrys&amp;xtcr=2], Dassault Systèmes Introduces BIOVIA; Combines Accelrys and BioPLM, Powered by the 3DEXPERIENCE Platform, May 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; for virtual [[biosphere]] and materials, and 3DEXCITE&lt;ref name="3DEXCITE"&gt;[http://www.3ds.com/press-releases/single/rtt-becomes-3dexcite-dassault-systemes-brand-to-power-marketing-in-the-age-of-experience/?xtmc=3DEXCITE&amp;xtcr=42], RTT Becomes 3DEXCITE, Dassault Systèmes’ Brand to Power Marketing in the Age of Experience, May 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; for real-time, high-end visualizations.&lt;ref name="Profile" /&gt;

In May 2016, he was named vice-president of the board of directors of Dassault Systèmes, of which he had become member in 1993.&lt;ref name="Profile" /&gt;

Since May 2015, Bernard Charlès has been co-leading the French [[government]] project “Industry of the Future”.

Troutwine earned his BA from [[Arizona State University]] at nineteen, and went on to earn a JD from the [[University of Missouri]], graduating with honors, an [[MBA]] from the [[Yale School of Management]], and received a master's degree in Public Administration from the [[Harvard Kennedy School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veritasprep.com/meet-the-team/|title=Meet the Team - Veritas Prep|first=|last=VeritasPrep|website=www.veritasprep.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==

While at Yale, Troutwine and [[Markus Moberg]], launched [[Veritas Prep]], a GMAT preparation and MBA admissions consulting company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2009/04/23/qa-som-grads-find-success-in-test-prep/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918224624/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2009/04/23/qa-som-grads-find-success-in-test-prep/ |archivedate=2012-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/node/53396|title=A Devilish time on tap in NCAAs|first=Jennifer|last=Scuteri|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Veritas Prep has become the world's largest privately owned test preparation and admissions consulting company, and now prepares students for the [[SAT]], [[ACT (test)|ACT]], and [[GRE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veritasprep.com/blog/|title=GMAT Prep - SAT Prep - Admissions Consulting - Veritas Prep Blog|website=www.veritasprep.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Codecasa''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] luxury [[super yacht]] building firm, founded in [[Viareggio]] by Giovanni Battista Codecasa in 1825.

==History==
The shipyard Codecasa was created by Giovanni Battista Codecasa in 1825.

In 2010, Codecasa launched the superyacht Lady Lau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designcurial.com/news/codecasa-launches-65m-lady-lau-superyacht Codecasa launches the 65m Lady Lau Superyacht], ''Designcurial.com'', 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
[[File:Lady_Lau_super-yacht_IMO_1010674_Bonifacio.jpg|thumbnail|The superyacht M/Y ''Lady Lau'' built in 2010 at Codecasa shipyard in Viareggio]]
The company possesses a [[shipyard]] which allows them to build steel/aluminium or entirely aluminium vessels between 30 metres (98 feet) and 90 metres (295 feet) in length.  The shipyard is situated in one of the port of Viareggio's oldest docks, covering an area in excess of 6500 square meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codecasayachts.com/en/codecasa/our-history/|title=Our history|publisher=Codecasa|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shipyard is also equipped with repairing and refitting of motor and sailing yachts.

The company is responsible for many luxury yachts around the [[Mediterranean sea]]. Former clients include billionaires such as [[Mohammed Al-Fayed]] who bought his yacht the ''[[Sokar (yacht)|Sokar]]'', originally built in 1990 as the Jonikal, in the spring of 1997.&lt;ref name="st"&gt;[http://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/details/342/ Superyacht Times]&lt;/ref&gt; It has a length of 208 ft 3 inches (63.5 metres) making it the 89th largest yacht in the world in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yachts.monacoeye.com/yachtsbysize/pages/sokar01.html Monaco Eye]&lt;/ref&gt;

Codecasa Yachts was awarded “Best Design” in the large motor yacht category by Yachts Magazine for their 164-foot range of yachts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boatworld.com/?sub=Codecasa Codecasa Yachts], ''Boatworld.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The software was written by Professor [[Nigel Howard (professor)|Nigel Howard]] for General [[Rupert Smith]] in 1996.]]
'''Confrontation analysis''' (also known as '''dilemma analysis''') is an [[operational analysis]] technique used to structure, understand and think through multi-party interactions such as negotiations. It is the underpinning mathematical basis of [[drama theory]]. 

It is derived from [[game theory]] but considers that instead of resolving the game, the players often redefine the game when interacting. Emotions triggered from the potential interaction play a large part in this redefinition. So whereas game theory looks on an interaction as a single decision matrix and resolves that, confrontation analysis looks on the interaction as a sequence of linked interactions, where the decision matrix changes under the influence of precisely defined emotional ''dilemmas''.&lt;ref name="dilemm"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=17 definition of Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation and use==

Confrontation analysis was devised by Professor [[Nigel Howard (professor)|Nigel Howard]] in the early 1990s drawing from his work on game theory and [[metagame analysis]]. It has been turned to defence,&lt;ref name="dw1"&gt;See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/the-future-of-libya/4553627902 The future of Libya]&lt;/ref&gt; political, legal, financial&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;"role playing... can also be used by investors in the form of "confrontation analysis' such as that organised by former military analyst [[Michael Young (former military analyst)|Mike Young's]] [http://www.decisionworkshops.com Decision Workshops]" –  ''Greek Dungeons and German Dragons'', James Macintosh, ''[[Financial Times]]'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and commercial &lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/letting-agency/4550567082 Letting agency case study]&lt;/ref&gt; applications.

Much of the theoretical background to General [[Rupert Smith]]'s book ''[[The Utility of Force]]'' drew its inspiration from the theory of confrontation analysis.{{quotation|I am in debt to Professor Nigel Howard, whose explanation of Confrontation Analysis and Game Theory at a seminar in 1998 excited my interest. Our subsequent discussions helped me to order my thoughts and the lessons I had learned into a coherent structure with the result that, for the first time, I was able to understand my experiences within a theoretical model which allowed me to use them further|General Rupert Smith|[[The Utility of Force]] (p.xvi)}}

Confrontation analysis can also be used in a ''decision workshop'' as structure to support role-playing&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; for training, analysis and decision rehearsal.

== Method ==
[[Image:BosniaConfrontation0.JPG|thumb|361px|left|An interaction as a sequence of confrontations where the ''card table''&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; changes as the parties struggle to eliminate their ''dilemmas''&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt;]]
Confrontation analysis looks on an interaction as a sequence of confrontations. During each confrontation the parties communicate until they have made their ''positions''&lt;ref name="posn"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=29 definition of Position]&lt;/ref&gt; clear to one another.  These positions can be expressed as a ''card table'' (also known as an options board&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=29 definition of Options Board/Card table]&lt;/ref&gt;) of yes/no decisions. For each decision each party communicates what they would like to happen (their ''position''&lt;ref name="posn"/&gt;) and what will happen if they cannot agree (the ''threatened future''). These interactions produce ''dilemmas''&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt; and the ''card table'' changes as players attempt to eliminate these.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation1.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Initial Card Table:&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The UN threatens to use air strikes, but is not believed by the Bosnian Serbs: The UN has three dilemmas&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt; The Bosnians have none]]
Consider the example on the [[:File:BosniaConfrontation2.JPG|right]] (Initial Card Table), taken from the [[Bosnian War#1995|1995 Bosnian Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;This example developed from that described in [[Rupert Smith|Smith R]], Tait A, Howard N (1999) [http://www.decisionmechanics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/warandpeace.pdf Confrontations in War and Peace]. ''Proceedings of the 6th international Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium'', U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, 19–20 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This represents an interaction between the Bosnian Serbs and the United Nations forces over the safe areas. The [[Bosnian Serbs]] had [[Bosniak]] enclaves surrounded and were threatening to attack.

Each side had a position as to what they wanted to happen:

The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column):
* To be able to attack the enclaves
* NOT to withdraw their heavy weapons from the enclaves
* For the UN NOT to use air strikes
The UN wanted (See 5th column):
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to attack the enclaves
* The Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to take hostages.
If no further changes were made then what the sides were saying would happen was (see 1st column):
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would attack the enclaves
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would NOT withdraw their heavy weapons
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would take hostages if the UN uses air strikes
*The UN said it would initiate air strikes.  However the Bosnian Serbs DID NOT BELIEVE them. (Hence the question mark on the Card Table).

Confrontation analysis then specifies a number of precisely defined ''dilemmas''&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt; that occur to the parties following from the structure of the card tables.  It states that motivated by the desire to eliminate these dilemmas, the parties involved will CHANGE THE CARD TABLE, to eliminate their problem.

In the situation at the start the Bosnian Serbs have no dilemmas, but the UN has four. It has three ''persuasion dilemmas''&lt;ref name="pd"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=32 definition of Persuasion Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt; in that the Bosnian Serbs are not going to do the three things they want them to (not attack the enclaves, withdraw the heavy weapons and not take hostages). It also has a ''rejection dilemma''&lt;ref name="rd"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=40 definition of Rejection Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt; in that the Bosnian Serbs do not believe they will actually use the air strikes, as they think the UN will submit to their position, for fear of having hostages taken.

Faced with these dilemmas, the UN modified the card table to eliminate its dilemmas.  It took two actions:

Firstly, it withdrew its forces from the positions where they were vulnerable to being taken hostage.  This action eliminated the Bosnian Serbs' option (card) of taking hostages.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation2.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Second Card Table:&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The UN eliminated the Bosnian "hostage" card and brought in an additional, credible "Artillery" card, changing the situation in their favour: The Bosnian Serbs now have two ''persuasion dilemmas''&lt;ref name="pd"/&gt; and two ''rejection dilemmas''&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt;]]
Secondly, with the addition of the [[Rapid Reaction Force]], and in particular its artillery the UN had an additional capability to engage Bosnian Serb weapons; they added the card "Use artillery against Bosnian Serbs". Because of this, the UN's threat of air strikes became more credible.  The situation changed to that of the Second Card Table:

The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column):
* To be able to attack the enclaves
* NOT to withdraw heavy weapons from the enclaves
* For the UN NOT to use air strikes
* For the UN NOT to use artillery
The UN wanted (See 5th column):
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to attack the enclaves
* The Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons
If no further changes were made then what the sides were saying would happen was (see 1st column):
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would attack the enclaves, but the UN did not believe them.
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would NOT withdraw their heavy weapons, but the UN did not believe them.
*The UN said it would use artillery.  The Bosnian Serbs believed this.
*The UN said it would use air strikes.  This time, however, the Bosnian Serbs believed them.

Faced with this new situation, the Bosnian Serbs modified their position to accept the UN proposal.  The final table was an agreement as shown in the Final Card table (see thumbnail and picture).

Confrontation analysis does not necessarily produce a win-win solution (although end states are more likely to remain stable if they do); however, the word ''confrontation'' should not necessarily imply that any negotiations should be carried out in an aggressive way.

The ''card tables'' or are isomorphic to [[game theory]] models, but are not built with the aim of finding a ''solution''. Instead, the aim is to find the dilemmas facing characters and so help to predict how they will change the table itself. Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters.

Sometimes analysis of the ticks and crosses can be supported by values showing the payoff to each of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/the-tables-in-a-decision-works/4557003218 understanding the tables used in confrontation analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4073">The '''Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics''' (CWP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/fishery/cwp Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; provides a mechanism to coordinate fishery statistical programmes of regional fishery bodies and other inter-governmental organizations with a remit for fishery statistics.

== Main function ==
Functional since 1960, the CWP's purpose is to:
* continually review fishery statistics requirements for research, policy-making and management;
* agree on standard concepts, definitions, classifications and methodologies for the collection and collation of fishery statistics;
* make proposals for the coordination and streamlining of statistical activities among relevant intergovernmental organizations. 

== Legal Framework ==
Established by resolution 23/59 of the [[FAO]] Conference under Article VI-2 of the Organization's Constitution at its Tenth Session in 1959. The Statutes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w0036e/w0036e0c.htm#ANNEX%202%20Statutes Statutes]&lt;/ref&gt; of CWP were amended and approved by the [[FAO]] Council at its Hundred and Eighth Session in June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w0036e/w0036e0c.htm#ANNEX%203%20Rules%20of%20Procedure Rules of Procedure]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participating Organizations ==
The CWP is composed of experts nominated by intergovernmental organizations which have a competence in fishery statistics. There are currently 17 participating organizations in the CWP:
* Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)
* [http://www.ccsbt.org/ Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT)]
* [http://www.fao.org/ Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)]

== Secretariat ==
The FAO serves as the CWP Secretariat. The CWP meets in full session approximately every two years and carries out intersessional and ad hoc meetings as required.

== Geographical Coverage ==
Although first mandated to cover North Atlantic fisheries, since 1995 the CWP has extended its remit to all marine water bodies.

}}'''Héctor Daniel Lalín''', generally known as '''Daniel Lalín''',&lt;ref name=cron&gt;{{cite web| title =Lalin se asocia a una empresa china para entrar al negocio petrolero| work =Cronista| date =Nov 9, 2006| url = http://www.cronista.com/impresageneral/Lalin-se-asocia-a-una-empresa-china-para-entrar-al-negocio-petrolero-20060912-0072.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] businessman and accountant with close ties to the ruling [[Nestor Kirchner|Kirchner family]]. He was the president of Racing Club, a professional sports club based in the Avellaneda district of [[Buenos Aires]], from 1995 to 1999, and is a major figure in the Argentine [[oil]] business.

==Early life and education==
Born around 1950, Lalín was a member of [[Montonero]], the youth wing of the [[Peron]]ist left. In 1999, as head of Racing, he described himself as still being “ideologically” a member of Montonero, despite all his wealth and success.&lt;ref name=old&gt;{{cite web| title =Sigo siendo un Montonero| work =Ole| url = http://old.ole.com.ar/diario/1999/01/06/r-03501b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In the mid 1970s, Lalín was [[Dean of the Faculty]] of [[Economics]] at the [[National University of Lomas de Zamora]].&lt;ref name=old/&gt; He later served as treasurer of the city of Buenos Aires during the administration of [[Carlos Grosso]] (1989–92).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pagina12.com.ar/1999/99-10/99-10-08/PAG27.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; During his term as city treasurer, Lalín and his old friend [[Daniel Peralta]], who at the time was the director of Argentina’s central bank and a close friend of Argentinian president Néstor Kirchner, won [[oil exploration]] leases from the Kirchner government, despite not having any experience in that field required under Argentine law.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite web| last =Nelson| first =Jerry| title =Argentina President Mulls Resignation| work =Guardian Liberty Voice| date =Mar 6, 2014| url = http://guardianlv.com/2014/03/argentina-president-mulls-resignation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite web| last =Smith| first =Michael; Pablo Gonzales| title =Argentina Oil’s Bonanza Helping Too Few Led by Political Friends| work =Bloomberg| date =Mar 5, 2014| url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-06/argentina-oil-s-bonanza-helping-too-few-led-by-political-friends.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his election as president of Racing Club, Lalín also pursued a “successful career in [[real estate]] and construction.”&lt;ref name="racing"/&gt;

===Racing Club===
Lalín was president of Racing Club, also known as [[Racing Club de Avellaneda]] or simply as Racing, from 1995 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asteriscos.tv/noticia-15677.html&lt;/ref&gt; The club was the favorite of President Néstor Kirchner. During his years at Racing Club, according to one source, Lalín became part of a social circle that included “Menemistas” [[Daniel Vila]] and [[José Luis Manzano]] and “‘K’ front men” [[Cristóbal López (businessman)|Cristóbal López]] and [[Lázaro Báez]].&lt;ref name="pcr"/&gt;

During Lalín’s tenure, Racing Club experienced a financial crisis. Some sources described him as the latest in a series of incompetent and/or corrupt presidents of Racing Club, suggesting that his purchase of several expensive top-level players precipitated the crisis.&lt;ref name=racing&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/racing-against-time-165010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taringa.net"&gt;http://www.taringa.net/posts/deportes/4344852/Daniel-Lalin-Lo-primero-que-haria-en-Racing-es-r.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Newsweek'', the major factor in Racing Club’s financial decline was the fact that it had, under Lalín, “stopped developing young talent in favor of recruiting high-priced stars – often using peculiar financing.” ''Newsweek'' noted that Lalín himself was Racing’s biggest creditor, having “pumped $2.5 million of his own money into Racing to keep it afloat, sometimes in exchange for rights to players.”&lt;ref name=racing/&gt;

In 1998, Lalín, a priest, and some 500 fans took part in an elaborate “[[exorcism]]” ceremony with the intention of banishing evil spirits from Racing Club.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/87846-con-una-fiesta-racing-quiere-renovar-la-fe&lt;/ref&gt; “We are uniting [[Roman Catholicism]] with Racingism,” Lalín explained. “It is an act of faith. The same faith displayed by the fans who stoically go to the stadium every Sunday.”&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9802/15/argentina.exorcism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Lalín filed for [[bankruptcy]] on behalf of Racing Club on July 10, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201403/55907-daniel-lalin-si-blanco-se-quiere-juntar-conmigo-no-hay-problema.html&lt;/ref&gt; When he announced the bankruptcy, fans reacted with outrage. Some hurled stones at him,&lt;ref name="racing"/&gt; and one person threw a drum at him, causing an injury to his nose. More than 1500 fans “called for his head.”&lt;ref&gt;http://edant.clarin.com/diar io/1999/03/05/r-05301d.ht m&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/mar/13/newsstory.sport16&lt;/ref&gt; He defended the bankruptcy, calling it “the best way out.”&lt;ref name="pagina12.com.ar"&gt;http://www.pagina12.com.ar/1998/98-07/98-07-20/bue05.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, 1998, Judge [[Enrique Gorostegui]] officially declared Racing bankrupt.&lt;ref name=litoral&gt;http://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/id_um/36326&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, 1999, the Court of Appeals of [[La Plata]] ordered the immediate liquidation of all of Racing’s assets. Racing, it was announced, had “ceased to exist.”&lt;ref name=litoral/&gt; On May 5, 1999, Lalín and his executive committee submitted their resignations.&lt;ref name=litoral/&gt; At the time Lalín left the club, it had $62 million in debts, 200 judgments against it, and 3 million pesos in [[lien]]s.&lt;ref name="pcr"/&gt; After the club went bankrupt, it was bailed out by the Kirchner government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Cabot| first =Diego| title =Llegaron los nuevos dueños del petróleo| work =La Nacion| date =Jan 6, 2008| url = http://www.lanacion.com.ar/976601-llegaron-los-nuevos-duenos-del-petroleo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 1999, prosecutor [[Manuel Barreiro]] issued arrest warrants for Lalín and former Racing presidents [[Osvaldo Otero]] and [[Juan De Stéfano]] in connection with charges of mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;http://old.ole.com.ar/diario/1999/10/22/r-01501d.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Lalín was taken into custody, and he and De Stéfano spent 14 days in detention in a police station in Lanús.&lt;ref name=litoral/&gt; The charges against him were dropped and he was released. In November 2000, De Stéfano claimed on a [[Fox Sports]] program that during the time he and Lalín had been in jail together, Lalín had told him that the dismissal of charges against him, Lalín, had “cost him 200 thousand dollars.” De Stéfano described Lalín’s acquittal as an example of the importance of political favors in “the city of Buenos Aires, the palace of corruption.” Otero said of Lalín that high-level “radical leaders” were “doing everything possible to save him.”&lt;ref&gt;http://old.clarin.com.ar/diario/2000/11/02/d-01001.htm&lt;/ref&gt; De Stéfano blamed both Lalín and Otero for the bankruptcy of Racing Club, which he called “a scam, a lie, immoral, and a disgrace.” De Stéfano claimed that “the club is run by scoundrels,” and urged the judge in the case to conduct a serious investigation that would drive “the Mafia” out of Racing management.&lt;ref name="pagina12.com.ar"/&gt;

Lalín himself also declared personal bankruptcy in 1998 following a request by former Racing coach [[Carlos Babington]], to whom he owed $600,000. They had worked out a payment deal but Lalín had reneged on it. Critics claimed that he owed $8 million and accused him of fraudulent management. It was noted that he actually had “nothing to his name” and held all his assets through companies. “Fiscally he doesn’t exist,” an attorney stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Avallaned| first =Daniel| title =Daniel Lalín y esa palabra, quiebra| work =Clarin| date =| url = http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1998/10/15/r-00801d.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Racing Club===
After leaving Racing Club, Lalín entered the oil business and became very successful in a short period.

A 2001 [[U.S. Senate]] report stated that Lalín had engaged in player transactions through Mercado Abierto SA and MA – House Exchange, both subsidiaries of the [[Cayman Islands]]-based Grupo Mercado Abierto, which was owned by three Lalín associates, [[Miguel Iribarne]], [[Aldo Ducler]], and [[Hector Scasserra]]. The Senate report linked Group Mercado Abierto to the [[Juarez drug cartel]] and identified it as a vehicle for laundering bribes and drug-trafficking profits. When Lalín filed a lawsuit in 2004 in [[Uruguay]] against businessman [[Adrián Troche]], on a matter involving player transactions, only to withdraw the suit shortly thereafter, a Uruguayan news source suggested that he had probably withdrawn it because he realized that he would have had to explain to the Uruguayan judiciary why his payments in the transactions in question had been made through Grupo Mercado Abierto.

Also in 2004, it was reported that there were “very strong indications” that player transfers and other activities by Lalín were tied up with money laundering in Uruguayan football. In addition, it was reported that funds paid to Lalín as part of several player transactions had not ended up in the club treasury but rather in Mercado Abierto SA and MA – House Rates accounts at the [[Bank of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espectador.com/ sociedad/20083/denuncian- maniobras-contables-con-tra nsferencias-de-futbolistas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ir21&gt;{{cite web| title =Lalín no quiso responder la denuncia del narcobanco| work =LaRed 21| date =Jun 23, 2004| url = http://www.lr21.com.uy/deportes/145390-lalin-no-quiso-responder-la-denuncia-del-narcobanco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One 2004 report indicated that Lalín had engaged in business operations that enabled him to skirt hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax payments.&lt;ref name=ir21/&gt; Another report the same year stated that Lalín had “evaded nearly two million dollars in taxes.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espectador.com/sociedad/20083/denuncian-maniobras-contables-con-transferencias-de-futbolistas&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, it was reported that Lalín was “seeking his place in la Argentina K” – in other words, in the business circles surrounding the Kirchners. Through a holding company, Lalín Global Group, he closed a deal in that year with the Chinese firm JHP, which had subsidiaries in [[Libya]] and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name=cron/&gt; One source states that Lalín, via his firm Maxipetrol-Petroleros de Occidente, turned himself into “a local intermediary of the two Chinese corporations JHP International Petroleum Engineering and New Times Energy Corporation” and became “a pivot in the Chinese appropriation of [Argentinian] oil.”&lt;ref name=pcr&gt;http://www.pcr.org.ar/nota/política-nacional/salta-petr%C3%B3leo-usurpaci%C3%B3n-desmonte-y-represi%C3%B3n&lt;/ref&gt;

In association with JHP, Lalín formed [[Oxipetrol]], a multinational oil exploration firm,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perfil.com/politica/Empresarios-cercanos-al-Gobierno-entran-al-negocio-del-petroleo-con-la-venia-oficial-20070130-0064.html&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2006. The plan was for the Argentinian partners to contribute familiarity with the local market, while the Chinese contributed scientific expertise. It was reported in that year that Lalín had other Chinese business contacts, and that he was serving as the regional representative of Shenzhen Our International Technology &amp; Science, a developer of medical technology.&lt;ref name=cron/&gt; One article described him as an “intermediary in the Kircherist ‘strategic association’ with Chinese monopolies.”&lt;ref name=pcr/&gt;

Another 2006 report identified Lalín and his friend José Luis Manzano Menem, a former Interior Minister, as “two of the leading exponents of an unexpected transformation in the energy world” on account of their large investments in oil exploration. Involved with them in these activities, it was reported, were “K businessman” Cristóbal López and [[Roberto Monti]]. (“K businessman,” “K politician,” and similar labels are Argentinian shorthand for persons with close connections to the Kirchner regime.) The four men were described as “emerging national oil bourgeoisie.”&lt;ref name=pag1229&gt;{{cite web| last =Candelaresi| first =Cledis| title =Lalín y Manzano, nueva burguesía petrolera| work =Pagina12| url = http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-75340-2006-10-29.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same article stated that Lalín and media entrepreneur [[Daniel Vila]] had jointly made “inroads into the territory of ‘K governor’ [[Julio Cobos]]” (who at the time was governor of Mendoza province), together proffering a successful bid for the firm Aguas de Mendoza and an unsuccessful bid for the energy company Edemsa.&lt;ref name=pag1229/&gt;

A 2007 article described Oxipetrol as performing successfully.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cronista.com/impresageneral/Lalin-debuta-en-el-mercado-petrolero-20070125-0043.html&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, South American Hedge Fund LLC, a subsidiary of Arizona-based Delta Mutual, Inc., paid the Kirchner administration $1.7 million for drilling rights to oil fields owned by Oxipetrol. The next year, Lalín’s friend Peralta and Peralta’s wife, Laura, bought a controlling interest in Delta, through which they sold and purchased oil leases. In 2007, Oxipetrol’s oil fields were valued at $2.7 million; two years later, New Times Group Holdings, based in [[Hong Kong]], bought 60 percent of two of the oil fields for $270 million. In November 2012, Peralta and his wife, Laura, were found shot to death in their home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]. Although the deaths were ruled a murder-suicide, some individuals close to the couple suggested that their death was connected to their oil activities.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

It was reported in 2008 that Lalín was still hoping to regain control of Racing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asteriscos.tv/n oticia-15677.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.don-patadon.c om/2008/12/daniel-lalin-q uiero-volver-ser_4074.htm l&lt;/ref&gt; When he sought re-election to the presidency of the club, he received only about 500 votes, which he considered “a hard blow to his pride.”&lt;ref name=24con&gt;{{cite web| last =Rodriguez| first =Gaston| title =Daniel Lalín: "Haría un gran esfuerzo para lleva a la `bruja Verón´ a Racing"| work =Conurbano| url = http://24con.infonews.com/conurbano/nota/33724-Daniel-Lal%EDn-Har%EDa-un-gran-esfuerzo-para-lleva-a-la-bruja-Ver%F3n%B4-a-Racing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lalín said in March 2013 that he was still “very involved in the politics of Racing,” that he talked frequently with “the people at Racing,” and that it was hurtful to him that some people believe he had “stolen” from Racing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OENexZoFU0I&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013 he reiterated his desire to resume control of Racing and harshly criticized its current management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infobae.com/2013/09/03/1506377-daniel-lalin-racing-es-un-delirio-debe-mas-180-millones-pesos&lt;/ref&gt;

“I had a lot of luck,” Lalín stated in an interview from 2010, referring to a profit of $63 million he had earned the previous year.&lt;ref name="taringa.net"/&gt; A 2014 report by ''Bloomberg News'' identified Lalín as one of several Kirchner intimates who had benefited from the illegal awarding of oil leases. Lalín acknowledged that he had obtained the leases through contacts. “Contacts are everything in Peronism,” he said. “Oil experience helps, but the contacts are what matters.”&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

==Personal life==
As of 2008, Lalín was involved with a personal trainer named Laura.&lt;ref name=24con/&gt;

'''Downtown Montreal''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada.

Located in the borough of [[Ville-Marie, Montreal|Ville-Marie]], the district is situated on the southernmost slope of [[Mount Royal]].

The downtown region houses many corporate headquarters as well a large majority of the city's [[skyscraper]]s — which, by law, cannot be greater in height than Mount Royal in order to preserve the aesthetic predominance and intimidation factor of the mountain. The two tallest of these are the [[1000 de La Gauchetière]] and [[1250 René-Lévesque]], both of which were built in 1992. The [[Tour de la Bourse]] is also a significant high-rise and is home to the [[Montreal Exchange]] that trades in [[derivative market|derivatives]]. The Montreal Exchange was originally a [[stock exchange]] and was the first in Canada. In 1999, all stock trades were transferred to [[Toronto]] in exchange for an exclusivity in the derivative trading market.

[[Place Ville-Marie]], an [[I. M. Pei]]-designed [[cruciform]] office tower built in 1962, sits atop an underground shopping mall that forms the nexus of Montreal's [[Underground City, Montreal|underground city]], the world's largest, with indoor access to over 1,600 shops, restaurants, offices, businesses, museums and universities, as well as [[List of Montreal metro stations|metro stations]], train stations, bus terminals, and tunnels extending all over downtown. The central axis for downtown is [[Saint Catherine Street]], Canada's busiest commercial avenue. The area includes high end retail such as the [[Holt Renfrew]] and [[Ogilvy (Montreal)|Ogilvy]] [[department store]]s as well as [[Les Cours Mont-Royal]] shopping centre. Other major streets include [[Sherbrooke Street]], [[Peel Street, Montreal|Peel]], [[Mountain Street|de la Montagne]], [[De Maisonneuve Boulevard|de Maisonneuve]] and [[Crescent Street|Crescent]].

The skyline may be observed from one of two [[Overlook|lookouts]] on Mount Royal. The lookout at the [[Belvedere (structure)|Belvedere]] takes in downtown, the river, and the [[Monteregian Hills]]. On clear days the [[Adirondack Mountains]] of [[Upstate New York]] are visible (the [[great-circle distance]] between Mount Royal and the U.S. border along a [[wikt:beeline|bee line]] normal to the border being only ~ 56&amp;nbsp;km, or ~ 35 miles), as are the [[Green Mountains]] of [[Vermont]]. The eastern lookout has a view of [[The Plateau]] neighbourhood, [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] and beyond.

Downtown Montreal is also home to the main campuses of [[McGill University]] and [[UQAM]] and the Sir [[Quartier Concordia|George Williams campus]] of [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/maps/ "Campus Maps"], "McGill University".

He married Lucy Parr in 1876.&lt;ref name=stoo2&gt;{{cite book|title=Den kongelige norske Sankt Olavs Orden 1847-1947|first=O. Delphin|last=Amundsen|page=251|year=1947|publisher=Grøndahl|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son [[Westye Parr Egeberg]] was a notable landowner. Through their daughter Esther Lucy Egeberg he was grandfather of painter and writer [[Ferdinand Finne]].&lt;ref name=snl-egeberg&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Egeberg|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Egeberg|editor=Henriksen, Petter|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Tolga, Norway|Tolga]] in 1921, aged 78.&lt;ref name=stoo/&gt;

==Career==
Egeberg was a naval officer from 1863, and served in the British [[Royal Navy]] from 1865. He was [[first lieutenant]] [[à la suite]] from 1874, and discharged in 1875.&lt;ref name=stoo/&gt; Together with his brother Einar, he took over his family's [[Oslo|Christiania]]-based timber company [[Westye Egeberg &amp; Co]] in 1874, after the death of their father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Egeberg, Einar Westye|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|editor=Bull, Edvard |editor-link=Edvard Bull, Sr. |editor2=[[Einar Jansen|Jansen, Einar]]|edition=1st|first=S.

He served as [[Chamberlain (office)|Cabinet Chamberlain]] ({{lang-sv|kabinettskammarherre}}) for [[Oscar II of Sweden]] from 1887 to 1905.&lt;ref name=stoo/&gt;

Egeberg was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] in 1891. He was a Commander, First Class of the Danish [[Order of the Dannebrog]], Knight Grand Officer of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]], Officer of the French [[Légion d'honneur]], Commander of the Spanish [[Order of Charles III]], Knight Grand Officer of the Spanish [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] and the Swedish [[Order of the Polar Star]], and recipient of 
[[King Oscar II]]'s Anniversary Medal.&lt;ref name=stoo/&gt;

==Egebergs Ærespris==
Upon his 75th birthday in 1917, Egeberg donated {{NOK|10,000|lk=yes}} to the sports association [[Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports|Norges Riksforbund for Idræt]]. The donation was basis for the sports prize ''[[Egebergs Ærespris|Kabinetskammerherre Egebergs ærespris for alsidig idrett]]''. According to the original statutes approved in 1920, the fund's interests should be used for a stauette given to a sportsperson who, during the last two years, had excelled in one sport and also showed eminent performances in another, completely different sport. Egeberg also funded a design competition for the trophy, won by sculptor [[Magnus Vigrestad]]. The statuette became regarded as the highest achievement in Norwegian sport at the time. The first prize was awarded for 1918.&lt;ref name=ni-100&gt;{{cite book|title=Norsk idrett gjennom hundre år|first=Gunnar|last=Nordahl|first2=Odd|last2=Tyrihjell|pages=167–68|year=1961|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutes have changed slightly over the years. Today the prize is awarded by the [[Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports]], and given to Norwegian sports people who have excelled nationally in at least two sports, and excelled internationally in at least one of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Egebergs ærespris|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|first=Rolf|last=Bryhn|url=http://www.snl.no/Egebergs_%C3%A6respris|editor=Henriksen, Petter|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behrend's research focused primarily on labour and [[industrial relations]], in particular the interrelationships between [[economics]] and [[psychology]] in understanding how people operate at work.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawkins|first=Peter|title=Book Reviews : Problems of Labour and Inflation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002218568602800120|journal=Journal of Industrial Relations|volume=28|issue=1|pages=159–161|doi=10.1177/002218568602800120}}&lt;/ref&gt; She coined the phrase 'effort bargaining', in relation to her research into the ways in which workers relate their effort to the pay they receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/effort-bargaining|title=effort bargaining - Dictionary definition of effort bargaining {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also came up with the 'blue Monday index' which measures the difference between Monday’s and Friday’s absence rates, and how these voluntary absence varied by types of worker.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''“Hō-Ren-Sō”''' (報・連・相) is a business [[mantra]] or [[mnemonic]] [[acronym]] in Japanese business culture. It is an “abbreviation of “''Hōkoku''” (報告, to report), “''Renraku''" (連絡, to inform) and “''Sōdan''” (相談, to consult), and is more memorable as a [[homonym]] of ''hōrensō'', the Japanese word for "[[spinach]]". It is utilized as a basic business rule in Japan to conduct smooth business communication. The origin of “'''Ho-Ren-So'''” comes from Tomiji Yamazaki who was the ex-president of Yamatana Security firm. In 1982 he started using the term for effective business communication in his firm and it has been widely spread and used throughout Japan through his book, “Strengthen your company with '''Ho-Ren-So'''”.

==Description==
“''Hokoku''” is to report on a process or result of business from a subordinate to a superior.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/japanese-versus-western-leadership/| title=JAPANESE CULTURE AND LEADERSHIP STYLE| accessdate=2 May 2017| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, subordinates don't have much authority to make business decision. Usually the decisions are made by an organization as a whole. Therefore, a subordinate must report everything to superior immediately and exactly. It is especially important to report a mistake or a problem immediately because his/her superior has the responsibility for it.

“''Renraku''” is to inform facts. One must inform the facts and decision to the relevant parties. One should not include one's opinion and guesses. If "''Renraku''" is not done or not completed, then you cannot control your team. And then, "''Renraku''" communicated to the people who need it. Finally, "''Renraku''" done quickly. Its content might need to prepare for the next action.

“''Sodan''” is to consult or discuss. For example, a superior give a subordinate an advice, and an employee talks over with superior about some unnecessary consultation in Japanese business. Because a superior rarely speaks to a subordinate in the Japanese company, but, they want to be asked for their advice. They want others to think that "you can always count on me." So, they feel better if they receive request for consultation from their subordinate.

==Pros and Cons==

There are many benefits to incorporating the "'''Ho-Ren-So'''" philosophy. First, if a issues within tasks are reported, it can be resolved quickly because a manager controls it and decides how to resolve it. Next, if information is communicated with team members and it is known all members of a team, they can take ownership of the schedule and tasks. Finally, if information is consulted from a subordinate, a decrease of quality will be prevented and likely won't occur again.

On the other hand, there are some Cons in "'''Ho-Ren-So'''". First, there is a cost of management. It is a very time consuming process, leaving employees with little time to complete their various work assignments. Moreover, and since a subordinate must always wait instructions from his/her supervisor, this prevents employees from applying problem-solving skills on their own without the constant need for managerial input.

'''Intellipedia''' is an online system for collaborative data sharing used by the [[United States intelligence community|United States Intelligence Community]] (IC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intelink.gov {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225104427/http://www.intelink.gov/ |date=2012-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was established as a pilot project in late 2005 and formally announced in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/intellipedia-marks-second-anniversary.html |title=Intellipedia marks second anniversary |publisher=CIA Press Release |date=March 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;INSA, Analytic Transformation, September 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Intellipedia consists of three [[wiki]]s running on the separate [[Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System|JWICS]] (Intellipedia-TS), [[SIPRNet]] (Intellipedia-S), and [[DNI-U]]  (Intellipedia-U) [[Computer network|networks]]. The [[Classified information|levels of classification]] allowed for information on the three wikis are [[Top Secret]] [[Sensitive Compartmented Information]] (TS SCI), [[Classified information in the United States#Secret|Secret]] (S), and [[Sensitive But Unclassified]] (SBU or [[For Official Use Only|FOUO]]) information, respectively.  Each of the wikis is used by individuals with appropriate [[Security clearance|clearances]] from the 16 agencies of the [[US intelligence community]] and other national-security related organizations, including [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]] and other federal departments. The wikis are not open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Steve, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/26/AR2009082603606.html For Intelligence Officers, A Wiki Way to Connect Dots]", ''[[Washington Post]]'', August 27, 2009, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellipedia is a project of the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] (ODNI) [[Intelink|Intelligence Community Enterprise Services]] (ICES) office headquartered in [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]], [[Maryland]]. It includes information on the regions, people, and issues of interest to the communities using its host networks. Intellipedia uses [[MediaWiki]], the same software used by the [[Wikipedia]] free-content encyclopedia project.&lt;ref name="National Defense Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2006/November/Pages/SecurityBeat2819.aspx?PF=1 |title=Wikipedia for Intel Officers Proves Useful |work=National Defense Magazine |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IvkVRnyJ?url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2006/November/Pages/SecurityBeat2819.aspx?PF=1 |archivedate=2013-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary of mainstream ''Wikipedia'', its intelligence analogue encourages editing that incorporates personal points of view regardless of rank as it was decided that, "much of the self-corrective knowledge in the Intelligence Community resides in personal points of view," and that, "not all good ideas originate at the top."&lt;ref name="D. Calvin Andrus" /&gt;

The Secret version connected to SIPRNet predominantly serves [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] personnel, many of whom do not use the Top Secret JWICS network on a day-to-day basis. Users on unclassified networks can access Intellipedia from remote terminals outside their workspaces via a [[VPN]], in addition to their normal workstations. [[Open Source Intelligence]] (OSINT) users share information on the unclassified Intelink-U wiki.

==History==
Intellipedia was created to share information on some of the most difficult subjects facing U.S. intelligence and to bring cutting-edge technology into its ever-more-youthful workforce.&lt;ref name="USAToday11_02"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2006-11-02-intellipedia_x.htm |title=Over 3,600 intelligence professionals tapping into Intellipedia |work=[[USA Today]] |agency=Associated Press |first=Katherine |last=Shrader |date=2006-02-11 |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also allows information to be assembled and reviewed by a wide variety of sources and agencies, to address concerns that pre-war intelligence did not include robust dissenting opinions on Iraq's alleged weapons programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartbrief.com/alchemy/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=53427FBF-AE22-4442-B244-C4E7C872397A&amp;lmid=archives "Data from spies now assembled wiki-style"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A number of projects are under way to explore the use of the Intellipedia for the creation of traditional Intelligence Community products. In the summer of 2006, Intellipedia was the main collaboration tool in constructing a [[National Intelligence Estimate]] on [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;Bruce Finley, [http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_4216851 "Intelligence Fixes Floated at Conference," ''Denver Post'', 08/22/2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellipedia was at least partially inspired by a paper written for the [[Galileo Award]] (an essay competition set up by the CIA, later taken over by the DNI), which encouraged any employee at any intelligence agency to submit new ideas to improve information sharing. The first essay selected was by [[Calvin Andrus]], chief technology officer of the Center for Mission Innovation at the CIA, entitled "The Wiki and the Blog: Toward a Complex Adaptive Intelligence Community". Andrus' essay argued that the real power of the Internet had come from the boom in self-publishing, and noted how the open-door policy of [[Wikipedia]] allowed it to cover new subjects quickly.&lt;ref name="D. Calvin Andrus"&gt;D. Calvin Andrus, Ph.D. Office of Application Services, Central Intelligence Agency. [http://www.acadac.net/wiki/images/a/af/SSRN-id755904.pdf The wiki and the blog: Toward a complex adaptive intelligence community], ''Studies in Intelligence'', Volume 49, Number 3, September 2005. Published on the Web as, {{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no3/html_files/Wik_and_%20Blog_7.htm |title=The wiki and the blog: Toward a complex adaptive intelligence community|author=D. Calvin Andrus |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency Center for the Study of Intelligence |accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/magazine/03intelligence.html |title=Open-Source Spying |author=Clive Thompson |work=The New York Times Magazine|date=2006-12-03|accessdate=2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard A. Russell, Deputy Assistant [[Director of National Intelligence]] for [[Information Sharing Customer Outreach (ISCO)]] said it was created so "analysts in different agencies that work X or Y can go in and see what other people are doing on subject X or Y and actually add in their two cents worth ... or documents that they have. ... What we're after here is 'decision superiority', not 'information superiority'. ... We have to get inside the decision cycle of the enemy. We have to be able to discover what they're doing and respond to it effectively."&lt;ref name="National Defense Magazine" /&gt;

In September 2007, sixteen months after its creation, officials noted that the top-secret version of Intellipedia alone (hosted on [[Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System|JWICS]]) has 29,255 articles, with an average of 114 new articles and more than 6,000 edits to articles added each workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Shane|title=Logged In and Sharing Gossip, Er, Intelligence|date=September 2, 2007|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/weekinreview/02shane.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2009, the overall Intellipedia project hosted 900,000 pages edited by 100,000 users, with 5,000 page edits per day.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1890084,00.html |title=Wikipedia for Spies: The CIA Discovers Web 2.0 |work=Time |date=2009-04-08 |accessdate=2009-04-09 |first=Massimo |last=Calabresi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2014, Intellipedia contained around 269,000 articles&lt;ref&gt;Kaven Waddel. [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/the-governments-secret-wiki-for-intelligence/518508/?google_editors_picks=true The Government’s Secret Wiki for Intelligence: Analysts reportedly tucked classified information about Russian hacking inside Intellipedia for safekeeping,] ''The Atlantic,'' March 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Top Secret Intellipedia counting 113,000 content pages with 255,000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=jasonsmathers|url=https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/intellipedia-usage-statistics-10058/|title=FOIA request for Intellipedia usage statistics|publisher=MuckRock|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===10 years later===
A 2017 two-part ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' series on Intellipedia and next steps reported that after 10 years of usage Intellipedia helped the IC get caught up to "Web 2.0" but never reformed how official reports were created like [[National Intelligence Estimate]]s. A more official version of Intellipedia called the Living Intelligence System was created after the fact and focused on collaboratively writing official reports. It failed to catch on because each agency has a different process for writing official, classified reports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2017/03/intellipedia-wikipedia-spies-much/ The Wikipedia for Spies and Where It Goes From Here], Wired, March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the lessons learned from Intellipedia and the Living Intelligence System, a pilot program within the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency created the Tearline apps focused on writing official collaborative reports in the less bureaucratic space of unclassified content.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2017/04/american-spies-now-smartphone-app/ American Spies Now Have Their Own Smartphone App], Wired, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential problems==
Some are concerned that individual intelligence agencies will create their own wikis, draining ideas and input from Intellipedia.&lt;ref name="Intellipedia Discussion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/11/intellipedia.html#comment-25336444|title=Intellipedia - Marginal REVOLUTION|date=2 November 2006|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Dennehy, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] official involved in integrating the system into the intelligence fabric, said disseminating material to the widest possible audience of analysts is key to avoiding mistakes. He said analysts from multiple agencies had used the network to post frequent updates on recent events, including [[2006 New York City plane crash|the crash of a small plane into a New York City apartment building in October 2006]] and [[2006 North Korean missile test|North Korea's test of a missile in July 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esenai.com/blog/intellipedia/people/michael_wertheimer/|title=Intellipedia Roundtable Discussion|website=esenai.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some view it as risky because it allows more information to be viewed and shared;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esenai.com/blog/intellipedia/|title=U.S. intelligence unveils spy version of Wikipedia|website=esenai.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to [[Michael Wertheimer]], [[John Michael McConnell|McConnell's]] assistant deputy director for analysis, it is worth the risk. The project was greeted initially with "a lot of resistance," said Wertheimer, because it runs counter to past practice which sought to limit the pooling of information.&lt;ref name="metimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metimes.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20061103-075107-4557r|title=US spies create their own 'Wiki' intelligence|website=metimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said there are risks in everything everyone does: "the key is risk management, not risk avoidance." Some encouragement has been necessary to spur contributions from the traditional intelligence community.&lt;ref name="USAToday11_02"/&gt; However, he said the system appeals to the new generation of intelligence analysts because "this is how they like to work" and "it's a new way of thinking."&lt;ref name="USAToday11_02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metimes"/&gt;

==Successes==
[[File:Intellipedia2008.png|thumb|[[2008 Mumbai attacks]] page on Intellipedia]]
[[Thomas Fingar]], [[Director of National Intelligence|Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis]] (DDNI/A), cited the successful use of Intellipedia to develop an article on how Iraqi insurgents were using [[chlorine]] in [[improvised explosive devices]] saying, "They developed it in a couple of days interacting in Intellipedia,"..."No bureaucracy, no mother-may-I, no convening meetings. They did it and it came out pretty good. That's going to continue to grow."&lt;ref&gt;[http://defensenews.com/story.php?F=2733832&amp;C=america "U.S. Intel Agencies Modernize Info Sharing", ''DefenseNews.com'', May 7, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dni.gov/speeches/20070905_speech.pdf 2007 Analytic Transformation Symposium], 6 September 2007, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 10, 2007 testimony before the [[United States Congress]], [[John Michael McConnell|Michael McConnell]], [[Director of National Intelligence]], cited the increasing use of Intellipedia among analysts and its ability to help experts pool their knowledge, form virtual teams, and make quick assessments.&lt;ref name="10 September 2007 hearing"&gt;[http://dni.gov/testimonies/20070910_testimony.pdf Michael McConnell. "Confronting the Terrorist Threat to the Homeland: Six Years after 9/11]", ''Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee'', September 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Analyzing Intelligence: Origins, Obstacles, and Innovations]]'', a 2008 book by several experts in the field of intelligence analysis, cited Intellipedia as evidence of the changing nature of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Roger George, James Bruce, et al., ''Analyzing Intelligence: Origins, Obstacles, and Innovations'', Georgtown University Press, April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Haseltine]], former ODNI Associate Director for Science and Technology said that "It's hard to overstate what [Burke and Dennehy] did . ... They made a major transformation almost overnight with no money after other programs failed to achieve these results with millions of dollars in funding."  Haseltine said intelligence analysts had "reacted 'more quickly and more intelligently' to potential terrorist threats than they would have without Intellipedia".&lt;ref name=medals/&gt;

==Community practices==
[[File:Intellipedia shovel.jpg|thumb|An Intellipedia shovel, awarded to exemplary wiki contributors.]]
The wiki provides so much flexibility that several offices throughout the community are using it to maintain and transfer knowledge on daily operations and events.&lt;ref name="Spotlight/Wilson"&gt;Executive Biz, [http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=jwilson Executive Spotlight with Jesse Wilson], October 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone with access to read it has permission to create and edit articles after registering and acquiring an account with [[Intelink]]. Since Intellipedia is intended to be a platform for harmonizing the various points of view of the agencies and analysts of the Intelligence Community, Intellipedia does not enforce a [[neutrality (philosophy)|neutral point of view]] policy.&lt;ref name="NTY Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/magazine/03intelligence.html?ex=1322802000&amp;en=46027e63d79046ce&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|title=Open-Source Spying|work=New York Times Magazine|date=December 2006|accessdate=2006-12-03 |first=Clive |last=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, viewpoints are attributed to the agencies, offices, and individuals participating, with the hope that a consensus view will emerge. Intellipedia also contains a great deal of non-encyclopedic content including meeting notes and items of internal, administrative interest. Deputy DNI [[Thomas Fingar]] made a comparison to [[eBay]], the auction Web site where the reliability of sellers is rated by buyers. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intellipedia. It's been written up. It's the Wikipedia on a classified network, with one very important difference: it's not anonymous. We want people to establish a reputation. If you're really good, we want people to know you're good. If you're making contributions, we want that known. If you're an idiot, we want that known too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/15754/intelligence_reform_rush_transcript_federal_news_service.html|title=Intelligence Reform [Rush Transcript; Federal News Service]|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mazzetti |last=Mark |title=Intelligence Chief Announces Renewed Plan for Overhaul |date=April 12, 2007 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/washington/12intel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During 2006–2007, Intellipedia editors awarded symbolic ''shovels'' to users to distinguish exemplary Wiki ''gardening'' and to encourage others in the community to contribute. A template with a picture of the limited-edition shovel (actually a trowel), was created to place on user pages for Intellipedians to show their ''gardening'' status. The handle bears the imprint: "I dig Intellipedia! It's wiki wiki, Baby." The idea was inspired by the [[Wikipedia:Barnstars|barnstar]],&lt;ref name="eekim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eekim.com/blog/2006/09/27/intellipediashovel |title=EEK Speaks |work=Eugene Eric Kim's Blog |accessdate=2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is used on both [[Wikipedia:Barnstars|Wikipedia]] and [[MeatballWiki]] for similar purposes. The shovels have since been replaced with a mug bearing the tag line, "Intellipedia: it's what we know".

Different agencies have experimented with other ways of encouraging participation. For example, at the CIA, managers have held contests for best pages with prizes such as free dinners.&lt;ref name="web2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9096658&amp;pageNumber=1 |title=CIA, Pfizer, Wachovia and Sony execs suggest options for adopting Web 2.0 |author=Heather Havenstein |publisher=Computerworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Rasmussen, knowledge management officer at the Defense Department's [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), argues that "gimmicks" like the Intellipedia shovel, posters, and handbills, encourage people to use [[Web 2.0]] tools like Intellipedia and are effective low-tech solutions to promote their use. Also, Rasmussen argues that "[[social software]]–based contributions should be written in an employee's performance plan".&lt;ref name="FCW"&gt;"[http://www.fcw.com/print/13_16/news/102750-1.html Government taps the power of us: Officials turn to blogs and wikis to share information and achieve goals]", ''Federal Computer Week'', May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training===
Several agencies in the Intelligence community, most notably the CIA and NGA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.executivebiz.com/web20-adoption-in-large-enterprises/|title=Web2.0 Adoption in Large Enterprises|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed training programs to provide time to integrate social software tools into analysts' daily work habits. These classes generally focus on the use of Intellipedia to capture and manage knowledge, but they also incorporate the use of the other social software tools. These include [[blog]]s, [[RSS]], and social bookmarking. The courses stress immersion in the tools and instructors encourage participants to work on a specific project in Intellipedia. The courses also expose participants to social media technologies on the Internet.&lt;ref name="training"&gt;[http://www.federalnewsradio.com/?sid=1286296&amp;nid=250 Radio interview] that highlights Intelligence Community social software training programs, Federal News Radio, November 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sean d"&gt;[http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=sdennehy Executive Spotlight Interview with Sean Dennehy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206042130/http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=sdennehy |date=2008-12-06 }}, ExecutiveBiz, December 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chris R"&gt;[http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=crasmussen Executive Spotlight Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204094209/http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=crasmussen |date=2008-12-04 }} with Chris Rasmussen, ExecutiveBiz, October 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2009, Don Burke and Sean P. Dennehy, two of the originators of Intellipedia, were awarded with the "Homeland Security Service to America Medal" by the [[Partnership for Public Service]]. The award noted that they "Promoted information sharing across the intelligence community through the development and implementation of Intellipedia, a Wikipedia-like clearinghouse of intelligence expertise."&lt;ref name=medals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://servicetoamericamedals.org/honorees/view_profile.php?profile=215|title=2009 'Service to America Medal Recipients' |accessdate=2010-01-05 |publisher=[[Service to America Medals]] |date=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

Founded in 2001, the company was initially known as Irevna Solutions Private Limited and was based out of [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], [[India]]. The company relocated to [[Chennai]] in 2003 and was renamed Irevna Research Services Pvt. Ltd. In 2005, [[CRISIL]] announced its intention to purchase Irevna Research Services for an initial cash payment of about Rs 43 crores (Approx US$8.6 Million, based on then USD-INR exchange rate).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2004/10/20/stories/2004102002710100.htm The Hindu Business Line : Crisil buys Irevna for Rs 43 cr&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The company has since been rechristened as '''Irevna, a division of Crisil'''. Subsequently in 2011, the global research support units of CRISIL have been rebranded as "CRISIL - Global Research and Analytics" (Irevna and Pipal serve as exclusive brands for external clients; and a Captive unit)

Irevna moved to Chennai in 2002 with about 20 people. At the start of 2010, the Chennai operations alone have grown over 25 times and accounts for around 40% of CRISIL's global offshoring operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irevna.com/pdf/Irevna%20is%20constantly%20redefining%20KPO%20landscape,%20ET%20interview%20-%20April%202010.pdf  Irevna is constantly redefining KPO landscape, ET interview - April 2010&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irevna claims to have pioneered the concept of "offshoring investment research" to the world's leading investment banks and financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-management/company-strategy-outsourcing/5284944-1.html Mr. GV Mani Named Global Head of CRISIL Irevna Group&amp;apos;s Offshoring Business. | Company Activities &amp; Management &gt; Company Strategy from AllBusiness.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company became ISO 27001 (BS 7799) certified in November 2006.

===Recognition &amp; Awards===

The company has been consistently ranked the best outsourcer in its niche segment of high end financial research &amp; analytics space.

'''Konstantin Čomu''' (1865–1952), often credited as '''Kosta Chomu''' ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian Cyrillic]]: Константин Чому) or '''Konstantin Comu''' was a [[Vlach]] ([[Aromanian people]]) cinema operator, first in [[Bitola]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].

== Work==
The appearance of the cinema in Macedonia dates from the beginning of the 20th century. Ten years after the promotion of this new art at the Grande Caffe in [[Paris]] (1895), the cinema arrived in Macedonian soil, thus marking the expansion of the new medium.
The first projection took place as early as 1896, and by the beginning of the 20th century they grew frequent. An increasing number of projectors were owned and operated by certain progressive individuals. At the Balkan, such a person was Konstantin Chomu from Bitola.
Konstantin Chomu opened and operated the first cinema center in Bitola. Among other world wide famous movies, he was projecting the shots and films made from the famous [[Manaki brothers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2134">'''Maurice Dollfus''' was appointed to head up [[Ford SAF|Ford of France]] in 1930.   Four years later he negotiated an agreement with [[Mathis (cars)|Mathis]] which led to the creation of the [[Matford]] joint project in 1934 in order to enable Ford to grow its French business at a time of [[mercantilism|increased protectionism]] and at an acceptable cost.   When the [[Matford]] partnership fell apart it was Dollfus who created Ford’s new [[PSA Poissy Plant|plant at Poissy]] which was ready to produce cars in 1940 and which allowed the company an impressive annual production capacity (that would never be reached while Ford owned the plant) of 100,000 cars.

Like many industrialists Dollfus was arrested in September 1944, suspected of collaboration in the fevered period of retribution that directly followed the [[:fr: Libération de la France|Liberation]], and he was transferred to [[Drancy internment camp|Drancy]] (where he met [[Sacha Guitry]]).   However he was quickly released and in 1945 received from the Americans an award reserved for companies that had contributed to the allied victory.

After 1945 he continued to lead Ford in France, obtaining from the Americans a ready developed new model that became the future [[Ford Vedette]].   However, aged 66 he quit Ford in January 1950 after presiding over the difficult gestation period of the Vedette, during which the company was troubled by serious industrial strife as well as the huge challenges that faced all auto-makers in France during the later 1940s.   Dollfus was succeeded at Ford by [[François Lehideux]], who was both a former [[Renault]] plant manager and a former minister under the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]].

'''Militant use of children in Sri Lanka''' has been an internationally recognized problem since the inception of the [[Sri Lankan civil war]] in 1983. The primary recruiters of under the age of 18 children are the rebel [[LTTE]] movement and the [[Karuna group]] (a break-away faction of the LTTE working with Sri Lanka Forces).&lt;ref name=UNICEF20060622&gt;{{cite press release |title=UNICEF condemns abduction and recruitment of Sri Lankan children by the Karuna group |publisher=[[UNICEF]] |date=2006-06-22 |url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_34677.html |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rediff20050126&gt;{{cite news|title=Tsunami orphans swell LTTE ranks |url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/jan/26ltte.htm |publisher=Rediff.com India Limited |date=2005-01-26 |accessdate=2008-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907141326/http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/jan/26ltte.htm |archivedate=September 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=irandaily20050127&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lankan Rebels Recruiting Child Soldiers |url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2201/pdf/9-politic.pdf |format=PDF |work=Iran Daily |page=9 |date=2005-01-27 |accessdate=2008-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184434/http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2201/pdf/9-politic.pdf |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sfchron20060917&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Meo |title=Tamil Tigers abduct teens to fight |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/09/17/MNGIPL6N391.DTL&amp;feed=rss.news  |work=San Francisco Chronicle |page=A17 |date=2006-09-17 |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LTTE recruitment==
Before 2007 the LTTE was accused of recruiting thousands of children into their ranks. The LTTE has been accused of knowingly recruiting and using child soldiers as front-line troops. Amid international pressure, LTTE announced in July 2003 that it would stop conscripting child soldiers, but both UNICEF and HRW have accused it of reneging on its promises, and of conscripting Tamil children orphaned by the tsunami. UNICEF claimed that LTTE recruited at least 40 children orphaned by the tsunami.&lt;ref name=rediff20050126 /&gt; However, from the beginning of 2007 LTTE agreed to release all of the recruits under the age of 18.

===2007===
According to UNICEF, between November 1, 2006 and August 31, 2007, 262 children were recruited by the LTTE; this figure includes 32 children who were rerecruited after being released.  This number shows a significant decrease in recruitment as compared to the previous 12-month period, which saw the LTTE recruit 756 children, of whom 97 were rerecruits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.app.com.pk/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=24745&amp;Itemid=2 Associated Press of Pakistan - Sri Lankan rebels still recruiting child soldiers : UN chief&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The LTTE promised that it would release all of the recruits under the age of 18 before the end of the year. On 18 June 2007, the LTTE released 135 children under the age of 18. On 22 October 2007, [[UNICEF]] claimed that at least 506 child recruits (under the age of 18) still remained under the LTTE. UNICEF further noted that there had been a significant drop in recruitment of children by the LTTE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engASA370172007?open&amp;of=eng-LKA Sri Lanka: Amnesty International urges LTTE to live up to its pledge to end child recruitment | Amnesty International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022100510/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA370172007?open&amp;of=ENG-LKA |date=2007-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a report released by the LTTE's Child Protection Authority (CPA) in 2008 reported that fewer than 40 child soldiers, under the age of 18, still remained in their forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltteps.org/?view=2095&amp;folder=17 LTTE PS: Status of UNICEF database on underage LTTE members&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716163102/http://www.ltteps.org/?view=2095&amp;folder=17 |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, the LTTE claimed that they had stopped child recruitment.&lt;ref name="The Hindu News Update Service"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/holnus/001200801311401.htm |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=Karuna faction recruiting child soldiers in Lanka: UN |date=2008-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107152624/http://www.hindu.com/holnus/001200801311401.htm |archivedate=2012-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the LTTE claims according to the UNICEF  a total of 594 children aged between 12 and 18 years surrendered to armed forces during the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Once a child soldier now an ice-creme truck driver |url=https://www.unicef.org/srilanka/reallives_7924.html |accessdate=7 August 2018 |agency=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TMVP Paramilitary Recruitment==

'''Mohammed Jamal Khalifa'''  ({{lang-ar|محمد جمال خليفه}})
(1 February 1957 – 31 January 2007) was a [[Saudi]] businessman from [[Jeddah]] who married one of [[Osama bin Laden]]'s sisters.&lt;ref name=CNNdead&gt;{{cite news|title=Bin Laden's brother-in-law killed|publisher=CNN|date=31 January 2007|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/01/31/khalifa.death/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202030010/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/01/31/khalifa.death/index.html|archivedate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been accused of funding terror plots and groups in the [[Philippines]] in the 1990s while head of the  [[International Islamic Relief Organization]] branch there.&lt;ref name=abuza/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunaratna-182/&gt; He was murdered in [[Madagascar]] in 2007.

==Biography==
Khalifa is said to have trained with Osama Bin Laden in the [[mujahideen]] camps in [[Afghanistan]] during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].&lt;ref name="Fielding" /&gt;

===Philippines===
Khalifa came to the Philippines in 1987 or 1988. He was the first head of the [[International Islamic Relief Organization]]’s Philippine branch, and also the IIRO's regional director for all of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/archive/hearing3/9-11Commission_Hearing_2003-07-09.htm|accessdate=19 June 2012|date=9 July 2003|quote=MR.

Khalifa had married a local woman, Alice "Jameelah" Yabo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abuza|first=Zachary|title=Balik-Terrorism: The Return of the Abu Sayyaf|publisher=Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College|location=Carlisle, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-58487-208-X|url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub625.pdf|page=47|date=September 2005|accessdate=19 June 2012|quote=Based on IIRO documents at the PSEC, Khalifa was one of five incorporators who signed the documents of registration; another was Khalifa's wife, Alice 'Jameelah' Yabo.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently exited and entered the country for "business" reasons. Yabo was the sister of Ahmad al-Hamwi, better known as Abu Omar.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|title=AFP was aware of 'al-Qaeda associate'|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/afp-was-aware-of-alqaeda-associate/2006/04/08/1143916754689.html|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=8 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zachary Abuza writing in 2003, Khalifa established several charities and Islamic organizations in the Philippines ostensibly for charity and religious world but which channeled money to extremist groups.&lt;ref name=abuza /&gt; According to ''[[Newsweek]]'', Filipino officials suspect Khalifa may have raised as much as several hundred thousand dollars during his eight years in the Philippines, but most of the money (as much as 70 percent, according to Wahab Akbar, governor of the Basilan region where the [[Abu Sayyaf]] is based) was spent funding Islamic extremists like Abu Sayyaf.&lt;ref name=Newsweek-21-10-01&gt;{{cite news|title=Taking From The Poor|url=http://www.newsweek.com/taking-poor-154043|accessdate=15 May 2015|work=Newsweek|date=21 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of his syphoning off of charitable funds, according to Newsweek, was his reporting to his "Saudi sponsors" that he had built 33 orphanages across the southern Philippines with "the funds they had sent him", when in fact Khalifa had set up only one institution for orphans.&lt;ref name=Newsweek-21-10-01/&gt;

Khalifa founded the "Benevolence International Corporation" (BIC) in the Philippines in 1988, apparently to recruit people for the Afghan jihad against the Soviets. The BIC claimed to be an import-export company. In 1992, that group folded visible operations while another group known as the Islamic Benevolence Committee renamed itself to [[Benevolence International Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasury designates Benevolence International Foundation and related entities as financiers of terrorism|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/po3632.aspx|publisher=US Department of the Treasury|accessdate=19 June 2012|date=19 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was left of the Benevolence International Corporation allegedly gave logistical support to terrorists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[George W. Bush]]|title=Executive Order 13224 blocking Terrorist Property and a summary of the Terrorism Sanctions Regulations|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/terror.pdf|date=23 September 2001|accessdate=19 June 2012|location=Names of entities designated on 19 November 2002|page=5|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228090201/http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/terror.pdf|archivedate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been accused of assisting the 1993 [[World Trade Center bombing]] and the [[Bojinka plot]] (of [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], [[Ramzi Yousef]] to blow up 11 American jetliners killing 4,000 people in early 1995).&lt;ref name=abuza /&gt;

Another organization founded by Khalifa, the International Relations and Information Center, has been called (by Zachary Abuza) the "primary funding mechanism" for the [[Bojinka plot|Bojinka plan]].  Money was embezzled from the International Relations and Information Center through the bank account of Omar Abu Omar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abuza|first=Zachary |title=Funding Terrorism in Southeast Asia: The Financial Network of Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah|journal=NBR Analysis|date=December 2003|volume=14|issue=5|page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an employee at the center, to an account under the name of Adel Sabah, an alias of Ramzi Yousef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramzi Yousef|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/ramzi_yousef.htm|publisher=Global Security.org|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Philippines National Security Advisor, Roilo Golez, Khalifa "built up the good will of the community through charity and then turned segments of the population into agents."&lt;ref name=abuza /&gt; A Philippines intelligence report claimed that "the IIRO which claims to be a relief institution is being utilized by foreign extremist as a pipeline through which funding for the local extremists are being coursed through".&lt;ref name=abuza /&gt;

A defector from the [[Abu Sayyaf]] Group (ASG) told authorities "The IIRO was behind the construction of Mosques, school buildings and other livelihood projects" but only "in areas penetrated, highly influenced and controlled by the Abu Sayyaf." According to the defector "Only 10 to 30% of the foreign funding goes to the legitimate relief and livelihood projects and the rest go to terrorist operations."&lt;ref name=abuza /&gt;

According to [[Rohan Gunaratna]], Khalifa dispatched at least one Filipino youth to Tripoli, Libya, on an eight-month training course and on his return in 1990 urged him to join ASG.&lt;ref name=abuza /&gt; He sent other ASG members for religious training to the [[International Islamic University, Islamabad|International Islamic University]] in Pakistan and for military training with Al Qaeda's International Islamic Brigade in Afghanistan, their visits being financed by IIRO.&lt;ref name=abuza /&gt;

From the Philippines, he "established links with Islamists in Iraq, Jordan, Turkey, Russia, Malaysia, the UAE, Romania, Lebanon, Syria, Pakistan, Albania, the Netherlands and Morocco, enabling the ASG to develop relationships with terrorist groups" throughout the Middle East and Asia.&lt;ref name=Gunaratna-182&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gunaratna|first1=Rohan|title=Inside Al Qaeda: Global Network of Terror|date=2002|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=182–83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rO2HY8unF_sC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=International+Relations+and+Information+Center+Benevolence+International+Corporation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t8NUVa_4B4jGogTyiIHwCA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Relations%20and%20Information%20Center%20Benevolence%20International%20Corporation&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Abuza, while Philippine government claimed to have shut down all the charities run by Khalifa to finance Abu Sayyaf, a senior Philippine intelligence official complained to him, "We could not touch the IIRO" because "intense diplomatic pressure" from Saudi Arabia kept the charity open. "Their most important source of leverage was the visas and jobs for several hundred thousand Filipino guest workers", which they could withhold if the Philippine government angered them.&lt;ref name=abuza&gt;Zachary Abuza, “[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25798639 Funding Terrorism in Southeast Asia: The Financial Network of Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah]”, ''The National Bureau of Asian Research'' 14, no. 5 (December 2003), pg. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deportation and release===
The first record U.S. authorities had of Khalifa reportedly came in 1992, when his alias "Barra" appeared on a bomb-making manual carried by Ahmed Ajaj who entered the United States on a false passport.&lt;ref name=forest-73&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forest|first1=James J. F.|title=Countering Terrorism and Insurgency in the 21st Century: Lessons from the ...|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDXWDJocZBgC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Ahmed+Ajaj+Mohammed+Jamal+Khalifa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YMFUVevCH9CloQTbyYHYCg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ahmed%20Ajaj%20Mohammed%20Jamal%20Khalifa&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berger|first=JM|title=The Unfinished Investigation|url=http://intelwire.egoplex.com/okc-overview.html|publisher=INTELWIRE.com|accessdate=19 June 2012|date=December 2004|quote=An alias used by Khalifa, Abu Barra, was written inside the cover of one of Ahmed Ajaj's bomb manuals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 1994, Khalifa met [[Mohamed Loay Bayazid]], the president of Benevolence International Foundation, in the [[United States]]. Khalifa and Bayazid were arrested on December 14, 1994, in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View, California]] on charges related to the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. Khalifa was planning to fly to the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Rizzo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rizzo|first=Tony|title=KC man linked to early al-Qaida|newspaper=The Kansas City Star|date=9 September 2006|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2006/060909-alqaeda-link.htm|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[FBI]] looked inside Khalifa's luggage, they found manuals in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] on training terrorists, which covered subjects such as bomb-making and other violent activities. Khalifa claims that his possession of the materials was innocent. They found a personal organizer with several contacts. One phone number was for [[Wali Khan Amin Shah]], a member of the [[Manila]] cell, which was plotting [[Operation Bojinka]] at the time. There was also a listing for an unknown man, who might have been [[Khalid Sheik Mohammed]]. Khalifa was placed in solitary confinement and the contents of his luggage were logged and edited.&lt;ref name="Bonner-Weiser"&gt;{{cite news|title=Echoes of early design to use chemicals to blow up airliners|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/11/world/europe/11manila.html?_r=1&amp;ref=bojinkajetlinersbombplot|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 August 2006|author=Raymond Bonner|author2=Benjamin Weiser}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Khalifa was held without bail for several months, before being deported to Jordan.&lt;ref name=Abuza-108&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abuza|first1=Zachary|title=Militant Islam in Southeast Asia: Crucible of Terror|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers.|date=2003|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqgiE94IAmIC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Mohammed+Jamal+Khalifa+deported+united+states&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gm9XVe2uGYWOyASBwoCgBQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mohammed%20Jamal%20Khalifa%20deported%20united%20states&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunaratna-182/&gt; In [[Jordan]], a court had convicted Khalifa in absentia for a string of theatre bombings. Khalifa faced a possible [[death sentence]] as a result. Khalifa first fought his deportation by suing the government.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

On 6-7 January 1995, Operation Bojinka was discovered after a fire at [[Ramzi Yousef]]'s [[Manila]] apartment. Investigators found evidence related to the plot.&lt;ref name="Bonner-Weiser"/&gt; [[Abdul Hakim Murad (militant)|Abdul Hakim Murad]], who was arrested at the apartment, had five phone numbers pointing to Khalifa. They also found logs of phone calls to and from Khalifa before his arrest and contact information on Yousef's computer.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} 

Despite this evidence, forwarded to the United States from the Philippines in March 1995, suggesting Khalifa was funding the foiled Operation Bojinka plot, Khalifa was not arrested but his belongs were returned and he was deported to Jordan on May 5 by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] as he requested. (Despite the fact that on 18 April, the conviction in Jordan was overturned as a key witness recanted his testimony.) In Jordan, a court acquitted Khalifa. Bayazid was also let go. Khalifa left for the Philippines and returned to Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=Gunaratna-182/&gt; The US deported him to Lebanon where he had already been sentenced to death in absentia for conspiracy to carry out terrorist acts. He was re-tried and acquitted, then released to Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=Abuza-108/&gt;

Khalifa was arrested in Saudi Arabia shortly after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]] attacks, but was released without charges being filed. Later that year, he publicly condemned Osama Bin Laden and publicly distanced himself from Al Qaeda.&lt;ref name="Fielding"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fielding|first=Nick|title=Gems, al-Qaida and murder.

===Death===
On 31 January 2007, the day before his 50th birthday, Khalifa was killed while visiting a gemstone mine he owned in Sakamilko, near the town of [[Sakaraha]] in southern [[Madagascar]]. Reports state that around 25 to 30 armed men raided Khalifa's residence in the middle of the night, attacked him with various weapons, and removed his computer and other intelligence materials. His family came to believe that he was assassinated by operators from the [[Joint Special Operations Command]].&lt;ref name="Fielding"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law, killed in Madagascar|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2007/01/mohammed_jamal_khali.php|accessdate=19 June 2012|newspaper=longwarjournal|date=31 January 2007|author=Reuters|author2=Sami Aboudi|author3=Bill Roggio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the president of [[Democratic Alternative (Serbia)|Democratic Alternative]] (DA) after the party got formed by certain number of SPS members seceded from SPS in July 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ex-yupress.com/danas/danas7.html Nebojsa Covic, president of the Democratic Alternative and former mayor of Belgrade: Ms. Mira Markovic Annulled November 1996 Elections, EX-YU Press, 21 November 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Čović served as the head of the Coordination Center for Kosovo and Metohija and as the head of the Southern Serbia Coordination Center during [[Insurgency in the Preševo Valley|Preševo Valley conflict]] (1999–2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/old_archive-article.php?yyyy=2004&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=27154 Covic to stay at Kosovo Coordination Centre], B92.net, 26 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 24 October 2000 to 25 January 2001 he was a member of the trio Co-Prime Ministers together with [[Milomir Minić]] from SPS and [[Spasoje Krunić]] from the [[Serbian Renewal Movement]] (SPO) that transitionally governed Serbia after the [[Bulldozer Revolution]], when [[Mirko Marjanović]] was sacked. After the [[assassination of Zoran Đinđić]], he was the acting Prime Minister of Serbia from 12 to 16 March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2003-03-12/world/serbia.djindjic.shooting.1235_1_prime-minister-djindjic-natasa-micic-zoran-djindjic?_s=PM:WORLD Serbian PM shot dead], CNN.com, 12 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party ceased to exist in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.rs/Vesti/Nebojsa-Covic-za-Press-POVRATAK-U-POLITIKU.html Povratak u politiku (in Serbian)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Politika/Politichka-scena-bez-Liberala-Srbije-SDP-a-SLS-a.sr.html Politička scena bez Liberala Srbije, SDP-a i SLS-a]; accessed 17 April 2015. {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports administration career==

;FMP Železnik (1991–2011)
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2015}}
In 1991 Čović became involved with Serbian basketball club KK ILR Železnik, a dormant sports collective for the workers of state-owned Ivo Lola Ribar metallurgical factory. Inactive since 1986, the club got revived by Čović under the auspices of his privately-owned metal products factory Fabrika metalnih proizvoda AD and renamed [[FMP Železnik]]. Under his guidance and ownership, the club grew into one of the top teams in Serbia and [[FR Yugoslavia]], developing a reputation for player development and quality work with younger categories.

By 1993, the club got its own basketball facility — the 2,000-seat [[Železnik Hall]] that served as its home arena form then on. Climbing rapidly up the basketball pyramid in FR Yugoslavia, FMP began the 1994-95 season in the Second Federal League, winning promotion to the country's [[YUBA League|top basketball competition]] for the following 1995-96 season. 

In 1998, Čović brought former Yugoslav national team player [[Ratko Radovanović]] on board as the club's sporting director. Radovanović soon became synonymous with the emerging club, making player personnel decisions and running its day-to-day operations. 

Čović's son [[Filip Čović|Filip]] later played as [[point guard]] for the club.

;Yugoslav Basketball Federation (1995–1997)
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2015}}
In late 1995, while simultaneously performing the city of Belgrade mayoral job as well as Serbian National Assembly MP duties, Čović became president of the [[Basketball Federation of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Basketball Federation]] (KSJ), succeeding Veselin "Vesko" Barović in the job. In addition to Čović's political connections through SPS, the rapid success of his club FMP Železnik that was about to start competing in the country's top league that season after multiple promotions was the best possible recommendation for the job. 

At the time when Čović came on board to lead the federation, FR Yugoslavia national team led by [[Dušan Ivković|Duda Ivković]] were the reigning [[EuroBasket 1995|European champions]], having returned to international competition following a four-year exile due to the UN embargo. Ivković soon stepped down and his assistant [[Željko Obradović]] took over the national team head coaching job. The national team had a great run at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, reaching the final against the American Dream Team composed of NBA players. In early 1997, soon after Čović's fall from grace in SPS, he was removed from the KSJ job as well.

'''''Nina Iraq''''' is a bilingual magazine for [[Iraq]]i women  everywhere, running articles mostly on women’s empowerment themes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/economic-empowerment&lt;/ref&gt; It is published a couple of times a year as a hard copy magazine, with digital publication and interaction on the Website as the live feed. ''Nina-Iraq'' is published by NGO the Private Sector Development Centre in Iraq (PSDC).&lt;ref name="PSDC"&gt;[http://psdc-iraq.org PSDC]&lt;/ref&gt;  with support from the [[World Bank Group]]  for the first issue and ongoing support from Chamber Trade Sweden &lt;ref name="CTS"&gt;[http://chambertradesweden.se/ CTS]&lt;/ref&gt;   into 2015 and beyond. Nina-Iraq focusses on economic empowerment opportunities by showcasing real voices through interviews and stories in both English and Arabic. The printed magazine is fed by features from the Nina-Iraq website.

== History ==
Designed to create trade links and shared expertise in a digital Iraqi homeland, Nina aims to inspire collaboration by 5 million Iraqi diaspora with in country Iraqi's. The distribution of 20,000 magazines in Iraq  and internationally occurs through private sector organisations and chambers of trade - as well as online interaction.
Nina was created in response to calls to action such as co-founder Madeleine White's report on Women in the Private Sector in MENA.&lt;ref name="Women in Private Sector Report"&gt;[https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/WP1321-Report.pdf MENA Wilton Park Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Winter 2013 ===
Nina gets a name and a brand. Nina is one of the names of Goddess "[[Inana]]", representing fertility, beauty and love to the ancient people of Mesopotamia. The Goddess appeared for the first time in the lands of "Sumer" 5,000 years ago. She was symbolized in cuneiform writing by an octagon star that referred to the planet Venus. She also came to symbolize the desire of communication between man and woman; from her body, a new life arises. Nina is a shortening on Inana, can be pronounced used in English and Arabic and has no modern religious connotations, instead referencing Iraq's rich past.

=== Spring 2014 ===
In April Issue 1 was launched in London in the House of Commons &lt;ref name="Nina-Iraq Launch London"&gt;[http://nina-iraq.com/2014/05/22/nina-launches-in-the-house-of-commons-in-london-29th-april Nina House of Commons Launch]&lt;/ref&gt;  by [http://lorelyburt.org.uk/en/article/2014/825331/female-business-champion-appointed-to-help-new-and-growing-firms Lorely Burt MP], with support by ABCC Chair [[Elizabeth Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean|Baroness Symonds of Vernham Dean]].    In May Issue 1 was launched with Chamber Trade Sweden and the Swedish diaspora Stockholm.&lt;ref name="Nina-Iraq Launch Stockholm"&gt;[http://nina-iraq.com/2014/05/22/sweden-celebrates-nina-19th-may Nina Stockholm Launch]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summer 2014 ===
The Iraqi launch took place at the Grand Millennium Hotel in Suleimania in early June with support from Asiacell.&lt;ref name="Iraqi Launch"&gt;[http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/2014/06/10/nina-launches-in-iraq Asiacell’s Chairman Faruk Rasool supports Iraqi launch]&lt;/ref&gt; The incursion of Isis, meant focus on the online edition of Nina. Nina's poem was written in order to create a united vision for all the volunteers disheartened by the invasion of ISIS, who were worried about Nina's relevance and future.

== Features ==
Nina-Iraq’s contributors are normal people, not journalists, although some special interviews are professionally done. For example, business opportunities around environmental sustainability, health and oil and gas are presented, offering industry for  Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan. Contributors can upload their stories directly via Share My Story, Email or work to get journalistic support via corporate volunteer portal, [[Benefacto]]. Examples include a  call to action by 14-year-old Mariam,&lt;ref&gt;http://nina-iraq.com/2014/09/23/living-in-the-future-iraq/&lt;/ref&gt; a  Women in Islam story by finance expert Natalie Schoon and an interview with global Vital Voices Winner Suaad Allami.&lt;ref&gt;http://nina-iraq.com/2014/09/18/women-in-islam-a-wider-perspective/&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft's masr ta3mal education and  Aspire Woman Mentoring platforms can be accessed directly. There is also a business register on Nina's Directory.

== Particular characteristics ==
All submitted features are translated into either Arabic or English, depending on submission language in order to create a shared cultural dialogue to a wider audience. By focusing so strongly on women, there is a question however, whether wider political and social issues are being sufficiently addressed through Nina. As a women's magazine it has also been confused with a lifestyle or beauty magazine.

== Early life and education ==
Born in [[London, England]] to [[Mike Adenuga]] Jr. from [[Ijebu Igbo]] in [[Ogun State]] and Emelia Marquis of [[Calabar]] descent from [[Cross River State]]. At the age of 10, Paddy Adenuga relocated from [[Lagos|Lagos, Nigeria]] to [[Harlingen, Texas]] in the [[Rio Grande Valley]] to attend the [[Marine Military Academy]]. After 3 years at [[Marine Military Academy]], he attended [[The Tenney School]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. By early 1998, he graduated from high school at the very tender age of 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pulse.ng/news/business/10-things-you-probably-did-not-know-about-paddy-adenuga-id7913785.html|title=10-things-you-probably-did-not-know-about-paddy-adenuga|last=Oyeniyi|first=Adegoke|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still at the age of 13, Paddy Adenuga started his university education at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston|University of Massachusetts,]] studying Business Administration and then thereafter, transferred to [[Northeastern University]] where he graduated with a Bachelors in Business Management in 2002 at the age of 18.

== Career ==
Paddy Adenuga initially worked at his family owned agglomerate company, The Mike Adenuga Group, from 2002 to 2006. He was the Group Executive Director of [[Globacom|GLO]] and also the upstream exploration &amp; oil production company, [[Conoil|ConOil Producing]]. In 2006, he left the Mike Adenuga Group and moved to London to setup an oil brokering firm with a business partner called Cayne &amp; Cayne. They brokered supplies of refined petroleum products to Nigerian oil firms. In 2009, Paddy returned to the Mike Adenuga Group in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] in an even more senior capacity as the co-CEO of [[Globacom|GLO]] and CEO of [[Conoil|ConOil]] Producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sunnewsonline.com/is-paddy-adenuga-feeling-bluesy/|title=Is Paddy Adenuga feeling bluesy? - The Sun News|date=2018-01-13|work=The Sun News|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-data/257368-takeaways-paddy-adenugas-trojan-gambit-chevron-netherlands-tope-fasua.html|title=Takeaways From Paddy Adenuga's Trojan Gambit For Chevron Netherlands, By Tope Fasua - Premium Times Nigeria|date=2018-02-01|work=Premium Times Nigeria|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he then returned to London and set up The Catalan Corporation, an investment company.

== Notable achievements ==
Under his leadership, GLO significantly increased its national cell tower coverage in [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], &amp; [[Benin|Benin Republic]], increased its overall revenue, and embraced new technologies to enhance customer experience and service delivery. In 2011, he led [[Conoil|ConOil']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s $1.3 billion bid for Shell’s OML 30 oil block in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yabaleftonline.ng/started-university-graduated-18-paddy-adenuga/|title="I started University at 13 and graduated at 18" — Paddy Adenuga - YabaLeftOnline|date=2018-01-25|work=YabaLeftOnline|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Paddy Adenuga organized an almost successful acquisition of the entire business and assets of [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] in the [[Netherlands]] - he was 29 years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2018/01/30/globacom-boss-son-paddy-adenuga-nearly-acquired-chevron-netherlands/|title=How Globacom boss' son Paddy Adenuga nearly acquired Chevron Netherlands - PM NEWS Nigeria|date=2018-01-30|work=PM NEWS Nigeria|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://punchng.com/nigerians-react-to-paddy-adenuga-chevrons-story/|title=Nigerians react to Paddy Adenuga Chevron’s story|work=Punch Newspapers|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecable.ng/paddy-adenuga-nearly-bought-chevron-netherlands-long-read|title=Paddy Adenuga: How I NEARLY bought Chevron Netherlands (long read) - TheCable|date=2018-01-30|work=TheCable|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paek Son-haeng''' (1848 November – 1933) was a [[Korean people|Korean]] businesswoman known for her [[philanthropy]].  The name "Son Haeng" means virtuous deeds, and was a nickname bestowed on her due to her contributions.  North Korean sources claim that she was born in modern-day Chung-kuyŏk, [[Pyongyang]], but South Korean sources claim that she was born in [[Suwon]].&lt;ref&gt;North:  {{cite web|url=http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/KrOne_magj/news/2006/07-01/2-4.htm|title=인덕높은 애국자로 내세워주시여|work=Uriminzokkiri.com|accessdate=2006-08-03}}
South: {{cite web|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=72683|title=백선행|work=Naver encyclopedia|accessdate=2006-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;   She was widowed at the age of 16 or 20, and spent the rest of her life saving money while spending very little.  Regardless of her place of birth, she spent most of her life in Pyongyang, where most of her donations were made.

Paek has often been used by the North Korean regime as an example of a good capitalist, and contrasted to the majority of capitalists who were miserly and non-patriotic.  She is mentioned in [[Kim Il Sung]]'s ''[[With the Century]]'' as someone respected by the people as "a great war hero" due to her success in making money under the Japanese regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/Newspaper/english/Books/Segi/Segi1/htm/36.htm|title=5. The Song of the River Amnok|accessdate=2006-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2006, her memorial stone was rediscovered and restored in Pyongyang.

Paek made her first major donation after turning 61 in 1908 (see [[East Asian age reckoning]]), when she supported the construction of the Paeksŏn Bridge across the [[Taedong River]].  In 1922, she built a three-story public assembly hall in Pyongyang.  She donated land to the [[Kwangson School]], a public school in Pyongyang, in 1923, and to the [[Changdok School]] in 1924.  Thereafter she also provided land and an endowment to the school run by [[Samuel Austin Moffet]], and also provided large amounts land to the [[Sunghyon School]] in Pyongyang.   In 1925, she donated her entire fortune to charity groups.

The [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial government]] offered her an award for her contributions, but she refused.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

The '''Parc d'entreprises de la Pointe-Saint-Charles''', formerly known as the '''Montreal Technoparc''' and '''Adacport''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/page/librairie_en/documents/LettreGeraldTremblayChefspartispoliEng.pdf&amp;nbsp;— letter from Gerald Tremblay to Stephen Harper asking for federal government support for decontamination&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[industrial park]] and former industrial dump in the [[Pointe-Saint-Charles]] neighbourhood of [[Montreal]], between the [[pont Champlain|Champlain]] and [[pont Victoria|Victoria]] bridges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=76d95baa-6189-4060-88c7-2e5e452f95fd&amp;nbsp;— Montreal Gazette article about contamination at the site.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site was formerly marshland adjacent to the [[St. Lawrence River]].  It was used as a landfill and dumpsite from 1866 until 1966, and then was paved to serve as a parking lot for [[Expo 67]] and was named ''Autoparc Victoria''. Following the Expo, it briefly served as the site of the [[Victoria STOLport]], or ''ADACport'' in French.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3769">'''Phase-jitter modulation (PJM)''' is a modulation method&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=1999034526 WO/1999/034526 "Transmitter and Method for Transmitting Data"].&lt;/ref&gt; specifically designed to meet the unique requirements of passive [[RFID]] tags. It has been adopted by the high-frequency RFID Air Interface Standard [[ISO/IEC 18000-3 MODE 2]] for high-speed bulk conveyor-fed item-level identification&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=53424 ISO/IEC 18000-3 Section 8 "Table of characteristic differences between the MODES"].&lt;/ref&gt; because of its demonstrably higher data rates. The MODE 2 PJM data rate is 423,75 kbit/s; 16 times faster than the alternative MODE 1 system [[ISO/IEC 18000|ISO/IEC 18000-3 MODE 1]] and the legacy HF system [[ISO/IEC 15693]].

== Method ==
PJM works by representing data as very small phase changes in the instantaneous phase of a carrier signal. PJM can be regarded as a very low-level [[phase-modulation]] (PM) signal where [[amplitude-modulation]] (AM) components are suppressed to provide a constant-modulus signal. Most of the power (greater than 99%) in a PJM signal is transmitted as an un-modulated carrier and conveys no information. Less than 1% of the transmitted power is used for conveying the modulated data. 

Passive [[RFID]] tags have no internal power source and derive their power from an external power source, typically the interrogating signal generated by an RFID interrogator. The interrogation signal is required to both power and communicate with the RFID tag. For a PJM signal the un-modulated carrier component powers the passive tag and the low-level modulated component conveys data to the tag. The tag uses the un-modulated carrier signal as a phase reference for demodulating the data signal. There is no reduction in the transfer of power to the tag during PJM.

There are international&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/net/home/index.aspx International Telecommunications Union (ITU)].&lt;/ref&gt; and US&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/Technologies/ShortRangeDevices.aspx ETSI EN 300 330-1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.fcc.gov/oet/info/rules/ FCC Title 47 Part 15].&lt;/ref&gt; regulations that restrict the spectrum of the transmitted interrogation signal used by any RFID system. These regulations mandate a spectral mask&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erodocdb.dk/Docs/doc98/official/pdf/REC7003E.PDF ERC/REC 70-03].&lt;/ref&gt; that restricts both the frequency and amplitude of the interrogation signal. For a PJM signal the powering signal and the modulated data signal components are decoupled allowing the spectrum of the PJM signal to be matched to the spectral mask defined under these regulations by suitable amplitude adjustment of the un-modulated carrier and encoding and/or filtering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2008089507 WO/2008/089507 "Communication Method and Device"].&lt;/ref&gt; of the modulated data signal.

== Applications ==
Primary applications are in RFID tags for use in gaming, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, document and media management.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.medialine.de/media/uploads/projekt/medialine/docs/forschung/magazinreader/RFID_Journal_050609_Auszug_FOCUS.pdf RFID Journal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719060820/http://www.medialine.de/media/uploads/projekt/medialine/docs/forschung/magazinreader/RFID_Journal_050609_Auszug_FOCUS.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raphael Cohen''' (born 1953) is a professor, lecturer, author, serial entrepreneur and [[business angel]]. He has a PhD in economics from Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAPHAEL COHEN  SERIAL-ENTREPRENEUR and BUSINESS BOOSTER|url=http://getratex.ch/left3_1.html|work=Management Boosters|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the owner and managing director of Getratex SA, as well as academic director of the entrepreneurship and business development specialization of the eMBA at the University of Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raphael Cohen - CEO at Getratex SA|url=http://www.world-entrepreneurship-forum.com/Communities/Members/Cohen-Raphael|work=World Entrepreneurship Forum|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been managing an international group of companies since before earning his PhD in economics in 1982.

Raphael has come up with the IpOp Model, an approach to innovation and corporate entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raphael|first=Cohen|author2=Heribert Watzke Jerome Katz |title=USASBE 2010 Workshop -IpOp Model and Opportunity Case|year=2010|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/59854046/USASBE-2010-Workshop-IpOp-Model-and-Opportunity-Case-2-8-6-3|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model is one of several attempting to help companies in their innovation management.

==Life and early career==
Cohen started his career at Getratex SA in 1975, where his first intrapreneurial opportunity was to create a new business unit to sell fashion wear. This unit eventually became one of the most dynamic licensees of Walt Disney as the first to sell Disney sportswear successfully to adults in North America and Europe. To reduce his exposure to the fashion industry, in 1980 he initiated a diversification, which led him to invest in several startups. Since he became a business angel Cohen has been involved in many businesses including tourist attractions, theming of public areas, surface treatments, financial derivatives, internet marketing, software, skin treatments, retail, real estate, construction and high-tech projects. As a trusted advisor for several large corporations he became an expert in corporate innovation and intrapreneurship.

==Career==

===Management Boosters===
Cohen started Management Boosters in 2001, as a division of Getratex SA, to provide corporate clients with consulting and training services focusing on the acquisition of competitive advantages. Management Boosters offers training, consulting, mentoring &amp; coaching, facilitation and lecturing.

===University of Geneva ===
Since 2001, Cohen has been the academic co-director of the entrepreneurship specialization of the eMBA of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, to design and run the first MBA in continental Europe focusing on innovation, entrepreneurship and business development &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hec Geneve|url=http://www.hec.unige.ch/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=423&amp;lang=fr|work=Website Of Universite De Geneve|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic contributions ==

===IpOp Model ===
Cohen developed the IpOp Model as a potential roadmap during the pre-project/ideation stage of seizing an opportunity. The model is meant to help innovators analyze and mature their idea to produce an opportunity case or a business plan to convince themselves and decision-makers, such as investors or management of the merits of the opportunity.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raphael Cohen CEO at Getratex SA|url=http://www.world-entrepreneurship-forum.com/Communities/Members/Cohen-Raphael|work=World Entrepreneurship Forum|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MicroMBA MB===
To help organizations benefit from the innovative ability of their employees Cohen has designed and implemented the MicroMBA MB program. Combining the IpOp Model with the fundamentals taught in an executive MBA, the MicroMBA MB enables middle managers to become proactive agents of change. Participants in the program must identify and implement a real project that supports the strategy of their employer. These projects translate into a measurable return of investment for the organization,  turning training into a profit center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turning Caterpillars Into Agile And Passionate Butterflies|url=http://www.winning-opportunities.org/?page_id=74|work=Winning Opportunities|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anders Ruben Rausing'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KFFR-XSJ|title=Immigration papers for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-sv|ˈrʉːbɛn ²raʊsɪŋ|-|Sv-Ruben_Rausing.ogg}}; [[Name at birth|né]] Andersson; 17 June 1895 – 8 October 1983) was the founder of the [[liquid]] [[food]] [[packaging]] company [[Tetra Pak]].

==Early life==
Anders Ruben Andersson was born in 1895 in [[Råå]], a small fishing hamlet in the district of Raus outside of [[Helsingborg]] in the south of [[Sweden]], to August and Mathilda Andersson. His father ran a small but successful business as a master painter.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, Lars, ''Tetra Pak. A Vision Becomes Reality. A company history with a difference'', Lund: Tetra Pak International  1996 ({{ISBN|91-630-4789-6}}), pp. 13 and 20&lt;/ref&gt; Rausing went to Upper Secondary School in [[Helsingborg]], graduating in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Idem&lt;/ref&gt; When doing his military service, Rausing, at the time still called (Anders) Ruben Andersson, was allegedly nicknamed ''rausingen'' by his fellow servicemen, meaning "the lad from Raus".&lt;ref&gt;Idem&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a liking to this name, he eventually changed his surname from Andersson to Rausing. Another alleged reason for changing the family name is that the name of the parish in Råå, where they lived, was Raus. The change took place in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wallencpa.com/blog/tag/a-rausing-is-a-rausing-is-a-rausing|title=A Rausing is a Rausing is a Rausing|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715060246/http://wallencpa.com/blog/tag/a-rausing-is-a-rausing-is-a-rausing/|archive-date=2012-07-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
With the help of a loan from his aunt, Rausing studied at the recently founded [[Stockholm School of Economics|Stockholm School of Economics and Business Administration]], graduating in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhs.se/se/BusinessAndSociety/Documents/4.pdf Ruben Rausing] Stockholm School of Economics and Business Administration 1909-2009, retrieved 2 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leander, Lars, ''Tetra Pak. A Vision Becomes Reality. A company history with a difference'', Lund: Tetra Pak International  1996 ({{ISBN|91-630-4789-6}}), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief engagement at the privately owned [[Stockholms Enskilda Bank]], Rausing was employed by Sveriges Litografiska Tryckerier, SLT (later renamed [[Esselte]]), a well-known printing company. In 1919 he earned a scholarship from  [[Stockholm School of Economics|SSE]] to continue his studies at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]] and obtained a [[MSc]] in [[Economics]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Idem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tetrapak.com/about_tetra_pak/the_company/history/pages/ourfounder.aspx Ruben Rausing] Tetrapak.com, retrieved 1 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Experiencing self-service grocery stores for the first time during his stay in America, Rausing realised that this system, yet unknown in Europe, was going to be part of a new way of retailing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/tetra-pak-international-s-a Tetra Pak International S.A.] Frederick C. Ingram in ''The Gale Directory of Company Histories'', retrieved 30 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tetrapak.com/about_tetra_pak/the_company/history/pages/ourfounder.aspx Ruben Rausing] Tetrapak.com, retrieved 1 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Sweden in 1920, Rausing continued his employment at SLT, first as a Manager Assistant and then as a Manager. During his time at SLT, Rausing became closely acquainted with the industrialist Erik Åkerlund and in 1929 Rausing left SLT to form a new packaging company together with Åkerlund in [[Malmö]], Åkerlund &amp; Rausing. Åkerlund &amp; Rausing was the first packaging company in Scandinavia and eventually became a leading manufacturer of dry food carton packages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tetrapak.com/about_tetra_pak/the_company/history/pages/ourfounder.aspx Ruben Rausing] Tetrapak.com, retrieved 1 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leander, Lars, ''Tetra Pak. A Vision Becomes Reality. A company history with a difference'', Lund: Tetra Pak International  1996 ({{ISBN|91-630-4789-6}}), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, however, the company had difficulties making profits and in 1933 Åkerlund sold his share to Rausing, who became the sole owner.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, Lars, ''Tetra Pak. A Vision Becomes Reality. A company history with a difference'', Lund: Tetra Pak International  1996 ({{ISBN|91-630-4789-6}}), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, non-carbonated drinks such as milk and juices were sold in heavy and cumbersome glass bottles and Rausing was determined to find a way of implementing the new, modern packaging technology, spending a lot of resources on developing new concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, Lars, ''Tetra Pak. A Vision Becomes Reality. A company history with a difference'', Lund: Tetra Pak International  1996 ({{ISBN|91-630-4789-6}}), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; With the aim of producing a carton container for liquid foods, similar to the hygienic and practical wax-coated paper cartons Rausing had seen overseas, Åkerlund &amp; Rausing created the plastic-coated carton [[tetrahedron]], patented on 27 March 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Idem p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sedig, Kjell, ''Swedish Innovations'', Stockholm: The Swedish Institute 2002 ({{ISBN|91-520-0910-6}}), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 there was still no viable packaging material for the new package, and efforts to develop packaging material increased.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, Lars, ''Tetra Pak. A Vision Becomes Reality. A company history with a difference'', Lund: Tetra Pak International  1996 ({{ISBN|91-630-4789-6}}), appendix p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1952, the first machine producing [[tetrahedron]] cream packages was sold to Lundabygdens Mejeri, a local dairy.&lt;ref&gt;Idem&lt;/ref&gt; The new packaging system was not an immediate success and the company had difficulties throughout the 1950s, with Rausing continuing to spend large amounts on development. Initially catering primarily to the Swedish market, the company expanded gradually, with [[Germany]] (1954), [[France]] (1954) and [[Italy]] (1956) as its first export markets.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, Lars, ''Tetra Pak. A Vision Becomes Reality. A company history with a difference'', Lund: Tetra Pak International  1996 ({{ISBN|91-630-4789-6}}), pp. 195, 165 and 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetra Pak's commercial break-through did not arrive until the mid-60s with the new [[Tetra Brik]] package, introduced in 1963, and the development of the [[aseptic processing|Aseptic technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Sedig, Kjell, ''Swedish Innovations'', Stockholm: The Swedish Institute 2002 ({{ISBN|91-520-0910-6}}), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The late 1960s and the 1970s saw a global expansion of the company, much due to the new [[Tetra Brik Aseptic]] package, debuted in 1968, which opened up new markets in the developing world and sparked off a virtual explosion in sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/tetra-pak-international-s-a Tetra Pak International S.A.] Frederick C. Ingram in ''The Gale Directory of Company Histories'', retrieved 30 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; After 30 years, Rausing's venture was successful and Tetra Pak eventually became one of the leading food processing and packaging company in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packagingeurope.com/Packaging-Europe-News/44268/Tetra-Pak-launches-nextgeneration-cheese-production-unit.html Tetra Pak launches next generation cheese production unit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924063133/http://www.packagingeurope.com/Packaging-Europe-News/44268/Tetra-Pak-launches-nextgeneration-cheese-production-unit.html |date=24 September 2015 }} Packaging Europe News, retrieved 11 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Rausing was made [[Doctor Honoris Causa]] in [[Medicine]] at [[Lund University]] in 1957, in [[Economics]] at the [[Stockholm School of Economics|Stockholm School of Economics and Business Administration]] in 1959 and in [[Technology]] at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/vemardet/1969/0802.html Ruben Rausing] Who's Who 1969 (Swedish), retrieved 2 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kth.se/om/fame/hedersdoktorer/hedersdoktorer-1944-2009-1.3974 The Royal Institute of Technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024222513/http://www.kth.se/om/fame/hedersdoktorer/hedersdoktorer-1944-2009-1.3974 |date=24 October 2011 }} List of Honorary Doctors, retrieved 2 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences]] (Ingenjörsvetenskapsakademin, IVA).

==Personal life==
Ruben Rausing was married to Elisabeth (née Varenius) and had three sons, [[Hans Rausing|Hans]], [[Gad Rausing|Gad]] and Sven. For tax reasons, Rausing left Sweden for [[Rome]] in 1969. All his life, however, he kept his country home Simontorp, near Lund.

'''The Rushmore Reviews''' is a company based in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]] that collects, analyzes and publishes [[Offset Well Data|offset well data]] for participating [[Company|Operators]] in the [[oil industry]]. The content of their extensive, global database is exclusively available to Review participants, who are then able to use the shared data to benchmark their own performance against others in the industry.

==History==
The Reviews began in 1993 when a group of oil operators, led by [[BP]], outsourced the production of the data collection and analysis project they had been conducting since 1988 to the Rushmore Reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epmag.com/EP-Magazine/archive/Benchmark-a-drilling-boost_2795| title=2003 Article}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a joint venture between two independent companies, Rushmore Associates Ltd (founded by Peter and Helen Rushmore) and the Sigma Consultancy (founded by Tim Stapenhurst and wife Pat). They shared offices and provided data to participants through a web-based portal. The Sigma Consultancy was purchased from the Stapenhursts on 30 April 2010, by Peter and Helen Rushmore, leaving the Rushmores the sole owners of the Rushmore Reviews.

Participants meet annually in Aberdeen Scotland to discuss and agree any changes to the data being shared and the rules under which it is shared. The 2013 annual meetings, hosted by both Helen and Peter Rushmore, marked 25 years of the Reviews, and 20 years since the outsourcing to Rushmore Reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://rushmorereviews.com/np/issue26_np_web.html| title=Companies December 2013 newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth of the Reviews==
Initially in 1989 the Reviews consisted of twelve operators, who agreed a process for sharing [[Offset Well Data|offset drilling data]] for the first time. A standard set of metrics and definitions were employed by all twelve, and quality control was added to ensure the data was sufficiently reliable to be of real use to them. This became known as the Drilling Performance Review (DPR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rushmorereviews.com/liveMarketing/Reviews/Dpr| title=DPR History}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Until 1993 the DPR was managed by the Operators themselves. However this was not a core activity for them and it was agreed that the DPR would be outsourced to Rushmore Reviews, who worked to increase the scope of the Reviews, as requested by the existing participants. Eventually the DPR grew to hold data for more than 50,000 wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rushmorereviews.com/livemarketing/| title=Company website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants meet annually in [[Aberdeen]] to consider the Reviews and discuss/agree upon any revisions they require for the following year, ensuring that the Reviews continue to evolve and grow. 1994 saw the establishment of the Completions Performance Review (CPR), now containing information and schematics on the completion of over 12,000 offset wells in over 60 countries. Following an increasing number of well abandonments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.spe.org/twa/print/archives/2013/2013v9n3/13_Tech101_FINAL.pdf| title=SPE archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; demand grew among participants for the Abandonment Performance Review (APR) which began in 2008. The APR contains data for over 300 permanently [[Oil well#Abandonment|abandoned wells]], mainly situated in Europe.

In 2011 the Interventions Performance Review (IPR) was initiated after new products and services available in the industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slb.com/services/well_intervention.aspx| title=Schumberger Intervention services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bakerhughes.com/products-and-services/completions/wellbore-intervention| title=Baker Hughes Well Interventions}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased the productivity of [[Well interventions|interventions]] for some participants of other Reviews, yet there was no performance benchmarking available in this area.

The Shale Performance Review (SPR), starting in 2012 contains information on the drilling, completion and frac'ing of offset multi-stage frac’ed wells. The SPR dataset includes multiple reservoir types, such as shale, sandstone, carbonate, siltstone, limestone and others. Over 7000 wells drilled since 2011 are included, covering Canada, USA, Argentina, Australia, China, Colombia, Jordan, Indonesia, Poland and Sweden.

In an increasingly competitive industry, [[benchmarking]] has grown popular amongst oil and gas Operators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/US_E_and_P_benchmark_study_-_June_2012/$FILE/US_EP_benchmark_study_2012.pdf| title=US E&amp;P benchmark study}}&lt;/ref&gt; explaining why participation in the Rushmore Reviews has grown steadily. The dataset contains a large amount of [[Offset Well Data|offset well data]] encompassing drilling, completions, shale, interventions and abandonments. As of 2013, the Reviews contain data for over 50,000 wells, from conventional [[hydrocarbon]] to [[shale]] and [[coal seam gas]] wells. Over 100 countries feature in the Reviews, and the vast majority of Operating companies have made contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dmi-drillers.com/performance.html| title=DMI Drillers article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012, Rushmore Reviews now hold a second set of annual meetings in [[Houston]] [[Texas]] for participants in the Shale Performance Review which continues to grow rapidly, with the notable addition of [[Chesapeake Energy]] to the Review in 2014;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rushmorereviews.com/liveMarketing/News/article5| title=News, Rushmorereviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second-largest natural gas producer in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chk.com/Pages/default.aspx| title=Chesapeake.com homepage| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315143547/http://www.chk.com/Pages/default.aspx| archivedate=15 March 2014| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IHS Acquisition==
On 5 February 2015, Denver based [[IHS Inc.|IHS]] acquired Rushmore Reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://press.ihs.com/press-release/corporate-financial/ihs-acquires-rushmore-reviews-leading-service-provider-drilling-an| title=IHS Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participant Website Tools==
Participants of the Reviews are provided with secure website access in order to view [[Offset Well Data|offset well data]]. The data is searchable and can be filtered by the user. The data may also be downloaded in Excel format.  Additionally there are a range of analytical tools available to study the data. These include performance metrics (P10, P25, P50, P75, P90, Min, Mean, Max etc.) as well as the facility to draw a range of different chart types.

Amongst the collection of tools, the [[Rushmore Drilling Index|Rushmore Drilling Index (RDI)]] and [[Rushmore Drilling Index &amp; Estimated Drilling Days|Rushmore Estimated Drilling Data (REDD)]], both designed and owned by the company, are particularly noteworthy. Designed as objective tools for well planning, they index the difficulty and indicate the amount of time a planned well is likely to take to drill to target depth.

==Activity in Financial Committee==

Serhii Rybalka chaired VR Financial Policy and Banking Committee based on political quota of the Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko, which was a part of democratic coalition until the autumn 2015. After withdrawal of the faction from the coalition, all faction members that chaired parliamentary committees turned in their resignations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unian.info/politics/1117546-lyashko-faction-quits-coalition.html|title=Lyashko faction quits coalition|last=|first=|date=|website=unian.info|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These resignations, however, were not considered by the Regulatory Committee and the Verkhovna Rada for two years.

As the chair of the financial policy and banking committee, Serhii Rybalka focused on the reforms in the banking sector. Specifically, under his leadership, a group of highly respected experts, employees of NBU, commercial banks, economists and scholars developed the Strategy of Banking Sector Development in Ukraine until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rada.gov.ua/en/news/news/News/128709.html|title=Draft Strategy for developing Ukrainian banking system presented at round table at Committee on Financial Policy and Banking|last=|first=|date=|website=rada.gov.ua|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first time, when the parliamentary committee initiated its own strategy for a whole industry. The document was approved at the meeting of the committee and recommended for the introduction to the parliament and the government of Ukraine.

The strategy provided an analysis of the operation of the National bank in relation to providing stability of the national currency – hryvnia for the first time (which is its constitutional obligation), withdrawing problem banks from the market (in 2014-2017, over 90 banks, which is half of all banking institutions in the country, were withdrawn from the market). In addition, it provided analysis of the factors suppressing financing of the economy, absence of export support and the role of state banks in the financial system of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forum-strategy.com/draft-strategy|title=Draft of the Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=forum-strategy.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategy proposed to increase transparency of NBU's operation, introduce instruments to encourage development of hi-tech productions, activate financing, increase liability for violating banking laws, in particular bankrupting a bank. Rybalka and experts also proposed to create a number of development institutes on the basis of state banks to support not only big businesses, but also small and medium enterprises, improve domestic demand, support exporters and develop hi-tech branches of production.

With Serhii Rybalka as the chair of the committee, an open competition for the positions of members of the NBU Council, a supervisory constitutional body the controls how NBU exercises its authority, was introduced for the first time. Specifically, the committee reviewed programs of candidates from different political forces, before making a recommendation to the Verkhovna Rada on the candidates to be approved as the members of the NBU Council by the parliament's quota.

Also, in 2014-2017, Rybalka and VR Committee on Financial Policy and Banking drafted and introduced to the Verkhovna Rada a number of draft laws aimed at reforming the financial sector.

Specifically, these include draft laws on improving trust towards the banking system, on the deposit guarantee system for individuals, on supporting export, on minimum size of banks' capital, on credit register, on improving transparency of operation of the National Bank, on protection of rights of consumers of financial services, on stimulating financing in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://serhiyrybalka.com/a_unified_credit_registry_will_strengthen_the_banking_system|title=Serhiy Rybalka: "A unified credit registry will strengthen the banking system"|last=|first=|date=|website=serhiyrybalka.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Implementation of a number of reforms, reflected in these draft laws, is a part of requirements of the International Monetary Fund within the package of the reforms that must be implemented in order to continue cooperation with Ukraine along with the demand to create anti-corruption court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukranews.com/en/news/534623-financial-sector-reform-is-needed-for-ukraine-not-for-western-creditors-serhii-rybalka|title=Financial sector reform is needed for Ukraine, not for Western creditors – Serhii Rybalka|last=|first=|date=|website=ukranews.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, under Rybalka's leadership, the Committee initiated the development of draft laws regulating circulation of cryptocurrency in Ukraine.[[Serhiy Rybalka (politician)#cite note-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The draft law envisages introduction of instruments of protection of unqualified investors and also preferential conditions for development of blockchain infrastructure.

However, the parliament's unwillingness to introduce financial reforms, including those initiated by the committee chaired by Rybalka, resulted into suspension of financial assistance to Ukraine from the international partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukranews.com/en/news/537490-we-need-a-more-united-effort-to-push-for-reforms-serhii-rybalka-at-the-general-meeting-of-the|title=We need a more united effort to push for reforms – Serhii Rybalka|last=|first=|date=|website=ukranews.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity as a member of USA-Ukraine inter-parliamentary group==

Serhii Rybalka as the Chair of the VR Committee on Financial Policy and Banking and a member of the USA-Ukraine inter-parliamentary group regularly pays working visits to Washington. In 2017, he met with a number of chairs of committees of the US Congress, held a number of meetings at the IMF, IRI, Heritage Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukranews.com/en/news/535987-mp-rybalka-spoke-in-washington-dc-about-corruption-and-the-sabotage-of-reforms-in-ukraine|title=MP Rybalka spoke in Washington D.C. about corruption and the sabotage of reforms in Ukraine|last=|first=|date=|website=ukranews.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues discussed at the meetings included reforms progress in the sphere of finance and also law enforcement and judicial systems, U.S. experience in supporting small and medium enterprises as well as high level of political corruption in the contest of creating and organizing the work of the anti-corruption court.

==Political Persecution==

Since 2013 his family's business and Rybalka himself have been persecuted for his political activity. Specifically, the media reported the first searches in January 2014. Later, the family's company was accused of tax evasion, drug trade, illegal surveillance, fraud and many other crimes, although every time none of these accusations were proven in court.

Moreover, there have also been murder attempts against Rybalka and his close ally, S.Group top manager Serhiy Bilyy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epravda.com.ua/rus/news/2017/01/11/617249/|title=S.Group accuses "ATB-Market" of attempted murder of the top-manager of the company|last=|first=|date=|website=epravda.com.ua|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the financial managers of the company Iryna Savytska is also being persecuted; she is currently under arrest in Georgia on trumped-up charges of fraudulent actions. American media has written a lot about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2017/09/03/the-casualties-of-business-warfare-in-eastern-europe-have-a-human-face/|title=The casualties of business warfare in Eastern Europe have a human face|last=|first=|date=|website=ocregister.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/oct/25/family-feud-ukraine-turns-ugly-shades-james-comeys/|title=Family feud in Ukraine turns ugly; Showing shades of James Comey's FBI?|last=|first=|date=|website=washingtontimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/oct/19/iryna-savytskaya-case-deserves-the-attention-of-fe/|title=A case of abuse feminists should really care about|last=|first=|date=|website=washingtontimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for The Washington Times, former employee of Prosecutor General Office of Ukraine Dmytro Sus told how the PGO employees falsified cases against Rybalka and company. Hennadii Butkevych could have been behind these falsified cases, said Sus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgLW7lwIsec&amp;t=565s|title=Dmytro Sus talks to American journalist|last=|first=|date=|website=youtube.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the moment, the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine initiated criminal proceedings regarding these facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukranews.com/en/news/534180-national-anti-corruption-bureau-of-ukraine-initiated-investigation-on-fabrication-of-criminal-cases|title=National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine initiated investigation on fabrication of criminal cases against MP Rybalka|last=|first=|date=|website=ukranews.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2075">A {{nihongo|'''shihainin'''|支配人||lit. "manager"}} is an authorized representative of a [[company]] or unincorporated [[business]] under [[Japan]]ese [[commercial law]].

A shihainin has full legal authority to represent the company/business at the place of business to which the shihainin is assigned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houko.com/00/01/M32/048.HTM Commercial Code], article 21; [http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/hourei/data/CA1_4_2.pdf Companies Act], article 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This authority may be restricted, but any restriction is unassertable against a third party acting in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houko.com/00/01/M32/048.HTM Commercial Code], article 21.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The status is often granted to the managers of regional or local offices of the company, as well as to managers at the head office. Directors and [[corporate officer]]s (but not [[statutory auditor]]s) may be granted shihainin status in addition to any other titles they hold within the company. The term can lead to confusion in translation, as the literal translation of "manager" may be confused with internal "manager" titles that do not necessarily denote shihainin status.

In most businesses, the term is mainly used in corporate legal documents. However, it is popular in certain industries, such as [[hotel]]s and [[restaurant]]s, as the sole designation for the manager of a particular property.

Company shihainin are generally appointed by the [[board of director]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/hourei/data/CA1_4_2.pdf Companies Act], article 348.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Their name, date of birth, residential address and place of business is recorded in the [[commercial register]] at the [[Legal Affairs Bureau]] and kept as [[public record]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houko.com/00/01/M32/048.HTM Commercial Code], article 22; [http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/hourei/data/CA1_4_2.pdf Companies Act], article 918; [http://www.houko.com/00/01/S38/125.HTM Commercial Registration Act], article 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social innovations''' are new [[strategies]], [[concept]]s, [[idea]]s and organizations that aim to meet [[social]] needs resulting from [[working condition]]s, [[education]], [[community development]], and [[health]]. These ideas are created with the goal of extending and strengthening [[civil society]]. Social innovation includes the social ''processes'' of innovation, such as open source methods and techniques and also the [[innovation]]s which have a [[social purpose]]—like [[activism]], [[online volunteering]], [[microcredit]], or [[Distance education|distance learning]].

Prominent innovators associated with the term include Pakistani [[Akhter Hameed Khan]], Bangladeshi [[Muhammad Yunus (economist)|Muhammad Yunus]], the founder of [[Grameen Bank]] which pioneered the concept of [[microcredit]] for supporting innovations in many developing countries such as Asia, Africa and Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Domanski, Monge, Quitiaquez, Rocha|title=Innovación Social en Latinoamérica|date=2016|publisher=Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios|isbn=978-958-763-196-8|url=http://sfs.tu-dortmund.de/Publikationen/Innovacion_Social_en_Latinoamerica.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired programs like the [[Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foreign |first=Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2226809/Info-Ladies-bringing-internet-bike-remote-villages-Bangladesh.html |title=Info Ladies bringing the internet by bike to the remote villages of Bangladesh &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-11-02 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asafeworldforwomen.org/global-news/asia/bangladesh/3284-internet-info-ladies.html |title=Internet rolls into Bangladesh villages on a bike |publisher=Asafeworldforwomen.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh |title=Info Ladies – Riding Internet into Rural Bangladesh! |publisher=Amader Kotha |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2014-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317182454/http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh/ |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Dnet (A Social Enterprise)]]. 

==Focus and application==
Social Innovation has an inter-sectoral approach and is universally applicable. Social Innovations are launched by a variety of actors, including research institutions, companies and independent organizations, which tend to use their respective definitions of Social Innovation. Therefore, it is worth discussing what distinguishes it from other forms of social work or [[innovation]]. 

Social Innovation focuses on the process of innovation, how innovation and change take shape (as opposed to the more traditional definition of innovation, giving priority to the internal organization of firms and their productivity). It likewise centers on new work and new forms of cooperation (business models),&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;Klievink, B., &amp; Janssen, M. (2014). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10580530.2014.923268 "Developing multi-layer information infrastructures: advancing social innovation through public-private governance"]  "Information Systems Management" 31:240–249&lt;/ref&gt; especially on those that work towards the attainment of a sustainable society.

The Young Foundation, in order to distinguish between social and business innovation, stressed that social innovation is developed and diffused via organisations, whose primary purposes are not centred on mere profit maximisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Innovation. What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated|last=Mulgan|first=Tucker|publisher=The Young Foundation|year=2007|isbn=|location=London|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of European Policy Advisers more precisely defined social innovation as socially oriented in both ends and means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=). Empowering People, Driving Change: Social Innovation in the European Union|last=Hubert|first=A,|publisher=BEPA – Bureau of European Policy Advisers|year=2010|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these influential definitions, social innovation is characterised by: the capacity to address social needs that traditional policy seems increasingly unable to tackle; the empowerment of groups and individuals; and the willingness to change social relations. Hence, social innovation is often presented as a way to increase the quality of social services and their cost-effectiveness, offering equivalent, if not superior, outcomes despite considerable budget constraints.

Social innovation can take place within [[government]]; the for-profit sector, the [[nonprofit]] sector (also known as the third sector), or in the spaces between them. Research has focused on the types of platforms needed to facilitate such cross-sector collaborative social innovation.

[[Social entrepreneurship]], like social enterprise, is typically in the nonprofit sector excluding both for-profit and public organizations. Both social entrepreneurship and social enterprise are important contributions to social innovation by creating social value and introducing new ways of achieving goals. Social entrepreneurship brings "new patterns and possibilities for innovation" and are willing to do things that existing organizations are not willing to do.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"&gt;James A. Phills Jr., Kriss Deiglmeier, &amp; Dale T. Miller "Rediscovering Social Innovation", Stanford Social Innovation Review Fall 2008.[http://innovationsociale.lu/sites/default/files/2008_Rediscovering%20Social%20Innovation_Phills%26al.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social innovation is often an effort of mental [[creativity]] which involves fluency and flexibility from a wide range of disciplines. The act of social innovation in a sector is mostly connected with diverse disciplines within the society. The social innovation theory of 'connected difference' emphasizes three key dimensions to social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan. Geoff. [http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/research/Pages/socialinnovationpaper.aspx "Social Innovation: What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated: Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, University of Oxford"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902021840/http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/research/Pages/socialinnovationpaper.aspx |date=2012-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, innovations are usually new combinations or hybrids of existing elements, rather than completely new. Second, their practice involves cutting across organizational or disciplinary boundaries. Lastly, they leave behind compelling new relationships between previously separate individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;Nambisan, S. [http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/platforms_for_collaboration "Platforms for Collaboration"], Stanford Social Innovation Review, Summer 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Social innovation is also gaining visibility within academia.&lt;ref&gt;Howaldt, J./ Schwarz, M.
[http://www.internationalmonitoring.de/fileadmin/Downloads/Trendstudien/Trends_V2/IMO-MAG%20Howaldt_final_mit_cover.pdf "Social Innovation: Concepts, research fields and international trends"], IMO international monitoring, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, a subdomain of social innovation has been defined in relation to the introduction of digital technologies. The subdomain is called digital social innovation and refers to "a type of social and collaborative innovation in which innovators, users and communities collaborate using digital technologies to co-create knowledge and solutions for a wide range of social needs and at a scale and speed that was unimaginable before the rise of the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;F. Bria, DSI4EU final report, 2015, available at: http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/dsireport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Social innovation was discussed in the writings of figures such as [[Peter Drucker]] and [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] (founder of the [[Open University]] and dozens of other organizations) in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;see for example Gavron, Dench e ds ''Young at 80'', Carcanet Press, London, 1995 for a comprehensive overview of one of the world's most successful social innovators&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in the work of French writers in the 1970s, such as [[Pierre Rosanvallon]], [[Jacques Fournier]], and [[Jacques Attali]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambon, J.-L, David, A. and Devevey, J.-M (1982), Les Innovations Sociales, Presses Universitaires de France, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; However, the themes and concepts in social innovation existed long before. [[Benjamin Franklin]], for example, talked about small modifications within the social organization of communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15326934CRJ1402_11 |title=Mumford, M.D. (2002) Social Innovation: Ten Cases from Benjamin Franklin, '&amp;#39;Creativity Research Journal'&amp;#39;, 14(2), 253-266 |publisher=Leaonline.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that could help to solve everyday problems. Many radical 19th century [[reform]]ers like [[Robert Owen]], founder of the cooperative movement, promoted innovation in the social field and all of the great sociologists including [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] focused attention on broader processes of [[social change]].  Other theories of innovation became prominent in the 20th century, many of which had social implications, without putting social progress at the center of the theory. [[Joseph Schumpeter]], for example, addressed the process of [[innovation]] directly with his theory of [[creative destruction]] and his definition of entrepreneurs as people who combined existing elements in new ways to create a new product or service. Beginning in the 1980s, writers on technological change increasingly addressed how social factors affect technology diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;notably in the writings of [[Christopher Freeman]], Carlotta Perez, Ian Miles and others&lt;/ref&gt;

The article "Rediscovering Social Innovation" mentions how social innovations are dependent on history and the change in institutions. The article discusses the ten recent social innovations reflecting current change to include:
* '''Charter Schools:''' Charter schools are a social innovation that provides an alternative avenue for students to continue to develop and build upon their educational foundation without many of the issues prominent in the public school system. These primary and secondary schools are publicly funded and operate independently, which allows the teachers and parents to collaboratively develop alternative teaching methods for their students as related regulations are less stringent for Charter Schools.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Charter School." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, n.d. Web. Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Community-Centered Planning:''' This social innovation allows communities to plan and develop systems that cater solutions to their specific local needs by using their historical knowledge and other local resources.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Emissions Trading:''' The Emissions Trading program was designed to address issues associated with the continuous increase in pollution. The program provides solutions such as setting a cap on the amount that certain pollutants can be emitted, and implementing a permit system to control the amount of pollution produced by each participating business. If a business needs to use more pollution than permitted, it can purchase credits from a business that has not emitted its maximum permitted amount. The goal of the Emissions Trading program is that, over time and with increased awareness, society will limit the types and the numbers of pollutants emitted to what is only necessary.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Fair Trade:''' Products including coffee, sugar, and chocolate are currently being traded without high standards that result in tough conditions for farmers and a less sustainable environment. Fair trade is a movement that certifies traders to exchange with the farmers that produce these products. The idea behind this movement is that by being paid a living-wage, being able to meet social and environmental standards and promoting "environmental sustainability, the lives of these farmers will be improved.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Habitat Conservation Plans:''' Habitat Conservation Plans is an effort by the US Fish and Wild Life Service and the Environmental Protection Agency to protect species and their endangerment by providing economical incentives to conserve their habitats and protect these species from endangerment.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Individual Development Accounts:''' This social innovation is made to support the working poor with saving decisions that they have made to better enhance their lives. This initiative will give $2 per every $1 saved by the working poor for College tuition, purchasing a home, starting a business, and other similar and productive initiatives. This is made possible by philanthropic, government and corporate sponsors that donate to this cause.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''International Labor Standards:''' Labor standards differ country-to-country, with some agreeably better than others. In effort to internationally align these, the International Labor Organization, participating governments, and employees contributed to the development of standards that protect workers’ rights to freedom, equity, security, and human dignity".&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Microfinance:''' This social innovation is created to support those financially unable to gain access to financial services such as banking, lending, and insurance. The ultimate goal of Microfinance is to enable an escape from poverty by helping to improve the living conditions and financial viability among the impoverished program participants.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Socially Responsible Investing:''' "An investment strategy that attempts to maximize both financial and social returns. Investors generally favor businesses and other organizations whose practices support environmental sustainability, human rights, and consumer protection."&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Supported Employment:''' Supported Employment is a social innovation geared towards helping disabled or disadvantaged workers who are un- or under-employed due to their condition obtain suitable employment. The Support Employment service provides access to job coaches, transportation, assistive technology, specialized job training, and individual tailored supervision in effort to help program participants become more competitive applicants and better prepared overall for the job market.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Over the last two decades social innovation has gained significant popularity as a strategy to tackle new social risks including population ageing and its health correlates (Hubert, 2010; Mulgan et al., 2007, 2010; Murray, Caulier-Grice and Mulgan, 2010). However, as other concepts recently developed within the academic debate – among them, [[social capital]] (Ferragina, 2012) – social innovation might soon turn out to be simply another way to juxtapose the qualifier "social" to the private sector jargon, in order to avoid heated discussions on structural inequalities (Grisolia and Ferragina, 2015).&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"&gt;Grisolia, Francesco and Ferragina, Emanuele. (2015), "Social Innovation on the Rise: yet another buzzword in a time of austerity?" (Salute e società, Vol. 1(2015), pp. 169-179).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of ‘neoliberal austerity’, a strong call in favour of social innovation might hide the attempt to shift public attention from structural deficiencies and disparities to individual and group responsibility, following the vision: "doing more with less". In order to guarantee universal coverage and universal social rights, however, the welfare state system cannot be managed with the logic of mere cost-effectiveness alone (Grisolia and Ferragina, 2015).&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"/&gt; A Universal coverage is the precondition for any well-functioning economy, not the other way around. As such, the enhancement of "politically motivated policies under the pretence of budget cuts" can be particularly dangerous in its consequences for population health (Kleinert and Horton, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;1074). Social innovation per se might not be able to substantially tackle pressing social needs. Rather, the all-innovating and self-empowering jargon currently in vogue might disguise a dangerous inattention to structural inequalities, adversely affecting health outcomes across the board, but especially of the poorest. Among the therapies prescribed by the neoliberal orthodoxy – liberalisation, deregulation, devolution, individual or group empowerment – social innovation might soon reveal itself as a convenient buzzword, an eclectic concept to dissimulate political choices, legitimated by the doctrine of budgetary constraints.&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"/&gt; The redistribution of resources "from past to present generations" – keeping constant the overall public spending – and the shift from a "transfer-based" to a "service-based" welfare state would represent a truly innovative approach to social policy, offering a credible and responsible alternative to the magic wand of social innovation.

== Developments since 2000 ==
Academic research, [[blogs]] and websites feature social innovation, along with organizations working on the boundaries of research and practical action. Topics include:

* '''Innovation in public services''' was pioneered particularly in some [[Scandinavia]]n and [[List of Asian countries|Asian countries]]. Governments are increasingly recognizing that innovation requires [[healthcare]], schooling and [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/innovation/index.asp Innovation in the Public Sector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110162352/http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/innovation/index.asp |date=2006-11-10 }} an overview of thinking about innovation in the public sector, published by the UK government's Strategy Unit in 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/node/576 Ready or Not?] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070618163301/http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/node/576 |date=2007-06-18 }} published by The Young Foundation in 2007 about the need for public sector organizations to innovate&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Social entrepreneurship]], which is the practice of creating new organizations focusing on non-market activities.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols; ''Social Entrepreneurship, Oxford University Press 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Responsible Research and Innovation]], which takes into account effects and potential impacts on the environment and society.

===Institutional support===
The US created an Office for Social Innovation in the White House, which is funding projects that combine public and private resources.&lt;ref name=economist810/&gt; with foundations that support social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Kohli, J. and Geoff Mulgan (2007) [http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/capital-ideas-july-2010 Capital Ideas. How to Generate Innovation in the Public Sector]. The Young Foundation and Center for American Progress&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the US government listed 11 investments made by its '[[Social Innovation Fund]]', with public funding more than matched by philanthropic organizations. This fund focuses on partnerships with charities, social enterprises, and business.&lt;ref name="economist810"&gt;{{cite news

In addition to pioneered efforts by institutions such as the Harvard Business School's Initiative on Social Enterprise (launched 1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/socialenterprise/ |title=The Social Enterprise Initiative at Harvard Business School |publisher=Hbs.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Said Business School's Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship (launched 2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/ideas-impact/skoll |title=The Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, Said Business School, University of Oxford |publisher=Sbs.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  INSEAD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/centres/social_entrepreneurship/ |title=INSEAD Social Entrepreneurship Programme |publisher=Insead.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other universities now offer short-term programs in Social Innovation, and a few such as [https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/professional-practice/mst-social-innovation/ Cambridge Judge Business School], University of Cambridge and Goldsmiths, University of London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-social-entrepreneurship/ |title=The Goldsmiths MA Programme in Social Entrepreneurship, University of London |publisher=Gold.ac.uk |date=2014-04-16 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer Masters courses dedicated entirely to the study of theory and practice in relation to social entrepreneurship and innovation.

Public policy makers support social innovation in the UK, Australia, China and Denmark, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan, Ali, Tucker; ''Social innovation: what it is, why it matters, how it can be accelerated, published by Said Business School, Oxford, 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union’s innovation strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/index_en.cfm |title=Home page - Innovation Union - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2014-05-13 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first well-funded research and development strategy to emphasize social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, R., Caulier- Grice and Geoff Mulgan (2010) [http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/the-open-book-social-innovation-march-2010 The Open Book of Social Innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008044055/http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/the-open-book-social-innovation-march-2010 |date=2010-10-08 }}. The Young Foundation and NESTA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the South Australian government, led by Premier and Social Inclusion Minister Mike Rann, embraced a ten-year social innovation strategy with big investments and a focus on reform in areas such as homelessness, school retention, mental health and disability services.

The Common Ground&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commonground.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; and Street to Home homelessness initiatives and the Australian Centre for Social Innovation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tacsi.org,au&lt;/ref&gt; were established in Adelaide and many reforms trialed in South Australia have been adopted nationally throughout Australia. This initiative, headed by Monsignor David Cappo, South Australia's Social Inclusion Commissioner, was advised by 'Thinkers in Residence' [[Geoff Mulgan]] and New York social entrepreneur [[Rosanne Haggerty]].

== Role in curbing corruption ==
Lin and Chen, in "The Impact of Societal and Social innovation: a case-based approach" have argued that social innovation's goal is to produce actions that are "socially valuable and good for many".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956953682|title=The impact of societal and social innovation : a case-based approach|last=Yeh-Yun,|first=Lin, Carol|others=Chen, Jeffrey,|isbn=9789811017667|location=Singapore|oclc=956953682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In governance, its main role is to enhance and maximize the trust of citizens through active involvement in society, whether in the public or private sphere.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Social innovation's role in curbing corruption is carried out through two main mediums. Firstly, it is institutionalized through actors (in the public and the private sectors), and secondly, it is executed with new tools available, specifically ICTs.

=== Public participation, governmental action and the private sector against corruption ===

==== Grassroots involvement ====
"Corruption cannot be tackled from the top, it has to be confronted from the grassroots"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/06/corruption-confronted-grassroots-john-githongo-kenya|title='Corruption has to be confronted from the grassroots' {{!}} Madeleine Bunting|last=Bunting|first=Madeleine|date=2011-05-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[John Githongo]], a Kenyan member of [[Transparency International]]. The Stanford Social Innovation Review develops that grassroots innovations emerge through a combination of social and ethical capital. That is especially true when the system in which they lie fails to accommodate to people's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/tapping_the_entrepreneurial_potential_of_grassroots_innovation|title=Tapping the Entrepreneurial Potential of Grassroots Innovation (SSIR)|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fight against corruption, individuals or groups of citizens have used their position to lead battles against corruption. An example is the case of RosPil.net, a [[crowdsourcing]] website relying on anonymous tips and alerts to uncover and expose corruption in Russia,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carnegie.ru/2010/12/08/navalny-effect-rospil.net-pub-42105|title=The Navalny Effect: RosPil.net|last=Petrov|first=Nikolay|work=Carnegie Moscow Center|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether in the private or the public sector. The collective action permits a growing flow of information and offers, on a daily basis, around three promising tip-offs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another example is the initiative Agenda Pública, a Civil Society [[Civil society organisation|Organisation]], which is paving way for transparent governance in Brazil by relying on the education of the country's public administrators,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/06/where-inequality-persists-social-entrepreneurs-can-step-in-to-bridge-the-gap/|title=Where inequality persists, social entrepreneurs can step in to bridge the gap|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in more remote and isolated rural areas. Agenda Pública trained more than 5,000 administrators in policy development and basic infrastructure, in order to promote effective parameters for transparency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They do so by making sure that environmental needs and basic financial, education and overall health are met to circumvent bribing.

===== Women and corruption =====
A [[UNDP]] study conducted amongst women grassroots organization around the world demonstrated that "79% of women are better able to stand up against corruption if affiliated with a community group".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/Democratic%20Governance/Anti-corruption/Grassroots%20women%20and%20anti-corruption.pdf|title=Grassroots, Women and Anti-Corruption|last=UNDP|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll suggested that electing women into power in countries heavily affected by corruption should be strongly accompanied by an affiliation to a mobilized grassroots women's group. Moreover, 83% of female respondents gave preferences to organized women's leadership to pursue anti-corruption policies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Innovation lies mainly in the introduction of programmes facilitating access to information as well as a governance agenda designed to augment women's engagement in [[participatory monitoring]].

==== Private sector ====
Rich and Moberg in "Beyond Governments" claim that companies need to take the largest step against corruption and must engage in collective governance in order to include public policy and standards in their core business. It would be way to promote good practices, specifically socially responsible investing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781351286077|title=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|website=www.taylorfrancis.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 2006, the corporate sector fully funded and instigated the creation and development of the Business Code of Conduct for Combating Corruption in Malawi. It is considered an anti-corruption task force which works hand in hand with local groups, members of governments, civil society and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-2010/african-business-ending-corruption-%E2%80%98priority-number-one%E2%80%99|title=For African business, ending corruption is ‘priority number one’ {{!}} Africa Renewal Online|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Governmental action ====
Anderson, Wu and Cho argue that good governance and its benefits can be extrapolated through effective e-governance. The simplification of administrative task and open data transparency, coupled with a clear policy on corruption can have a substantial impact.They also advocate for the strengthening of the delivery of services by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934513454|title=E-government strategy, ICT and innovation for citizen engagement|others=Anderson, Dennis (College teacher),, Wu, Robert (College teacher),, Cho, June-Suh, 1966-, Schroeder, Katja (Social media strategist),|isbn=9781493933501|location=New York, NY|oclc=934513454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the government introduced in 2016 the Open Government National Action Plan with one of the main aim being improved transparency. One of the main commitments is the establishment of an Anti-Corruption Innovation Hub. It is the use of social innovation to mobilize social actors and entrepreneurs against corruption. It is perceived that it will "catalyze and connect [an] innovation approach" while promoting the sharing of good practices.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-open-government-national-action-plan-2016-18/uk-open-government-national-action-plan-2016-18#commitment-4-anti-corruption-innovation-hub|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their plan of action has been supported by Switzerland, Indonesia, Spain, Georgia, Australia, the UAE, France and Norway.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In Kosovo, Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts in Kosovo (SAEK) has been developed in order to strengthen the capacities of the Kosovo Anti-Corruption Agency (KAA). They are using innovative [[Information and communications technology|ICT]], web2.0 and social media technologies as a way to connect the government and younger generations by utilizing the potential of new technologies as well as "giving citizens the opportunity to voice concerns, share observations online and to make these visible to the public while raising the awareness  on the level and form of corruption occurring in Kosovo".&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undp.akvoapp.org/en/project/936/|title=Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts in Kosovo|last=UNDP|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAEK is considered a success as in the year it was launched, more than 1024 cases of corruption were reported (with half of them now resolved).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Information and communications technology as a tool for transparency ===
According to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development (part of the [[United Nations]]): "in addition to being an important technology sector in its own right, information and communication technology (ICT) is important for linking agents in the innovation system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developmentfinance.un.org/promoting-information-and-communication-technology-access-to-technology-for-all-and-social-innovation|title=Promoting information and communication technology, access to technology for all and social innovation {{!}} Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development|website=developmentfinance.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Open data and data mining ====
Open data is currently arising as a corruption-fighting mechanism. Indeed, as transparency in government data increases and becomes accessible to all, there will be opportunities for better accountability as it will increase the odds of uncovering governmental misconduct (specifically in government activities, budgets and expenditures for citizens). Its applications are various, including but not restricted to: following the money, open contracting, changing incentives and enabling cross-sector collaboration.

In 2015, one of the [[G20]] priorities was to reduce corruption and to promote good governance.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2015/G20-Anti-Corruption-Open-Data-Principles.pdf|title=G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles|last=G20|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Corruption Working Group (ACWG) developed the Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles in order to leverage open data as one of the key actions to create and foster accountability and transparency. The principles are directly derived from the International Open Data Charter, which specifies the release and use of government data to reduce the reach of corruption.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Transparency International]] and the Web Foundation carried out a study on certain member countries of the G20 (Brazil, France, Germany, Indonesia and South Africa) to evaluate the effect of the principles on their fight against corruption.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/open_data_and_the_fight_against_corruption_in_indonesia|title=TI Publication - Open data and the fight against corruption in Indonesia|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, for example ([[Corruption in Indonesia]]), it is estimated that corruption has cost up to IDR 31,077 trillion to the country.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Through public information availability, the country has tried to foster and promote its anti-corruption actions by utilizing its legal and institutional frameworks. Nonetheless, the access to datasets remains scarce while the lack of education amongst staff and citizens impedes the use of data as a tool against corruption.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Data mining]] was a crucial tool used in the famous anti-corruption investigation of the [[Panama Papers]] by way of the initiative of the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/|title=The Panama Papers: Exposing the Rogue Offshore Finance Industry - ICIJ|work=ICIJ|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of data reached was 2.6 terabytes or 11.5 billion documents.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The implementation of a [[graph database]] allowed for better efficiency in the research and analysis of the documents as it found hidden links between accounts and owners that would have been hard to dig up otherwise. Mar Cabra, ICIJ Data Editor, claimed that the software used made them feel like: "we [had] superpowers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Neo4j|title=How the ICIJ Used Neo4j to Unravel the Panama Papers|date=2016-05-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAlu3ud2k_A|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social media ====
[[Social media]] is amongst the newest factors that has been shown by researchers to reduce the impact of corruption.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968551831|title=Political scandal, corruption, and legitimacy in the age of social media|others=Çakır-Demirhan, Derya,, Demirhan, Kamil,|isbn=9781522520191|location=Hershey, Pennsylvania|oclc=968551831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media platforms have created a multi-way communication which contradicts the one-way channel of traditional media. It enables individuals to share experiences in a quick and cheap manner through its platforms. It facilitates exchanges of geographically separated individuals which makes it an important tool as a dialogue platform.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In many countries, cases of human rights violations and corruption have started to come out publicly. They challenge the status quo of the government holding the monopoly over information.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The World Economic Forum established in 2014 that social media could be a useful tool to drive anti-corruption because of its ability to advance commentary and information provision to the population.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/12/how-to-use-social-media-to-fight-corruption/|title=How to use social media to fight corruption|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also useful because of its key role in investigating through collective action participation. They use the example of I Paid A Bribe, an Indian website inviting users to input their daily contact with corruption and whether they paid a bribe or not to a public servant.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mobile banking ====
[[Petty corruption]] can be fought by the emergence of cashless payments, and more generally in a cashless economy.

In Kenya, [[M-Pesa]] was launched to allow people to transfer money through mobile phones.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/21/africa/mpesa-10th-anniversary/index.html|title=M-Pesa: Kenya's mobile success story turns 10|last=CNN|first=Kieron Monks,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by almost two-thirds of the population and is gaining momentum as it is opening its technology to other countries (Tanzania for example).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

As traffic police is seen as one of the most notorious sources of corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000189201/i-saw-traffic-officers-extort-bribes-president-tells-top-police-bosses|title=I saw traffic officers extort bribes, President tells top police bosses|last=Reporter|first=Standard|work=The Standard|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; M-Pesa proposed to create cashless payments on public buses to avoid the extortion of bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28106004|title=Kenya's buses to go cashless|date=2014-07-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are currently some logistical and regulatory problems preventing it from getting traction, [[mobile banking]] is seen as a potential tool to fight petty corruption, specifically if it is accompanied by the proper framework for legislative action and [[good governance]].
==Local and regional development==
Literature on social innovation in relation to territorial/[[Regional development|regional]] development covers innovation in the [[social economy]], i.e. strategies for satisfaction of human needs; and innovation in the sense of transforming and/or sustaining [[social relations]], especially [[governance]] relations at the regional and local level. Beginning in the late 1980s, Jean-Louis Laville and [[Frank Moulaert]] researched social innovation.&lt;ref name="Laville, J 1994"&gt;Laville, J.-L. (Ed.) (1994) L’économie solidaire, une perspective internationale, Desclée de Brouwer, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylorandfrancis.metapress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;eissn=1360-0591&amp;volume=37&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=289 |title=Moulaert, F. and Sekia, F. (2003) Territorial Innovation Models: a Critical Survey, '&amp;#39;Regional Studies'&amp;#39;, 37(3), 289-302 |publisher=Taylorandfrancis.metapress.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]] CRISES&lt;ref name="CRISES"&gt;[http://www.crises.uqam.ca/pages/en/ CRISES] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214164731/http://www.crises.uqam.ca/pages/en/ |date=December 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated this type of research. Another, larger project was SINGOCOM&lt;ref name="users.skynet.be"&gt;[http://users.skynet.be/bk368453/singocom/index2.html Social Innovation, Governance, and Community Building] (2002–2004)&lt;/ref&gt; a [[European Commission]] [[FP5|Framework 5]] project, which pioneered so-called "Alternative Models for Local Innovation" (ALMOLIN). These models were further elaborated through community actions covered by KATARSIS&lt;ref name="KATARSIS Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katarsis.ncl.ac.uk/ |title=KATARSIS Homepage |publisher=Katarsis.ncl.ac.uk |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SOCIAL POLIS.&lt;ref name="Social Polis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialpolis.eu/ |title=Social Polis |publisher=Socialpolis.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent works focus on the societal role of the economic life in terms of innovations in social practices and social relations at the local and regional levels. Social Innovation, therefore, is increasingly seen as a process and a strategy to foster human development through solidarity, cooperation, and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="MacCallum, D. 2009"&gt;MacCallum, D., Moulaert, F., Hillier, J. and S. Vicari (Eds) (2009) ''Social Innovation and Territorial Development''. Ashgate, Aldershot. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-7233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masselin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masselin |first=Matthieu |url=http://www.paristechreview.com/2011/12/16/social-innovation-future-economy/ |title='&amp;#39;Is Social Innovation the Future of Economy?'&amp;#39;, ParisTech Review, Dec. 2011 |publisher=Paristechreview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU funded URBACT programme is designed to help cities to exchange and learn around urban policies.  The URBACT methodology can be seen as a social innovation action planning approach. A typical URBACT network would have ten cities working on a specific theme such as active inclusion or regenerating disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  They examine good practice and then working through a local support group use the results to inform their local action plan.&lt;ref&gt;Jegou F., Bonneau M., (2015) [http://urbact.eu/sites/default/files/03_socialinn-web.pdf Social Innovation in Cities - Urbact II Capitalisation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Innovation Europe&lt;ref name="Socialinnovationeurope.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialinnovationeurope.eu |title=Home &amp;#124; Social Innovation Europe |publisher=Socialinnovationeurope.eu |date=2014-05-15 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiative, funded by the European Commission's Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry, was set up to map social innovation at a European level, by creating a directory of grass-roots examples of social innovation from across the 27 member states.

The European Commission funded the SELUSI study between 2008 - 2013 that looked at over 550 social ventures and examined how these insights can spark change and innovation at a much larger scale. It looked at business models of social ventures in five countries - UK being one of them – identifying which specific practices evolved by social ventures are particularly successful, and how and by whom – be it social enterprise, public sector body or mainstream business – they can be most effectively scaled-up.

The European Commission has launched a new initiative (project) in 2013 under FP7 funding, with the aim to build a network of incubators for social innovation across regions and countries. This network facilitates identification of 300 social innovation examples and facilitates its scaling. The network is organised in a way to identify new models for scaling of social innovations across various geographical clusters in collaboration with each other, communicating the ideas, finding the tools and funds, developing business plans and models in order to promote the new promising ideas throughout Europe.

:''Not to be confused with Statutory power, see [[Statute]].''

{{Use Australian English|date=June 2018}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}
A '''statutory authority''' is a  body set up by [[law]] which is authorised to enact legislation on behalf of the relevant country or state. They are typically found in countries which are governed by a [[Westminster system|British style of parliamentary democracy]] such as the [[UK]] and [[British Commonwealth]] countries like [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[India]]. They are also found in [[Israel]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auditor.leg.state.mn.us/statu.htm Minnesota  Statutory authority - Legislative auditor]&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, many such bodies are termed [[QUANGO]]s because of their semi-autonomous nature{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}.

==Australia==
Federal statutory authorities are typically established under the ''[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/caaca1997387/ Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997]''(Repealed). Statutory authorities at the State or Territory level are established under corresponding State or Territory laws. Each statutory authority tends to have its own enabling legislation, or [[Act of Parliament|originating act]], even if it was established before the relevant over-riding legislation, For example, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) was established in 1949 by the ''Science and Industry Research Act'', but it has since come under the jurisdiction of the ''Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997'' as legislation covering statutory authorities has evolved.

Laws made by statutory authorities are usually referred to as regulations. They are not cited in the same fashion as an act of parliament, but usually with specific initials (depending on the authority) and a number.

Just as Laws enacted by Parliament, all laws made by a statutory authority must be published in the Government Gazette.

===Rationale===

The [[Parliament of Australia]], or a [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|State or Territory Parliament]], will delegate its Authority to a statutory authority for several reasons;

* Efficiency - State and Federal Parliaments do not have the time nor resources to investigate, analyse, draft, enact and monitor laws for every area of our increasingly complex society. By delegation of legislative power to a statutory authority, a specialist body may subrogate parliament and use its authority in a more efficient manner
* Bipartisanship - Statutory authorities are usually responsible for areas of legislation where there is a common goal or direction desirable within the community. Delegation of authority away from parliament prevents these areas of law from becoming partisan issues.
* Transparency - The disclosure requirements placed upon statutory authorities are generally stricter than that of State and Federal Parliaments; statutory authorities cannot rely upon the same government secrets provisions as can State and Federal governments.
* Accountability - The jurisdiction of a statutory authority is expressly set out in its corresponding act (i.e. the Act of Parliament which created the statutory authority). This, therefore, makes switching, sharing or evasion of responsibility in the instance of a scandal more difficult for officers of the statutory authority.

===Statutory Authorities in Australia===

The power to enact legislation has been delegated by Australian Parliaments (State and/or Federal) in the following areas;

* Consumer affairs - Where authority is delegated to the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]]
* Road and traffic safety - Where authority is delegated to various bodies by state, for example, [[VicRoads]] in Victoria
* Public transport - Where authority is delegated to various bodies by state, for example, [[Public Transport Authority (Western Australia)|Public Transport Authority]] in Western Australia.
* Collection of taxes - Where authority is delegated to the [[Australian Taxation Office]]
* Corporate law - Where authority is delegated to the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]]
* Prudential regulation - Where authority is delegated to the [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]]
* Monetary Policy - Where authority is delegated to the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] established by an Act of Parliament, the Reserve Bank Act 1959, which gives it specific powers and obligations.
* Workplace Health and Safety - Where authority is delegated to [[Safe Work Australia]] and to various bodies by state, for example, [[WorkSafe Victoria|WorkSafe]] in Victoria and subsidiaries such as the [[Accident Compensation Conciliation Service]]
* Communications and Media - For example, [[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] is responsible for the regulation of broadcasting, the internet, radiocommunications and telecommunications.
* Offshore petroleum activities - Where authority is delegated to the [[National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">'''Steady change''' is the persistent process of transformation in a [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[economic system]]. 

This is explained by the continuous generation, diffusion, accumulation and substitution of innovations by [[economic agent]]s as time moves on. This regular (and accelerating) phenomenon causes movement and crises in economic structures as measured by rates of growth of countries, regions, [[Economic sector|sectors]] and companies. 

The economy is an evolving system. It is thus to always unfold and change, to incessantly show novel behaviour, to surprise its actors and observers with emergent phenomena. The concept stands in contrast to the conventional concept of [[Steady state economy|"steady-state"]] in economics and is inspired by evolutionary insights in modern economic theory such as put forward by Nelson and Winter's book of 1982.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38208">'''Text mining''', also referred to as '''''text data mining''''', roughly equivalent to '''text analytics''', is the process of deriving high-quality [[information]] from [[Plain text|text]]. High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as [[pattern recognition|statistical pattern learning]]. Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a [[database]]), deriving patterns within the [[structured data]], and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]], [[novelty (patent)|novelty]], and interest. Typical text mining tasks include [[text categorization]], [[text clustering]], concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, [[sentiment analysis]], [[document summarization]], and entity relation modeling (''i.e.'', learning relations between [[named entity recognition|named entities]]).

Text analysis involves [[information retrieval]], [[lexical analysis]] to study word frequency distributions, [[pattern recognition]], [[tag (metadata)|tagging]]/[[annotation]], [[information extraction]], [[data mining]] techniques including link and association analysis, [[information visualization|visualization]], and [[predictive analytics]]. The overarching goal is, essentially, to turn text into data for analysis, via application of [[natural language processing]] (NLP) and analytical methods.

A typical application is to scan a set of documents written in a [[natural language]] and either model the document set for [[predictive classification]] purposes or populate a database or search index with the information extracted.

==Text analytics==
The term '''text analytics''' describes a set of [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[statistical]], and [[machine learning]] techniques that model and structure the information content of textual sources for [[business intelligence]], [[exploratory data analysis]], [[research]], or investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/blog/archives/2007/02/defining_text_a.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129171151/http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/blog/archives/2007/02/defining_text_a.html |date=November 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is roughly synonymous with text mining; indeed, [[Ronen Feldman]] modified a 2000 description of "text mining"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dunja/CFPWshKDD2000.html |title=KDD-2000 Workshop on Text Mining - Call for Papers |publisher=Cs.cmu.edu |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 to describe "text analytics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ir.iit.edu/cikm2004/tutorials.html#T2]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303042253/http://www.ir.iit.edu/cikm2004/tutorials.html#T2 |date=March 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter term is now used more frequently in business settings while "text mining" is used in some of the earliest application areas, dating to the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.3115/991813.991833 |title=Proceedings of the 9th conference on Computational linguistics |year=1982 |last1=Hobbs |first1=Jerry R. |last2=Walker |first2=Donald E. |last3=Amsler |first3=Robert A. |volume=1 |pages=127–32|chapter=Natural language access to structured text }}&lt;/ref&gt; notably life-sciences research and government intelligence.

The term text analytics also describes that application of text analytics to respond to business problems, whether independently or in conjunction with query and analysis of fielded, numerical data. It is a truism that 80 percent of business-relevant information originates in unstructured form, primarily text.&lt;ref name="breakthroughanalysis1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breakthroughanalysis.com/2008/08/01/unstructured-data-and-the-80-percent-rule/ |title=Unstructured Data and the 80 Percent Rule |publisher=Breakthrough Analysis |accessdate=2015-02-23|date=August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques and processes discover and present knowledge – facts, [[business rule]]s, and relationships – that is otherwise locked in textual form, impenetrable to automated processing.

==Text analysis processes==
Subtasks—components of a larger text-analytics effort—typically include:

*[[Information retrieval]] or identification of a [[text corpus|corpus]] is a preparatory step: collecting or identifying a set of textual materials, on the Web or held in a file system, database, or content [[corpus manager]], for analysis.
* Although some text analytics systems apply exclusively advanced statistical methods, many others apply more extensive [[natural language processing]], such as [[part of speech tagging]], syntactic [[parsing]], and other types of linguistic analysis.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
*[[Named entity recognition]] is the use of gazetteers or statistical techniques to identify named text features: people, organizations, place names, stock ticker symbols, certain abbreviations, and so on.
* Disambiguation—the use of contextual clues—may be required to decide where, for instance, "Ford" can refer to a former U.S. president, a vehicle manufacturer, a movie star, a river crossing, or some other entity.
* Recognition of Pattern Identified Entities: Features such as telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, quantities (with units) can be discerned via regular expression or other pattern matches.
*Document clustering: identification of sets of similar text documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Wui Lee|last2=Tay|first2=Kai Meng|last3=Lim|first3=Chee Peng|date=2017-02-06|title=A New Evolving Tree-Based Model with Local Re-learning for Document Clustering and Visualization|journal=Neural Processing Letters|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=379–409|doi=10.1007/s11063-017-9597-3|issn=1370-4621}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Coreference]]: identification of [[noun phrase]]s and other terms that refer to the same object.
* Relationship, fact, and event Extraction: identification of associations among entities and other information in text
*[[Sentiment analysis]] involves discerning subjective (as opposed to factual) material and extracting various forms of attitudinal information: sentiment, opinion, mood, and emotion. Text analytics techniques are helpful in analyzing, sentiment at the entity, concept, or topic level and in distinguishing opinion holder and opinion object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breakthroughanalysis.com/2010/06/14/2514/ |title=Full Circle Sentiment Analysis |publisher=Breakthrough Analysis |accessdate=2015-02-23|date=2010-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Quantitative text analysis is a set of techniques stemming from the social sciences where either a human judge or a computer extracts semantic or grammatical relationships between words in order to find out the meaning or stylistic patterns of, usually, a casual personal text for the purpose of [[psychological profiling]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1037/11383-011 |title=Handbook of multimethod measurement in psychology |year=2006 |last1=Mehl |first1=Matthias R. |isbn=978-1-59147-318-3 |page=141|chapter=Quantitative Text Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Text mining technology is now broadly applied to a wide variety of government, research, and business needs. All three groups may use text mining for records management and searching documents relevant to their daily activities. Legal professionals may use text mining for [[e-discovery]]. Governments and military groups use text mining for [[national security]] and intelligence purposes. Scientific researchers incorporate text mining approaches into efforts to organize large sets of text data (i.e., addressing the problem of [[unstructured data]]), to determine ideas communicated through text (e.g., [[sentiment analysis]] in [[social media]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pang|first=Bo|last2=Lee|first2=Lillian|date=2008|title=Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis|journal=Foundations and Trends® in Information Retrieval|volume=2|issue=1–2|pages=1–135|doi=10.1561/1500000011|issn=1554-0669|citeseerx=10.1.1.147.2755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paltoglou|first=Georgios|last2=Thelwall|first2=Mike|date=2012-09-01|title=Twitter, MySpace, Digg: Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis in Social Media|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2337542.2337551|journal=ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST)|volume=3|issue=4|pages=66|doi=10.1145/2337542.2337551|issn=2157-6904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task4/|title=Sentiment Analysis in Twitter &lt; SemEval-2017 Task 4|website=alt.qcri.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and to support [[scientific discovery]] in fields such as the [[life sciences]] and [[bioinformatics]]. In business, applications are used to support [[competitive intelligence]] and automated [[ad serving|ad placement]], among numerous other activities.

===Security applications===
Many text mining software packages are marketed for [[security appliance|security applications]], especially monitoring and analysis of online plain text sources such as [[Internet news]], [[blog]]s, etc. for [[national security]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-88181-0_7 |title=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Security for Information Systems CISIS'08 |series=Advances in Soft Computing |year=2009 |last1=Zanasi |first1=Alessandro |isbn=978-3-540-88180-3 |volume=53 |page=53|chapter=Virtual Weapons for Real Wars: Text Mining for National Security }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also involved in the study of text [[encryption]]/[[decryption]].

In addition, with large patient textual datasets in the clinical field, datasets of demographic information in population studies and adverse event reports, text mining can facilitate clinical studies and precision medicine.

===Software applications===
Text mining methods and software is also being researched and developed by major firms, including [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]], to further automate the mining and analysis processes, and by different firms working in the area of search and indexing in general as a way to improve their results.
Within public sector much effort has been concentrated on creating software for tracking and monitoring [[Information Awareness Office|terrorist activities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/texor-a-chat-mining-program.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224652/http://yatsko.zohosites.com/texor-a-chat-mining-program.html |date=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online media applications===
Text mining is being used by large media companies, such as the [[Tribune Company]], to clarify information and to provide readers with greater search experiences, which in turn increases site "stickiness" and revenue. Additionally, on the back end, editors are benefiting by being able to share, associate and package news across properties, significantly increasing opportunities to monetize content.

===Business and marketing applications===
Text mining is starting to be used in marketing as well, more specifically in analytical [[customer relationship management]].&lt;ref name="Text Analytics: The “Why” Behind the Score"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medallia.com/text-analytics/ |title=Text Analytics |publisher=Medallia |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coussement and Van den Poel (2008)&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005 |url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:rug:rugwps:08/502 |title=Integrating the voice of customers through call center emails into a decision support system for churn prediction |year=2008 |last1=Coussement |first1=Kristof |last2=Van Den Poel |first2=Dirk |journal=Information &amp; Management |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=164–74|citeseerx=10.1.1.113.3238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.dss.2007.10.010 |url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:rug:rugwps:07/481 |title=Improving customer complaint management by automatic email classification using linguistic style features as predictors |year=2008 |last1=Coussement |first1=Kristof |last2=Van Den Poel |first2=Dirk |journal=Decision Support Systems |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=870–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; apply it to improve [[predictive analytics]] models for customer churn ([[customer attrition]]).&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005" /&gt; Text mining is also being applied in stock returns prediction.&lt;ref name="Galvez2017"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750317300091 | title=Assessing the usefulness of online message board mining in automatic stock prediction systems |author1=Ramiro H.

===Sentiment analysis===
[[Sentiment analysis]] may involve analysis of movie reviews for estimating how favorable a review is for a movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.3115/1118693.1118704 |title=Proceedings of the ACL-02 conference on Empirical methods in natural language processing |year=2002 |last1=Pang |first1=Bo |last2=Lee |first2=Lillian |last3=Vaithyanathan |first3=Shivakumar |volume=10 |pages=79–86|chapter=Thumbs up? }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such an analysis may need a labeled data set or labeling of the [[affect (psychology)|affectivity]] of words.
Resources for affectivity of words and concepts have been made for [[WordNet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

Text has been used to detect emotions in the related area of affective computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/T-AFFC.2010.1 |title=Affect Detection: An Interdisciplinary Review of Models, Methods, and Their Applications |year=2010 |last1=Calvo |first1=Rafael A |last2=d'Mello |first2=Sidney |journal=IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=18–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text based approaches to affective computing have been used on multiple corpora such as students evaluations, children stories and news stories.

===Scientific literature mining and academic applications===

The issue of text mining is of importance to publishers who hold large [[database]]s of information needing [[index (database)|indexing]] for retrieval. This is especially true in scientific disciplines, in which highly specific information is often contained within written text. Therefore, initiatives have been taken such as [[Nature (journal)|Nature's]] proposal for an Open Text Mining Interface (OTMI) and the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s common Journal Publishing [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) that would provide semantic cues to machines to answer specific queries contained within text without removing publisher barriers to public access.

Academic institutions have also become involved in the text mining initiative:

* The [[National Centre for Text Mining]] (NaCTeM), is the first publicly funded text mining centre in the world. NaCTeM is operated by the [[University of Manchester]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk |title=The University of Manchester |publisher=Manchester.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in close collaboration with the Tsujii Lab,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html |title=Tsujii Laboratory |publisher=Tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html |title=The University of Tokyo |publisher=UTokyo |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; NaCTeM provides customised tools, research facilities and offers advice to the academic community. They are funded by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] (JISC) and two of the UK [[Research Council]]s ([[EPSRC]] &amp; [[BBSRC]]). With an initial focus on text mining in the [[biology|biological]] and [[biomedical]] sciences, research has since expanded into the areas of [[social sciences]].
* In the United States, the [[UC Berkeley School of Information|School of Information]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] is developing a program called BioText to assist [[biology]] researchers in text mining and analysis.
* The [[Text Analysis Portal for Research]] (TAPoR), currently housed at the [[University of Alberta]], is a scholarly project to catalogue text analysis applications and create a gateway for researchers new to the practice.

==== Methods for scientific literature mining ====
Computational methods have been developed to assist with information retrieval from scientific literature. Published approaches include methods for searching,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shen|first=Jiaming|last2=Xiao|first2=Jinfeng|last3=He|first3=Xinwei|last4=Shang|first4=Jingbo|last5=Sinha|first5=Saurabh|last6=Han|first6=Jiawei|date=2018-06-27|title=Entity Set Search of Scientific Literature: An Unsupervised Ranking Approach|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3209978.3210055|publisher=ACM|pages=565–574|doi=10.1145/3209978.3210055|isbn=9781450356572}}&lt;/ref&gt; determining novelty&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=Lothar|last2=Radauer|first2=Alfred|last3=Moehrle|first3=Martin G.|date=2017-02-06|title=The beauty of brimstone butterfly: novelty of patents identified by near environment analysis based on text mining|journal=Scientometrics|language=en|volume=111|issue=1|pages=103–115|doi=10.1007/s11192-017-2267-4|issn=0138-9130}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and clarifying [[Homonym|homonyms]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roll|first=Uri|last2=Correia|first2=Ricardo A.|last3=Berger-Tal|first3=Oded|date=2018-03-10|title=Using machine learning to disentangle homonyms in large text corpora|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=32|issue=3|pages=716–724|doi=10.1111/cobi.13044|pmid=29086438|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt; among technical reports.

=== Digital humanities and computational sociology ===
The automatic analysis of vast textual corpora has created the possibility for scholars to analyze
millions of documents in multiple languages with very limited manual intervention. Key enabling technologies have been parsing, machine translation, topic categorization, and machine learning.

[[File:Tripletsnew2012.png|thumb|right|Narrative network of US Elections 2012&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Automated analysis of the US presidential elections using Big Data and network analysis; S Sudhahar, GA Veltri, N Cristianini; Big Data &amp; Society 2 (1), 1-28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, turning textual data into network data.  The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analyzed by using tools from network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Network analysis of narrative content in large corpora; S Sudhahar, G De Fazio, R Franzosi, N Cristianini; Natural Language Engineering, 1-32, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This automates the approach introduced by quantitative narrative analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Quantitative Narrative Analysis; Roberto Franzosi; Emory University © 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

[[Content analysis]] has been a traditional part of social sciences and media studies for a long time. The automation of content analysis has allowed a "[[big data]]" revolution to take place in that field, with studies in social media and newspaper content that include millions of news items. [[Gender bias]], [[readability]], content similarity, reader preferences, and even mood have been analyzed based on text mining methods over millions of documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lansdall-Welfare|first=Thomas|last2=Sudhahar|first2=Saatviga|last3=Thompson|first3=James|last4=Lewis|first4=Justin|last5=Team|first5=FindMyPast Newspaper|last6=Cristianini|first6=Nello|date=2017-01-09|title=Content analysis of 150 years of British periodicals|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/03/1606380114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=114|issue=4|language=en|pages=E457–E465|doi=10.1073/pnas.1606380114|issn=0027-8424|pmid=28069962|pmc=5278459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.

===Situation in Europe===
[[File:FixCopyright- Copyright &amp; Research - Text &amp; Data Mining (TDM) Explained.webm|thumb|Video by Fix Copyright campaign explaining TDM and its copyright issues in the EU, 2016 [3:52]]Because of a lack of flexibilities in European copyright and [[Database Directive|database law]], the mining of in-copyright works (such as [[web mining]]) without the permission of the copyright owner is illegal.  In the UK in 2014, on the recommendation of the [[Hargreaves review]] the government amended copyright law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/june/researchers-given-data-mining-right-under-new-uk-copyright-laws/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609020315/http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/june/researchers-given-data-mining-right-under-new-uk-copyright-laws/ |date=June 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow text mining as a [[Limitations and exceptions to copyright|limitation and exception]]. It was only the second country in the world to do so, following [[Copyright law of Japan|Japan]], which introduced a mining-specific exception in 2009. However, owing to the restriction of the [[Copyright Directive]], the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions.

The [[European Commission]] facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and [[data mining]] in 2013, under the title of Licenses for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licences for Europe - Structured Stakeholder Dialogue 2013|url=http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/en/content/about-site|website=European Commission|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the focus on the solution to this legal issue was licenses, and not limitations and exceptions to copyright law, led representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and [[open access]] publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text and Data Mining:Its importance and the need for change in Europe|url=http://libereurope.eu/news/text-and-data-mining-its-importance-and-the-need-for-change-in-europe/|website=[[Association of European Research Libraries]]|accessdate=14 November 2014|date=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation in the United States===
By contrast to Europe, the flexible nature of US copyright law, and in particular [[fair use]], means that text mining in America, as well as other fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea, is viewed as being legal. As text mining is transformative, meaning that it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the [[Google Book Search Settlement Agreement|Google Book settlement]] the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed—one such use being text and data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge grants summary judgment in favor of Google Books — a fair use victory|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a18c5b92-5a20-4d1d-a098-a3095046a88e|website=Lexology.com|publisher=Antonelli Law Ltd|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
Until recently, websites most often used text-based searches, which only found documents containing specific user-defined words or phrases. Now, through use of a [[semantic web]], text mining can find content based on meaning and context (rather than just by a specific word). Additionally, text mining software can be used to build large dossiers of information about specific people and events.  For example, large datasets based on data extracted from news reports can be built to facilitate social networks analysis or [[counter-intelligence]].  In effect, the text mining software may act in a capacity similar to an [[intelligence analyst]] or research librarian, albeit with a more limited scope of analysis. Text mining is also used in some email [[spam filter]]s as a way of determining the characteristics of messages that are likely to be advertisements or other unwanted material. Text mining plays an important role in determining financial [[market sentiment]].

==Future==
Increasing interest is being paid to multilingual data mining: the ability to gain information across languages and cluster similar items from different linguistic sources according to their meaning. Popular text analytics tools includes [[Accern]], [[Lexalytics]], and Repustate. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.efinancialcareers.com/ch-en/285462/the-top-big-data-companies-to-work-for-by-j-p-morgan|title=43 of the top big data companies to work for, by J.P. Morgan|date=2017-06-01|work=eFinancialCareers|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-CH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge of exploiting the large proportion of enterprise information that originates in "unstructured" form has been recognized for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/6311|title=A Brief History of Text Analytics by Seth Grimes|date=2007-10-30|publisher=Beyenetwork|accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recognized in the earliest definition of [[business intelligence]] (BI), in an October 1958 IBM Journal article by H.P. Luhn, A Business Intelligence System, which describes a system that will:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...utilize data-processing machines for auto-abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles for each of the 'action points' in an organization. Both incoming and internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by a word pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet as management information systems developed starting in the 1960s, and as BI emerged in the '80s and '90s as a software category and field of practice, the emphasis was on numerical data stored in relational databases. This is not surprising: text in "unstructured" documents is hard to process. The emergence of text analytics in its current form stems from a refocusing of research in the late 1990s from algorithm development to application, as described by Prof. Marti A. Hearst in the paper Untangling Text Data Mining:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the 37th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Computational Linguistics|last1=Hearst|first1=Marti A.|year=1999|isbn=978-1-55860-609-8|pages=3–10|chapter=Untangling text data mining|doi=10.3115/1034678.1034679|chapter-url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/papers/acl99/acl99-tdm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For almost a decade the computational linguistics community has viewed large text collections as a resource to be tapped in order to produce better text analysis algorithms. In this paper, I have attempted to suggest a new emphasis: the use of large online text collections to discover new facts and trends about the world itself. I suggest that to make progress we do not need fully artificial intelligent text analysis; rather, a mixture of computationally-driven and user-guided analysis may open the door to exciting new results.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hearst's 1999 statement of need fairly well describes the state of text analytics technology and practice a decade later.

'''The 2.0 Adoption Council''' is a free-to-join [[peer group]] of corporate leaders focused on the adoption and utilization of [[Enterprise 2.0]] collaboration tools. The organization's stated objective is "''to gain practical insights on innovative business practices using 2.0 tools, processes and strategies for cost efficiencies in tough economic times, as well as leveraging agility for [[competitive advantage]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.20adoptioncouncil.com/?page_id=4 |title=The 2.0 Adoption Council &amp;raquo; About Us |accessdate=2011-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group was founded in 2009 by [[industry analyst]] Susan Scrupski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/article/susan-scrupski-20-adoption-council |title=Susan Scrupski, founder and CEO of the 2.0 Adoption Council (Most Influential Women in Technology 2010: The Evangelists) |accessdate=2011-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Council began as an independent entity and was acquired in 2010 by the [[Enterprise 2.0]] consultancy [https://web.archive.org/web/20110217034349/http://www.dachisgroup.com/ Dachis Group].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="951">'''[[RFM (customer value)]]''' is a model that diversifies considerable [[customer]]s from a mass of data by three attributes. Interval of customer [[consumer|consumption]], frequency and payment value, are these three factors. Hughes (1994) considered that the three variables are equal in the importance; therefore, the weights of the three variables are identical. On the other hand, Stone (1995) indicated that the three variables are different in the importance due to the characteristic of [[industry]]. Thus, the weights of the three variables are not equal.&lt;ref&gt;Peiman Alipour Sarvari, Alp Ustundag, Hidayet Takci , (2016),"Performance evaluation of different customer segmentation approaches based on RFM and demographics analysis", [[Kybernetes]], Vol. 45 Iss 7 pp. - Permanent link to this document: https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-07-2015-0180&lt;/ref&gt;
