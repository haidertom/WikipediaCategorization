'''Alexandra Fountain''' is regarded as one of  [[Bendigo]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], Australia's most prominent landmarks and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CQR_alexandra-fountain?guid=03274844-3a83-47c5-b2e0-0858278d1318 |title=GC20CQR Alexandra Fountain (Earthcache) in Victoria, Australia|publisher=Geocaching.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fountain is located in Bendigo's "Charing Cross", the intersection of View Street and Pall Mall. Charing Cross effectively stands at the centre of the city and is one of Bendigo's busiest and most prominent intersections. The fountain stands opposite to the main entrance of Rosalind Park.

Alexandra Fountain was funded from the proceeds of the Bendigo Juvenile Industrial Exhibition (1879), a £500 gift from George Lansell and a further £700 from the Sandhurst City Council (now the [[City of Greater Bendigo]]). The fountain was designed by [[W. C. Vahland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bendigo.ws/Our-History/Architecture-and-Buildings/Alexandra-Fountain.html |title=Alexandra Fountain - Bendigo, Victoria, Australia |publisher=Bendigo.ws |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a local architect responsible for some of the cities most prominent buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bendigo.ws/Our-History/People/William-Charles-Vahland.html |title=William Charles Vahland - Bendigo Pioneer |publisher=Bendigo.ws |date= |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain was named in honour of [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]], Princess of Wales and the grand opening (5 July 1881) was attended by her sons [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]] and [[George V|Prince George]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedvic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/search/nattrust_result_detail/68184 |title=Alexandra Fountain |publisher=Vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au |date=2010-07-30 |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the Exhibition Fountain, built in 1880 and located in the [[Melbourne]]'s [[Carlton Gardens]], the Alexandra Fountain is the largest and most ornate municipal fountain in Victoria.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedvic"/&gt;  The fountain stands {{convert|28|ft|m}} high and sits in a {{convert|50|ft|m}} diameter circular pool which itself is {{convert|2|ft|m}} deep.  It is made from {{convert|20|tonne}} of Harcourt granite, cast iron and painted stone. Decoratively the fountain includes lion head spouts, four allegorical female figures, spouted bronzed mer-horses and dolphins, medallions of seashells, dolphins and tridents also decorate the fountain. The pool is bordered by a decorative cast iron fence and lit with four cast iron lamps.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedvic"/&gt;

Historically the fountain is a monument to the success of the Goldfields and the Bendigo region. Aesthetically the fountain is fairly typical of late Victorian monumental design but is unusual in that  few fountains were built according to this theme.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedvic"/&gt;

As of 2017 a AU$350,000 refurbishment project is underway.  The restoration project will include repairs and repainting of the balustrade and masonry, including repainting and re-rendering the plaster work as well as plumbing and electrical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bendigo.vic.gov.au/About/News-and-media/Media-Releases/city-set-commence-restoration-historic-alexandra-fountain|title=City set to commence restoration of historic Alexandra Fountain {{!}} City of Greater Bendigo|website=www.bendigo.vic.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland (ACSI) was founded in 1894, instigated by [[Dermot Bourke, 7th Earl of Mayo]], with the aim of encouraging and sponsoring the development of artistic industries in Ireland. It held its first exhibition in 1895, opening on 7 November in the Royal University Buildings, Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin. It was broadly modelled on its British counterpart, the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27116354|title=The arts &amp; crafts movement in Ireland|last=Larmour|first=Paul|date=|publisher=Friar's Bush Press|year=1992|isbn=0946872538|location=Belfast|pages=5, 56-89|oclc=27116354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with holding exhibitions, the Society also held lectures for both members and non-members.&lt;ref name="ArtBiogs"&gt;{{cite web |title=Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland {{!}} Artist Biographies |url=https://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/arts-crafts-society-ireland |website=www.artbiogs.co.uk |accessdate=11 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also published exhibition catalogues, pamphlets, and reports.&lt;ref name="Gla" /&gt;

In 1907 the ASCI founded the [[Guild of Irish Art Workers]] for professional craftspeople.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Society was disbanded in 1925, after its seventh exhibition that year.&lt;ref name="Bowe"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowe |first1=Nicola Gordon |title=The Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland (1894-1925) with particular reference to Harry Clarke |journal=The Journal of the Decorative Arts Society 1850 - the Present |date=1985 |issue=9 |pages=29–40 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41809143 |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the member of the Society were [[Harry Clarke]], Robert Arthur Dawson, [[Rosamond Praeger]], [[Oswald Reeves]], [[Evelyn Gleeson]], [[Alice Brittain]] and Alice Shaw.&lt;ref name="ArtBiogs" /&gt; The members worked in varying media including leather, lace, metal, wood, stone, marble, stained glass and porcelain.&lt;ref name="Sheridan"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sheridan |first1=Colette |title=Exhibition showcases Cork’s place in the Arts and Crafts movement |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/exhibition-showcases-corks-place-in-the-arts-and-crafts-movement-430712.html |accessdate=11 October 2018 |agency=Irish Examiner |date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Briton Rivière''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (14 August 1840 in [[London]]{{snd}}20 April 1920 in [[London]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://ann-lauren.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/19-20th-cent-briton-riviere.html Ann Lauren: Biography of Rivière]&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[artist]] of [[Huguenot]] descent. He exhibited a variety of paintings at the [[Royal Academy]], but devoted much of his life to animal paintings.

==Biography==
Briton's father, [[William Rivière]] (1806–1876), was for some years drawing-master at [[Cheltenham College]], and then an art teacher at the [[University of Oxford]]. Briton was educated at Cheltenham College and Oxford, where he took his degree in 1867. For his art training he was indebted almost entirely to his father.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Riviere, Briton |volume=23 |page=387  }} This cites [[Walter Armstrong (art historian)|Sir Walter Armstrong]], "Briton Riviere, R.A.: His Life and Work", ''Art Annual'' (1891).&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal uncle [[Henry Parsons Rivière]] (1811–1888) was also a noted watercolourist, exhibiting works at the [[Royal Watercolour Society]], London and the [[Royal Birmingham Society of Artists]].

His first pictures appeared at the [[British Institution]], and in 1857 he exhibited three works at the [[Royal Academy]], but it was not until 1863 that he became a regular contributor to the Academy exhibitions. In that year he was represented by ''The eve of the [[Spanish Armada]]'', and in 1864 by a ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. However, subjects of this kind did not attract him long, for in 1865 he began, with ''Sleeping Deerhound'', a series of paintings of animal-subjects which occupied much of the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In a lengthy interview in ''[[Chums Boys Annual]]'', entitled "How I paint animals", Rivière explained some of the practicalities of painting both tame and wild animals:

{{quote|I have always been a great lover of dogs but I have worked at them so much that I've grown tired of having them about me. However, you can never paint a dog unless you are fond of it. I never work from a dog without the assistance of a man who is well acquainted with animals ... Collies, I think, are the most restless dogs ...[[greyhounds]] are also very restless, and so are [[fox terriers]] ... The only way to paint wild animals is to gradually accumulate a large number of studies and a great knowledge of the animal itself, before you can paint its picture ... I paint from dead animals as well as from live ones. I have had the body of a fine lioness in my studio ... I have done a great deal of work in the dissecting rooms at the Zoological Gardens from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;"How I paint animals", ''Chums Boys Annual'', No. 256, Vol. V, 4 August 1897&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early in his career, Rivière made some mark as an illustrator, beginning with ''[[Punch magazine]]''. He was elected an [[Associate of the Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1878, and a [[Royal Academician]] in 1881, and received the degree of [[Doctor of Civil Law]] at Oxford in 1891.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He was narrowly defeated in the election for President of the Royal Academy in 1896. His wife, Mary Alice Rivière (née Dobell; 1844–1931) whom he married in 1867, was a painter and exhibited briefly at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1869–70. After his death she presented the [[British Museum]] with four of his drawings (and an etching "The king drinks"), which complements the dozens of prints made after his work housed there, especially by [[Frederick Stacpoole]] and [[William Henry Simmons]]. The artist and his wife had seven children; five sons and two daughters. One of the sons, [[Hugh Goldwin Rivière]] (1869–1956), became a portraitist; another son (Evelyn) married the eminent psychoanalyst and translator of Sigmund Freud known as [[Joan Riviere]].

The '''Catacombs of San Gennaro''' are underground [[Early Christianity|paleo-Christian]] burial and worship sites in [[Naples]], [[Italy]], carved out of [[tuff]], a porous stone. They are situated in the northern part of the city, on the slope leading up to {{ill|Capodimonte (Naples)|it|Capodimonte (Napoli)|lt=Capodimonte}}, consisting of two levels, San Gennaro Superiore, and San Gennaro Inferiore.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259225675_Environmental_Monitoring_of_the_St_Gennaro_and_St_Gaudioso_catacombs_in_Naples|title=Environmental Monitoring of the St. Gennaro and St. Gaudioso catacombs in Naples (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catacombs lie under the [[Rione Sanità]] neighborhood of [[Naples]], sometimes called the "Valley of the Dead".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebanista|first=Carlo|title=Aree funerarie e luoghi di culto in rupe: le cavità artificiali campane tra tarda antichità e medioevo, in Atti VI Convegno Nazionale di Speleologia in Cavità Artificiali, Napoli, 30 maggio-2 giugno 2008 («Opera ipogea», 1/2, 2008), pp. 117-144|url=https://www.academia.edu/1477008/Aree_funerarie_e_luoghi_di_culto_in_rupe_le_cavit%C3%A0_artificiali_campane_tra_tarda_antichit%C3%A0_e_medioevo_in_Atti_VI_Convegno_Nazionale_di_Speleologia_in_Cavit%C3%A0_Artificiali_Napoli_30_maggio-2_giugno_2008_Opera_ipogea_1_2_2008_pp._117-144|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is now easily identified by the large church of [[Madre del Buon Consiglio]].

== History ==
[[File:Catacombe di San Gennaro 003.jpg|left|thumb|One of the halls with carved ''loculi.'']]
Originally, there were three separate cemeteries, dedicated, respectively, to [[Gaudiosus of Abitine|Saint Gaudiosus]] (''San Gaudioso''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napoli.com/english/sotterranea2.php napoli.com - Around Naples&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90237 San Gaudioso di Abitine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Severus of Naples|Saint Severus]] (''San Severo'') and [[St. Januarius]] (''San Gennaro''). These [[catacombs]] in Naples are different from their Roman counterparts in that they have more spacious passageways along two levels. The lower level is the oldest, going back to the 3rd-4th century and may actually be the site of an earlier pre-Christian cemetery later ceded to the new sect. It apparently became an important religious burial site only after the entombment there of Bishop [[Agrippinus of Naples|Agrippinus]].  The second level was the one expanded so as to encompass the other two adjacent cemeteries.

The foundation of [[San Gennaro extra Moenia]] is connected with the Catacombs of San Gennaro, the largest Christian catacomb complex in southern Italy. The first structure was probably the result of the fusion of two ancient burial sites, one from the 2nd century CE that contained the remains of [[Saint Agrippinus of Naples]], the first [[patron saint]] of Naples, and the site from the 4th century CE that contained the remains of [[St. Januarius]], the  patron saint of the city.

The site was consecrated to Gennaro (Januarius) in the fifth century on the occasion of the entombment there of his remains, which were later removed to the [[Cathedral of Naples]] by [[John IV (bishop of Naples)|Bishop John IV]] (842-849) in the 9th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As the burial areas grew around the remains of Gennaro so did underground places of worship for the growing Christian faith. An early example of religious use of the catacombs is the [[Basilica]] of Agrippinus dating to the fourth century. An altar and chair are carved from the tuff creating a meeting place for worshipers. Other ritual spaces included a [[confessional]], [[baptismal font]], a carved tuff table used as a seat for a consignatorium (area for [[confirmation]]), or “oleorum” table for holy oils, and possibly, monastic and hermit cells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Until the eleventh century the catacombs were the burial site of Neapolitan bishops, including [[Quodvultdeus|Quodvoltdeus]], the exiled bishop of Carthage who died in 450 AD. Between the 13th and 18th century, the catacombs were the victim of severe looting. Restoration of the catacombs was made possible only after the transfer of skeletal remains to another cemetery. During WWII the catacombs were used by the local population as a place of shelter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Catacombs were reopened in 1969 by the Archbishop of Naples and modern excavations started in 1971.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gino_Iannace/publication/256457813_The_acoustic_of_the_Catacombs_of_San_Gennaro_in_Naples/links/0046352385aa897a91000000.pdf|title=The Acoustic of The Catacombs of "San Gennaro" in Naples|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of burials ==
The types of tombs include [[Loculus (architecture)|loculi]], [[Arcosolium|arcosoli]], pits dug in the ground, and less often, [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] made of tuff, or recycled marble and stone from older graves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The loculi are aligned vertically and the most simple style of burial found in the catacombs but not indicative of the status of the deceased. Arcosoli, made for family funeral areas, are built into the walls of the galleries and cubicles and are more sophisticated than the loculi. Sometimes decorated with [[mosaic]]s or [[fresco]]es, the burials may be stacked horizontally. This type of burial is often found in Sicilian catacombs as well, and can be described as a “Siracusa” burial and is often found in Greek areas of catacombs. Occasionally child burials are found in the bottom wall of the [[lunette]], another example of the efficient use of space in the catacombs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Oil lamps ==
Approximately 200 oil lamps dating from late antiquity to the Middle Ages have been found in the catacombs. Included in the findings are 54 [[African red slip ware|African red slip lamps]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A thorough study of all the lamps will eventually indicate trade routes from the time period as well as the types of people using the catacombs for burial and ritual purposes. The oldest oil lamps found date back to the second half of the third century and were made in Naples.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaudio|first=Antonio Del|last2=Ebanista|first2=Carlo|title=Le lucerne di età tardoantica e altomedievale dalla catacomba di S.

The '''cello''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|l|oʊ}} {{respell|CHEL|oh}}; plural '''cellos''' or '''celli''') or '''violoncello''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|aɪ|əl|ən|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|l|oʊ}} {{respell|VY|ə-lən|CHEL|oh}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/pronunciation/english/violoncello |title=violoncello noun – Pronunciation |website=Oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-it|vjolonˈtʃɛllo}}) is a [[string instrument]]. It is played by [[Bow (music)|bowing]] or [[pizzicato|plucking]] its four strings, which are usually [[intonation (music)|tuned]] in [[perfect fifth]]s an octave lower than the [[viola]]: from low to high, [[scientific pitch notation|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. It is the bass member of the [[violin family]], which also includes the [[violin]], viola and the [[double bass]], which doubles the bass line an octave lower than the cello in much of the orchestral repertoire. After the double bass, it is the second-largest and second lowest (in pitch) [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]] in the modern symphony orchestra. The cello is used as a solo instrument, as well as in [[chamber music]] ensembles (e.g., [[string quartet]]), [[string orchestra]]s, as a member of the [[string section]] of [[symphony orchestra]]s, most modern [[Chinese orchestra]]s, and some types of [[cello rock|rock bands]]. 

Music for the cello is generally written in the [[bass clef]], but both [[tenor clef]] and [[treble clef]] are used for higher-range parts, both in orchestral/chamber music parts and in solo cello works. A person who plays the cello is called a ''cellist'' or ''violoncellist''. In a small classical ensemble, such as a string quartet, the cello typically plays the [[bassline|bass part]], the lowest-pitched musical line of the piece. In an [[orchestra]] of the [[Baroque era]] (ca. 1600–1750) and [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (ca. 1725–1800), the cello typically plays the bass part, generally doubled an octave lower by the double basses. In Baroque-era music, the cello is often used to play the [[basso continuo]] bassline, typically along with a [[keyboard instrument]] (e.g., [[pipe organ]] or [[harpsichord]]) or a fretted, plucked stringed instrument (e.g., [[lute]] or [[theorbo]]). In such a Baroque performance, the cello player might be joined or replaced by other bass instruments, playing [[bassoon]], [[double bass]], [[viol]] or other low-register instruments.

==Etymology==
The name ''cello'' is derived from the ending of the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''violoncello'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/violoncello|title=Violoncello |publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means "little [[violone]]". The [[violone]] ("big viol") was the lowest-pitched instrument of the [[viol]] family, the group of stringed instruments that went out of fashion around the end of the 17th century in most countries except France, where they survived another half-century before the louder [[violin]] family came into greater favour in that country as well. In modern symphony orchestras, it is the second largest stringed instrument (the [[double bass]] is the largest). Thus, the name "violoncello" contained both the [[augmentative]] "''-one''" ("big") and the [[diminutive]] "''-cello''" ("little"). By the turn of the 20th century, it had become common to shorten the name to 'cello, with the apostrophe indicating the missing stem.&lt;ref name="countess"&gt;{{cite web|author=Delbanco, Nicholas|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108101905/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-70397117.html|title=The Countess of Stanlein Restored|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-70397117.html|publisher=Harper's Magazine|accessdate=4 October 2016|archivedate=January 8, 2009|date=January 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now customary to use "cello" without apostrophe as the full designation.&lt;ref name="countess"/&gt; ''Viol'' is derived from the root ''viola'', which was derived from [[Medieval Latin]] ''vitula'', meaning stringed instrument.

==Description==
[[File:Cello study.jpg|thumb|Cello close-up]]
[[File:Violoncello open strings.png|thumb|Cello open strings. {{audio|Violoncello open strings actual.mid|Play}}]]
Cellos are tuned in [[perfect fifth|fifths]], starting with [[Scientific pitch notation|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (two [[octave]]s below [[middle C]]), followed by G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and then A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is tuned in the same intervals as the [[viola]], but an octave lower. Unlike the [[violin]] or [[viola]] but similar to the [[double bass]], the cello has an [[endpin]] that rests on the floor to support the instrument's weight. The cello is most closely associated with [[Classical music|European classical music]], and has been described as the closest sounding instrument to the human voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Leyla Mamedova |author2=Isin Metin |author3=Nuran Ekici |author4=Murad Huseyinov |author5=Gulara Huseyinova |author6=Mehmet Kanter |title=An Ultrastructural Study on the Effects of Different Musical Timbres on the Skeletal Muscle Cells |journal=Asian Journal of Cell Biology |date=2007 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=43–49 |url=http://www.academicjournals.net/2/detail.php?id=2&amp;jid=ajcb&amp;theme=2&amp;issueno=4&amp;articleno=17 |accessdate=4 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207073731/http://www.academicjournals.net/2/detail.php?id=2&amp;jid=ajcb&amp;theme=2&amp;issueno=4&amp;articleno=17 |archivedate=7 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is a part of the standard [[orchestra]], as part of the [[string section]], and is the bass voice of the [[string quartet]] (although many composers give it a melodic role as well), as well as being part of many other [[chamber music|chamber]] groups.

Among the most well-known Baroque works for the cello are [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s six unaccompanied [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Suites]].  The cello possibly figures as a member of the  [[Figured bass|basso continuo]] group in chamber works by [[Francesca Caccini]] (1587–1641), [[Barbara Strozzi]] (1619–1677) with pieces such as ''Il primo libro di madrigali, per 2–5 voci e basso continuo, op. 1'' and  [[Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre|Elisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre]] (1665–1729) who wrote six sonatas for violin and basso continuo.

From the [[Classical music era|Classical era]], the two concertos by [[Joseph Haydn]] in [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Haydn)|C major]] and [[Cello Concerto No. 2 (Haydn)|D major]] stand out, as do the five sonatas for cello and pianoforte of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], which span the important three periods of his compositional evolution. A ''Divertimento for Piano, Clarinet, Viola and Cello'' is among the  surviving works by [[Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] (1739–1807).

A review of compositions for cello in the [[Romantic music era|Romantic era]] must include the German composer [[Fanny Mendelssohn]] (1805–1847) who wrote the Fantasy in G minor for cello and piano and a Capriccio in A-flat for cello.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--Who claims these are important or even well-known works?--&gt; Other well-known works of the era include the [[Robert Schumann]] [[Cello Concerto (Schumann)|Concerto]], the [[Antonín Dvořák]] [[Cello Concerto (Dvořák)|Concerto]] as well as the two sonatas and the [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] by [[Johannes Brahms]].

Compositions from the late-19th and early 20th century include three cello sonatas (including the Cello Sonata in C Minor written in 1880) by [[Ethel Smyth|Dame Ethel Smyth]] (1858–1944),  [[Edward Elgar]]'s [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|Cello Concerto in E minor]], [[Claude Debussy]]'s [[Cello Sonata (Debussy)|Sonata for Cello and Piano]], and unaccompanied cello sonatas by [[Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Paul Hindemith]].  Pieces including cello were written by [[American Music Center|American Music Cente]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; founder [[Marion Bauer]] (1882–1955)  (two trio sonatas for flute, cello and piano) and Ruth Crawford Seeger (1901–1953) (Diaphonic suite No. 2 for bassoon and cello).

Polish composer [[Grażyna Bacewicz]] (1909–1969) was writing for cello in the mid 20th century with Concerto No. 1 for Cello and Orchestra (1951), Concerto No. 2 for Cello and Orchestra (1963) and in 1964 composed her Quartet for four cellos. The cello's versatility made it popular with many male composers in this era as well, such as [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Witold Lutoslawski]] and [[Henri Dutilleux]].

Well-known cellists include [[Jacqueline du Pré|Jacqueline du Pre]], [[Raya Garbousova]], [[Zara Nelsova]], [[Hildur Guðnadóttir|Hildur Gudnadottir]], [[Han-na Chang|Han-Na Chang]], [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] and [[Beatrice Harrison]]. Others include [[Anner Bylsma]], [[Yo-Yo Ma]], [[Pablo Casals]], [[Julian Lloyd Webber]], [[Alfred Wallenstein]], [[Mischa Maisky]] and [[Gregor Piatigorsky]]. See the comprehensive list of [[List of cellists#A 2|cellists]] here.

In the 2010s, the instrument is found in [[popular music]], but was more commonly used in 1970s pop and [[disco]] music.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Today it is sometimes featured in [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] recordings, examples of which are noted later in this article. The cello has also recently appeared in major [[hip-hop]] and [[R &amp; B]] performances, such as singers [[Rihanna]] and [[Ne-Yo]]'s performance at the [[American Music Awards]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The instrument has also been modified for [[Indian classical music]] by Nancy Lesh and [[Saskia Rao-de Haas]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Cello#cite note-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==History&lt;!--'Viola da spalla' redirects here--&gt;==
The [[viola da braccio|violin family]], including cello-sized instruments, emerged c. 1500 as family of instruments distinct from the [[viol|viola da gamba]] family. The earliest depictions of the violin family, from northern Italy c. 1530, show three sizes of instruments, roughly corresponding to what we now call [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, and cellos. Contrary to a popular misconception, the cello did not evolve from the viola da gamba, but existed alongside it for about two and a half centuries. The violin family is also known as the viola da braccio (meaning viola of the arm) family, a reference to the primary way the members of the family are held. This is to distinguish it from the viola da gamba (meaning viola of the leg) family, in which all the members are all held with the legs. The likely predecessors of the violin family include the [[lira da braccio]] and the [[rebec]]. The earliest surviving cellos are made by [[Andrea Amati]], the first known member of the celebrated [[Amati]] family of [[luthier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;.[http://collections.nmmusd.org/Cellos/Amati/Amaticello.html]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--The instrument described is clearly stated to have been a three-string bass, later cut down and remade into a cello.--&gt;

The direct ancestor to the violoncello was the [[bass violin]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Monteverdi referred to the instrument as "basso de viola da braccio" in ''Orfeo'' (1607). Although the first [[bass violin]], possibly invented as early as 1538, was most likely inspired by the viol, it was created to be used in consort with the violin. The bass violin was actually often referred to as a "''violone''", or "large viola", as were the viols of the same period. Instruments that share features with both the bass violin and the ''viola da gamba'' appear in Italian art of the early 16th century.

The invention of wire-wound [[String (music)|strings]] (fine wire around a thin gut core), around 1660 in [[Bologna]], allowed for a finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body. Bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello, a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument and the fact that the smaller size made it easier to play [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] passages.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} This instrument had disadvantages as well, however. The cello's light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing, so it had to be doubled by [[organ (music)|organ]], [[theorbo]] or [[violone]].

Around 1700, Italian players popularized the cello in northern Europe, although the bass violin (basse de violon) continued to be used for another two decades in France.{{citation needed|date=November 2007}}&lt;!--I believe you, I would just like to know where you got the info--&gt; Many existing bass violins were literally cut down in size to convert them into cellos according to the smaller pattern developed by [[Stradivarius]], who also made a number of old pattern large cellos (the 'Servais').&lt;ref name="vrzuok" &gt;{{Cite journal|last= Cyr |first= Mary |title= Basses and basse continue in the Orchestra of the Paris Opéra 1700–1764 |journal= Early Music |volume= X |issue= Apr., 1982 |pages= 155–170 |doi=10.1093/earlyj/10.2.155|ref=harv }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The sizes, names, and tunings of the cello varied widely by geography and time.&lt;ref name="vrzuok"/&gt; The size was not standardized until around 1750.

Despite similarities to the [[viol|viola da gamba]], the cello is actually part of the [[viola da braccio]] family, meaning "viol of the arm", which includes, among others, the [[violin]] and [[viola]]. Though paintings like [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Bruegel]]'s "The Rustic Wedding", and [[Philibert Jambe de Fer|Jambe de Fer]] in his ''Epitome Musical'' suggest that the bass violin had alternate playing positions, these were short-lived and the more practical and ergonomic ''a gamba'' position eventually replaced them entirely.

[[File:Cello strung gut.JPG|thumb|right|A baroque cello strung with gut strings. Note the absence of fine-tuning pins on the tailpiece.]]
[[Baroque]]-era cellos differed from the modern instrument in several ways. The neck has a different form and angle, which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing.{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--What?!--&gt; Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theclassymusician.com/blog/the-endpin |title=The Endpin – The Classy Musician |website=Theclassymusician.com |date=March 7, 2016  |author=Marsh, Gregory and Elizabeth |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the [[Bow frog|frog]]; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of [[Catgut|gut]], with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make it much easier to tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello,{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.

Few educational works specifically devoted to the cello existed before the 18th century, and those that do exist contain little value to the performer beyond simple accounts of instrumental technique. One of the earliest cello manuals is [[Michel Corrette]]'s ''Méthode, thèorique et pratique pour apprendre en peu de temps le violoncelle dans sa perfection'' (Paris, 1741).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cello.org/heaven/wasiel/18italy.htm |title=Cello Playing in 18th Century Italy |website=Cello.org |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==

===Orchestral===
[[File:FHM-Orchestra-mk2006-03.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cello section of the orchestra of the Munich University of Applied Sciences is shown here.]]
Cellos are part of the standard [[orchestra|symphony orchestra]], which usually includes eight to twelve cello players. The cello section, in standard orchestral seating, is located on stage left (the audience's right) in the front, opposite the first violin section. However, some orchestras and conductors prefer switching the positioning of the viola and cello sections. The ''principal'' cellist is the section leader, determining bowings for the section in conjunction with other string principals, playing solos and leading entrances (when the section begins to play its part). Principal players always sit closest to the audience.

The cellos are a critical part of orchestral music; all symphonic works involve the cello section, and many pieces require cello soli or solos. Much of the time, cellos provide part of the low-register harmony for the orchestra. Often, the cello section plays the melody for a brief period, before returning to the harmony role. There are also cello [[concerto]]s, which are orchestral pieces that feature a solo cellist accompanied by an entire orchestra.

===Solo===
There are numerous [[cello concerto]]s – where a solo cello is accompanied by an [[orchestra]] – notably 25 by [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], 12 by [[Luigi Boccherini|Boccherini]], at least 3 by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], 3 by [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;E. Bach]], 2 by [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], 2 by Dvořák, and one each by Robert Schumann], [[Édouard Lalo|Lalo]], and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]. There were also some cellists who, while not otherwise composers, did write cello-specific repertoire, such as [[Nikolaus Kraft]] who wrote six cello concertos. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] for Cello, Violin and Piano and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] for Cello and Violin are also part of the concertante repertoire although in both cases the cello shares solo duties with at least one other instrument. Moreover, several composers wrote large-scale pieces for cello and orchestra, which are concertos in all but name. Some familiar "concertos" are [[Richard Strauss]]' [[tone poem]] ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'', [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'', [[Ernest Bloch|Bloch]]'s ''[[Schelomo]]'' and [[Max Bruch|Bruch]]'s ''[[Kol Nidrei (Bruch)|Kol Nidrei]]''.

In the 20th century, the cello repertoire grew immensely. This was partly due to the influence of virtuoso cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who inspired, commissioned and premiered dozens of new works. Among these, Prokofiev's ''[[Symphony-Concerto (Prokofiev)|Symphony-Concerto]]'', [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]'s ''[[Cello Symphony]]'', the concertos of Shostakovich and Lutosławski as well as Dutilleux's ''[[Tout un monde lointain...]]'' have already become part of the standard repertoire. Other major composers who wrote concertante works for him include [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]], [[André Jolivet|Jolivet]], [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]]. In addition, [[Malcolm Arnold|Arnold]], [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[Philip Glass|Glass]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]], Ligeti, [[Nikolai Myaskovsky|Myaskovsky]], Penderecki, [[Joaquín Rodrigo|Rodrigo]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos|Villa-Lobos]] and [[William Walton|Walton]] also wrote major [[List of compositions for cello and orchestra|concertos]] for other cellists, notably for [[Gaspar Cassadó]], [[Aldo Parisot]], Gregor Piatigorsky, [[Siegfried Palm]] and [[Julian Lloyd Webber]].

There are also many [[cello sonata|sonatas]] for cello and [[piano]]. Those written by [[Beethoven]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Brahms]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], Shostakovich, Prokofiev, [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], [[Elliott Carter|Carter]], and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]] are particularly well known.

Other important pieces for cello and piano include Schumann's five ''Stücke im Volkston'' and transcriptions like [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s [[Arpeggione Sonata]] (originally for [[arpeggione]] and piano), [[César Franck]]'s [[Cello Sonata (Franck/Delsart)|Cello Sonata]] (originally a violin sonata, transcribed by [[Jules Delsart]] with the composer's approval), [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)#Suite italienne|Suite italienne]]'' (transcribed by the composer – with Gregor Piatigorsky – from his ballet ''Pulcinella'') and [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]'s first rhapsody (also transcribed by the composer, originally for violin and piano).

There are pieces for [[List of solo cello pieces|cello solo]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.&amp;nbsp;S. Bach]]'s six [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Suites for Cello]] (which are among the best-known solo cello pieces), [[Zoltán Kodály|Kodály]]'s [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Kodály)|Sonata for Solo Cello]] and Britten's three [[Cello Suites (Britten)|Cello Suites]]. Other notable examples include [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]]'s and [[Eugène Ysaÿe|Ysaÿe]]'s Sonatas for Solo Cello, Dutilleux's ''Trois Strophes sur le Nom de Sacher'', Berio's ''Les Mots Sont Allés'', [[Gaspar Cassadó|Cassadó]]'s Suite for Solo Cello, Ligeti's [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Ligeti)|Solo Sonata]], Carter's two ''Figment''s and [[Iannis Xenakis|Xenakis]]' ''[[Nomos Alpha]]'' and ''Kottos''.

===Quartets and other ensembles===
The cello is a member of the traditional [[string quartet]] as well as [[string quintets]], [[string sextet|sextet]] or [[string trio|trios]] and other mixed ensembles.
There are also pieces written for two, three, four or more cellos; this type of ensemble is also called a "cello choir" and its sound is familiar from the introduction to [[Rossini]]'s [[William Tell Overture]] as well as Zaccharia's prayer scene in [[Verdi]]'s [[Nabucco]]. [[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[1812 Overture]] also starts with a cello ensemble, with four cellos playing the top lines and two violas playing the bass lines.  As a self-sufficient ensemble, its most famous repertoire is [[Villa-Lobos]]' first of his [[Bachianas Brasileiras]] for cello ensemble (the fifth is for soprano and 8 cellos). Other examples are [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s cello duets, quartet, and sextet, [[Pärt]]'s [[Fratres]] for 8 cellos and [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]]' ''Messagesquisse'' for 7 cellos, or even Villa-Lobos' rarely played ''Fantasia Concertante'' (1958) for 32 cellos. The 12 cellists of the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] (or "the Twelve" as they have since taken to being called) specialize in this repertoire and have commissioned many works, including arrangements of well-known popular songs.

[[File:Apocalyptica - Ilosaarirock 2009.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Apocalyptica]] at the 2009 [[Ilosaarirock]] festival.]]
The cello is less common in [[popular music]] than in classical music. Several bands feature a cello in their standard line-up, e.g. Joe Kwon of [[The Avett Brothers]]. The more common use in [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] is to bring the instrument in for a particular song. In the 1960s, artists such as [[the Beatles]] and [[Cher]] used the cello in popular music, in songs such as The Beatles' "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]", "[[Eleanor Rigby]]" and "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", and Cher's "[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]". "[[Good Vibrations]]" by [[the Beach Boys]] includes the cello in its instrumental ensemble, which includes a number of instruments unusual for this sort of music. Bass guitarist [[Jack Bruce]], who had  originally studied music on a performance scholarship for cello, played a prominent cello part in "As You Said" on [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s ''[[Wheels of Fire]]'' studio album (1968).

In the 1970s, the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] enjoyed great commercial success taking inspiration from so-called "Beatlesque" arrangements, adding the cello (and violin) to the standard rock combo line-up and in 1978 the UK based rock band, [[Colosseum II]], collaborated with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber on the recording ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]''. Most notably, [[Pink Floyd]] included a cello solo in their 1970 epic instrumental "[[Atom Heart Mother (suite)|Atom Heart Mother]]". Bass guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] was originally a cellist and included some cello parts in their ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' album.

Established non-traditional cello groups include [[Apocalyptica]], a group of Finnish cellists best known for their versions of [[Metallica]] songs, [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]], a group of cellists committed to an intricate cello style intermingled with Gothic music, the [[Massive Violins]], an ensemble of seven singing cellists known for their arrangements of rock, pop and classical hits, Von Cello, a cello fronted rock power trio, [[Break of Reality]] who mix elements of classical music with the more modern rock and metal genre, [[Cello Fury]], a cello rock band that performs original rock/classical crossover music, and Jelloslave, a Minneapolis-based Cello duo with two percussionists. These groups are examples of a style that has become known as [[cello rock]]. The crossover string quartet [[Bond (band)|bond]] also includes a cellist. Silenzium and Cellissimo Quartet are [[Russia]]n (Novosibirsk) groups playing rock and metal and having more and more popularity in [[Siberia]]. [[Cold Fairyland]] from [[Shanghai]], [[China]] is using a cello along a [[Pipa]] as the main solo instrument to create East meets West progressive (folk) rock.

More recent bands using the cello are [[Aerosmith]], [[The Auteurs]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[James (band)|James]], [[Talk Talk]], [[Phillip Phillips]], [[OneRepublic]], and the [[baroque rock]] band [[Arcade Fire]]. An Atlanta-based trio, King Richard's Sunday Best, also uses a cellist in their lineup. So-called "chamber pop" artists like [[Kronos Quartet]], The Vitamin String Quartet and Margot and the Nuclear So and So's have also recently made cello common in modern alternative rock. Heavy metal band [[System of a Down]] has also made use of the cello's rich sound. The indie rock band [[The Stiletto Formal]] are known for using a cello as a major staple of their sound, similarly, the indie rock band [[Canada (music group)|Canada]] employs two cello players in their lineup. The orch-rock group, [[The Polyphonic Spree]], which has pioneered the use of stringed and symphonic instruments, employs the cello in very creative ways for many of their "[[psychedelia|psychedelic]]-esque" melodies. The first wave [[screamo]] band ''I Would Set Myself On Fire For You'' featured a cello as well as a viola to create a more [[Folk music|folk]]-oriented sound. The band, [[Panic! at the Disco]] uses a cello in their song, "Build God, Then We'll Talk". The lead vocalist of the band, [[Brendon Urie]], also did the recording of the cello solo. [[The Lumineers]] added cellist Nela Pekarek to the band in 2010. She plays cello, sings harmony and duets.

In [[jazz]], bassists [[Oscar Pettiford]] and [[Harry Babasin]] were among the first to use the cello as a solo instrument; both tuned their instrument in fourths, an octave above the double bass. [[Fred Katz (cellist)|Fred Katz]] (who was not a bassist) was one of the first notable jazz cellists to use the instrument's standard tuning and arco technique. Contemporary jazz cellists include [[Abdul Wadud (musician)|Abdul Wadud]], [[Diedre Murray]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Dave Holland]], [[David Darling (musician)|David Darling]], [[Lucio Amanti]], Akua Dixon, [[Ernst Reijseger]], [[Fred Lonberg-Holm]], [[Tom Cora]] and [[Erik Friedlander]]. Modern musical theatre pieces like Jason Robert Brown's [[The Last Five Years]], Duncan Sheik's [[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]], Adam Guettel's [[Floyd Collins (musical)|Floyd Collins]], and Ricky Ian Gordon's [[My Life with Albertine]] use small string ensembles (including solo cellos) to a prominent extent.

In Indian Classical music [[Saskia Rao-de Haas]] is a well established soloist as well as playing duets with her sitarist husband Pt. [[Shubhendra Rao]]. Other cellists performing Indian classical music are: Nancy Lesh (Dhrupad) and Anup Biswas. Both Rao and Lesh play the cello sitting cross-legged on the floor.

The cello can also be used in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[folk music]], with notable players including [[Ben Sollee]] of the [[Sparrow Quartet]] and the "Cajun cellist" Sean Grissom, as well as [[Vyvienne Long]] who, in addition to her own projects, has played for those of [[Damien Rice]]. Cellists such as [[Natalie Haas]], Abby Newton and Liz Davis Maxfield have contributed significantly to the use of cello playing in Celtic folk music, often with the cello featured as a primary melodic instrument and employing the skills and techniques of traditional fiddle playing. [[Lindsay Mac]] is becoming well known for playing the cello like a guitar, with her cover of [[The Beatles]]' "[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]".

==Construction==
[[File:Cello Parts.jpg|thumb|Main parts of the cello|230px]]
The cello is typically made from carved wood, although other materials such as [[carbon fiber]] or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a [[spruce]] top, with [[maple]] for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as [[Populus|poplar]] or [[willow]], are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of [[Plywood|laminated wood]]. Laminated cellos are widely used in elementary and secondary school orchestras and [[youth orchestra]]s, because they are much more durable than carved wood cellos (i.e., they are less likely to crack if bumped or dropped) and they are much less expensive.

The top and back are traditionally hand-carved, though less expensive cellos are often machine-produced. The sides, or ribs, are made by heating the wood and bending it around forms. The cello body has a wide top bout, narrow middle formed by two C-bouts, and wide bottom bout, with the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] and [[F holes]] just below the middle. The top and back of the cello has decorative border inlay known as [[purfling]]. While purfling is attractive, it is also functional: if the instrument is struck, the purfling can prevent cracking of the wood. A crack may form at the rim of the instrument, but spreads no further. Without purfling, cracks can spread up or down the top or back. Playing, traveling and the weather all affect the cello and can increase a crack if purfling is not in place. Less expensive instruments typically have painted purfling.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Alternative materials===
Cello manufacturer [[Luis and Clark|Luis &amp; Clark]] constructs cellos from [[carbon fibre]]. Carbon fibre instruments are particularly suitable for outdoor playing because of the strength of the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Luis &amp; Clark has produced over 1000 cellos, some of which are owned by cellists such as Yo-Yo Ma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/arts/music/19carb.html?_r=0 |title=Cold Case: Luis and Clark Carbon Expedition for Yo-Yo Ma? |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 18, 2009 |author=Chris Museler |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Josephine van Lier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van Lier|first1=Josephine|title=Luis and Clark Carbon Fibre Cells|url=http://www.albertastringassociation.ca/docs/ASANewsletterSummer2006.pdf|website=Alberta String Association|accessdate=4 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407090955/http://www.albertastringassociation.ca/docs/ASANewsletterSummer2006.pdf|archivedate=April 7, 2014|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) as well as German luthier G.A. Pfretzschner produced an unknown number of aluminum cellos (in addition to aluminum double basses and violins).

===Neck, fingerboard, pegbox, and scroll===
Above the main body is the carved neck. The neck has a curved cross-section on its underside, which is where the player's thumb runs along the neck during playing. The neck which leads to a [[pegbox]] and the [[scroll (music)|scroll]]. The neck, pegbox, and scroll are normally carved out of a single piece of wood, usually [[maple]]. The [[fingerboard]] is glued to the neck and extends over the body of the instrument. The fingerboard is given a curved shape, matching the curve on the bridge. Both the fingerboard and bridge need to be curved so that the performer can bow individual strings. If the cello were to have a flat fingerboard and bridge, as with a typical guitar, the performer would only be able to bow the "outer" two strings or bow all the strings. The performer would not be able to play the "inner" two strings alone.

The [[Nut (instrumental)|nut]] is a raised piece of wood, fitted where the fingerboard meets the pegbox, in which the strings rest in shallow slots or grooves to keep them the correct distance apart. The pegbox houses four tapered [[tuning peg]]s, one for each string. The pegs are used to tune the cello by either tightening or loosening the string. The pegs are called "friction pegs", because they maintain their position by friction. The scroll is a traditional ornamental part of the cello and a feature of all other members of the [[violin family]]. [[Ebony]] is usually used for the tuning pegs, fingerboard, and nut, but other hardwoods, such as [[Buxus|boxwood]] or [[rosewood]], can be used. Black fittings on low-cost instruments are often made from inexpensive wood that has been blackened or "ebonized" to look like [[ebony]], which is much harder and more expensive. Ebonised parts such as tuning pegs may crack or split, and the black surface of the fingerboard will eventually wear down to reveal the lighter wood underneath.

===Strings===
Historically, cello [[String (music)|strings]] had cores made out of [[catgut]], which, despite its name is made from sheep or goat intestines which are dried out. Most modern strings used in the 2010s are wound with metallic materials like [[aluminum]], [[titanium]] and [[chromium]]. Cellists may mix different types of strings on their instruments. The pitches of the open strings are C, G, D, and A (black note heads in the playing range figure above), unless alternative tuning ([[scordatura]]) is specified by the composer. Some composers (e.g. [[Ottorino Respighi]] in the final movement of ‘’[[The Pines of Rome]]’’) ask that the low C be tuned down to a B{{Music|b}} or B so that the performer can play a different low note on the lowest open string.

===Tailpiece and endpin===
The [[tailpiece]] and [[endpin]] are found in the lower part of the cello. The tailpiece is the part of the cello to which the "ball ends" of the strings are attached by passing them through holes. The tailpiece is attached to the bottom of the cello. The tailpiece is traditionally made of [[ebony]] or another hard wood, but can also be made of [[plastic]] or [[steel]] on lower-cost instruments. It attaches the strings to the lower end of the cello, and can have one or more fine tuners. The fine tuners are used to make smaller adjustments to the pitch of the string. The fine tuners can increase the tension of each string (raising the pitch) or decrease the tension of the string (lowering the pitch). When the performer is putting on a new string, the fine tuner for that string is normally reset to a middle position, and then the peg is turned to bring the string up to pitch. The fine turners are used for subtle, minor adjustments to pitch, such as tuning a cello to the oboe's 440&amp;nbsp;Hz A note or to tune the cello to a piano.

The endpin or spike is made of wood, metal or rigid carbon fibre and supports the cello in playing position. The endpin can be retracted into the hollow body of the instrument when the cello is being transported in its case. This makes the cello easier to move about. When the performer wishes to play the cello, the endpin is pulled out to lengthen it. The endpin is locked into the player's preferred length with a screw mechanism. The adjustable nature of endpins enables performers of different ages and body sizes to adjust the endpin length to suit them.  In the Baroque period the cello was held between the calves, as there was no endpin at that time. The endpin was "introduced by Adrien Servais {{circa}} 1845 to give the instrument greater stability".&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stowell|first=Robin|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Cello|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvlhQgAACAAJ|date=June 28, 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were removed when not in use. (The word "endpin" sometimes also refers to the button of wood located at this place in all instruments in the violin family, but this is usually called "tailpin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/stringed-instrument |title=Stringed instrument |website=britannica.com |author=Eric Halfpenny |author2=Theodore C Grame |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The sharp tip of the cello's endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that protects the tip from dulling and prevents the cello from slipping on the floor. Many cellists use a rubber pad with a metal cup to keep the tip from slipping on the floor. A number of accessories to keep the endpin from slipping; these include ropes which attach to the chair leg and other devices.

===Bridge and f-holes===
[[File:Cello bridge2.JPG|right|thumb|The bridge of a cello, with a mute (the mute is not in use)]]
The [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] holds the strings above the cello and transfers their vibrations to the top of the instrument and the soundpost inside (see below). The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The bridge is usually positioned by the cross point of the "f-hole" (i.e., where the horizontal line occurs in the "f"). The [[sound-hole|f-holes]], named for their shape, are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument as part of the sound-production process.  They probably actually stand for an old style medial S, for words related to Sound.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The f-holes also act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small length of rubber hose containing a water-soaked sponge, called a Dampit, is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a humidifier. This keeps the wood components of the cello from drying out.

===Internal features===
Internally, the cello has two important features: a [[bass bar]], which is glued to the underside of the top of the instrument, and a round wooden [[sound post]], a solid wooden cylinder which is wedged between the top and bottom plates. The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations from the strings to the body of the instrument. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings' vibrations to the top (front) of the instrument (and to a lesser extent the back), acting as a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to produce the instrument's sound.

===Glue===
Cellos are constructed and repaired using [[hide glue]], which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs call for the removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it lets go, so the plate does not crack. Cellists repairing cracks in their cello do not use regular [[wood glue]], because it cannot be steamed open when a repair has to be made by a [[luthier]].

===Bow===
[[File:Bow hand Violoncello.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|A cello French bow&lt;ref&gt;As opposed to the German bow popular in baroque era, held underhand.&lt;/ref&gt; ''sul ponticello'']]
Traditionally, [[bow (music)|bows]] are made from [[Paubrasilia|pernambuco]] or [[brazilwood]]. Both come from the same species of tree (''Caesalpinia echinata''), but pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the heartwood of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity, &lt;!--and high sound velocity--&gt;which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows. Horsehair is stretched out between the two ends of the bow. The taut horsehair is drawn over the strings to produce the cello's characteristic tone. A small knob is twisted to increase or decrease the tension of the horsehair. The tension on the bow is released when the instrument is not being used. The amount of tension a cellist puts on the bow hair depends on the preferences of the player, the style of music being played, and for students, the preferences of their teacher.

Bows are also made from other materials, such as carbon-fibre—stronger than wood—and fiberglass (often used to make inexpensive, lower-quality student bows). An average cello bow is {{convert|73|cm|in|abbr=on}} long (shorter than a violin or viola bow) {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} high (from the frog to the stick) and {{convert|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The frog of a cello bow typically has a rounded corner like that of a viola bow, but is wider. A cello bow is roughly {{convert|10|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier than a viola bow, which in turn is roughly {{convert|10|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier than a violin bow. &lt;!-- for example, see http://www.codabow.com/info_buyfirstbow.html --&gt;

Bow hair is traditionally [[horsehair]], though synthetic hair, in varying colors, is also used. Prior to playing, the musician tightens the bow by turning a screw to pull the frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back, and increase the tension of the hair. [[Rosin]] is applied by the player to make the hairs sticky. Bows need to be re-haired periodically. [[Baroque]] style (1600–1750) cello bows were much thicker and were formed with a larger outward arch when compared to modern cello bows. The inward arch of a modern cello bow produces greater tension, which in turn gives off a louder sound.

The cello bow has also been used to play [[electric guitar]]s. Jimmy Page pioneered its application on tracks such as "[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]". The [[post-rock]] [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] band [[Sigur Rós]]'s lead singer often plays a guitar using a cello bow.

In 1989, the German cellist [[Michael Bach (musician)|Michael Bach]] began developing a [[curved bow]], encouraged by [[John Cage]], [[Dieter Schnebel]], Mstislav Rostropovich and [[Luigi Colani]]: and since then many pieces have been composed especially for it. This curved bow (''BACH.Bow'') is a convex curved bow which, unlike the ordinary bow, renders possible polyphonic playing on the various strings of the instrument. The solo repertoire for violin and cello by J. S. Bach the BACH.Bow is particularly suited to it: and it was developed with this in mind, polyphonic playing being required, as well as monophonic.

==Physics==

===Physical aspects===
When a string is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves the air around it, producing sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved by the string itself, and consequently if the string was not mounted on a hollow body, the sound would be weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger hollow wooden body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instrument’s vibrational patterns and thus changes the character of the sound produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowling|first=Elizabeth|title=The cello|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46gXAQAAIAAJ|year=1983|publisher=C. Scribner's Sons|isbn=978-0-684-17870-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A string’s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length. Tightening a string stiffens it by increasing both the outward forces along its length and the net forces it experiences during a distortion.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield, Louis A 2001. pp 241-244"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloomfield|first=Louis|title=How things work: the physics of everyday life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgUvAQAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-38151-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cello can be tuned by adjusting the tension of its strings, by turning the tuning pegs mounted on its pegbox, and tension adjusters (fine tuners) on the tail piece.

A string’s length also affects its fundamental pitch. Shortening a string stiffens it by increasing its curvature during a distortion and subjecting it to larger net forces. Shortening the string also reduces its mass,  but does not alter the mass per unit length,  and it is the latter ratio rather than the total mass which governs the frequency.   The string vibrates in a standing wave whose speed of propagation is given by {{sqrt|''T''/''m''}},  where ''T'' is the tension and ''m'' is the mass per unit length;    there is a node at either end of the vibrating length,  and thus the vibrating length ''l'' is half a wavelength.    Since the frequency of any wave is equal to the speed divided by the wavelength,  we have frequency = {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|2''l''}} × {{sqrt|''T''/''m''}}}}.   (Note that some writers,  including Muncaster (cited below) use the Greek letter ''μ'' in place of ''m''.) Thus shortening a string increases the frequency,  and thus the pitch. Because of this effect, you can raise and change the pitch of a string by pressing it against the fingerboard in the cello’s neck and effectively shortening it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muncaster|first=Roger|title=A-level Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Knov8XAyf2cC|year=1993|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-1584-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise strings with less mass per unit length,  if under the same tension,  will have a higher frequency and thus higher pitch than more massive strings.   This is a prime reason why the different strings on all string instruments have different fundamental pitches,  with the lightest strings having the highest pitches.

A played note of E or F{{music|#}} has a frequency which is often very close to the natural resonating frequency of the body of the instrument,  and if the problem is not addressed this can set the body into near resonance.   This may cause an unpleasant sudden amplification of this pitch,  and additionally a loud beating sound results from the interference produced between these nearby frequencies; this is known as the “[[wolf tone]]” because it is an unpleasant growling sound. The wood resonance appears to be split into two frequencies by the driving force of the sounding string. These two periodic resonances beat with each other. This wolf tone must be eliminated or significantly reduced for the cello to play the nearby notes with a pleasant tone. This can be accomplished by modifying the cello front plate, attaching a wolf eliminator (a metal cylinder or a rubber cylinder encased in metal), or moving the sound post.&lt;ref name="Berg, Richard E 2005. pp 314, 329"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Richard E.|last2=Stork|first2=David G.|title=The Physics of Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FpgQgAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-145789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a string is bowed or plucked to produce a note, the fundamental note is accompanied by higher frequency overtones. Each sound has a particular recipe of frequencies that combine to make the total sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chattopadhyay|first=D.|title=Elements Of Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eA7g3aXePRoC|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-1538-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing technique==
{{main|Cello technique}}
[[File:Cello KSG 9829 PK.jpg|thumb|A cellist]]
Playing the cello is done while seated with the instrument supported on the floor by the endpin. The left hand fingertips stop the strings on the fingerboard, determining the pitch of the fingered note. The right hand plucks or bows the strings to sound the notes. The left hand fingertips stop the strings along their length, determining the pitch of each fingered note. Stopping the string closer to the bridge results in  higher-pitched sound, because the vibrating string length has been shortened. In the ''neck'' positions (which use just less than half of the fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the thumb rests on the back of the neck; in ''[[thumb position]]'' (a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard) the thumb usually rests alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.

[[Vibrato]] is a small oscillation in the pitch of a note, usually considered expressive. [[Harmonics]] played on the cello fall into two classes; natural and artificial. Natural harmonics are produced by lightly touching (but not depressing) the string with the finger at certain places, and then bowing (or, rarely, plucking) the string. For example, the halfway point of the string will produce a harmonic that is one octave above the unfingered (open) string. Natural harmonics only produce notes that are part of the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] on a particular string. Artificial harmonics (also called false harmonics or stopped harmonics), in which the player depresses the string fully with one finger while touching the same string lightly with another finger, can produce any note above middle C. 
[[Glissando]] (Italian for "sliding") is an effect played by sliding the finger up or down the fingerboard without releasing the string. This causes the pitch to rise and fall smoothly, without separate, discernible steps.

In cello playing, the bow is much like the breath of a [[wind instrument]] player. Arguably, it is the major determinant in the expressiveness of the playing. The right hand holds the bow and controls the duration and character of the notes. The bow is drawn across the strings roughly halfway between the end of the [[fingerboard]] and the bridge, in a direction perpendicular to the strings. The bow is held with all five fingers of the right hand, the thumb opposite the fingers and closer to the cellist's body. Tone production and volume of sound depend on a combination of several factors. The three most important ones are: bow speed, weight applied to the string, and point of contact of the bow hair with the string.

[[Double stop]]s involve the playing of two notes at the same time. Two strings are fingered simultaneously, and the bow is drawn so as to sound them both at once. In [[pizzicato]] playing, the string is plucked directly with the fingers or thumb. Pizzicato is often abbreviated as "Pizz.". Position of the hand is slightly over the finger board and away from the bridge.

A player using the [[col legno]] technique strikes or rubs the strings with the wood of the bow rather than the hair. In [[spiccato]] playing, the strings are not "drawn" by the bow hair but struck by it, while still retaining some horizontal motion, to generate a more percussive, crisp sound. In [[staccato]], the player moves the bow a small distance and stops it on the string, making a short sound, the rest of the written duration being taken up by silence. 
[[Legato]] is a technique where the notes are smoothly connected without accents or breaks. It is noted by a slur (curved line) above or below – depending on their position on the staff – the notes of the passage that is to be played legato.

''Sul ponticello'' ("on the bridge") refers to bowing closer to the bridge, while ''sul tasto'' ("on the fingerboard") calls for bowing nearer the end of the fingerboard. Sul tasto produces a more flute-like sound, with more emphasis on the fundamental frequency of the note, and softer overtones.

==Sizes==
[[File:Full size and fractional cello.jpg|thumb|{{frac|1|8}} size cello with full size cello]]
Standard-sized cellos are referred to as "full-size" or "{{frac|4|4}}" but are also made in smaller (fractional) sizes (e.g. {{frac|7|8}}, {{frac|3|4}}, {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|1|8}}, {{frac|1|10}}, {{frac|1|16}}). The fractions refer to volume rather than length, so a 1/2 size cello is much longer than half the length of a full size.  The smaller cellos are identical to standard cellos in construction, range, and usage, but are simply scaled-down for the benefit of children and shorter adults.

Cellos in sizes larger than {{frac|4|4}} do exist, and cellists with unusually large hands may require such a non-standard instrument. Cellos made before approximately 1700 tended to be considerably larger than those made and commonly played today. Around 1680, changes in string-making technology made it possible to play lower-pitched notes on shorter strings. The cellos of [[Stradivari]], for example, can be clearly divided into two models: the style made before 1702, characterized by larger instruments (of which only three exist in their original size and configuration), and the style made during and after 1707, when Stradivari began making smaller cellos. This later model is the design most commonly used by modern luthiers. The [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] of a {{frac|4|4}} cello is about {{convert|27+1/2|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The new size offered fuller tonal projection and greater range of expression. The instrument in this form was able to contribute to more pieces musically and offered the possibility of greater physical dexterity for the player to develop technique.&lt;ref name="size"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stowell|first=Robin|title=The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bJAZU27hWEC|date=November 13, 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00042-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessories==
There are many accessories for the cello.
*Cases are used to protect the cello and bow (or multiple bows).
[[File:Rosins.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Rosin is applied to bow hairs to increase the "bite" of the bow on the strings.]]
*[[Rosin]], made from [[Pinophyta|conifer]] [[resin]], is applied to the bow hairs to increase the effectiveness of the friction, grip or bite, and allow proper sound production. Rosin may have additives to modify the friction such as beeswax, gold, silver or tin. Commonly, rosins are classified as either Dark or Light.
*[[Endpin]] stops or straps (tradenames include Rockstop and Black Hole) keep the cello from sliding if the endpin does not have a rubber piece on the end, or if a floor is particularly slippery.
*[[Wolf tone eliminator]]s are placed on cello strings between the tailpiece and the bridge to eliminate acoustic anomalies known as [[wolf tone]]s or "wolfs".
*[[Mute (music)#String|Mutes]] are used to change the sound of the cello by reducing [[overtones]] and to reduce the amount of noise produced by the instrument by preventing the bridge vibrating as much.
[[File:Wolf tone eliminator.jpg|thumb|150px|A brass wolf tone eliminator typically placed on the G string (second string from the left) of a cello, between the bridge and the tailpiece. (The black rubber piece on the D string (third from the left) is a [[mute (music)|mute]].)]]
*[[Metronome]]s provide a steady [[tempo]] by sounding out a certain number of beats per minute.

==Instrument makers==
{{Main|Luthier}}
Cellos are made by [[luthier]]s, specialists in building and repairing stringed instruments, ranging from guitars to violins. The following luthiers are notable for the cellos they have produced:
*[[Nicolò Amati]] and others in the Amati family
*[[Nicolò Gagliano]]
*[[Matteo Goffriller]]
*[[Giovanni Battista Guadagnini]]
*[[Giuseppe Guarneri]]
*[[Charles Mennégand]]
*[[Domenico Montagnana]]
*[[Giovanni Battista Rogeri]]
*[[Francesco Ruggieri]]
*[[Stefano Scarampella]]
*[[Antonio Stradivari]]
*[[David Tecchler]]
*[[Carlo Giuseppe Testore]]
*[[Jean Baptiste Vuillaume]]

==Cellists==
{{Main|List of cellists}}
A person who plays the cello is called a ''cellist''. For a list of notable cellists, see the [[list of cellists]] and [[:Category:Cellists]].

==Careers==
Careers in cello vary widely by genre and by region or country. Most cellists earn their living from a mixture of performance and teaching jobs. The first step to getting most performance jobs is by playing at an [[audition]]. In some styles of music, cellists may be asked to [[sight reading|sight read]] printed music or perform standard repertoire with an ensemble.

In classical music, cellists audition for playing jobs in orchestras and for admission into university or Conservatory programs or degrees. At a classical cello audition, the performer typically plays a movement from a Bach suite or a movement from a concerto and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[Concertmaster]], the Principal cellist and other principal players.

The most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a ''test week'', in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.

Performance jobs include playing as a freelancer in small groups, playing in a [[chamber music]] group, large ensembles, or performing solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting ("subbing") for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for many cello players to be able to find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist can come to this is in the case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.

Teaching work for cellists includes giving private lessons in the home or at colleges and universities; coaching cellists who are preparing for recordings or auditions; doing group coaching at music camps or for youth ensembles; and working as a high school music teacher. Due to the limited number of full-time orchestral jobs, many classical cellists are not able to find full-time work with a single orchestra. Some cellists increase their employ-ability by learning several different styles, such as folk or pop.

In some cases, cellists supplement their performing and teaching income with other related music jobs, such as working as a stringed instrument repairer (luthier); as a contractor who hires musicians for orchestras or big bands, composing music, songwriting, conducting, or organizing festivals (e.g., [[Julian Armour]]).

==Famous instruments==
{{See also|Category:Individual cellos}}
[[File:Servais Stradivarius.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The Servais Stradivarius is preserved in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]]]]
Specific instruments are famous (or become famous) for a variety of reasons. An instrument's notability may arise from its age, the fame of its maker, its physical appearance, its acoustic properties, and its use by notable performers. The most famous instruments are generally known for all of these things. The most highly prized instruments are now collector's items, and are priced beyond the reach of most musicians. These instruments are typically owned by some kind of organization or investment group, which may loan the instrument to a notable performer. (For example, the [[Davidov Stradivarius]], which is currently in the possession of one of the most widely known living cellists, Yo-Yo Ma, is actually owned by the Vuitton Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Beare | first=Charles | author2=Carlson, Bruce | chapter=Foreword by Yo-Yo Ma | title=Antonio Stradivari: The Cremona Exhibition of 1987 | location=London | publisher=J. &amp; A.

A '''color solid''' is the three-dimensional representation of a [[color model]], an analog of the two-dimensional [[color wheel]].  The added spatial [[dimension]] allows a color solid to depict an added dimension of [[color]] variation.  Whereas a two-dimensional color wheel typically depicts the variables of [[hue]] (red, green, blue, etc.) and [[lightness]] (gradations of light and dark), a color solid adds the variable of [[colorfulness]] (either chroma or saturation), allowing the sphere to depict all conceivable colors in an organized three-dimensional structure.

Different color theorists have each designed unique color solids.  Many are in the shape of a [[sphere]], whereas others are warped three-dimensional ellipsoid figures&amp;mdash;these variations being designed to express some aspect of the relationship of the colors more clearly.  The color spheres conceived by [[Phillip Otto Runge]] and [[Johannes Itten]] are typical examples and prototypes for many other color solid schematics.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Itten, "The Art of Color", 1961. Trans. Ernst Van Haagen. New York: Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1966. {{ISBN|0-442-24038-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The models of Runge and Itten are basically identical, and form the basis for the description below.

Pure, saturated hues of equal brightness are located around the equator at the periphery of the color sphere.  As in the color wheel, [[Complementary color |contrasting (or complementary) hues]] are located opposite each other.  Moving toward the center of the color sphere on the equatorial plane, colors become less and less saturated, until all colors meet at the central [[Coordinate axis|axis]] as a neutral [[gray]].  Moving vertically in the color sphere, colors become lighter (toward the top) and darker (toward the bottom). At the upper pole, all hues meet in white; at the bottom pole, all hues meet in black.  

The vertical axis of the color sphere, then, is gray all along its length, varying from [[black]] at the bottom to [[white]] at the top.  All pure (saturated) hues are located on the surface of the sphere, varying from light to dark down the color sphere.  All impure (unsaturated hues, created by mixing contrasting colors) comprise the sphere's interior, likewise varying in brightness from top to bottom.

== Usage ==

[[Artists]] and art critics find the color solid to be a useful means of organizing the three variables of color&amp;mdash;hue, lightness, and saturation (or chroma), as modelled in the [[HCL color space|HCL]] and [[HSV_and_HSL|HSL color models]]&amp;mdash;in a single schematic, using it as an aid in the composition and analysis of visual art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3500">The '''Community Arts Partnership''' (usually known as CAP) was established in 1990, and is the first program of its kind in the U.S. The program links the [[California Institute of the Arts]] (CalArts) to community art centers and public schools throughout Los Angeles County as part of an expanding joint endeavor to provide college-level arts education to middle and high school students. Glenna Avila currently serves as CAP's director.

It began in 1990 as a partnership between CalArts and three community arts centers: [[Plaza de la Raza]], the [[Watts Towers]] Arts Center and the [[Social and Public Art Resource Center]]. (SPARC)

CAP courses are taught by  CalArts faculty and students and are designed to mirror the [[pedagogical]] approaches used in teaching at CalArts. The different artistic disciplines being taught include [[art]], [[animation]], [[digital media]], [[dance]], [[drawing]], [[chamber music]], [[graphic design]], [[jazz]], [[printmaking]], [[photography]], [[public art]], [[puppetry]], [[theater]], [[video]], [[world music]] and [[writing]]. All CAP classes and workshops are offered free-of-charge and culminate in performances, exhibitions, concerts and screenings. To date, these public events have been held at more than 250 community venues throughout Los Angeles County, including the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater [[REDCAT]].

CAP forms a bridge between the talents and resources of CalArts and those of its community partners in order to train and encourage promising young artists. At the same time, CAP affords CalArts students the opportunity to share their knowledge and abilities with teenagers, work directly with faculty artists to create innovative educational approaches and test and refine ideas about interdisciplinary art practice. More than that, CalArts students involved in CAP gain valuable life, teaching and art making experience, and benefit from real-world engagement across a wide range of Los Angeles' unique communities.

CAP students who are admitted to CalArts after completing high school qualify for CAP scholarships.

Additionally, CAP creates model arts education curricula for middle and high schools. Designed to be responsive to the culturally diverse communities of Southern California, these curricula are based on the low student-teacher ratio of 4:1 and feature individualized arts training and mentoring.

Classes and workshops are taught at the following locations in Los Angeles County:
**Armory Center for the Arts
**Banning's Landing Community Center 
**Center for the Arts Eagle Rock 
**Inner-City Arts 
**KAOS Network 
**Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies, 
**My Friend's Place 
**[[Plaza de la Raza]]
**[[San Fernando Gardens]] Community Service Center
**Santa Clarita Valley Boys &amp; Girls Club

**Art-in-the-Park  
**[[Self-Help Graphics &amp; Art]] 
**Side Street Projects 
**Taking the Reins
**Visual Communications
**William Reagh Los Angeles Photography Center
**Watts Towers Arts Center  
**Los Angeles Unified School District through CAP's ArtsCOOL program.

'''''Death and Life''''' (Italian: '''''Morte e Vita''''') is an oil on canvas painting by Austrian symbolist painter, [[Gustav Klimt]] whose primary subject was the female body. His paintings, murals, and sketches are marked by a sensual eroticism, which is especially apparent in his pencil drawings. The painting was started in 1908 and completed in 1915. It is created in an Art Nouveau (Modern) style by use of allegorical painting genre during Golden phase. The painting measures 178 by 198 centimeters and is now housed at the [[Leopold Museum]] in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leopoldmuseum.org/en/leopoldcollection/masterpieces/41|title=Gustav Klimt, Death and Life|publisher=Leopold Museum|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
This is one of Klimt’s central themes, central also to his time and to his contemporaries among them Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele. Klimt makes of it a modern dance of death, but unlike Schiele, he introduces a note of hope and reconciliation, instead of feeling threatened by the figure of death, his human beings seem to disregard it. The imagination of the artist is focused no longer on physical union, but rather on the expectation that precedes it. Perhaps this new found serenity is rooted in Klimt’s own awareness of aging and closeness to death. But before the moment came when he chose to depict nothing more than moments of intense pleasure or miraculous beauty and youth.

'''''Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights''''' (also known as '''''Dirty Dancing 2''''' or '''''Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights''''') is a 2004 American [[dance]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[romantic drama film]] directed by [[Guy Ferland]]. The film is a [[prequel]]/"re-imagining" of the 1987 [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', reusing the same basic plot, but transplanting it from upstate New York to Cuba on the cusp of the [[Cuban Revolution]].The movie was filmed in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.

==Plot==
In 1958, Katey Miller ([[Romola Garai]]), her parents ([[Sela Ward]] and [[John Slattery]]), and her younger sister Susie ([[Mika Boorem]]) arrive in Cuba during the [[Cuban revolution]]. A self-described bookworm, Katey is not very happy about having to move to a different country during her senior year of high school, as she had been planning to attend [[Radcliffe College]], although the rest of her family seem extremely pleased to be in Cuba.

Meeting several other rich American teenagers down by the pool - including James Phelps ([[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]]), the son of her father's boss -, Katey becomes disgusted when one of the teenagers insults a local waiter when he accidentally knocks over some of their drinks. Katey attempts to talk to the waiter—Javier ([[Diego Luna]]), who works at the hotel to support his family—because she feels awful about what had occurred, but he is not interested.

Katey watches a film of her mother and father dancing and wishes she could dance as well as they did. She and her father dance a bit. The next day in class, Katey is asked to read aloud from ''[[The Odyssey]]'' - a passage about love and passion. After class, James invites her to a party at the country club the next day and she accepts.

While walking home from school, she sees Javier dancing at a street party, and he offers to walk her home. They stop to listen to a street band and police show up, stopping Javier while Katey runs away.

The next day, Katey tries some of the dance moves she saw. Javier sees her and asks her to come see the real dancers Saturday night, but she says she is already going to the country club. Javier gets upset and leaves. Katey wears one of her maid's dresses to the country club party and impresses James. Katey convinces him to take her to the Cuban club where Javier is dancing with the ladies.

Javier dances with Katey while James sits at the bar. Soon he is accosted by Javier's brother, Carlos, who tells him that they will eventually kick the Americans out of Cuba. Javier comes over and argues with his brother. James takes Katey back to the car and assaults her after she refuses to kiss him. She slaps him and runs into the club, and Javier agrees to walk her home.

The next day, Katey walks by a dance class. The teacher ([[Patrick Swayze]]) asks if anyone wants to enter the big dance contest and then dances with Katey for a bit. She grabs a flyer for the competition.

While walking to the pool, James apologizes to Katey and then tells her that Susie saw Javier with her and got him fired. Katey argues with Susie and goes to find Javier. He is now working at a [[chop shop]] with Carlos. She asks him to enter the dance contest with her, but he refuses. Meanwhile, it is becoming apparent that Carlos is helping the revolutionaries.

The next day, Javier shows up at Katey's school and agrees to enter the dance contest with her. They start teaching each other dance moves and Javier convinces her to "feel the music". They practice all the time, and Katey dances some more with the dance teacher, until it is the night of the dance. Katey and Javier dance with the other couples on the floor and are chosen to go on to the next round.

Katey's parents disapprove of her relationship with Javier, but Katey reconciles with them. On the night of the contest's final round, while Katey and Javier are on the dance floor, Javier sees his brother and some revolutionaries disguised as waiters, and the police soon try to arrest them. The contest stops as everyone flees the club, and Javier has to save Carlos from the police. Javier and Carlos talk about how they miss their dad, then they hear that [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] has fled the country and join the celebration.

Later, Javier comes to the hotel and finds Katey. He takes her to the beach and they make love. The next day, Katey's parents tell her they are leaving Cuba and she has one last night with Javier. They go to the Cuban club where they first danced, and the floor is theirs. Katey's family is there to see her, and Katey narrates that she doesn't know when she will see Javier again, but this will not be their last time to dance together.

==Production==
''Havana Nights'' is based on an original screenplay by playwright and [[NPR]] host [[Peter Sagal]], based on the real life experience of producer JoAnn Jansen, who lived in Cuba as a 15-year-old in 1958-59. Sagal wrote the screenplay, which he titled ''Cuba Mine'', about a young American woman who witnessed the [[Cuban revolution]] and had a romance with a young Cuban revolutionary. The screenplay was to be a serious political romance story, documenting, among other stories, how the Cuban revolution transformed from idealism to terror. It was commissioned in 1992 by [[Lawrence Bender]], who was rising to fame with his production of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' and ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''. The screenplay was bought by a film studio, which requested several rewrites before deciding not to produce the film. A decade later, Bender decided to make a ''Dirty Dancing'' [[sequel]], and the film was very loosely adapted from Sagal's script. Not a single line from Sagal's original screenplay appears in the final film and Sagal says that the only remnants of the political theme that existed in his script is a scene wherein some people are executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[This American Life]] |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=383 |title=Radio episode #383|date=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was actress [[Romola Garai]]'s first Hollywood film and she repeatedly has cited the filming of the movie as being an extremely negative experience which caused her to re-evaluate working in Hollywood. In a 2004 interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' she explained that the filmmakers "were obsessed with having someone skinny. I just thought, why didn't they get someone like Kate Bosworth, if that's what they wanted?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLean|first1=Craig|title=Romola Garai: Dancing Queen|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/romola-garai-dancing-queen-27395.html|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, in the midst of producer [[Harvey Weinstein]]'s [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|sexual abuse allegations]] in Hollywood, Garai later revealed that Weinstein, whose company [[Miramax]] was co-producing the film, had required her to meet him alone in a hotel room while he was wearing only a bathrobe to obtain the part: "I had to go to his hotel room in the Savoy, and he answered the door in his bathrobe. I was only 18. I felt violated by it, it has stayed very clearly in my memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellis-Petersen|first1=Hannah|title=Actor Romola Garai felt 'violated' after Harvey Weinstein encounter|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/09/actor-romola-garai-felt-violated-after-harvey-weinstein-encounter|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 23% rating based on 108 reviews from critics, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The website provides a brief critical consensus: "Cheesy, unnecessary remake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dirty_dancing_havana_nights |title=Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights (2004) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-dancing-havana-nights |title=Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Denerstein of the Denver Rocky Mountain News gave it a D+, saying: "Tries to add Cuban flavor to a familiar plot but comes up with nothing more than a bubbling stew of cliches." Peter Howell of the Toronto Star thought it to be "Charmless, clumsy and culturally offensive all at the same time" and merited it 1 out of 5 stars. Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe awarded it 2 out of 4 stars, saying: "As you might expect, the movie is as square as a sock hop." A more favorable review came from  Philip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, who rated it B-, because "aside from the triteness of the dialogue, the mathematical predictability of the script and the muddling of numbskulled politics, DD: HN is a fairly enjoyable experience." According to Louis Hobson of Jam! Magazine, who thought the movie was worth 3.5 out of 5 stars, the main redeeming factor was the choreography: "You may have problems with the obvious, cliched story, but the dancing is incredible." That didn't convince everyone; Philip Wuntch of the Dallas Morning News thought the movie was worth no more than a C, stating that "both the dance numbers and the personal drama are largely listless." &lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|havana_nights|Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Extreme Measures''''' is a 1996 American [[crime film|crime]] [[thriller film]] based on [[Michael Palmer (novelist)|Michael Palmer]]'s 1991 novel of the same name, dealing with the ethics of medical sacrifices. The film was directed by [[Michael Apted]] and starred [[Hugh Grant]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] and [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]].

==Plot==
Dr. Guy Luthan ([[Hugh Grant]]) is a New York emergency room doctor who one night comes across a strange patient: a homeless man who has a wristband from a hospital he's not familiar with, mentioning a drug he's never heard of, and with strange symptoms, including a wildly fluctuating heart rate. When the man dies, Guy attempts to follow up and find out more about the patient - only to find that the body and all records have disappeared, and he's told by his superiors to drop the case.

As he continues trying to find out what happened, Guy's personal and professional life get suddenly sidetracked. His home is ransacked and cocaine is planted near his bedside. The police arrest him and he is convicted and in the process he loses his job, his license to practice medicine and all of his friends. In desperation, he manages to get the help of some homeless men who lead him to [[mole people|their underground home]]. His ER patient who died also had lived there. Through them he's led to an organization, led by neurosurgeon Dr. Lawrence Myrick ([[Gene Hackman]]), that performs spinal experiments on the homeless people, all of whom have died thus far, in an attempt to find a cure for paralysis.

Myrick attempts to sway Guy to join his team, telling him that his “test subjects” are heroes, and that killing one to save millions is worth the sacrifice.  Guy admits that while there is some truth in what Myrick says, Myrick’s victims did not choose to give up their lives, which makes Myrick a murderer. Myrick is accidentally shot and killed by rogue FBI Agent Frank Hare ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]).  Later, Myrick’s widow hands the discs and documentation regarding the research to Guy telling him "my husband was trying to do a good thing, but in the wrong way".  He opens the package, views the materials and proceeds towards the neurology building where he is now working.

==Production==
The film was based on a 1991 novel by Michael Palmer. It was originally developed as a vehicle for [[Alec Baldwin]].&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

Then it went to Simian Films, the company of [[Hugh Grant]] and his then-girlfriend [[Elizabeth Hurley]], which had set up at [[Castle Rock Entertainment]]. The film marked a change of pace for Grant, being a drama. "I was always on the lookout for one (a drama), but I wasn't saying, `I've got to do a serious role now.' It was just that that was the best script around."&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

The script was developed for about a year, including rewrites with involvement from [[William Goldman]]. "We just tamed it a bit for me," said Grant. "We just tweaked it."&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

Palmer said, "They apologized for the way they deviated from the book. Hugh Grant has turned the protagonist into a character he can live with, but the nature of the character hasn't changed. The more I think about it, the more it seems like my book."&lt;ref&gt;Strickler, J., &amp; Writer, S. (1996, Jul 21). Bottleneck at box office // the hits just keep on coming. Star Tribune Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/426723651&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming took place in Toronto and New York City, beginning February 1996.

Director [[Michael Apted]] found it challenging working with Grant and Hurley. "It's not something I'd recommend, however genial the people are.... It was tricky. We had the same agendas, mercifully, so it was all right.... Producers are powerful. And actors are powerful these days. So, to have the double whammy up there, it makes your job harder. The other challenge I had was that this was the first film they (Hurley and Grant) produced. They were learning as they were doing.... I didn't know whether they were going to be dilettante producers.... They really got their hands dirty. They weren't just swanning in for the glamour bits. They were there the whole time in the trenches."&lt;ref name="new"&gt;WILLISTEIN, P. (1996, Sep 22). HUGH GRANT, ELIZABETH HURLEY GO TO `EXTREME MEASURES' TO STAY TOGETHER. Morning Call Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/392830140&lt;/ref&gt;

Added Hurley: "I've been on film sets for about nine years as a hired hand so it wasn't that I didn't know anything.... Yes, there are things I know now that I didn't know before. But there are things a monkey could learn to do.... I think learning to keep on top of things ... You have to, sort of, learn that as you go. I hadn't realized how fragile a film could be. I did end up being very hands-on. I ended up doing much more than I had expected to. I didn't realize how easy it was to really not make the film you set out to make.... I think having to concentrate very, very hard on every department was a shock."&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

==Reception==
The film had a mixed reception from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Extreme Measures|publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1996-10-04|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294427,00.html|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Extreme Measures|publisher= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1996-09-15|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117911083?refcatid=31|accessdate=2010-12-13|first=Leonard|last=Klady}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Extreme Measures|publisher= [[Chicago Tribune]]|date=1996-09-27|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-09-27/entertainment/9609270125_1_extreme-measures-generic-star|accessdate=2010-12-13|first=Gene|last=Siskel}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently holds a 56% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] both gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. Ebert mentioned in his review that  the film is "pitched at a higher level than most thrillers; the dialogue is literate and intelligent, and Grant is more of an everyman than an action hero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Extreme Measures|publisher= [[Chicago Sun Times]]|date=|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960927/REVIEWS/609270303|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant's performance received particular praise for this film, along with ''[[An Awfully Big Adventure]]'', for playing against type in his post-[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]] career in the late 1990s. [[Kenneth Turan]], who disliked the film, said of Grant's performance: "Though he doesn't have enough weight to stabilize the film when the plotting turns silly, overall he does a capable job in an unlikely role."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Movie Review; Extreme Measures' Finds Case of Trauma in the E.R.|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1996-09-27|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-27/entertainment/ca-47876_1_extreme-measures|accessdate=2010-12-13|first=Kenneth|last=Turan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9566">{{French art history}}

From the seventeenth century to the early part of the twentieth century, artistic production in France was controlled by artistic '''academies''' which organized official exhibitions called '''salons'''. In France, [[Academy|academies]] are  institutions and learned societies which monitor, foster, critique and protect French cultural production.

Academies were more institutional and more concerned with criticism and analysis than those literary gatherings today called [[salon (gathering)|salons]] which were more focused on pleasurable discourse in society, although certain gatherings around such figures as [[Marguerite de Valois]] were close to the academic spirit.

==History==
Academies first began to appear in France in the [[Renaissance]]. In 1570 [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]] created one devoted to poetry and music, the [[Académie de poésie et de musique]], inspired by Italian models (such as the academy around [[Marsilio Ficino]]).

The first half of the seventeenth century saw a phenomenal growth in private learned academies, organized around a half-dozen or a dozen individuals meeting regularly.&lt;ref name=Viala&gt;Viala, 1985. Viala's first chapter is entirely devoted to these academies.  By his count, 70 were created during the 17th century.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the century, the number of private academies decreased as academies gradually came under government control, sporsorship and patronage.

The first private academy to become "official" and to this day the most prestigious of governmental academies is the [[Académie française]] ("French Academy"), founded in 1634 by [[Cardinal Richelieu]]. It is concerned with the [[French language]]. In the fine arts, the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] ("Academy of Painting and Sculpture") was founded by [[Cardinal Mazarin]] in 1648 and was soon followed by a number of other officially instituted academies: the [[Académie royale de danse]] ("Royal Academy of Dance") in 1661; the [[Académie royale des inscriptions et médailles]] ("Royal Academy of Inscriptions and Medals") in 1663 [renamed the Académie royale des inscriptions et belles-lettres ("Royal Academy of Inscriptions and Literature" or "Royal Academy of Humanities") in 1716]; the [[Académie royale des sciences]] ("Royal Academy of Sciences") in 1666; the [[Académie d'Opéra]] ("Academy of Opera") in 1669 [renamed the Académie royale de musique ("Royal Academy of Music") in 1672 and the Académie de musique in 1791]; and the [[Académie royale d'architecture]] ("Royal Academy of Architecture") founded by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] in 1671.&lt;ref name=Viala/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Mayer Brown and Iain Fenlon, "Academy" in Sadie 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793 during the [[French Revolution]] the academies were suppressed, but in 1795 the Institut national des sciences et des arts (now the [[Institut de France]]) was established and consisted of three Classes: Sciences physiques et mathématiques ("Physical and Mathematical Sciences"); Sciences morales et politiques ("Moral and Political Sciences"); and Littérature et beaux-arts ("Literature and Fine Arts"). In 1803 under [[Napoleon]] the name was changed to Institut national de France, and it was reorganized into four Classes: 1. Sciences physiques et mathématiques; 2. La Langue et littérature françaises ("French Literature and Language"); 3. Histoire et littérature anciennes ("History and Ancient Literature"); and 4. Beaux-arts ("Fine Arts"). The Institut was renamed the Institut de France in 1806 and Institut impérial de France in 1811.&lt;ref name=NameChanges&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZ9e2B-WfU0C&amp;lpg=PT660&amp;pg=PT661#v=onepage&amp;q=%22institut%20national%20des%20sciences%20et%20arts%22%22&amp;f=false Lane 1989] and South Kensington Museum 1891, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mnc_AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA453 p. 453].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institut was renamed again in 1814 under the [[Bourbon Restoration]] to Institut royal de France, and in 1816, the older appellation of "Académie" was revived, when it was reorganized into four sections: the Académie française; the Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres; the Académie des sciences; and the Académie des beaux-arts.&lt;ref name=NameChanges/&gt; The last consisted of three subordinate academies, those of painting and sculpture, music, and architecture. In 1833 the earlier class, Sciences morales et politiques, which had been suppressed in 1803 under Napoleon, was revived as a fifth academy, the [[Académie des sciences morales et politiques]].

==French Academy in Rome==
The Académie de peinture et sculpture is responsible for the [[French Academy in Rome|Académie de France]] in the [[Villa Médicis]] in [[Rome]] (founded in 1666) which allows promising artists to study in Rome.

==Salons as exhibitions==
From the 17th to the 20th century, the Académie de peinture et sculpture organized official art exhibitions called [[salon (art)|salons]]. To show at a salon, a young artist needed to be received by the Académie by first submitting an artwork to the jury; only Académie artists could be shown in the salons. Salons were started under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and continued from 1667-1704. After a hiatus, the salons started up again in 1725. Under [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], the most prestigious Salon took place in [[Paris]] (the [[Paris Salon|Salon de Paris]]) in the Salon Carré of the [[Louvre]], but there were also salons in the cities of [[Bordeaux]], [[Lille]] and [[Toulouse]].

In 1881, the government withdrew official sponsorship from the annual Salon, and a group of artists organized the [[Société des artistes français]] to take responsibility for the show.

In the 19th century, the salon system frequently incited criticism from artists for the bland or academic quality of the artwork, while radical artists (like [[Édouard Manet]] or [[Gustave Courbet]]) would not be received or would be greatly censored by the "respectable" public. The salon system thus forced radical and modern artists to seek alternative or ''unofficial'' exhibition sites. This is especially true for [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] and [[Fauvism]].

==Other major art exhibitions in France==
{{See also|List of world's fairs}}
France has been the host of a number on important '''international fairs and exhibitions''':
*The ''[[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition universelle de Paris]]'' &amp;mdash; a kind of World's Fair &amp;mdash; was held in Paris in 1889. It was for this fair that the [[Eiffel Tower]] was built (1887–1889).
*The ''[[Grand Palais]]'' and the ''[[Petit Palais]]'' were built as exhibition halls for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]].

Paris was also the site of two world exhibitions of decorative arts:
*The ''[[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes|Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes]]'' in 1925 launched the style called "Moderne", or "Streamline Moderne" or "[[Art Deco]]".
*The subsequent exhibition, the "[[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)]]", in 1937 saw, to a certain degree, the last flowering of this style; the ''[[Palais de Tokyo]]'' was built for this exhibition.

Today, France is host to one of Europe's most prestigious international contemporary art fairs, the ''FIAC'' ("Foire internationale d'art contemporain"), and to ''Paris Photo'' (an international photography exhibition).  Other art fairs and salons include:
*''ArtParis'', held in the Carrousel du [[Louvre]] ([http://www.artparis.fr/ ArtParis website])
*''SAGA'' ("Salon des Arts Graphiques Actuels"), specialized in lithography, etching and illustration

'''Fugitive Projects''' is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] curatorial arts organization, arts collective, and beehive operating since 1999 out of [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

From 1999- 2005 Fugitive Projects called itself the '''Fugitive Art Center''' bringing national and international artists to Nashville to exhibit in their warehouse gallery space.  In both configurations they served as an artist advocacy, curatorial resource and databank. Since restructuring they have focused more on ephemeral exhibitions and involvement with exhibitions traveling to the [[IMAFY]] in [[Egypt]]; [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Canada]] for [[The Interactive Screen Conference]]; [[Ireland]]'s [[Dublin Electronic Arts Festival]]; [[Basel, Switzerland]] and to venues across the U.S.  Artists with video works in this touring program included [[Hernan Bas]], [[Charles De Meaux]], [[e*rock]], [[Haus am Gern]], [[Jenna Gribbon]], [[Muda Matthis / Sus Zwick]], [[Casey Reas]], [[Scott Reeder (artist)|Scott Reeder]], [[Magda Tothova]], [[Moliu Zhang]], [[Eliane Rutishauser]], [[Melody Owen]], [[Charles Huntley Nelson]], [[Kristin Lucas]], Matt Freedman, [[Bert Rodriguez]], [[Dominic DeJoseph]], [[Nicolas Lobo]], [[Karina Nimmerfall]], [[Jeff Luckey]], and [[Joseph Burwell]] among others.

David Maddox in the ''[[Nashville Scene]]'' said in 2004 "the Fugitive (Art Center) has become an essential part of Nashville's art scene...The Fugitive can point to a steady series of good shows, but that's only part of the group's significance to Nashville. Its 12-person board provides a cross-section of the city's art scene."

Susan Knowles, in [[Art Papers]], refers to The Fugitive Art Center as "unbridled energy",  "a lightning rod for artists" and "the edge of visual dialogue in Nashville- and Tennessee."

'''George Aleef''' (1887–1970) was a [[Russia]]n [[orientalism|orientalist]] [[Painting|painter]] who served in the Tsarist Army. He later lived in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] until the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]]. His paintings depicted major historical moments during that era in Palestine. Aleef eventually settled in Jordan, where he started the first art college and taught a group of young, local artists who were instrumental in creating a Jordanian art movement. Aleef's family name is sometimes spelled as ''Allief'' or ''Aleev.''&lt;ref&gt;The Artists' Trade Union of Russia, ''The Register of Professional  Artists of Russian Empire, USSR, Russian emigration, Russian Federation and the republics of former Soviet Union, (XVIII–XXI centuries)'' Online: http://painters.artunion.ru/e2-01-1.htm gives his name as Georgy Aleev.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in Russia, he served as a bodyguard for [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia]] until the [[October Revolution]] broke out. He became part of a large group of civilians and former members of the White Russian Army (collectively known as [[white émigrés]]) who, after the [[Russian civil war]], retreated to South [[Crimea]] and then to [[Istanbul]] before ultimately emigrating to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Göçmen, Muammer, ''Mütareke yillarinda beyaz Ruslarin İstanbul'daki sürgün hayatlari,'' [Exile Lives of White Russians in Istanbul during the Ceasefire Years], ''Review of the Faculty of Divinity,'' University of Süleyman Demirel, 2008/1, Number 20, İsmail Hakkı Göksoy (ed), Süleyman Demirel Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakültesi Dergi.  SDÜ İlahiyat Fakültesi 32260 Isparta, Turkey, pp. 199–216.  ISSN 1300-9672.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleef remained in Istanbul, and during this period, in around 1920, became a professional painter. He later moved to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and in 1948 during the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]], he relocated to [[Jordan]], where he lived until 1967. In Jordan, he set up a studio. Aleef was one of the few artists who arrived in Jordan at that time, willing to give private art lessons in his studio.&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur, S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p.375&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleef was able to make a living by giving painting lessons, Russian language lessons and by selling small works of art. He started the first art college in Jordan,&lt;ref&gt;"Jerusalem tiles and other Christian artefacts," ''Jordan Times,'' Saturday, February 28, 1998, [https://archive.org/stream/JordanTimes1998JordanEnglish/Feb%2028%201998%2C%20Jordan%20Times%2C%20%236775%2C%20Jordan%20%28en%29_djvu.txt Jordan Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered to be a very useful teacher who introduced locals to easel painting and promoted an appreciation of European art.&lt;ref&gt;Wejdan, A., ''Contemporary Jordanian Art,'' [Alfan alarabi almu’aser], Ministry of culture, Amman, 2nd print, 2002, p. 17; Zuhur, S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;

Local artists including [[Muhanna Al-Dura]], Rafiq Lahham, and Suha Katibah Noursi studied in Aleef's studio. According to Dura's memoirs, Aleef taught his students the basics of watercolor, drawing and painting, and the European understanding of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, S., "Mohanna Durra," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohanna-Durra.aspx; Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; He taught his students to meticuoulsy render a matchbox as an exercise in perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Dura along with the other young artists who studied with Aleef helped to spark a local, Jordanian art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p.175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Aleef's personal experiences living and working in strife-torn countries informed his work. The themes he chose for his work almost always involve real historical episodes or of great monuments. His style is rather [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] and has naive traits which are apparent in practically all his works. He used both oils and water color. During his time in Palestine, he painted [[Jerusalem]] with an Arabic identity, also portraying a time where [[mosque]]s, churches and [[synagogue]]s coexisted peacefully.

He had many exhibitions in Jerusalem, [[Amman]] and [[Beirut]] and many of his paintings are hanging at the Jordanian Royal Court, the Jordanian National Gallery and in private Jordanian collections. One of his works, featuring a ruined monument, hangs in the Jordan National Art Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan National Art Gallery, ''Photo Gallery,'' Online: http://www.nationalgallery.org/PhotoGallery/tabid/59/Default.aspx; al- Matḥaf al-Waṭanī, al-Urdunnī lil-Funūn, al-Ǧamīla (ʻAmmān), Wiǧdān ʻAlī, ''Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts,''University of Michigan, 2009,  p.283&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2839">In [[geometry]] and [[crystallography]], a '''glide plane''' (or '''transflection''') is a [[symmetry operation]] describing how a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a plane, followed by a [[translation (mathematics)|translation]] parallel with that plane, may leave the [[crystal]] unchanged. 

Glide planes are noted by ''a'', ''b'' or ''c'', depending on which axis the glide is along.  There is also the ''n'' glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of a face, and the ''d'' glide, which is along a fourth of either a face or space diagonal of the [[unit cell]]. The latter is often called the diamond glide plane as it features in the diamond structure.

==Formal treatment==
In [[geometry]], a '''glide plane operation''' is a type of [[isometry]] of the [[Euclidean space]]: the combination of a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a plane and a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] in that plane. Reversing the order of combining gives the same result. Depending on context, we may consider a reflection a special case, where the translation vector is the zero vector.

The combination of a reflection in a plane and a translation in a perpendicular direction is a reflection in a parallel plane. However, a glide plane operation with a nonzero translation vector in the plane cannot be reduced like that. Thus the effect of a reflection combined with ''any'' translation is a glide plane operation in the general sense, with as special case just a reflection. The glide plane operation in the strict sense and the pure reflection are two of the four kinds of indirect [[Euclidean_group#Overview_of_isometries_in_up_to_three_dimensions|isometries in 3D]].

The [[isometry group]] generated by just a glide plane operation is an infinite [[cyclic group]]. Combining two equal glide plane operations gives a pure translation with a translation vector that is twice that of the glide plane operation, so the even powers of the glide plane operation form a translation group.

In the case of '''glide plane symmetry''', the [[symmetry group]] of an object contains a glide plane operation, and hence the group generated by it. For any symmetry group containing glide plane symmetry, the translation vector of any glide plane operation is one half of an element of the translation group. If the translation vector of a glide plane operation is itself an element of the translation group, then the corresponding glide plane symmetry reduces to a combination of [[reflection symmetry]] and [[translational symmetry]].

[[File:Peter von Cornelius Hagen versenkt den Nibelungenhort 1859.jpg|275px|thumb|According to the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' (1859) by [[Peter von Cornelius]], Gunther orders [[Hagen (legend)|Hagen]] to drop the hoard into the [[Rhine]].]]
'''Gundaharius''' or '''Gundahar''' (d. 437), better known by his legendary names '''Gunther''' ([[Middle High German]] ''Gunther'') or '''Gunnar''' ([[Old Norse]] ''Gunnarr''), was a historical [[King of Burgundy]] in the early 5th century. Gundahar is attested as ruling his people shortly after they crossed the Rhine into Roman Gaul. He was involved in the campaigns of the failed Roman usurper [[Jovinus]] before the latter's defeat, after which he was settled on the left bank of the Rhine as a Roman ally. In 436, Gundahar launched an attack from his kingdom on the Roman province of [[Belgica Prima]]. He was defeated by the Roman general [[Flavius Aetius]], who destroyed Gundahar's kingdom with the help of Hunnish mercenaries the following year, resulting in Gundahar's death.

The historical Gundahar's death became the basis for a legend in which the legendary Gunther finds his death at the court of [[Attila the Hun]] (Etzel/Atli). The character also became attached to other legends: most notably he is associated with [[Sigurd|Siegfried/Sigurd]] and [[Brunhild]], and is implicated in Sigurd's murder. He also appears as an adversary in the legend of [[Walter of Aquitaine]]. It is generally assumed that Gunther's involvement in these other legends, in which he plays a secondary or antagonistic role, is a later development.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=118}} Gunther's importance in the story of the destruction of the Burgundians also waned with time.{{sfn|Guðmundsdóttir|Cosser|2015|p=1015}}

Gunther appears as a legendary character in [[Latin]], [[Middle High German]], [[Old Norse]], and [[Old English language|Old English]] texts, as well as in various pictorial depictions from Scandinvia. Most significantly, he plays a role in the German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', the medieval Latin ''[[Waltharius]]'', and the Old Norse ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and ''[[Völsunga saga]]''. He also plays an important role in [[Richard Wagner]]'s operatic [[Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]] cycle, which is based on the medieval legends of Sigurd.

==Etymology==
The first element of Gunther's name is [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*gunþ-'', meaning war or conflict.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973}} The second element is Proto-Germanic ''*-hari'', meaning army.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=136}}

The name of the historical Gundahar is attested in the primary sources as Latin ''Gundaharius'' or ''Gundicharius'' and Greek ''Γυντιάριος'' (''Gyntiarios'').{{sfn|Anton|1999|p=193}} Medieval Latin gives the name of the legendary figure as ''Guntharius'', while Anglo-Saxon has ''Gūðhere'', Old Norse has ''Gunnarr'', and Middle High German has ''Gunther''.{{sfn|Nedoma|Anton|1998|p=67}}

==Historical Gundahar==
Gundahar is the first king of Burgundy to be historically attested.{{sfn|Anton|1999|p=193}} It is unclear if he ruled alone or if he may have ruled together with brothers, as occurs in the heroic tradition; the title ''φύλαρχος'' (''phylarchos'') given to him by [[Olympiodorus of Thebes]] may suggest he was not the sole ruler.{{sfn|Anton|1999|p=193}} In [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] he is identified as ''rex'' (king).{{sfn|Anton|1999|p=194}}

A majority of the Burgundians [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed the Rhine]] in 406/407, together with numerous other Germanic tribes.{{sfn|Anton|1981|p=238}} Their king Gundahar is first attested in 411 as cooperating with [[Goar]], king of the [[Alans]], to proclaim  [[Jovinus]] as a new [[Roman emperor|emperor]] in the province [[Germania Inferior]] on the lower Rhine.{{sfn|Anton|1999|p=193}} He is attested as being involved in Jovinus's campaigns in southern Gaul.{{sfn|Anton|1999|p=193}} Following Jovinus's defeat in 413, the Roman ''[[magister militum]]'' Constantius settled the Burgundians on the left bank of the Rhine as Roman ''[[foederati]]''.{{sfn|Anton|1999|p=193}} Based on the later heroic tradition, many scholars identify their area of settlement as around [[Worms]], though some scholars have argued in favor of other locations.{{sfn|Anton|1999|p=193}}{{sfn|Anton|1981|pp=238-240}}

In the 430s, the Burgundians came under increasing pressure from the [[Huns]]; likely as a reaction to this Gundahar attacked the Roman province [[Belgica Prima]] (based around [[Trier]]) in 435.{{sfn|Anton|1999|p=194}} The Burgundians were defeated by the Roman general [[Flavius Aetius]], who nevertheless confirmed Gundahar and his people's rights to their kingdom.{{sfn|Anton|1999|p=194}} However, the next year (436) Aetius, accompanied by Hunnish mercenaries, attacked and destroyed the Burgundian kingdom. According to Prosper of Aquitaine, Gundahar and the majority of his people found their deaths in Aetius's attack.{{sfn|Anton|1999|p=194}}{{sfn|Anton|1981|p=241}}

Aetius resettled the survivors of the destruction of the Burgundian kingdom in [[Savoy]] on the upper [[Rhone]].{{sfn|Anton|1981|p=241}} The memory of Gundahar and his downfall was likely preserved by these survivors, as well as by observers from neighboring Germanic tribes.{{sfn|Nedoma|Anton|1998|p=69}}

The late fifth-/early-sixth century ''[[Lex Burgundionum]]'', produced by the Burgundian king [[Gundobad]] at the Burgundians' new kingdom, mentions four older Burgundian kings: [[Gibica]], [[Gundomar I|Gundomar]], [[Gislaharius]], and Gundahar. It makes no mention of any familial relationship between the kings, however.{{sfn|Nedoma|Anton|1998|p=68}} In the heroic tradition, Gibica (Gibeche/Gjúki) appears as Gundahar's father, while Gundomar (Guthorm/Gernot) and Gislaharius (Giselher) appear as his brothers and co-kings.{{sfn|Nedoma|Anton|1998|p=68}}

==Anglo-Saxon traditions==
===''Waldere''===
In the fragmentary [[Old English]] poem ''Waldere'' (c. 1000), the Old English attestation of the story of [[Walter of Aquitaine]] (see '''''Waltharius''''' under '''Continental traditions'''), Guðhere (Gunther) is preparing to attack Waldere (Walter). He refuses the gifts that Walther offers him to make peace and is portrayed as boastful.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=54}} It appears that Guðhere wishes to take the gold that Waldere has with him.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=109}}
===''Widsith''===
The narrator of the Old English poem ''[[Widsith]]'' reports that he was given a ring by Guðhere when he visited the Burgundians (''Burgendas'').{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=54}}

==Continental traditions==
===''Waltharius''===
The ''[[Waltharius]]'' is a Latin epic that reworks the legend of [[Walter of Aquitaine]]; it is conventionally dated to around 1000, but some scholars argue that it was produced in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian period]].{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=105-106}}

In ''Waltharius'', Gunther (as ''Guntharius'') appears as a king of the [[Franks]] with his capital at [[Worms]].{{sfn|Rosenfeld|1981|p=233}} At the beginning of the poem, Gunther's father Gibeche (''Gibico'') has sent his vassal Hagen (''Hageno'') to the Huns as a hostage because Gunther is still too young. Hagen later flees back to Gibeche's kingdom.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=106}} When Walter and his love Hiltgunt flee the Huns, taking much treasure, they enter into Gunther's kingdom by crossing the [[Rhine]] by Worms. They sell the ferryman fish they had brought with them in exchange for passage, and the ferryman brings these fish, which do not live in the area, to the king. Hagen tells Gunther that this must be Walter, and Gunther declares that now he can reclaim the gold that his father had paid to [[Attila]] in tribute. Although Hagen advises against it, the king sets out with some warriors to apprehend Walter and Hiltgunt. When Gunther finds the pair, he demands that Walter give him Hiltgunt and the gold. Walter refuses and kills Gunther's warriors as they attack, despite Gunther's encouragements. Finally, only Gunther and Hagen are left alive; they allow Walter to leave, then attack him from behind. Walter cuts off Gunther's leg, but Hagen saves the king's life when Walter wishes to kill him. After both Hagen and Walter have maimed each other, the fighting stops and Hiltgunt tends the warriors' wounds. The warriors then part in friendship.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=108-109}}

The story presents a contrast to Gunther's destruction in that he is attracted by the Huns' gold rather than the other way around.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=117}} Like Gunther's role in the death of Siegfried, his role in the legend of Walter places him in a negative light.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=198}}

===''Nibelungenlied''===
[[File:Abfahrt der Burgunder ins Hunnenland Aufbruch der Koenige von Worms Hundeshagenscher Kodex.jpeg|thumb|Gunther and the Burgundians prepare to leave for Etzel's court. Hundeshagenscher Kodex]]
Gunther's story next appears in writing in the ''Nibelungenlied'' from c. 1200. In it, Gunther is the king of the Burgundians with a capital at Worms. He is the son of King Dancrat and Queen Ute and rules together with his royal brothers Giselher and Gernot, and his sister is named [[Kriemhild]].{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=54}} When [[Siegfried]] comes to Worms to woo Kriemhild, he first challenges Gunther as king before the situation is resolved peacefully. Gunther subsequently relies on Siegfried to defeat his enemies the [[Saxons]] and [[Danes]]. Eventually, Gunther offers to allow Siegfried to marry Kriemhild if Siegfried first helps him woo the queen of [[Iceland]], [[Brunhild]]. Brunhild has set various martial and physical challenges that any suitor must accomplish, or else she will kill him. Siegfried uses his [[cloak of invisibility]] (''Tarnkappe'') to allow Gunther to accomplish each challenge, and Brunhild is forced to marry Gunther. She refuses, however, to sleep with Gunther on her wedding night, tying him up and hanging him from a hook. Gunther again enlists Siegfried's help, who takes Gunther's shape and overpowers Brunhild so that Gunther can then sleep with her.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=181-182}}

Some time later, Kriemhild and Brunhild quarrel, and Kriemhild tells Brunhild that Siegfried and not Gunther took her virginity. Brunhild complains to Gunther, who causes Siegfried to publicly swear that this is not true. Brunhild and Gunther's vassal Hagen, however, are not satisfied, and convince Gunther to have Siegfried murdered while on a hunt. Hagen kills Siegfried. He later arranges to steal the hoard of the Nibelungs that rightfully belongs to Kriemhild as Siegfried's widow. After some time, Kriemhild is persuaded to be reconciled with Gunther, but not Hagen. After she has been married to King Etzel of the [[Huns]], she invites her brothers to visit, plotting revenge. Gunther accepts this invitation despite Hagen's warning, and the Burgundians trek from Worms to Etzelburg ([[Buda]]). Gunther can be said to play a secondary role to Hagen in the conclusion of the ''Nibelungenlied''.{{sfn|Gentry|McConnell|Müller|Wunderlich|2011|p=78}} When fighting begins, Gunther fights bravely. When only he and Hagen are left alive, [[Dietrich von Bern]] captures the two. Told by Hagen that he will only reveal the location of the hoard of the Nibelungs once Gunther is dead, Kriemhild has her brother beheaded.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=183-185}}

===''Þiðrekssaga''===
Although the ''[[Þiðrekssaga]]'' (c. 1250) is written in Old Norse, the majority of the material is translated from German (particularly [[Low German]]) oral tales, as well as possibly some from German written sources such as the ''Nibelungenlied''.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=270-273}} Therefore, it is included here.

Gunnar (Gunther) is a king of the [[Nibelung|Niflungs]] who live in northern Germany at ''Niflungaland'',{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=55}} with a capital at Verniza ([[Worms]]).{{sfn|Gentry|McConnell|Müller|Wunderlich|2011|p=103}} He is the son of King Aldrian and Queen Oda and brother of Grimhild (Kriemhild), Gernoz (Gernot), and Gisler (Giselher), and half-brother of Högni (Hagen).{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=55}} In another version of the saga, his father is Irung.{{sfn|Gentry|McConnell|Müller|Wunderlich|2011|p=50}}

Gunnar first appears when he takes part in the expedition of twelve heroes to Bertangenland organized by Thidrek ([[Dietrich von Bern]]). He loses in combat against one of King Isung's sons, but is freed once Thidrek defeats Sigurd (Siegfried).{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=55}}{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=264}} Thidrek and Sigurd then accompany Gunnar back to his court, and Sigurd marries Gunnar's sister Grimhild. Sigurd suggests that Gunnar should marry Brunhild, and Gunnar agrees. Although Brunhild is initially reluctant, saying Sigurd had promised to marry her, she eventually agrees. However, she refuses to sleep with Gunnar and overpowers him with her emmense strength when he tries to. Gunnar then tells Sigurd to take Gunnar's shape and deflower Brunhild for him. This takes away Brunhild's strength; after this, Brunhild is brought back to Gunnar's court.{{sfn|Haymes|Samples|1996|p=114}}{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=264}}

After some time conflict erupts between Brunhild and Grimhild over their respective statuses at court. The quarrel causes Grimhild to reveal to Brunhild that Sigurd took her virginity, not Gunnar. When Gunnar hears of this, he and Högni decide to kill Sigurd. Högni then kills Sigurd on a hunt, and Gunnar and he place the corpse in Grimhild's bed.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=266}} Later, Grimhild is married to Atli ([[Attila]]), and she invites her brothers to visit her and her new husband's court at Susat ([[Soest, Germany|Soest]]). She intends to kill them, while Atli desires the hoard they had taken from Sigurd. Gunnar agrees to come despite Högni's warnings. As in the ''Nibeungenlied'', Gunnar plays a secondary role to Högni in the action at Atli's court.{{sfn|Gentry|McConnell|Müller|Wunderlich|2011|p=76}} Once fighting breaks out at the Hunnish court, Gunnar is taken captive. Grimhild tells Atli to throw him into a tower full of snakes, where he dies.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=267}}

The author of the saga has made a number of changes to create a more or less coherent story out of the many oral and possibly written sources that he used to create the saga.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=273–274}} The author mentions alternative Scandinavian versions of many of these same tales, and appears to have changed some details to match the stories known by his Scandinavian audience.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=271-272}}{{sfn|Haymes|1988|pp=xxvii-xxix}} The saga's version of the downfall of the Burgundians represents a unique mix of elements known from the Norse and continental traditions.{{sfn|Uecker|1972|p=42}} Some elements that are closer to the Norse version may reflect genuine Low German traditions: a "snake tower" (''Schlangenturm'') is attested as having existed in Soest until the end of the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=55 n. 9}}

==Scandinavian traditions and attestations==
===''The Poetic Edda''===
The ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', a collection of heroic and mythological Nordic poems, appears to have been compiled around 1270 in Iceland, and assembles mythological and heroic songs of various ages.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=288}} As elsewhere in the Scandinavian tradition, Gunnar is the son of Gjuki and the brother of Gudrun and Högni. Depending on the poem Guthorm is either his full brother, step-brother, or half-brother.{{sfn|Gillespie|1973|p=50}} A sister Gullrönd also appears in one poem.{{sfn|Gentry|McConnell|Müller|Wunderlich|2011|p=75}}

Generally, none of the poems in the collection is thought to be older than 900 and some appear to have been written in the thirteenth century.{{sfn|Haymes|Samples|1996|p=119}} It is also possible that apparently old poems have been written in an archaicizing style and that apparently recent poems are reworkings of older material, so that reliable dating is impossible.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=294}}

====''Grípisspá''====
In ''[[Grípisspá]]'', a prophecy that Sigurd receives about his future life and deeds, Sigurd learns of his future marriage to Gudrun and his role taking Gunnar's place in his wooing of Brunhild, followed by his murder.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=295-296}}

The poem is probably not very old.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=301}}

====''Brot af Sigurðarkviðu''====
''[[Brot af Sigurðarkviðu]]'' is only preserved fragmentarily: the surviving part of the poem tells the story of Sigurd's murder. The fragment opens with Högni questioning Gunnar's decision to have Sigurd murdered, believing that Brunhild's claim that Sigurd slept with her might be false. Soon after the murder occurs, Gunnar shows himself to be deeply concerned about the future, while Brunhild admits that she lied to have Sigurd killed.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=296-297}} Gunnar plays only a supporting role in the surviving portion of the poem, with Brunhild and Gudrun being the more important characters.{{sfn|Würth|2005|p=426}}

====''Sigurðarkviða hin skamma''====
''[[Sigurðarkviða hin skamma]]'' retells the story of Sigurd's life from his arrival at Gunnar's court to his murder. On account of its content, which dwells on psychological motivation, and its style, this poem is generally not thought to be very old.{{sfn|Würth|2005|p=426}}

Sigurd and Gunnar become friends when Sigurd comes to Gunnar's court, and Sigurd aids Gunnar in his wooing of Brunhild. Sigurd marries Gudrun, but Brunhild desires him for herself. In her jealousy, she threatens to leave Gunnar if he does not have Sigurd murdered. Gunnar and Högni decide that the death of Sigurd is not as bad as losing the queen, so they have their brother Guthorm murder him in his bed. Brunhild laughs loudly when she hears Gudrun's wailing, and Gunnar insults her and makes accusations against her when he hears her laugh. Brunhild tells him that she never wanted to marry him, but was forced to by her brother Atli. She then kills herself in spite of Gunnar's attempts to change her mind.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=297-298}}

====''Dráp Niflunga''====
The ''[[Dráp Niflunga]]'' is a short prose section connecting the death of Sigurd to the following poems about the Burgundians (Niflungs) and Atli (Attila). Atli, who is Brunhild's brother, blames Gunnar for Brunhild's death, and in order to placate him Gunnar marries Gudrun to Atli. Gunnar desires to marry Brunhild and Atli's sister Oddrun, but Atli refuses, so he and Oddrun become lovers. Some time later, Atli invites Gunnar and Högni to visit him, and they go despite a warning from Gudrun. Gunnar and Högni are taken prisoner, and Gunnar is thrown into a [[snake pit]]: he puts the snakes to sleep with his harp, but in the end one bites him in the liver, and he dies.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=298}}

====''Oddrúnargrátr''====
In ''[[Oddrúnargrátr]]'', Atli's sister Oddrun narrates the story of her love for Gunnar. She tells how Atli refused to marry her to Gunnar after her sister Brunhild's death. She and Gunnar nevertheless begin an affair, sleeping together until one day they are discovered. In anger, Atli then murders Gunnar and Högni, throwing Gunnar into a snake pit. Oddrun says that she tries to help Gunnar escape the snake pit, but by the time she got there he was already dead, as her mother had turned into a snake and bitten him.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=306}}

Oddrun appears to be a late addition to the legend, perhaps created so that the poet could "tell the story of the fall of the Nibelungs from a different point of view."{{sfn|Haymes|Samples|1996|p=124}} She also provides an additional reason for enmity between Gunnar and Atli besides Atli's lust for treasure in Gunnar's role as Oddrun's lover.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=306}}

====''Atlakviða''====
In ''[[Atlakviða]]'', Atli invites Högni and Gunnar to his hall, claiming to wish to offer them great riches, but actually intending to kill them. Gunnar decides to come although Gudrun has sent them a warning. They cross through [[Myrkviðr]] (mirkwood) on their way to Atli's court. Once they arrive, Atli captures Gunnar and Högni. He demands Gunnar's hoard of gold, but Gunnar says he will not tell Atli until Högni is dead. Atli then kills Högni and brings his heart to Gunnar, who laughs and says now only he knows the secret of the hoard's location. He refuses to tell Atli, so Atli has him thrown into a [[snake pit]]. Gunnar plays his harp there until he is bitten by a snake and dies.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=49-50}}

''Atlakviða'' is commonly supposed to be one of the oldest poems in the ''Poetic Edda'', possibly dating from the ninth century.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=48, 51}} The poem is particularly notable in that Sigurd is not mentioned at all.{{sfn|Beck|1973|p=466-467}} The presence of the forest Myrkviðr and the timelessness of the story show the poem to have moved into the realm of myth rather than historical legend.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp-58-59}} Alternatively, Myrkviðr could refer to the [[Erzgebirge]], which are called ''Miriquidui'' by the historian [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] in the eleventh century.{{sfn|Gentry|McConnell|Müller|Wunderlich|2011|p=101}}

====''Atlamál hin groenlenzku''====
''[[Atlamál hin groenlenzku]]'' tells the same story as ''Atlakviða'' with several important differences. When Gunnar receives Atli's invitation, he and Högni shrug off the warning sent by Gudrun. They then ignore the [[runes]] read by Högni's wife Kostbera telling them not to go, and an ominous dream by Gunnar's wife Glaumvör. When they arrive at Atli's court, Atli's messenger, who has accompanied them, announces that they must die. Gunnar and Högni kill him. Gudrun attempts to negotiate between the two sides but is unsuccessful; she fights with her brothers until they are captured. Atli then has Gunnar and Högni killed in order to spite Gudrun. Gunnar is thrown into a snake pit, where he plays the harp with his toes as his hands are bound. He is bitten and dies.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=299-300}}

===''Völsunga saga''===
The ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' tells a longer prose version of Gunther's life and deeds. It follows the plot given in the ''Poetic Edda'' fairly closely, although there is no indication that the author knew the other text.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=319}} The author appears to have been working in Norway and to have known the ''Thidrekssaga'' (c. 1250), a translation of continental Germanic traditions into Old Norse (see '''''Þiðrekssaga''''' above). Therefore the ''Völsunga Saga'' is dated to sometime in the second half of the thirteenth century.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=313}}

Gunnar is portrayed as the son of Gjúki and Grimhild and brother of Högni, Gudrun, and Guthorm. After Sigurd's arrival at the Burgundian court, Gunnar is encouraged by Grimhild to marry Brynhild. Brynhild, however, refuses to marry any man but the one who can ride through a wall of flame. Gunnar is unable to do this, and so Sigurd takes his shape and performs the action for him. Brynhild is thus forced to marry Gunnar. Some time later, Gudrun and Brynhild quarrel about whether Sigurd or Gunnar has the highest rank at the court. Gudrun then reveals the deception to Brynhild, who demands vengeance from Gunnar. He is unable to change her mind, and she demands that he kill Sigurd. Gunnar and Högni decide that their younger brother Guthorm, who has not sworn any oaths to Sigurd, should perform the murder. They feed him with wolf meat to make him more ferocious, then send him to kill Sigurd in his bed. After the murder, Brynhild commits suicide and prophesies Gunnar's fate.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=316}}

In order to be reconciled to Brynhild's brother Atli for her death, Gunnar arranges for Sigurd's widow, his sister Gudrun, to marry Atli. He also seeks to marry Atli's other sister Oddrun, but Atli refuses and the two begin an affair.{{sfn|Gentry|McConnell|Müller|Wunderlich|2011|p=105}} Gunnar instead marries the woman Glaumvör.{{sfn|Gentry|McConnell|Müller|Wunderlich|2011|p=73}} After some time, desiring to avenge his sister and to gain Gunnar's treasure, Atli invites Gunnar and Högni to his court, intending to kill them. Gunnar is suspicious and Gudrun has tried to warn them not to come, but once he and Högni are drunk, Atli's messenger convinces them to accept the invitation. In spite of the warnings of their wives, Gunnar and Högni set out for Atli's court. Once they arrive the messenger reveals that it is a trap, and they kill him. Atli demands the treasure that Gunnar took for Sigurd, and when Gunnar refuses, they begin to fight. Eventually, Gunnar and Högni are captured. Gunnar says he will not tell Atli where the hoard is unless he sees Högni's heart. When he is finally shown the heart, Gunnar laughs and says that now only he knows where the hoard is and he will never tell. Atli then orders Gunnar thrown into a [[snake pit]], where he plays the harp with his toes as his hands are bound. In the end, the snakes kill him.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=317}}

===Pictorial depictions===
[[File:Gunnar in snakepit Hylestad.jpg|thumb|Gunnar in snakepit at Hylestad stave church, c. 1200.]]
Gunnar's death in the snake pit is well attested in pictorial depictions. Not all images of a man in a snake pit can be identified as Gunnar: the image appears to predate the story of Gunnar's death.{{sfn|Guðmundsdóttir|2015|p=352}} Although only images that also depict a harp can be securely identified as depicting Gunnar, Aðalheiður Guðmundsdóttir argues that the presence of a harp appears to have originally been a variant of the story of Gunnar's death, and that images that do not depict a harp can therefore also depict Gunnar.{{sfn|Guðmundsdóttir|2015|p=352}}

Only one potential depiction is located outside of Scandinavia, on the [[Isle of Man]]: the [[Kirk Andreas]] cross (c. 1000) shows a bound figure surrounded by snakes who has been identified as Gunnar. An alternative interpretation is that the figure is meant to represent [[Loki]].{{sfn|Guðmundsdóttir|2015|p=353}}

The earliest depiction that has been relatively securely identified as Gunnar is the [[picture stone]] [[Södermanland]] 40, from [[Västerljung]], Sweden. Guðmundsdóttir argues that the presence of several [[Sigurd stones]] nearby make an identification of the bound figure on the stone with Gunnar very likely.{{sfn|Guðmundsdóttir|2015|p=355}}

Gunnar can be securely identified on a number of church portals and [[baptismal font]]s in Norway or areas formerly under Norwegian control in Sweden, with the earliest dating to the twelfth-century and most dating to around 1200 or later. In all of these images, Gunnar is shown with a harp.{{sfn|Guðmundsdóttir|2015|pp=355-358}} The presence of Gunnar's death in Christian religious contexts shows that a Christian interpretation was common: his death was seen as [[Typology (theology)|typologically]] related to the story of [[Daniel in the lions' den]].{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=169}} 

Seven additional images from Norway, Sweden, and the island of [[Gotland]] have been proposed to depict Gunnar in the snake pit, but without a harp: these images date from between the ninth and the eleventh centuries, and thus predate the secure attestations considerably.{{sfn|Guðmundsdóttir|2015|p=360}} The earliest of these proposed identifications are the carvings on the cart found with the ninth-century [[Oseberg Ship]] burial.{{sfn|Guðmundsdóttir|2015|p=358}} This identification is very controversial.{{sfn|Guðmundsdóttir|2015|p=364}} Guðmundsdóttir suggests that the picture stone Klinte Hunninge I from Gotland (ninth/tenth century) may depict a version of the story of Oddrun's aid to Gunnar, as it shows an unidentified female figure by the snake pit.{{sfn|Guðmundsdóttir|2015|p=360}} She argues in favor of identifying the figure in the snake pit in all of these images with Gunnar, noting their apparent shared iconography.{{sfn|Guðmundsdóttir|2015|pp=368-370}} Guðmundsdóttir nevertheless dismisses a number of other proposed images of Gunnar, on the grounds that they are not clear.{{sfn|Guðmundsdóttir|2015|pp=370-371}}

{{Japanese name|Katsushika}}
{{nihongo|'''Katsushika Hokusai'''|葛飾 北斎|extra={{Audio|Ja-葛飾 北斎.ogg|listen}}, c. October 31, 1760&amp;nbsp;– May 10, 1849}} was a Japanese artist, [[ukiyo-e]] painter and [[printmaker]] of the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Frédéric|Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric]]. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq= "Hokusai"] in ''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;  Born in [[Edo]] (now Tokyo), Hokusai is best known as author of the [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock print]] series {{Nihongo|''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]''|富嶽三十六景|Fugaku Sanjūroku-kei|c. 1831}} which includes the internationally iconic print, ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''.

Hokusai created the ''Thirty-Six Views'' both as a response to a domestic travel boom and as part of a personal obsession with [[Mount Fuji]].&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; It was this series, specifically ''The Great Wave'' print and ''[[Fine Wind, Clear Morning]]'', that secured Hokusai’s fame both in Japan and overseas. As historian [[Richard Douglas Lane|Richard Lane]] concludes, "Indeed, if there is one work that made Hokusai's name, both in Japan and abroad, it must be this monumental print-series".&lt;ref name="lane"/&gt; While Hokusai's work prior to this series is certainly important, it was not until this series that he gained broad recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S. and Christin J. Mamiya, (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=TlVeuxIgjwQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq= ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: Non-Western Perspectives,'' p. 115].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and artistic training==

Hokusai's date of birth is unclear, but is often stated as the 23rd day of the 9th month of the 10th year of the [[Hōreki]] era (in the [[Japanese calendar|old calendar]], or October 31, 1760) to an [[artisan]] family, in the Katsushika district of [[Edo]], Japan.&lt;ref name="weston116"/&gt; His childhood name was Tokitarō.&lt;ref name="nagata"/&gt; It is believed his father was the mirror-maker Nakajima Ise, who produced mirrors for the [[shogunate|shōgun]].&lt;ref name="nagata"/&gt; His father never made Hokusai an heir, so it is possible that his mother was a [[concubine]].&lt;ref name="weston116"/&gt; Hokusai began painting around the age of six, perhaps learning from his father, whose work on mirrors included a painting of designs around mirrors.&lt;ref name="weston116"/&gt;

Hokusai was known by at least thirty names during his lifetime. While the use of multiple names was a common practice of Japanese artists of the time, his number of pseudonyms exceeds that of any other major Japanese artist. Hokusai's name changes are so frequent, and so often related to changes in his artistic production and style, that they are used for breaking his life up into periods.&lt;ref name="weston116"/&gt;

At the age of 12, his father sent him to work in a bookshop and [[lending library]], a popular institution in Japanese cities, where reading books made from wood-cut blocks was a popular entertainment of the middle and upper classes.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt; At 14, he worked as an apprentice to a wood-carver, until the age of 18, when he entered the studio of [[Katsukawa Shunshō]]. Shunshō was an artist of [[ukiyo-e]], a style of woodblock prints and paintings that Hokusai would master, and head of the so-called Katsukawa school.&lt;ref name="nagata"/&gt; Ukiyo-e, as practised by artists like Shunshō, focused on images of the courtesans and [[Kabuki]] actors who were popular in Japan's cities at the time.&lt;ref name="weston117"/&gt;

After a year, Hokusai's name changed for the first time, when he was dubbed Shunrō by his master. It was under this name that he published his first prints, a series of pictures of Kabuki actors published in 1779. During the decade he worked in Shunshō's studio, Hokusai was married to his first wife, about whom very little is known except that she died in the early 1790s. He married again in 1797, although this second wife also died after a short time. He fathered two sons and three daughters with these two wives, and his youngest daughter Ei, also known as [[Katsushika Ōi|Ōi]], eventually became an artist.&lt;ref name="weston117"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/author/DA10315358?l=en|title=葛飾, 応為 カツシカ, オウイ|language=Japanese|publisher=[[CiNii]]|access-date=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of Shunshō in 1793, Hokusai began exploring other styles of art, including European styles he was exposed to through French and Dutch copper engravings he was able to acquire.&lt;ref name="weston117"/&gt; He was soon expelled from the Katsukawa school by Shunkō, the chief disciple of Shunshō, possibly due to studies at the rival [[Kanō school]]. This event was, in his own words, inspirational: "What really motivated the development of my artistic style was the embarrassment I suffered at Shunkō's hands."&lt;ref name="lane"/&gt;

Hokusai also changed the subjects of his works, moving away from the images of courtesans and actors that were the traditional subjects of ukiyo-e. Instead, his work became focused on landscapes and images of the daily life of Japanese people from a variety of social levels. This change of subject was a breakthrough in ukiyo-e and in Hokusai's career.&lt;ref name="weston117"/&gt; ''Fireworks in the Cool of Evening at Ryogoku Bridge in Edo'' (1790) dates from this period of Hokusai's life.&lt;ref name="britishmuseum.org"/&gt;

==Height of career==
The next period saw Hokusai's association with the Tawaraya School and the adoption of the name "Tawaraya Sōri". He produced many brush paintings, called ''[[surimono]]'', and illustrations for ''kyōka ehon'' (illustrated book of humorous poems) during this time. In 1798, Hokusai passed his name on to a pupil and set out as an independent artist, free from ties to a school for the first time, adopting the name Hokusai Tomisa.

By 1800, Hokusai was further developing his use of ukiyo-e for purposes other than portraiture. He had also adopted the name he would most widely be known by, Katsushika Hokusai, the former name referring to the part of Edo where he was born and the latter meaning, 'north studio'. That year, he published two collections of landscapes, ''Famous Sights of the Eastern Capital'' and ''Eight Views of Edo''. He also began to attract students of his own, eventually teaching 50 pupils over the course of his life.&lt;ref name="weston117"/&gt;

He became increasingly famous over the next decade, both due to his artwork and his talent for self-promotion. During a Tokyo festival in 1804, he created a portrait of the [[Buddhist]] priest [[Bodhidharma|Daruma]] said to be {{convert|600|ft|m}} long using a broom and buckets full of ink. Another story places him in the court of the [[Tokugawa Ienari|Shōgun Ienari]], invited there to compete with another artist who practised more traditional brush stroke painting. Hokusai's painting, created in front of the Shōgun, consisted of painting a blue curve on paper, then chasing across it a chicken whose feet had been dipped in red paint. He described the painting to the Shōgun as a landscape showing the Tatsuta River with red maple leaves floating in it, winning the competition.&lt;ref name="weston1"/&gt;

1807 saw Hokusai collaborate with the popular novelist [[Takizawa Bakin]] on a series of illustrated books. The two did not get along due to artistic differences, and their collaboration ended during work on their fourth book. The publisher, given the choice between keeping Hokusai or Bakin on the project, opted to keep Hokusai, emphasizing the importance of illustrations in printed works of the period.&lt;ref name="weston118"/&gt;

Hokusai paid close attention to the production of his work in books. Two instances are documented in letters he wrote to the publishers and block cutters involved in the production of his designs in ''Toshisen Ehon'', a Japanese edition of an anthology of Chinese poetry. Hokusai writes to the book’s publisher that the blockcutter Egawa Tomekichi, with whom Hokusai had previously worked and whom he respected, had strayed from Hokusai’s style in the cutting of certain heads. Hokusai also wrote directly to another block cutter involved in the project, Sugita Kinsuke, stating that he disliked the Utagawa-school style in which Kinsuke had cut the figure’s eyes and noses and that amendments would need to be made for the final prints to be true to Hokusai’s style. In his letter, Hokusai includes illustrated examples of both his style of illustrating eyes and noses and the Utagawa–school style. The publisher agreed to make these alterations, even with hundreds of copies of the book already printed. To correct these details the already existing cut blocks would be corrected by use of the Umeki technique. The sections to be corrected would be removed and a prepared piece of wood inserted, into which the blockcutter would cut the revised design. Use of the Umeki technique can be detected by fine break marks bordering the inserted block. Copies in print of both the original woodblock and those made of Hokusai’s requested revisions survive, printed in 1833 and 1836 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tinios|first1=Ellis|title=Hokusai and his Blockcutters|journal=Print Quarterly|date=June 2015|volume=XXXII|issue=2|pages=186–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, at the age of 51, Hokusai changed his name to ''Taito'' and entered the period in which he created the ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'' and various ''etehon'', or art manuals.&lt;ref name="nagata"/&gt; These ''etehon'', beginning in 1812 with ''Quick Lessons in Simplified Drawing'', served as a convenient way to make money and attract more students. ''Manga'' (meaning random drawings) included studies in perspective.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Screech|first=Timon|year=2012|title=Hokusai's Lines of Sight|jstor=41601844|journal=Mechademia|volume=7|page=107&lt;!--|pages=103-109--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book of Hokusai's ''manga'', sketches or caricatures that influenced the modern form of comics known by the same name, was published in 1814. Together, his 12 volumes of manga published before 1820 and three more published posthumously include thousands of drawings of animals, religious figures, and everyday people. They often have humorous overtones and were very popular at the time.&lt;ref name="weston118"/&gt;

On October 5, 1817, he painted at the [[Hongan-ji Nagoya Betsuin]] in Nagoya the ''Big [[Bodhidharma|Daruma]]'' on paper, measuring 18 × 10.8 metres, impressing many onlookers. For this feat he received the name "''Darusen''" (a shortened form of ''Daruma [[Sensei]]'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/archives/21092&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctv.co.jp/event/darusen/midokoro/&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original was destroyed in 1945, promotional handbills from that time survived and are preserved at the [[Nagoya City Museum]]. Based on studies, a reproduction of the large painting was done at a large public event on 23 November 2017 to commemorate the 200-year anniversary of the painting, using the same size and techniques and material as the original.&lt;ref&gt;https://mainichi.jp/articles/20171124/k00/00m/040/070000c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chugainippoh.co.jp/religion/news/20171129-001.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820, Hokusai changed his name yet again, this time to "Iitsu," a change which marked the start of a period in which he secured fame as an artist throughout Japan. His most famous work, ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'', including the famous ''Great Wave off Kanagawa'', was produced in the early 1830s. The results of Hokusai's perspectival studies in ''Manga'' can be seen here in ''The Great Wave off Kanagawa'' where he uses what would have been seen as a western perspective to represent depth and volume.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It proved so popular that Hokusai later added ten more prints to the series. Among the other popular series of prints he published during this time are ''[[A Tour of the Waterfalls of the Provinces]]'', ''[[Oceans of Wisdom]]'' and ''Unusual Views of Celebrated Bridges in the Provinces''.&lt;ref name="weston2"/&gt; He also began producing a number of detailed individual images of flowers and birds, including the extraordinarily detailed ''Poppies'' and ''Flock of Chickens''.&lt;ref name="weston119"/&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:hokusai-fuji-koryuu.png|thumb|upright|''The Dragon of Smoke Escaping from Mt Fuji'']]

The next period, beginning in 1834, saw Hokusai working under the name "Gakyō Rōjin Manji" (The Old Man Mad About Art).&lt;ref name="gvjh.org"/&gt;  It was at this time that Hokusai produced ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'', another significant landscape series.&lt;ref name="weston119"/&gt;

In the postscript to this work, Hokusai writes:

{{quote|From the age of six, I had a passion for copying the form of things and since the age of fifty I have published many drawings, yet of all, I drew by my seventieth year there is nothing worth taking into account. At seventy-three years I partly understood the structure of animals, birds, insects and fishes, and the life of grasses and plants. And so, at eighty-six I shall progress further; at ninety I shall even further penetrate their secret meaning, and by one hundred I shall perhaps truly have reached the level of the marvellous and divine. When I am one hundred and ten, each dot, each line will possess a life of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Calza, Gian Carlo. "Hokusau: a Universe" in ''Hokusai'', p. 7.  Phaidon&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1839, a fire destroyed Hokusai's studio and much of his work. By this time, his career was beginning to fade as younger artists such as [[Andō Hiroshige]] became increasingly popular. But Hokusai never stopped painting and completed ''Ducks in a Stream'' at the age of 87.&lt;ref name="Weston, p. 120"/&gt;

Constantly seeking to produce better work, he apparently exclaimed on his deathbed, "If only Heaven will give me just another ten years&amp;nbsp;... Just another five more years, then I could become a real painter." He died on May 10, 1849 (18th day of the 4th month of the 2nd year of the [[Kaei|Kaei era]] by the old calendar), and was buried at the [[Seikyō-ji]] in Tokyo (Taito Ward).&lt;ref name="nagata"/&gt;

==Shunga==
{{Cleanup rewrite|this section should focus on Hokusai's shunga work and not describe what shunga is|section|date=November 2018}}
[[File:Tako_to_ama_retouched.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'', 1814]]
Hokusai also executed [[erotic art]], called   ''[[Shunga (art)|Shunga]]'' in Japanese. Most shunga are a type of [[ukiyo-e]], usually executed in [[Woodcut|woodblock]] print format.&lt;ref name=Helsinki&gt;{{cite book | title=Forbidden Images – Erotic art from Japan's Edo Period |publisher=Helsinki City Art Museum |location=Helsinki, Finland |language=Finnish | year=2002 | pages=23–28|isbn=9518965536}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translated literally, the Japanese word ''shunga'' means ''picture of spring''; "spring".

Shunga was enjoyed by both men and women of all classes.  Superstitions and customs surrounding shunga suggest as much; in the same way that it was considered a lucky charm against death for a [[samurai]] to carry shunga, it was considered a protection against fire in [[merchant]] warehouses and the home.  From this, we can deduce that samurai, [[chonin]], and housewives all owned shunga.  All three of these groups would suffer separation from the opposite sex; the samurai lived in barracks for months at a time, and conjugal separation resulted from the [[sankin-kōtai]] system and the merchants' need to travel to obtain and sell goods.&lt;ref name=Kornicki&gt;{{cite book | title=The Book in Japan: A Cultural History from the Beginnings to the Nineteenth Century | author=Kornicki, Peter F. |location=Honolulu | publisher=University of Hawaii Press | isbn=0824823370| pages=331–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Records of women obtaining shunga themselves from book lenders show that they were consumers of it.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt; It was traditional to present a bride with ukiyo-e depicting erotic scenes from ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. Shunga may have served as sexual guidance for the sons and daughters of wealthy families.

==Works and influences==
Hokusai had a long career, but he produced most of his important work after age 60. His most popular work is the [[ukiyo-e]] series ''[[36 Views of Mount Fuji (Hokusai)|Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'', which was created between 1826 and 1833. It actually consists of 46 prints (10 of them added after initial publication).&lt;ref name="lane"/&gt;
In addition, he is responsible for the 1834 {{nihongo|''One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji''|富嶽百景|Fugaku Hyakkei}}, a work which "is generally considered the masterpiece among his landscape picture books."&lt;ref name="lane"/&gt;
His ukiyo-e transformed the art form from a style of portraiture focused on the courtesans and actors popular during the [[Edo period]] in Japan's cities into a much broader style of art that focused on landscapes, plants, and animals.&lt;ref name="weston117"/&gt;

Both Hokusai's choice of [[art name]] and frequent depiction of [[Mount Fuji]] stem from his religious beliefs. The name {{nihongo|Hokusai|北斎}} means "North Studio (room)," an abbreviation of {{nihongo||北辰際|Hokushinsai}} or "North Star Studio." Hokusai was a member of the [[Nichiren]] sect of [[Buddhism]], who see the [[North Star]] as associated with the deity {{nihongo||妙見菩薩|Myōken}}.&lt;ref name="lane"/&gt;
Mount Fuji has traditionally been linked with eternal life. This belief can be traced to ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', where a goddess deposits the elixir of life on the peak. As Henry Smith expounds, "Thus from an early time, Mt. Fuji was seen as the source of the secret of immortality, a tradition that was at the heart of Hokusai's own obsession with the mountain."&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

The largest of Hokusai's works is the 15-volume collection {{nihongo|''[[Hokusai Manga]]''|北斎漫画}}, a book crammed with nearly 4,000 sketches that was published in 1814.&lt;ref name="lane"/&gt;
These sketches are often incorrectly considered the precedent to modern [[manga]], as ''Hokusai's Manga'' is a collection of sketches (of animals, people, objects, etc.), different from the story-based comic-book style of modern manga.&lt;ref name="lane"/&gt;

===Influences on art and culture===

Hokusai himself was influenced by [[Sesshū Tōyō]] and other styles of [[Chinese painting]].&lt;ref name="csuchico"/&gt; His influences stretched across the globe to his western contemporaries in nineteenth-century Europe with [[Japonism]], which started with a craze for collecting Japanese art, particularly ukiyo-e, of which some of the first samples were to be seen in Paris, when in about 1856, the French artist Félix Bracquemond first came across a copy of the sketchbook Hokusai Manga at the workshop of his printer. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} He influenced [[Art Nouveau]], or [[Jugendstil]] in Germany, and the larger [[Impressionist|Impressionism]] movement, with themes echoing his work appearing in the work of [[Claude Monet]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. According to the Brooklyn Rail: "many artists collected his woodcuts: [[Degas]], [[Gauguin]], [[Klimt]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Manet]], and [[van Gogh]]."&lt;ref name="Hokusai Retrospective"/&gt;  [[Hermann Obrist]]'s whiplash motif, or ''Peitschenhieb'', which came to exemplify the new movement, is visibly influenced by Hokusai's work.

Hokusai inspired the [[Hugo Award]]-winning short story by science fiction author [[Roger Zelazny]], "[[24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai]]", in which the protagonist tours the area surrounding Mount Fuji, stopping at locations painted by Hokusai. A 2011 book on [[mindfulness]] closes with the poem "Hokusai Says" by Roger Keys, preceded with the explanation that "[s]ometimes poetry captures the soul of an idea better than anything else."&lt;ref&gt;[[J.

In the 1985 Encyclopaedia Brittanica, Richard Lane speculates Hokusai as "since the later nineteenth century [having] impressed Western artists, critics and art lovers alike, more, possibly, than any other single Asian artist."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Douglas Lane|Lane, Richard]] (1985).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2809">The '''Home Arts and Industries Association''' was part of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in Britain. It was founded in 1884 by [[Eglantyne Louisa Jebb]], mother of [[Save the Children]] founder, [[Eglantyne Jebb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D. Maltz|title=British Aestheticism and the Urban Working Classes, 1870-1900: Beauty for the People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKftCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|date=22 November 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-50405-9|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial name, changed in 1885, was the "Cottage Arts Association".&lt;ref&gt;Janice Helland, ''Exhibiting Ireland: The Donegal Industrial Fund in London and Chicago'', RACAR: revue d'art canadienne / Canadian Art Review Vol. 29, No. 1/2 (2004), pp. 28–46, at p. 31. Published by: AAUC/UAAC (Association des universités d’art du Canada / Universities Art Association of Canada). Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/42630693&lt;/ref&gt; Jebb was inspired by an initiative of [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] in Philadelphia. Another leading member was the designer [[Mary Fraser Tytler]]. The organisation sought to revive traditional rural crafts which were threatened by the mechanisation of production and by increasing urbanization. In conformity with the thinking of [[John Ruskin]] and with Arts and Crafts philosophy, supporters believed that flourishing traditional crafts helped sustain rural communities and provided workers with far more personal satisfaction than was possible for factory workers. The Association funded schools and organised marketing opportunities for craftspeople. By 1889 it had 450 classes, 1,000 teachers and 5,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Naylor, ''The Arts and Crafts Movement'', London: Studio Vista, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the Associations’ annual exhibitions took place in July 1885 and by 1888 were large enough to take place in the [[Royal Albert Hall]], an annual occurrence until 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Albert Hall Archives&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 the Association moved their offices to the Hall as tenants of the building and continued their work of funding schools and organising marketing opportunities for craftspeople. In 1904 the Art Workers Quarterly said the association, '…is a society for teaching the working classes handicrafts such as wood carving, inlaying, metal repousse, basket weaving, leather work, book binding, and for encouraging these and others such as lace, embroidery spinning, weaving, pottery etc., by means of an annual exhibition'.&lt;ref&gt;The Art Workers Quarterly, Vol.3, p135-138, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lead sheet''' is a form of [[musical notation]] that specifies the essential elements of a [[song|popular song]]: the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[harmony]]. The melody is written in [[music notation#Modern notation|modern Western music notation]], the lyric is written as text below the [[musical staff|staff]] and the harmony is specified with [[chord notation|chord symbols]] above the staff.

The lead sheet does not describe the chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]], [[voice leading]], [[bass line]] or other aspects of the [[accompaniment]]. These are specified later by an [[arrangement|arranger]] or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] by the performers&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.76. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, and are considered aspects of the arrangement or performance of a song, rather than a part of the song itself. 

A lead sheet may also specify an instrumental part or theme, if this is considered essential to the song's identity. For example, the opening [[guitar riff]] from [[Deep Purple]]'s "[[Smoke on the Water]]" is a part of the song; any performance of the song should include the guitar riff, and any imitation of that guitar riff is an imitation of the song. Thus the riff belongs on the lead sheet.

== Performance with lead sheets ==
A lead sheet is often the only form of written music used by a small [[jazz]] ensemble. One or more musicians will play the melody while the rest of the group improvises an appropriate accompaniment based on the [[chord progression]] given in the [[chord symbol]]s, followed by an improvised solo also based on the [[chord progression]]. Similarly, a sufficiently skilled [[jazz]] [[pianist]] should be able to accompany a singer and perform a song by her or himself using only a lead sheet.

Lead sheets are also called '''fake sheets''' and collections of lead sheets are called "[[fake book|fakebooks]]".

== Lead sheet as legal definition of a song ==
The melody, lyrics, and harmony define what a song is. In the [[music industry]] and [[entertainment law]], a lead sheet is the document used to describe a song for legal purposes. For example, a lead sheet is the form of a song to which [[copyright]] is applied—if a [[songwriter]] sues someone for copyright violation, the court will compare lead sheets to determine how much of the song has been copied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Krasilovsky et al. 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or if a song is considered for an [[Academy Award]] or a [[Grammy]], the song is submitted for consideration in the form of a lead sheet.

'''Léon Bakst''' ({{lang-ru|Леон (Лев) Николаевич Бакст}}, Leon (Lev) Nikolaevich Bakst) – born as '''Leyb-Khaim Izrailevich''' (later '''Samoylovich''') '''Rosenberg''', Лейб-Хаим Израилевич (Самойлович) Розенберг (27 January (8 February) 1866&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/izobrazitelnoe_iskusstvo/BAKST_LEV_SAMOLOVICH.html БАКСТ, ЛЕВ САМОЙЛОВИЧ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article090753.html Бакст Лев Самойлович]&lt;/ref&gt; – 28 December 1924) was a [[Russia]]n [[Painting|painter]] and [[Scenic design|scene]] and [[costume design]]er. He was a member of the [[Sergei Diaghilev]] circle and the [[Ballets Russes]], for which he designed exotic, richly coloured [[Set construction|sets]] and [[costume]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%81%D1%82/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%81%D1%82%20%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%B2%20%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87/ Леон Бакст]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:Léon Samoilovitch Bakst in 1916.jpg|thumb|Bakst in 1916]]
Leyb-Khaim Izrailevich (later Samoylovich) Rosenberg was born in [[Grodno]] (now in [[Belarus]]), into a middle-class Jewish family. As his grandfather was an exceptional tailor, the Tsar gave him a very good position, and he had a huge and wonderful house in Saint Petersburg{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. Later, when Leyb's parents moved to the capital, the boy Leyb would visit his grandfather's house every Saturday. He said that he had been very impressed as a youth by that house, always returning with pleasure.  At the young age of twelve, Lejb won a drawing contest and decided to become a painter, but his parents did not approve of this. 

After graduating from [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], he studied at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts|St. Petersburg Academy of Arts]] as a noncredit student, because he had failed the entry. He also worked part-time as a book illustrator, gaining admission into the Imperial Academy in 1883.

At the time of his first exhibition (1889) he took the surname of "Bakst," based on his mother's maiden name. The surname "Rosenberg" was thought to be "too Jewish" and not good for business. At the beginning of the 1890s, Bakst exhibited his works with the Society of [[Watercolour]]ists. From 1893 to 1897 he lived in Paris, where he studied at the [[Académie Julian]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=D1G37Ko49DcC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Acad%C3%A9mie+Julian&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOrYikkcHPAhXIVhQKHVKdCSo4HhDoAQgmMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Acad%C3%A9mie%20Julian&amp;f=false Bakst]&lt;/ref&gt; He still often visited [[Saint Petersburg]]. After the mid-1890s, Bakst became a member of the circle of writers and artists formed by [[Sergei Diaghilev]] and [[Alexandre Benois]],&lt;ref name="k"&gt;[http://pv-gallery.ru/artist.php?i=231&amp;letter=%CE Бакст Л. С.]&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1899 founded the influential periodical ''[[Mir iskusstva]],'' meaning "World of Art." His graphics for this publication brought him fame.

== Rise to fame ==
Bakst continued painting, producing portraits of [[Filipp Malyavin]] (1899), [[Vasily Rozanov]] (1901), [[Andrei Bely]] (1905), [[Zinaida Gippius]] (1906). He also worked as an art teacher for the children of [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia]]. In 1902, he took a commission from [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] to paint ''Admiral Avellan and Russian sailors meeting'' in Paris, a painting he started there, during the celebrations from the 17 to 25 October 1893. However, it took him 8 years to finish this work. 

In 1898, he showed his works in the Diaghilev-organized ''First Exhibition of Russian and Finnish Artists''; in ''World of Art'' exhibitions, as well as the [[Munich]] ''[[Sezession|Secession]],'' exhibitions of the ''Union of Russian Artists'', etc.

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Bakst worked for the magazines ''Zhupel'', ''Adskaja Pochta'', and ''Satyricon'', then for an art magazine called ''Apollon.''

Beginning in 1909, Bakst worked mostly as a stage-designer, designing [[Set construction|sets]] for [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]]. In 1908, he gained attention as a scene-painter for [[Diaghilev]] with the [[Ballets Russes]].  He produced scenery for ''Cleopatra'' (1909), ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]'' (1910), ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'' (1910), ''Narcisse'' (1911), ''[[Le Spectre de la Rose]]'' (1911), ''[[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|L'après-midi d'un faune]]'' (1912) and ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'' (1912).&lt;ref name =Remsen&gt;Thomas J Mikotowicz  "Bakst, Léon" in Thomas J Mikotowicz, ''Theatrical designers: and International Biographic Dictionary. ''New York: Greenwood, 1992 {{ISBN|0313262705}}. p.17&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Bakst lived in western Europe because, as a Jew, he did not have the right to live permanently outside the [[Pale of Settlement]] in the Russian Empire.

During his visits to Saint Petersburg, he taught in ''Zvantseva's school,'' where one of his students was [[Marc Chagall]] (1908–1910). Bakst described Chagall as a favorite, because when told to do something, he would listen carefully, but then he would take his paint and his brushes and do something completely different from the assignment. 

In 1914, Bakst was elected a member of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]].

In 1922, Bakst broke off his relationship with Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes. During this year, he visited [[Baltimore]] and, specifically [[Evergreen Museum &amp; Library|Evergreen House]] - the residence of his American friend and patron, art philanthropist Alice Warder Garrett (1877–1952). Having met in Paris in 1914, when Mrs. Garrett was accompanying her diplomat husband in Europe, Bakst soon depended upon Garrett as both a confidante and agent. Alice Garrett became Bakst's representative in the United States upon her return home in 1920, organizing two exhibitions of the artist's work at New York's [[Knoedler Gallery]], as well as subsequent traveling shows.  When in Baltimore, Bakst re-designed the dining room of Evergreen into a shocking acidic yellow and 'Chinese' red confection.  The artist transformed the house's small c. 1885 gymnasium into a colorfully Modernist private theatre. This is believed to be the only extant private theatre designed by Bakst.

Bakst died on 27 December 1924, in a clinic in Rueil Malmaison, near Paris, from [[lung]] problems ([[pulmonary edema|oedema]]).  His many admirers amongst the most famous artists of the time, poets, musicians, dancers and critiques, formed a funeral procession to accompany his body to his final resting place, in the Cimetière des Batignolles, in Paris, during a very moving ceremony.&lt;ref name="k"/&gt;

In late 2010, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London presented an exhibit of Bakst's costumes and prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/theatre_performance/features/Costume/1739_Designers_Speak/1739_Leon_Bakst/index.html |title=Biography of Léon Bakst - Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411070131/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/theatre_performance/features/Costume/1739_Designers_Speak/1739_Leon_Bakst/index.html |archivedate=2009-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film revolves around the family of Jaikodi Thevar, who has two wives. Jaikodi is a respected landowner whose family has helped develop the village for generations. However, his first wife Sevanamma ([[Viji Chandrasekhar]]), and her elder brother Veera ([[Vela Ramamoorthy]]) control the local gangs and are feared by the villagers. As a result, Jaikodi prefers to live with his second wife and her children (Parthiban ([[Kathir (actor)|Kathir]]) and Prema. Because of her husband's preference of his second wife, Sevanamma dislikes her and her children. Veera blames his brother-in-law's  second wife and her children of destroying his sister's life and hates them too. The only member of the first wife's family that accepts the second wife's family is Jaikodi's drunkard eldest son, Boologarasa ([[Kalaiyarasan]]). However, he is often powerless against his mother and maternal uncle. 

Parthiban develops affection for a Malayali girl named Ritu ([[Oviya]]), who he first meets at his sister's nursing college and later convinces her to stay at his house due to ragging issues at the college hostel. However, she stays silent when he confesses his love for her and leaves the village. Jaikodi Thevar dies unexpectedly after a heart attack, a day after Prema's marriage from his second marriage. Boologarasa invites his stepmother and half-siblings to pay their respects but his Uncle Veera threatens to have the entire village boycott the funeral if they attend. As a result, the second wife and her children are kept away from the rituals 

Boologarasa is guilt-suck that his stepmother and half-siblings are excluded from his father's funeral. He invites Parthiban to the sixteenth day ritual in honour of their father. After initial procrastination, Parthiban decides to attend the ritual. Boologarasa teases Veera's sons for not being to do anything to stop him from bringing his brother to their home. Angered, Boologarasa's cousins attack him. This eventually escalates into a fight. As one of Veera's sons tries to stab Boologarasa, Parthiban pushes him away and the man lands on to a sharp knife, dying at the spot. Parthiban flees as his brother holds back his surviving cousins. In order to avenge his son's death, Veera and his surviving sons plan to kill him. Sevanamma initially understands that Parthiban is not at fault and he did this to save her only son. She helps to protect Parthiban's mother and arranges for him to escape to Kerala. Parthiban lives with Ritu's family for a few days but is forced to live on the streets after his stepmother's nephews track him down. 

Sevannamma, confronted by his brother, helps him to lure Parthiban out by poisoning Parthiban's mother who currently lives with her. This brings Parthiban to his dead mother, where he is being killed after he performs his last rites for her. The film ends with a scene where Sevannamma is shown crying out loud with guilt soaked in the blood of Parthiban.

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews from critics.

[[Rediff]] wrote "Vikram Sukumaran’s ''Madha Yaanai Koottam'' reveals in great detail the rites and rituals followed after death and how pride, anger and vengeance can only lead to senseless violence and death".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/review-madha-yaanai-koottam-shows-senseless-violence-south/20131226.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Business Times]] wrote "Commendable Effort by Director Vikram Sugumaran", while  [[Sify]] wrote, "Vikram Sugumaran has made a decent first film. He is a good writer."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sify.com/movies/madhayaanai-koottam-review-tamil-pcmbhnhhdhceg.html&lt;/ref&gt; Behindwoods wrote, " MYK has tense and gripping sequences. Vikram Sugumaran’s debut isn’t a bad watch".&lt;ref&gt;http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movies/madha-yaanai-koottam/madha-yaanai-koottam-review.html&lt;/ref&gt; Indiaglitz wrote, "''Madha Yaanai Koottam'' is a heavy story, with intermediate dark comedy relief on a different genre of entertainment; the film, on the whole, is commendable." ''[[The Hindu]]'' wrote, "The film is hopelessly dark".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-reviews/madhayaanai-koottam-herd-mentality/article5511986.ece&lt;/ref&gt; The movie has received good rating from the viewers on the opening week.

The '''Missorium of Theodosius I''' is a large ceremonial silver dish preserved in the [[Real Academia de la Historia]], in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].  It was probably made in [[Constantinople]] for the tenth anniversary ([[decennalia]]) in 388 of the reign of the Emperor [[Theodosius I]], the last Emperor to rule both the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empires]].  It is one of the best surviving examples of [[Late Antique]] Imperial imagery and one of the finest examples of late Roman [[goldsmith|goldsmith work]]. It is the largest and most elaborate, and the most famous, of the 19 surviving vessels believed to represent ''largitio'' ("largesse") or a "ceremonial gift given by the emperor to a civil or military official".&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Missorium Théodose dt Tellus.jpg|thumb|Reclining [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]], the Roman goddess of Mother Earth.]]
The dish shows a hieratic image of the Emperor framed in an arcade, giving a document contained in a [[consular diptych|diptych]], possibly a letter of appointment, to a much smaller senior official, flanked by his two co-emperors, [[Valentinian II]] and his own son [[Arcadius]], and bodyguards who can be identified by their hairstyles, [[torc]]s and shields as belonging to the German imperial bodyguard.  The official receives the document with hands covered by his [[chlamys]] (cloak).&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, 14, 33; Kiilerich, 278&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[iconography]] is related to that known as the ''[[Traditio legis]]'', which was transferred from [[Late Antique]] Imperial art to Christian art,&lt;ref&gt;Hvalvik, 414-415&lt;/ref&gt; eventually developing into the iconic "[[Christ in Majesty]]".  Theodosius is shown far larger than the other figures, as is common in the hieratic [[Late Antique]] style, despite the fact that Valentinian II had been an Emperor for longer (he in turn is significantly larger than Arcadius or the unknown official).  The three emperors have [[halo (religious iconography)|haloes]] which is usual at this period.  Although all were Christians, there are no specific Christian elements in the iconography,&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, 35&lt;/ref&gt; and the lower zone contains specifically pagan imagery, as some Late Antique Christian art continued to do.

[[File:Peristyle of Diocletian's Palace, Split (11908116224).jpg|thumb|The [[peristyle]] in [[Diocletian's Palace]], in modern-day Croatia.]]
Their clothing is early [[Byzantine dress]] consistent with other Imperial portraits of the period.  The two co-emperors have decorated ''tablions'' (patches showing rank attached to their main garment) at their knees, or possibly [[Epigonation]]s (unattached ceremonial "handkerchiefs", which survive as an [[Eastern Orthodox]] vestment).  These would have been highly decorated with [[embroidery]] and probably [[gemstone|jewel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, 34; Kiilerich, 275-276&lt;/ref&gt;

The official receiving the document wears clothes decorated with stripes and patches which would have been a kind of uniform for his office.  The three Imperial figures have tightly curled hairstyles, and wear [[diadem]]s of [[pearls]].  Their cloaks are fastened with large circular jewelled [[fibula]]e, comparable to that worn by [[Justinian]] in the famous mosaic at [[Ravenna]], while the official has a "crossbow" fibula.&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, 34; Kiilerich, 275-276&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural surround has often been compared to a [[peristyle]] at [[Diocletian's Palace]] in [[Split, Croatia]], where the emperor retired after abdicating his powers. This opens from the imperial residence to a courtyard that has been regarded as a setting for ceremonial audiences such as the one shown on the dish, but this interpretation is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, 33-34; Kiilerich, 276-277&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the groundline of the imperial scene there is a scene of [[putti]] offering garlands and other objects, up to the Emperor above; with the two on the [[pediment]] above, there are five in total, and various significances have been given to this number, as representing years, "dioceses" of the Eastern Empire, or other things. Their offerings are held in hand-cloths, just as the official uses his clothes to receive his gift; it was not considered respectful to hold bare hands out to the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, 14, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The putti fly above a reclining figure of [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]] or Terra, the Roman goddess of "Mother Earth". Vaguer figures from [[Roman mythology]] such as personifications, putti, and [[winged victories]] continued to be acceptable in Christian art of the Roman elite, and apparently retained for reasons of what we might call "cultural heritage",  where representations of specific major deities were not. Tellus is shown in a pose that continues [[Hellenistic]] style, rather than the frontal iconic Late Antique style of the figures in the upper zone.&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, 14, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and condition==
[[File:07 constantius2Chrono354.png|thumb|A haloed [[Constantius II]] dispensing ''largitia'' (generosity) as if by magic, from the [[Chronography of 354]].]]

The missorium comes from a treasure of silver objects that also included two plain silver cups, now missing, discovered by a labourer in 1847 in [[Almendralejo]], close to [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]] in the Spanish province of [[Badajoz]]. When found it was folded flat along the line of the diagonal cut that now divides it into two pieces, which was made as part of an attempt to restore it, though an attempt at a cut along the same line may also have been made in antiquity.  It is in good condition apart from the areas affected by this, but that it was folded may suggest it was being treated as bullion when deposited.&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;  The height of the silver relief varies, and is highest in the face of Theodosius and other highlights of the composition; much of the detail on the clothing is engraved.

==A commemorative dish==
The dish is one of the most beautiful examples of silversmith's work of imperial largesse, that is to say of the category of luxury articles made for imperial celebrations such as accession to the throne and anniversaries and given on these occasions by the emperor to high-ranking dignitaries of the empire: they were mainly dishes, plates, cups, and bowls in silver.  The recipient may well be the official represented on the dish (possibly a generalized figure, especially if the design was made in several copies, which we cannot judge), and the find-spot in Spain, Theodosius's home province, suggests it was one of his Spanish friends or relations.&lt;ref&gt;Kiilerich, 278&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''missorium'' is a large dish or shallow bowl that could be used in ceremonial washing of hands and face in both secular and pagan and Christian religious contexts, though this dish is too flat to be very useful for this, and was probably intended mainly to be displayed as a sign of wealth and imperial favour. The term now tends to be avoided by scholars, &lt;ref&gt;A. M. Canto, 2000, p. 297, argued that the object could not be a "missorium", "object that is sent" (the name universally used since R. Delbrueck in 1929 and 1933), among other reasons because the word itself did not exist yet in the fourth century AD, and suggested the term "clipeus" or, in any case, "disc" or "dish".&lt;/ref&gt; as rather imprecise, but has become traditional in the case of the dish in Madrid. This is made of solid silver and has traces of [[gilding]] on the inscriptions. Its size is exceptional compared to other contemporary silver dishes, measuring 74&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter with a thickness which varies between 4 and 8&amp;nbsp;mm. It rests on a ring, 3&amp;nbsp;cm thick with a diameter of 26&amp;nbsp;cm, which was welded to the base. This ring has a Greek inscription specifying the official weight of the object:

ποc ↑Ν ΜεΤ i.e. ποσότης λιτρῶν 50 μετάλλου (“50 metal pounds”)

The 50 "[[Byzantine_units_of_measurement#Weight|pound]]s" correspond to an official weight of 16.13&amp;nbsp;kg of silver,&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, 14&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the dish actually weighs only 15.35&amp;nbsp;kg; the difference could be because the dish was weighed and marked before being decorated: a piece of the dish is also missing. The decoration, at the same time [[Engraving|engraved]] and with [[repoussé]] decoration (pushed out from the back), would have removed a little metal, although this is unlikely to account for the whole difference.

[[File:Missorium Kerch.jpg|thumb|The Missorium of Kerch representing [[Constantius II]], [[Hermitage Museum]], St Petersburg.]]
The subject of the decoration is the emperor enthroned with his co-reigning emperors. An inscription along the side of the rim makes it possible to identify him with certainty:

D(ominus) N(oster) THEODOSIVS PERPET(uus)AVG(ustus)OB DIEM FELICISSIMVM X  

that is to say: “Our Lord Theodosius, emperor forever, on the most happy occasion of the tenth anniversary (of his reign).”

The inscription indicates that the dish was made at the time of the decennalia of an emperor named Theodosius.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1159113/Las_quindecennalia_de_Teodosio_I_el_Grande_19_de_enero_del_393_d._C._en_el_gran_cl%C3%ADpeo_de_Madrid_con_addenda A. M. Canto, 2000, p. 291], reads the inscription ''D(ominus) n(oster) Theodosius perpet(uus)· Aug(ustus) ob diem felicissimum XV'' (''i.e., quindecennalium)'', the 15 years of his reign. She sees a V over the X, therefore ''XV'' (pages 291 ff, and 1-2 of the addenda of 2015), and also believes the date of 388 impossible because Valentinian II lived and, being the senior emperor, he could not be in a second plane with respect to Theodosius. However, in 393 Valentinian II had already passed away. Therefore the date historically more possible are the ''quindecennalia'' of Theodosius I, January 19, 393 AD. (pp. 297 ff.), being the two co-reigning ''Augusti'' the sons of Theodosius, Arcadius and Honorius. &lt;/ref&gt;. The presence of two co-regents makes it possible to exclude immediately Theodosius II, for he had one co-regent — his uncle [[Honorius (emperor)|Flavius Honorius]] — at the time of the tenth anniversary of his reign, celebrated in 412. This leaves the decennalia of Theodosius I, on January 19 388.&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, 14; Kiilerich, 373-374&lt;/ref&gt; It was celebrated when the emperor was staying at [[Thessaloniki]] from September 387 to April 388. Some have concluded that the missorium was the work of a Thessalonician workshop, but it is more likely that it was ordered from the Imperial workshops in [[Constantinople]]; others think that the imperial workshop would have followed the emperor around on his travels.&lt;ref&gt;Kiilerich, 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Few examples of this imperial silver have survived; only nineteen items, all dating from the 4th century and produced for six different emperors, though ten are for  [[Licinius]]. In this series, the missorium of [[Theodosius I]] is distinguished because it is both the latest - although the practice probably continued for a further two centuries - and because it carries the most elaborate decoration: the only other well-preserved examples are the ''Kerch plate'', preserved at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St Petersberg]], showing [[Constantius II]] on horseback, and that of [[Valentinian I]] or [[Valentinian II]] in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, 14&lt;/ref&gt;   A fragment from a treasure found at Groß Bodungen was probably the closest to the missorium of [[Theodosius I]] in design, but is too damaged to allow an identification or a precise dating.  Rather more examples have survived of aristocratic, rather than imperial silver, such as the [[Mildenhall Treasure]] probably dating from a few years earlier, or the [[Sevso Treasure]].

[[Jutta Meischner]] relocates the Missorium of Theodosius to the 5th century AD, to the year 421. She argues, that the emperor is [[Theodosius II]], flanked by [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] to the right and [[Valentinian III]] to the left. Meischner constitutes this interpretation by describing the Missorium as a work of distinctive style, quality of execution and workmanship seen in exemplary examples of Western Roman Empire. She argues that features like these are not consistent with the era of [[Theodosius I]]. &lt;ref&gt;Canto (2000, p. 294-295) said that the dates proposed by J. Meischner and J. M. Blázquez (op.cit., 2000) for Theodosius II, 421 and 426 AD, are also impossible because we know by [[Marcellinus Comes]] and by coins that the ''decennalia'' and ''quindecennalia'' of Theodosius II were celebrated in the years 411 and 416 AD (the same opinión have J. Arce and W. Raeck, op. cit. ibid. fn. 26-27).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:de:Arne Effenberger|Arne Effenberger]] has argued against this interpretation,  stating that Theodosius II became autocrat in the year 408 AD, so his 10th reign anniversary would have taken place in 418 and not in 421 AD. He believes that it is thus unlikely that anniversary specified in the inscription may date to the reign of Theodosius II. 

However, Meischner bases her argument on the inscription mentioning a tenth imperial anniversary was intended to celebrate the continuation of the dynasty ten years after coming to power Theodosius II in 418 AD, following his father Arcadius’ death in 408 AD. On the basis of the epigraphic evidence (a XV, as proposed by Alicia Canto, see above and below), she believes that it was most likely commissioned by [[Galla Placidia]] and produced in [[Ravenna]] in around 421 AD as a gift to her nephew Theodosius II. She concedes the reading of the Roman numerals inscribed on the missorium by Alicia Canto in her detailed study (that was presented in the same Madrid conference),&lt;ref&gt;Canto, 289-300.&lt;/ref&gt; as ‘quindecennalia’ the fifteenth imperial anniversary, as opposed to the common reading of ''decennalia'', gives us of a new perspective and reassessment of the history, the circumstances of the Missorium’s commission by Galla Placidia and its intended functions and unresolved provenance.

==Style==
[[Image:RéplicaMissoriumTeodosioMNAR.JPG|thumb|A copy of the Missorium of Theodosius in the Museum of Mérida, Spain.]]

The dish is a leading example of the style of the so-called "Theodosian Renaissance", along with the base of the [[Obelisk of Theodosius]] in [[Istanbul]] and the fragments surviving of his triumphal column there. This is the first stylistic phase that can be clearly linked with the new capital of [[Constantinople]], and according to [[Ernst Kitzinger]]: "One senses that some strong artistic personality or personalities who set the tone and aesthetic standards were active at the centre of political power, stamping the monuments of this period with an unmistakable imprint".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite limitations in terms of anatomical correctness, and a "soft, rubbery quality" in the nude bodies, the style has "an element of studied classicism" as well as "an insistence on clear, continuous and simplified outline, on neatness and regularity" in the figure of ''Terra/Tellus'', so that "Classicist form is oddly paired with linear abstract order", the latter more prominent in the upper zone, to lend an air of authority and "timelessness and absolute stability" to the imperial figures that was not required below.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and history==
One In Ten is overseen by a board of three officers and nine board members.  A full-time, paid executive director oversees the day-to-day operations of the organization.  All One In Ten programs, including Reel Affirmations, are conceived, organized and implemented by volunteers.

One In Ten was co-founded by Barry Becker, Mark Betchkal, Matthew Cibellis and Keith Clark, [[gay]] residents of Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Plowman"&gt;Plowman, "Rehoboth Beach Film Fest Makes A Splash at the Box Office," ''Delaware Today,'' October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The four began meeting in 1990, and founded One In Ten as the parent organization for Reel Affirmations.&lt;ref name="Howe"&gt;Howe, "Gay and Lesbian Festival," ''Washington Post,'' October 16, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The four sought the advice and input of [[Frameline]], then the largest LGBT gay film festival in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Plowman" /&gt; With financial and administrative assistance from Frameline, the first Reel Affirmations film festival opened on October 11, 1991.

==Capital Pride==
In 1995, One In Ten assumed responsibility for organizing Washington, D.C.'s Gay Pride Day events after the festival's original sponsoring organization nearly went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Bates and Nguyen, "Celebrating the Right to Celebrate," ''Washington Post,'' June 10, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; One In Ten moved the street festival from Francis Junior High to [[Freedom Plaza]] near the [[White House]] on [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue N.W.]]&lt;ref&gt;Loose, "Goal of Gay March Is Freedom Plaza," ''Washington Post,'' June 15, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization also changed the festival's parade route. Instead of traveling south from [[Meridian Hill Park]] and then westward on P Street N.W. to finish at Francis Junior High School, the parade now began at the school, moved east along P Street N.W. to 14th Street N.W., and then south on 14th Street to Freedom Plaza.&lt;ref name="Chibbaro"&gt;Chibbaro, "Politics Take Backseat at Pride," ''Washington Blade,'' June 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Capital Pride Takes to the Streets," ''Washington Post,'' June 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the financial and organizational strain of producing the event proved too heavy for the arts group. In 1997, [[Whitman-Walker Clinic]] joined One In Ten as a co-sponsor of the festival, and the event was renamed [[Capital Pride (Washington)|Capital Pride]]. The street festival was moved off Freedom Plaza and onto [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] N.W. between 14th and 10th Streets N.W.&lt;ref name="Chibbaro" /&gt; Corporate sponsorships also rose dramatically, reflecting the festival's growing commercial nature. Corporate sponsorships reached $247,000 in 1999, up from $80,000 in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Allam, "Taking to the Streets With Capital Pride," ''Washington Post,'' June 14, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Whitman-Walker Clinic became the sole co-sponsor of Capital Pride, although One In Ten continued to serve on the festival's community board along with other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, "At 25, Pride Hits Its Stride," Washington Post, June 12, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Southeastern Ceremonial Complex''' (formerly the '''Southern Cult'''), aka '''S.E.C.C.''', is the name given to the regional stylistic similarity of [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[iconography]], [[ceremony|ceremonies]], and [[mythology]] of the [[Mississippian culture]] that coincided with their adoption of [[maize]] agriculture and [[chiefdom]]-level complex social organization from 1200 to 1650 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/~anthro/muller/SECC/sld008.htm |title=Connections |author=muller |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914003946/http://www.siu.edu/~anthro/muller/SECC/sld008.htm |archivedate=2006-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Townsend 2004"&gt;{{cite book |  last = Townsend | first = Richard F., and Robert V.

This ceremonial complex represents a major component of the [[religion]] of the Mississippian peoples, and is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  editors = F.

Obsolete names for this ceremonial complex, found in some anthropological sources, include Buzzard Cult and Southern Death Cult.&lt;ref name="hrnrkmp"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hill|editor1-first=Samuel S.|editor2-last=Lippy|editor2-first=Charles H.|editor3-last=Wilson|editor3-first=Charles Reagan|title=Encyclopedia of Religion in the South|chapter=Native American Religions Pre-Contact Period|last=Hornerkamp|first=Nicholas|pages=542–545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories and names==
Much of what is called a "complex" was more of an "exchange network." This kind of network may be illustrated by a pair of [[shell gorget]]s whose representation is so similar as to suggest that they were made by the same artist. One is found in southeast [[Missouri]] and the other in [[Spiro Mounds]] in [[Oklahoma]]. Numerous other pairs of extremely similar gorgets serve to link sites across the entire Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/~anthro/muller/SECC/sld008.htm |title=Connections |author=Muller |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914003946/http://www.siu.edu/~anthro/muller/SECC/sld008.htm |archivedate=2006-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The social organization of the Mississippian culture was based on [[warfare]], which was represented by an array of motifs and symbols in articles made from costly raw materials, such as [[conch]]es from [[Florida]], [[copper]] from the [[Great Lakes]] area and Appalachian Mountains, [[lead]] from northern [[Illinois]] and [[Iowa]], pottery from [[Tennessee]], and stone tools sourced from [[Kansas]], [[Texas]], and [[Mill Creek chert|southern Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeologicals4/a/spiro.htm|title=Spiro Mounds-A Ceremonial Center of the Southern Cult| accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such objects occur in [[Birdman burial|elite burial]]s, together with war [[axe]]s, [[Mace (bludgeon)|maces]], and other weapons. These warrior symbols occur alongside other artifacts, which bear cosmic imagery depicting animals, humans, and mythic beasts. This symbolic imagery bound together warfare, [[cosmology]], and nobility into a coherent whole. Some of these categories of artifacts were used as markers of chiefly office, which varied from one location to another. The term Southeast Ceremonial Complex refers to a complex, highly variable set of religious mechanisms that supported the authority of local [[tribal chief|chiefs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~coupland/ANT310/lectures/woodlnd3.htm|title=The Late Woodland Period| accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''S.E.C.C.'' was first defined in 1945 by the archaeologists [[Antonio J. Waring, Jr.|Antonio Waring]] and [[Preston Holder]] as a series of four lists of traits, which they categorized as the ''Southeastern (centered) Ceremonial Complex''. Their concept was of a complex of a specific cult manifestation that originated with [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean speakers]] in the southern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  editor= Williams, S.|author =Waring, A.J. Jr.|  title=The Waring Papers: The Collected Work of Antonio J. Waring | article = The Southeastern Cult and Muskogean Ceremonial | publisher = Harvard University| year = 1968 | pages = 30–69 | authorlink = Antonio J. Waring, Jr. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=American Anthropologist|author =Waring, A.J. Jr.|  title=A prehistoric ceremonial complex in the Southeastern United States|volume=47|issue=1|pages =1|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1945.47.1.02a00020/pdf|year = 1945 |authorlink = Antonio J. Waring, Jr.|doi=10.1525/aa.1945.47.1.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then scholars have expanded the original definition, while using its trait lists as a foundation for critical analysis of the entire concept.

In 1989 scholars proposed a more archaeologically based definition for the Mississippian artistic tradition. [[Jon Muller]] of [[Southern Illinois University]] proposes the classification of the complex into five [[Archaeological horizon|horizons]], with each as a discrete tradition defined by the origin of specific motifs and ritual objects, and the specific developments in long-distance exchange and political structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Galloway, Patricia|author =Muller, Jon|  title=The Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, Artifacts and Analysis:The Cottonlandia Conference| article = The Southern Cult | publisher = University of Nebraska Press| year = 1989 | pages = 11–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
With the redefinition of the complex, some scholars have suggested choosing a new name to exemplify the new understanding of the large body of art symbols classified as the S.E.C.C. Participants of a decade-long series of conferences held at [[Texas State University]] have proposed the terms ''"Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere"'' or ''"M.I.I.S."'' and ''"Mississippian Art and Ceremonial Complex"'' or ''"M.A.C.C."''  Present theories suggest that the complex developed from pre-existing beliefs spread over the midwest and southeast by the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell Interaction Sphere]] from 100 BCE to 500 CE.&lt;ref name="Townsend 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press"&gt;{{cite book |  editors = F. Kent Reilly and James Garber  |  title = [[Ancient Objects and Sacred Realms]] | publisher = [[University of Texas Press]] | year = 2007 | pages = 29–34 |  isbn = 978-0-292-71347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major expression of the complex developed at the [[Cahokia]] site and is known as the Braden Style; it corresponds with the Southern Cult Period horizon defined by Muller. Other regional styles developed as a result of the fusion of ideas borrowed from the Braden Style and pre-existing local expressions of post-Hopewellian traditions.&lt;ref name="Townsend 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press"/&gt;

As the major centers, such as Cahokia, collapsed and the trade networks broke down, the regional styles diverged more from the ''Braden Style'' and from each other. During the ensuing centuries, the local traditions diverged into the religious beliefs and cosmologies of the different historic tribes known to exist at the time of European contact.

==Cosmology==
[[File:S.E.C.C. world tree HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|The Cedar Tree Axis Mundi]]
[[File:S.E.C.C. striped pole and Hero Twins HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The Striped Pole Axis Mundi]]
Most S.E.C.C. imagery focuses on [[cosmology]] and the supernatural beings who inhabit the cosmos. The cosmological map encompassed real, knowable locations, whether in this world or the supernatural reality of the Otherworld. S.E.C.C. iconography portrayed the cosmos in three levels. The Above World or Overworld, was the home of the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderers]], the Sun, Moon, and Morning Star or [[Red Horn (legend)|Red Horn]] / ''"He Who Wears Human Heads For Earrings"'' and represented Order and Stability. The Middle World was the Earth that humans live in. The Beneath World or Under World was a cold, dark place of Chaos that was home to the [[underwater panther|Underwater Panther]] and Corn Mother or "Old Woman Who Never Dies".

These three worlds were connected by an ''[[axis mundi]]'', usually portrayed as a [[Eastern red cedar|cedar]] tree or a striped pole reaching from the Under World to the Over World.  Each of the three levels also was believed to have its own sub-levels.  Deeply ingrained in the world view was the concept of [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]] and opposition.  The beings of the Upper and Under realms were in constant opposition to each other.  Ritual and ceremony were the means by which these powerful forces could be accessed and harnessed.&lt;ref name="Townsend 2004"/&gt;

===Motifs===
Many common motifs in S.E.C.C. artwork are locative symbols that help determine where the action takes place and where the beings originated.

|| The Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif is often seen in the headdresses of the warriors/birdmen/chunkey players. A complex symbol, it is a graphic representation of a bow and arrow, an ''[[atlatl]]'', or possibly a ''[[ceremonial pipe]]''. In the [[Red Horn (man)|Red Horn]] Cycle, Red Horn is also called "He who gets hit with deer lungs", which may be a euphemism or an allusion to the fact that deer lungs with the trachea attached, resemble the graphic depiction of the Bi-Lobed Arrow. It may symbolize kinship and adoption rituals related to social hierarchies. Examples in the form of [[Mississippian copper plates]] have been found in many Mississippian culture sites.

|| The Hand and Eye Motif is a human hand with an eye gazing out from the palm, yet another symbol of deity. It was one of the most common motifs in Mississippian symbolism and may be related to the Ogee Motif, suggesting it represents a portal to the Otherworld.
|-
| Mace Motif
||[[File:Motif S.E.C.C. mace HRoe 2008.jpg|50px|Mace Motif]]
|| The Mace Motif usually is associated with the warrior image and may be combined with other motifs, especially the Cross in Circle Motif. It is a graphic representation of a war club or [[ceremonial mace]], such as the chipped flint and ground stone versions found throughout the southeast.
|-
| Columnella Pendant Motif
||[[File:Motif S.E.C.C. columnella pendant HRoe 2008.jpg|50px|Columnella Pendant Motif]]

===Birdman===
[[File:Chromesun mississippian priest digital painting.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a warrior holding a ceremonial flint mace or war club and a severed head]]
The [[Peregrine falcon|falcon]] is one of the most conspicuous symbols of the S.E.C.C. It was simultaneously an [[avatar]] of warriors and an object of supplication for a lengthy life, healthy family, and a long line of descendants.  Its supernatural origin is placed in the Upper World with a pantheon including the Sun, Moon, and Four Stars.  He is most often represented on precious materials, sometimes shell, most often on beaten copper. He dances, costumed with great ground-sweeping wings and a raptor-beaked mask. In his raised right hand he holds a club,  prepared to strike. In his left he holds rattles fashioned from human skulls.

At [[Cahokia]], the falcon imagery was elaborated in figural expression. It is associated with warfare, high-stakes gaming, and possibly family dynastic ambitions, symbolized by arrow flights and the rising of the pre-dawn [[Venus#Venus in human culture|morning star]] as metaphors for the succession of descendants into the future.  Raptor imagery gained prominence during the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell period]], but attained its peak in the Braden Style of the early Mississippian period. It survived afterward in the [[Red Horn(man)|Red Horn]] mythological cycle and native religion of the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebagos), [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Ioway]], and other plains [[Siouan]] peoples. In the Braden Style, the Birdman is divided into four categories.

====Red Horn and his sons====
The [[Red Horn (legend)|Red Horn]] Mythic Cycle is from the [[Ho Chunk]], or Winnebago people. The mythic cycle of Red Horn and his sons has certain analogies with the [[Maya Hero Twins|Hero Twins]] mythic cycle of [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  last = Power | first = Susan |  title = [[Early Art of the Southeastern Indians-Feathered Serpents and Winged Beings]] | publisher = [[University of Georgia Press]] | year = 2004 |  isbn = 0-8203-2501-5 | page = 158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redhorn was known by many names, including "[[Venus#Venus in human culture|Morning Star]]", a reference to his celestial origin, and ''"He who is Struck with Deer Lungs,"'' a possible reference to the Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif. In the episode associated with this name, Red Horn turns into an arrow to win a race. After winning the race, Redhorn creates heads on his earlobes and makes his hair into a long red braid.  Thus he becomes known as ''"Redhorn"'' and as ''"He who has Human Heads as Earlobes"''.

In another episode, Redhorn and his friends are challenged by the Giants to play [[History of lacrosse|ball]] (or possibly chunkey)&lt;ref name="Pauketat 2004"&gt;{{cite book |  last = Pauketat | first = Timothy R.|  title = [[Ancient Cahokia and the Mississippians]]| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2004 |  isbn = 0-521-52066-5 |  authorlink = Timothy Pauketat}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their lives staked on the outcome.  The best Giant player was a woman with long red hair identical to Redhorn's.  The little heads on Redhorn's ears caused her to laugh so much that it interfered with her game and the Giants lost.&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press"/&gt; The Giants lost all the other contests as well. Then they challenged Redhorn and his friends to a wrestling match in which they threw all but Red Horn's friend Turtle. Since Redhorn and his fellow spirits lost two out of the three matches, they were all slain.  The two wives of Redhorn were pregnant at the time of his death.  The sons born to each have red hair, with the older one having heads where his earlobes should be, and the younger one having heads in place of his nipples.  The older brother discovers where the Giants keep the heads of Redhorn and his friends.  The two boys use their powers to steal the heads from the Giants, whom they wipe out almost completely.  The boys bring back to life Redhorn, Storms as He Walks, and Turtle. In honor of this feat, Turtle and "Storms as He Walks" promise the boys special weapons.

In another episode, the sons of Redhorn decide to go on the warpath. The older brother asks "Storms as He Walks" for the Thunderbird War bundle. After some effort, it is produced, but the Thunderbirds demand that it have a case. A friend of the sons of Redhorn offers his own body as its case. The boys take the Thunderbird War bundle and with their followers go on a raid to the other side of the sky.&lt;ref name="The Red Horn Cycle"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hotcakencyclopedia.com/ho.RedhornCycle.html|title=The Red Horn Cycle| accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many S.E.C.C. images seem to be of Red Horn, his companions, and his sons. The characters in the myth seem to be tied integrally to the [[ceremonial pipe|pipe]] ceremony, and its association with kinship and adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3904/is_200004/ai_n8897879/pg_7?tag=artBody;col1|title=Of Masks and Myths| accessdate=2008-09-13 |last= Duncan|first=James R|author2=Diaz-Granados, Carol |work=Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif may be a graphic depiction of the calumet.&lt;ref name="The Red Horn Cycle"/&gt; Other images found in S.E.C.C. art show figures with [[long-nosed god maskette]]s on their ears and in place of their nipples.&lt;ref name="Townsend 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauketat 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/marina/caribbean/244/oraltrad.html |title=Archaeology, Ethnicity, and Oral Tradition-Chapter 6 |year=1994 |first=John P. |last=Staeck |accessdate=2008-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726132211/http://www.fortunecity.com/marina/caribbean/244/oraltrad.html |archivedate=2009-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Serpent===
The [[Horned Serpent|Great Serpent]] (or Horned Serpent) is the most well-known mythological figure from the S.E.C.C. Its roots go back to Hopewell times, if not earlier. It usually is described as horned and winged, although the wings are more an indicator of its celestial origin than an essential form of the creature.  In some versions of [[Shawnee]] myths, the serpent is described as a multi-headed monster with one green and one red horn, horns being a manifestation or marker of its power.  In other myths, it is described as a one-eyed buffalo with one green and one red horn.  The [[Piasa]] figure of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]] was painted on a bluff near present-day [[Alton, Illinois]].  It was described as having the body of a panther, four legs, a human head, an impossibly long tail and horns.

''Mishibizhiw'', the [[Ojibwa]] [[underwater panther]], was a combination of [[rattlesnake]], [[cougar]], [[deer]], and [[hawk]]. Other native peoples also gave descriptions of the being, sometimes now referred to as the ''Spirit Otter'', with the majority seeming to belong to one of two extremes, and a multitude in between.&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press"/&gt;

The Great Serpents, the great denizens of the Underworld, were described as powerful beings who were in constant antagonism with the forces of the Upper World, usually represented by the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderer]]s (Birdmen or Falcon beings).&lt;ref name="Townsend 2004"/&gt; Although men were to be careful of these beings, they could also be the source of great power. A Shawnee myth tells of the capture and dismemberment of ''Msi Kinepikwa''. The pieces were distributed to the five ''[[sept]]s'' of the tribe, who kept them in their sacred "medicine bundles".&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/southbeach/cove/8286/myth1.html| title=Shawnee Mythology|accessdate = 2013-09-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027090132/http://www.geocities.com/southbeach/cove/8286/myth1.html|archivedate=2009-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artifacts with S.E.C.C. imagery==
S.E.C.C. motifs have been found on a variety of non-perishable materials, including [[Shell gorget|shell]], [[Mississippian culture pottery|pottery]], [[Mississippian stone statuary|carved stone]], and copper ([[Wulfing cache]] and [[Etowah plates]]). Undoubtedly many other materials also were used, but haven't survived the intervening centuries. It may be judged by looking at the remaining artifacts that S.E.C.C. practitioners worked with feathers and designs woven into cloth, practiced body painting, and possibly [[tattoo]]ing, as well as having pierced ears. One surviving painting found on a baked clay floor at the [[Wickliffe Mounds]] site suggests they also painted designs in and on their dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://users.stlcc.edu/mfuller/Wickliffe.html| title=The Wickliffe Mounds Site|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings displaying S.E.C.C. imagery also have been found in caves, most notably [[Dunbar Cave State Park|Mud Glyph Cave]] in Tennessee. Animal images, serpents, and warrior figures occur, as well as winged warriors, horned snakes, stylized birds, maces, and arrows. Their location underneath the Earth probably reflect aspects of Mississippian myth and cosmology concerning the (perhaps sacred) precincts beneath the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3904/is_200110/ai_n8962063/pg_7|title=Issues in the study of southeastern prehistoric cave art | work=Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Standard manuscript format''' is a formatting style for manuscripts of short stories, novels, poems and other literary works. Even with the advent of [[desktop publishing]], making it possible for anyone to prepare text that appears professionally [[typesetting|typeset]], many publishers still require authors to submit manuscripts within their respective guidelines. Although there is no single set of guidelines, the "standard" format describes formatting that is considered to be generally acceptable.&lt;ref name="Shunn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shunn|first1=William|title=Proper Manuscript Format|journal= Writers Write: The Internet Writing Journal|date=December 1998|url=http://www.shunn.net/format/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although publishers guidelines for formatting are the most critical resource for authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Formatting and Submitting your Manuscript|edition= 3rd|last1= Sambuchino|first1= Chuck |last2= The Editors of Writer's Digest Books|year= 2009|publisher= Writer's Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, OH|isbn= 978-1-58297-571-9|pages=5, 10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[style guide]]s are also key references for authors preparing manuscripts since "virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Punctuation: A Handy Reference to Resolve All Your Grammatical Problems|last= Stevenson|first=Jay|year=2005|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=978-1-59257-393-6|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscript formatting depends greatly on the type of work that is being written, as well as the individual publisher, editor or producer. Writers who intend to submit a manuscript should determine what the relevant writing standards are, and follow them. Individual publishers' standards will take precedence over [[style guide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Formatting and Submitting your Manuscript|edition= 3rd|last1= Sambuchino|first1= Chuck |last2= The Editors of Writer's Digest Books|year= 2009|publisher= Writer's Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, OH|isbn= 978-1-58297-571-9|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
In general, a document with standard manuscript format will have the following features:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sfwa.org/2008/11/manuscript-preparation/|title = Manuscript Preparation|date = 2008-11-07|last = McIntyre|first = Vonda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Splane&gt;{{cite book|last1=Splane|first1=Lily|title=The Book Book: A Complete Guide to Creating a Book on Your Computer|date=2002|page=31|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TSCFzLxu-58C&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=www.aw-bc.com&gt;{{cite book|last1=Addison-Wesley/Benjamin Cummings publishing team|title=Author guidelines|publisher=Addison-Wesley or Benjamin Cummings|url=http://www.aw-bc.com/publishing/authorguidelines/|chapter=Chapter 6: Preparing the Text Manuscript|chapter-url=http://www.aw-bc.com/publishing/authorguidelines/Ch06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Letter (paper size)|8.5"×11"]] or [[A4 (paper size)|A4]] paper size.
* [[Courier (font)|Courier]] or a similar [[Monospaced font|monospaced]] [[serif]] font.
* 12-[[Point (typography)|point]] (10 [[Pitch (typewriter)|{{abbr|pitch|characters and spaces per inch of running text}}]]) or 10-point (12 pitch) font size.
* [[Leading|Double-spaced]] lines of text (set in a [[word processor]] as 24-point or 20-point line spacing).
* 24 or 25 lines of text.
* 1, 1.25 or 1.5 inch margins.
* Paragraph indentation of 0.5 inches.
* Printed one-sided with black ink.
On the first page of the document, the author's name and contact information appears in the top left corner. In the top right corner of the first page, the wordcount appears.&lt;ref name="Shunn" /&gt;

Subsequent pages only have text in the top right corner. This text includes: the author's name, a slash, an abbreviated title, another slash, and the page number.&lt;ref name="Shunn" /&gt;

Writers can add the [[word count]] of the manuscript, although this may also be noted on a [[query letter]]. Most publishers pay writers based on a hypothetical number of words in the manuscript. However, this is not the physical count of actual words; this is a rough count of the number of characters divided to better estimate the space that the final text will consume in the published version. Normally, this involves counting every character in the manuscript, including spaces, and dividing by 6. If the correct font size is used, and if the [[Margin (typography)|margins]] are set so that lines contain an average of 60 characters, the editor can easily assume that there are 10 words per line. Furthermore, if the top and bottom margins are set so that there are, for example, 20 lines on each page, the editor can easily count 250 words per page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.davidfarland.net/writing_tips/?a=230|title = The Importance of Standard Manuscript Format|date = 2013-06-18|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Splane/&gt;&lt;ref name=www.aw-bc.com/&gt;

==Manuscript handling==
The final reason involves how editors, copy editors, and typesetters handle manuscripts. They might work on an entire manuscript at one time or the editor might hand groups of pages to the typesetter at a time. Unstapled pages facilitate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://homeschoolmagazinereviews.com/en/dissertation-writing-process|title = Dissertation Writing Process|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page numbers, author's name, and title on every page ensure that if an unstapled manuscript is shuffled on a table, shared among two or more people, or dropped, it can easily be reassembled, and if a stack of unstapled manuscripts is dropped, it can easily be sorted into the correct sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/the-basics-standard-manuscript-format-and-mailing/|title = The Basics of Manuscript Format and Mailing|date = 2010-03-27|accessdate = 2015-02-09|website = Brad R. Torgersen|publisher = |last = Torgersen|first = Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Exhibition Suiseki and Shangshi Prague 2011 2257.jpg|thumb|Suiseki and its wooden base at "Exhibition Suiseki and Shangshi" in Prague, 2011]]

{{nihongo|'''Suiseki'''|水石}} are small naturally occurring or shaped [[rock (geology)|rocks]] which are traditionally appreciated.  They are similar to [[Chinese scholar's rocks]].&lt;ref name="cousins244"&gt;Cousins, Craig. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=7w-arIGpmfEC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=  ''Bonsai Master Class,'' p. 244].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chinese scholar's rocks influenced the development of ''suiseki'' in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Brokaw, Charles. (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=T51TNiU9460C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=  ''The Temple Mount Code,'' p. 73].&lt;/ref&gt;  The history of ''suiseki'' in Japan begins during the reign of [[Empress Suiko]].  The small objects were brought to Japan as gifts from the Chinese Imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;Corvello, Vincent T. and Yūji Yoshimura. (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=o-87ZrlXIzAC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq= ''The Japanese Art of Stone Appreciation: Suiseki and Its Use With Bonsai,'' p. 17].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Suiseki'' are usually presented in two different ways:

*The stone is provided with a wooden base (Daiza).
*The stone is placed in a waterproof tray or bowl of ceramic (suiban) or bronze (Doban).

These stones are not just any stones which can be found in nature; they must be expressive stones and have a special shape, color and texture to be categorized as ''suiseki''. There is a distinction between landscape and object stones. The former reflect landscapes such as mountains, lakes or rivers, while other stones have object shapes that resemble animals or sculptures.

The stones are of natural origin and are found in rivers, oceans and karst areas. They are not allowed to be reshaped. An exception is the cutting of stones to have a flat base, so they can be placed stably on a Daiza, suiban or Doban, to be displayed properly. This diminishes their value, in the eyes of purists.

==Evaluation==
The evaluation of ''suiseki'' recognizes subtlety of color, shape, markings and surface.  According to {{nihongo|Hideo Marushima|丸島秀夫|Marushima Hideo|1934-&amp;nbsp;}} in {{nihongo| ''The History of Suiseki in Japan''|日本愛石史|Nihon aisekishi|}},
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not a silly thing at all to enjoy a stone in a tray. I see the whole world in a tiny stone. Some objects in this world are huge, and others are small, and they come in all shapes, but they are not that different when you look at their essence.&lt;ref&gt;Rivera, Felix G. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vgr2MAYajMIC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=  ''Suiseki: The Japanese Art of Miniature Landscape Stones,'' p. 40], citing {{nihongo|''The History of Suiseki in Japan''|日本愛石史|Nihon aisekishi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Popular types of ''suiseki'' suggest a mountain, a waterfall, an island, a thatched hut or an animal.&lt;ref name="cousins244"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3188">The '''Symphony No. 3 in C minor''' is a [[symphony]] for orchestra by the American composer [[Florence Price]].  The work was commissioned by the [[Works Progress Administration]]'s [[Federal Music Project]] during the height of the [[Great Depression]].  It was first performed at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] on November 6, 1940, by the Detroit Civic Orchestra under the conductor Valter Poole.  The composition is Price's third symphony, following her [[Symphony No. 1 (Price)|Symphony in E minor]]—the first symphony by a black woman to be performed by a major American orchestra—and her lost Symphony No. 2.&lt;ref name="Symphony nos. 1 and 3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Price |first=Florence |author-link=Florence Price |date=January 1, 2008 |orig-year=1932 |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=Rae Linda |editor2-last=Shirley |editor2-first=Wayne D. |title=Symphonies nos. 1 and 3 |publisher=A-R Editions |pages=xlvi-lii |isbn=0895796384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oteri |first=Frank J. |title=Sounds Heard: Florence B.

==Composition==
The symphony has a duration of roughly 30 minutes and is composed in four [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Andante
#Andante ma non troppo
#Juba: Allegro
#Scherzo: Finale

Price started writing the symphony in the summer of 1938, but later revised the work prior to its 1940 premiere.&lt;ref name="Symphony nos. 1 and 3" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for an orchestra comprising [[piccolo]], three [[Western concert flute|flutes]], two [[oboe]]s, [[Cor anglais|English horn]], two [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[timpani]], percussion, and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Symphony nos. 1 and 3" /&gt;

==Reception==
Contemporary reception for the symphony was positive.  Reviewing the 1940 world premiere, J. D. Callaghan of the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' wrote:{{quote|Mrs. Price, both in the [piano] concerto and in the symphony, spoke in the musical idiom of her own people, and spoke with authority.  There was inherent in both works all the emotional warmth of the American Negro, so that the evening became one of profound melody satisfaction.

In the symphony there was a slow movement of majestic beauty, a third in which the rhythmic preference of the Negro found scope in a series of dance forms, and a finale which swept forward with great vigor.&lt;ref name="Symphony nos. 1 and 3" /&gt;}}

==Plot==
''The Boy Who Grew Flowers'' follows the character of Rink Bowagon, a little boy disliked among his peers that has the ability to sprout flowers on his body on full moons. This changes one day when a new girl named Angelina starts attending his class, causing Rink to become enamored of her. Rink has no way of knowing that like him, Angelina also has something special about her that he will eventually discover during the school's full moon dance.

==Reception==
Critical response to the book was positive. Reviewers for the [[School Library Journal]] called it "A lovely story about celebrating differences." In addition, the School Library Journal praised the "luminous scenes and soulful relationship between Rink and Angelina".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6704257.html?&amp;rid= Flower Power] School Library Journal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6304308.html Preschool to Grade 4] School Library Journal&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Stage]] wrote that the book's message might be "a little sophisticated and hidden away for the lower end of the target age group." However, The Stage liked that the book expressed "the mother’s dialogue solely in musical phrases and the giant school satchel which Rink uses to hide his blushes - and his petunias."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/18636/the-boy-who-grew-flowers The Boy Who Grew Flowers] The Stage&lt;/ref&gt; [[Booklist]] praised the book, calling it an "odd, lovely offering".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.booklistonline.com/The-Boy-Who-Grew-Flowers-Steve-Adams/pid=1505059 Booklist review: The Boy Who Grew Flowers] Booklist&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly]] positively reviewed the book, citing "If the narrative doesn't follow through on its early promise of helping young readers understand the beauty of being different, it will remind them of the power of kindness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84148-686-4 Children's review: The Boy Who Grew Flowers] Publishers Weekly&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wired News]] praised the book's artwork while saying that "the fantasy on which the story is based prevents, I think, most little kids from realizing the message is there, even while they absorb it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/07/the-geekly-re-1-3/ The Geekly Reader: The Boy Who Grew Flowers by Jen Wojtowicz (art by Steve Adams)] Wired News&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Short description|Choral work by Edward Elgar about the journey of a soul}}
'''''The Dream of Gerontius''''', [[Opus number|Op]]. 38, is a work for voices and orchestra in two parts composed by [[Edward Elgar]] in 1900, to text from [[The Dream of Gerontius (poem)|the poem]] by [[John Henry Newman]]. It relates the journey of a pious man's soul from his deathbed to his judgment before God and settling into [[Purgatory]]. Elgar disapproved of the use of the term "[[oratorio]]" for the work (and the term occurs nowhere in the score), though his wishes are not always followed. The piece is widely regarded as Elgar's finest choral work, and some consider it his masterpiece.

The work was composed for the [[Birmingham Triennial Music Festival|Birmingham Music Festival]] of 1900; the first performance took place on 3 October 1900, in [[Birmingham Town Hall]]. It was badly performed at the premiere, but later performances in Germany revealed its stature. In the first decade after its premiere, the [[Roman Catholic]] dogma in Newman's poem caused difficulties in getting the work performed in [[Anglican]] cathedrals, and a revised text was used for performances at the [[Three Choirs Festival]] until 1910.

==History==
[[File:Edward Elgar.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Elgar, around the time of composition]]
Elgar was not the first composer to think about setting [[John Henry Newman]]'s poem "[[The Dream of Gerontius (poem)|The Dream of Gerontius]]". [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]] had considered it fifteen years earlier, and had discussions with Newman, before abandoning the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar knew the poem well; he had owned a copy since at least 1885, and in 1889 he was given another copy as a wedding present. This copy contained handwritten copies of extensive notes that had been made by [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]], and Elgar is known to have thought of the text in musical terms for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1890s, Elgar had composed several large-scale works for the regular festivals that were a key part of Britain's musical life. In 1898, based on his growing reputation, he was asked to write a major work for the 1900 [[Birmingham Triennial Music Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; He was unable to start work on the poem that he knew so well until the autumn of 1899, and did so only after first considering a different subject.&lt;ref name=m296&gt;Moore, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HansRichter1876.png|left|thumb|upright|Hans Richter conducted the premiere]]
Composition proceeded quickly. Elgar and [[August Jaeger]], his editor at the publisher [[Novello &amp; Co|Novello]], exchanged frequent, sometimes daily, letters,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, pp. 302–316&lt;/ref&gt; which show how Jaeger helped in shaping the work, and in particular the climactic depiction of the moment of judgment.&lt;ref name=m322&gt;Moore, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Elgar had completed the work and Novello had printed it, there were only three months to the premiere. The Birmingham chorus, all amateurs, struggled to master Elgar's complex, demanding and somewhat revolutionary work. Matters were made worse by the sudden death of the chorus master [[Charles Swinnerton Heap]] and his replacement by [[William Stockley (musician)|William Stockley]], an elderly musician who found the music beyond him.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; The conductor of the premiere, [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]], received a copy of the full score only on the eve of the first orchestral rehearsal.&lt;ref name=mt/&gt; The soloists at the Birmingham Festival on 3 October 1900 were [[Marie Brema]], [[Edward Lloyd (tenor)|Edward Lloyd]] and [[Harry Plunket Greene]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; The first performance was, famously, a near disaster. The choir could not sing the music adequately, and two of the three soloists were in poor voice.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar was deeply upset at the debacle, telling Jaeger, "I have allowed my heart to open once – it is now shut against every religious feeling &amp; every soft, gentle impulse for ever."&lt;ref name=gram/&gt; However, many of the critics could see past the imperfect realisation and the work became established in Britain&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; once it had had its first London performance in 1903, at the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Westminster Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]], [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32988 "Elgar, Sir Edward William, baronet (1857–1934)".] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 22 April 2010 {{subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the premiere, the German conductor and chorus master [[Julius Buths]] made a German translation of the text and arranged a successful performance in [[Düsseldorf]] on 19&amp;nbsp;December 1901. Elgar was present, and he wrote "It completely bore out my idea of the work: the chorus was very fine".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; Buths presented it in Düsseldorf again on 19 May 1902 in conjunction with the [[Lower Rhenish Music Festival]].&lt;ref name=reed61&gt;Reed, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The soloists included [[Muriel Foster]], and Elgar was again in the audience, being called to the stage twenty times to receive the audience's applause.&lt;ref name=m368/&gt; This was the performance that finally convinced Elgar for the first time that he had written a truly satisfying work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/hooey/foster.htm |title=Elgar's Blessed Charmer – Muriel Foster |publisher=Music Web International |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buths's festival co-director [[Richard Strauss]] was impressed enough by what he heard that at a post-concert banquet he said: "I drink to the success and welfare of the first English progressive musician, Meister Elgar".&lt;ref name=reed61/&gt; This greatly pleased Elgar,&lt;ref name=m368&gt;Moore, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; who considered Strauss to be "the greatest genius of the age".&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to ''Salome'', Decca Records, 2006, oclc 70277106&lt;/ref&gt;

The strong Roman Catholicism of the work gave rise to objections in some influential British quarters; some [[Church of England|Anglican]] clerics insisted that for performances in English cathedrals Elgar should modify the text to tone down the Roman Catholic references. There was no Anglican objection to Newman's words in general: [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s setting of his "[[Lead, Kindly Light]]", for example, was sung at [[Westminster Abbey]] in 1904.&lt;ref name="The Times 1904, p. 13"&gt;''The Times'', 13 February 1904, p. 13{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; Disapproval was reserved for the doctrinal aspects of ''The Dream of Gerontius'' repugnant to Anglicans, such as Purgatory.&lt;ref&gt;"A Dean's Objections to ''The Dream of Gerontius''", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 17 November 1903. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar was unable to resist the suggested [[bowdlerization|bowdlerisation]], and in the ten years after the premiere the work was given at the [[Three Choirs Festival]] with an expurgated text.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 11 September 1903 and 13 September 1905{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]] refused admission to the work until 1910.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Charles Edward, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDRN-arhD2wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Elgar+Byron+Adams&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7SzBtX0G8Z&amp;sig=tjM_q_cSKP4XXoSNRbp5n7qV64E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=REHBTPTfH4yA4QaL2tmjDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAw#v=snippet&amp;q=Newman&amp;f=false "Measure of a Man"], in ''Edward Elgar and his World'', ed. Byron Adams, Princeton University Press, 2007 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Geraint, "A Cathedral in Sound", ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', September 2008, p. 50. The Gloucester performance in 1910 was described in ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' (5 September 1910, p. 7) as "given unmutilated for the first time in an Anglican cathedral".&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude lingered until the 1930s, when the Dean of [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]] banned the work from the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;"Cathedral Ban on 'Gerontius'," ''The Manchester Guardian'', 19 October 1932, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar was also faced with many people's assumption that he would use the standard hymn tunes for the sections of the poem that had already been absorbed into Anglican hymn books: "Firmly I believe and truly", and "Praise to the Holiest in the Height".&lt;ref name="The Times 1904, p. 13"/&gt;

[[File:Gerontius-singers.jpg|thumb|right|Notable ''Gerontius'' soloists, [[Edward Lloyd (tenor)|Edward Lloyd]] and [[Marie Brema]], (top); [[Gervase Elwes]] and [[Elena Gerhardt]], (below)]]
''The Dream of Gerontius'' received its US premiere on 23 March 1903 at The Auditorium, Chicago, conducted by Harrison M. Wild. It was given in New York, conducted by [[Walter Damrosch]] three days later.&lt;ref name=hod&gt;Hodgkins, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed in Sydney, in 1903.&lt;ref name=hod/&gt; The first performance in Vienna was in 1905;&lt;ref&gt;McColl, Sandra, "Gerontius in the City of Dreams: Newman, Elgar, and the Viennese Critics", ''International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music'', Vol. 32, No. 1 (Jun. 2001), pp. 47–64&lt;/ref&gt; the Paris premiere was in 1906;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Musical Times]]'', April 1934, p. 318{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1911 the work received its Canadian premiere in [[Toronto]] under the baton of the composer.

In the first decades after its composition leading performers of the tenor part included [[Gervase Elwes]] and [[John Coates (tenor)|John Coates]], and [[Louise Kirkby Lunn]], [[Elena Gerhardt]] and [[Julia Culp]] were admired as the Angel. Later singers associated with the work include Muriel Foster, [[Clara Butt]], [[Kathleen Ferrier]], and [[Janet Baker]] as the Angel, and [[Heddle Nash]], [[Steuart Wilson]], [[Tudor Davies]] and [[Richard Lewis (tenor)|Richard Lewis]] as Gerontius.&lt;ref name=gram&gt;Farach Colton, Andrew, "Vision of the Hereafter", ''Gramophone'', February 2003, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has come to be generally regarded as Elgar's finest choral composition. The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' rates it as "one of his three or four finest works", and the authors of ''[[The Record Guide]]'', writing in 1956 when Elgar's music was comparatively neglected, said, "Anyone who doubts the fact of Elgar's genius should take the first opportunity of hearing ''The Dream of Gerontius'', which remains his masterpiece, as it is his largest and perhaps most deeply felt work."&lt;ref&gt;Sackville-West, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] writes, "[T]he work has become as popular with British choral societies as ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' and ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'', although its popularity overseas did not survive 1914. Many regard it as Elgar's masterpiece. ... It is unquestionably the greatest British work in the oratorio form, although Elgar was right in believing that it could not accurately be classified as oratorio or cantata."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:John Henry Newman by Sir John Everett Millais, 1st Bt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]], author of the poem set by Elgar]]
Newman's poem tells the story of a soul's journey through death, and provides a meditation on the unseen world of [[Roman Catholic]] theology. Gerontius (a name derived from the Greek word ''geron'', "old man") is a devout [[Everyman]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The name "Gerontius" is not sung in the work, and there is no consensus on how it is pronounced. The Greek "geron" has a hard 'g'; but English words derived from it often have a soft 'g', as in "geriatriac"&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar's setting uses most of the text of the first part of the poem, which takes place on Earth, but omits many of the more meditative sections of the much longer, otherworldly second part, tightening the narrative flow.&lt;ref name=m296/&gt;

In the first part, we hear Gerontius as a dying man of faith, by turns fearful and hopeful, but always confident. A group of friends (also called "assistants" in the text) joins him in prayer and meditation. He passes in peace, and a priest, with the assistants, sends him on his way with a valediction. In the second part, Gerontius, now referred to as "The Soul", awakes in a place apparently without space or time, and becomes aware of the presence of his [[Guardian angel (spirit)|guardian angel]], who expresses joy at the culmination of his task (Newman conceived the Angel as male; Elgar gives the part to a female singer, but retains the references to the angel as male). After a long dialogue, they journey towards the [[Throne#Thrones and the Bible|judgment throne]].

They safely pass a group of [[Demon#War in Heaven|demons]], and encounter choirs of angels, eternally praising God for His grace and forgiveness. The Angel of the [[Gethsemane|Agony]] pleads with Jesus to spare the souls of the faithful. Finally Gerontius glimpses God and is judged in a single moment. The Guardian Angel lowers Gerontius into the soothing lake of Purgatory, with a final benediction and promise of a re-awakening to glory.

==Music==
===Forces===
The work calls for a large orchestra of typical [[Romantic music#Instrumentation and scale|late Romantic]] proportions, double chorus with semichorus, and usually three soloists. Gerontius is sung by a [[tenor]], and the Angel is a [[mezzo-soprano]]. The Priest's part is written for a [[baritone]], while the Angel of the Agony is more suited to a [[bass (voice type)|bass]]; as both parts are short they are usually sung by the same performer, although some performances assign different singers for the two parts.

The choir plays several roles: attendants and friends, demons, Angelicals (women only) and Angels, and souls in Purgatory. They are employed at different times as a single chorus in four parts, or as a double chorus in eight parts or [[antiphonal]]ly. The semichorus is used for music of a lighter texture; usually in performance they are composed of a few members of the main chorus; however, Elgar himself preferred to have the semi-chorus placed near the front of the stage.

The required instrumentation comprises two [[flute]]s (II doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s and [[cor anglais]], two [[clarinet]]s in B{{music|flat}} and A and [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s and [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horn]]s, three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]] plus three [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] parts, [[harp]], [[organ (music)|organ]], and [[string orchestra|strings]]. Elgar called for an additional harp if possible, plus three additional trumpets (and any available percussionists) to reinforce the climax in Part II, just before Gerontius's vision of God.

===Form===
Each of the two parts is divided into distinct sections, but differs from the traditional oratorio in that the music continues without significant breaks. Elgar did not call the work an oratorio, and disapproved when other people used the term for it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e2086 "Dream of Gerontius, The",] ''Oxford Companion to Music'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 22 October 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part I is approximately 35 minutes long and Part II is approximately 60 minutes.

'''Part I:'''
# Prelude
# Jesu, Maria – I am near to death
# Rouse thee, my fainting soul
# Sanctus fortis, sanctus Deus
# Proficiscere, anima Christiana

'''Part II:'''
# I went to sleep
# It is a member of that family
# But hark! upon my sense comes a fierce hubbub
# I see not those false spirits
# But hark! a grand mysterious harmony
# Thy judgment now is near
# I go before my judge
# Softly and gently, dearly-ransomed soul

====Part I====
The work begins with an orchestral prelude, which presents the most important [[motif (music)|motifs]]. In a detailed analysis, Elgar's friend and editor [[August Jaeger]] identified and named these themes, in line with their functions in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger's analysis is summarised at Burton, James [http://www.choirs.org.uk/prognotes/Elgar%20Gerontius.htm "The Dream of Gerontius], British Choirs on the Net, accessed 22 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerontius sings a prayer, knowing that life is leaving him and giving voice to his fear, and asks for his friends to pray with him. For much of the soloist's music, Elgar writes in a style that switches between exactly [[musical notation|notated]], fully accompanied [[recitative]], and [[arioso]] phrases, lightly accompanied. The chorus adds devotional texts in four-part [[fugue|fugal]] writing. Gerontius's next utterance is a full-blown aria ''Sanctus fortis'', a long ''[[creed|credo]]'' that eventually returns to expressions of pain and fear. Again, in a mixture of conventional chorus and recitative, the friends intercede for him. Gerontius, at peace, submits, and the priest recites the blessing "Go forth upon thy journey, Christian soul!" (a translation of the [[litany]] ''Ordo Commendationis Animae''). This leads to a long chorus for the combined forces, ending Part I.&lt;ref name=notes&gt;Grove; Jenkins, Lyndon (1987), notes to EMI CD CMS 7 63185 2; and [[Jerrold Northrop Moore|Moore, Jerrold Northrop]] (1975), notes to Testament CD SBT 2025&lt;/ref&gt;

====Part II====
In a complete change of mood, Part II begins with a simple four-note phrase for the [[viola]]s which introduces a gentle, rocking theme for the strings. This section is in triple time, as is much of the second part. The Soul's music expresses wonder at its new surroundings, and when the Angel is heard, he expresses quiet exultation at the climax of his task. They converse in an extended duet, again combining recitative with pure sung sections. Increasingly busy music heralds the appearance of the demons: [[fallen angel]]s who express intense disdain of men, mere mortals by whom they were supplanted. Initially the men of the chorus sing short phrases in close harmony, but as their rage grows more intense the music shifts to a busy [[fugue]], punctuated by shouts of derisive laughter.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

Gerontius cannot see the demons, and asks if he will soon see his God. In a barely accompanied recitative that recalls the very opening of the work, the Angel warns him that the experience will be almost unbearable, and in veiled terms describes the [[stigmata]] of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]]. Angels can be heard, offering praises over and over again. The intensity gradually grows, and eventually the full chorus gives voice to a setting of the section that begins with ''Praise to the Holiest in the Height''. After a brief orchestral passage, the Soul hears echoes from the friends he left behind on earth, still praying for him. He encounters the Angel of the Agony, whose intercession is set as an impassioned aria for bass. The Soul's Angel, knowing the long-awaited moment has come, sings an Alleluia.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

The Soul now goes before God and, in a huge orchestral outburst, is judged in an instant. At this point in the score, Elgar instructs "for one moment, must every instrument exert its fullest force." This was not originally in Elgar's design, but was inserted at the insistence of Jaeger, and remains as a testament to the positive musical influence of his critical friendship with Elgar. In an anguished aria, the Soul then pleads to be taken away. A chorus of souls sings the first lines of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 90 ("Lord, thou hast been our refuge") and, at last, Gerontius joins them in [[Purgatory]]. The final section combines the Angel, chorus, and semichorus in a prolonged song of farewell, and the work ends with overlapping Amens.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

===Dedication and superscription===
Elgar dedicated his work "A.M.D.G." (''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]'', "To the greater glory of God", the motto of the [[Society of Jesus]] or ''Jesuits''), following the practice of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who would dedicate his works "S.D.G." (''[[Soli Deo gloria]]'', "Glory to God alone").&lt;ref name=m317&gt;Moore, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Underneath this he wrote a line from [[Virgil]]: "Quae lucis miseris tam dira cupido?" together with [[John Florio|Florio]]'s English translation of [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]'s adaptation of Virgil's line: "Whence so dyre desire of Light on wretches grow?"&lt;ref name=m317/&gt;

At the end of the manuscript score, Elgar wrote this quotation from [[John Ruskin]]'s ''Sesame and Lilies'':
:This is the best of me; for the rest, I ate, and drank, and slept, loved and hated, like another: my life was as the vapour and is not; but ''this'' I saw and knew; this, if anything of mine, is worth your memory.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;McVeagh, Diana. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08709 "Elgar, Sir Edward."] Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Accessed 21 October 2010. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richter signed the autograph copy of the score with the inscription: "Let drop the Chorus, let drop everybody—but let ''not'' drop the wings of your original genius."&lt;ref name=mt&gt;''[[The Musical Times]]'', 1 November 1900, p. 734{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
{{Main|The Dream of Gerontius discography}}
[[Henry Wood]] made [[acoustic recording]]s of four extracts from ''The Dream of Gerontius'' as early as 1916, with [[Clara Butt]] as the Angel.&lt;ref name=gram/&gt; Edison Bell issued the work in 1924 with Elgar's tacit approval (despite his contract with HMV); acoustically recorded and abridged, it was swiftly rendered obsolete by the introduction of the electrical process, and soon after withdrawn. [[HMV]] issued live recorded excerpts from two public performances conducted by Elgar in 1927, with the soloists [[Margaret Balfour]], [[Steuart Wilson]], [[Tudor Davies]], [[Herbert Heyner]], and [[Horace Stevens]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Elgar Birthday Records", ''The Gramophone'', June 1927, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Private recordings from radio broadcasts ("off-air" recordings) also exist in fragmentary form from the 1930s.

The first complete recording was made by [[EMI]] in 1945, conducted by [[Malcolm Sargent]] with his regular chorus and orchestra, the [[Huddersfield Choral Society]] and the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra|Liverpool Philharmonic]]. The soloists were [[Heddle Nash]], [[Gladys Ripley]], [[Dennis Noble]] and [[Norman Walker (bass)|Norman Walker]]. This is the only recording to date that employs different singers for the Priest and the Angel of the Agony.&lt;ref name=gram/&gt; The first stereophonic recording was made by EMI in 1964, conducted by [[John Barbirolli]]. It has remained in the catalogues continuously since its first release, and is notable for [[Janet Baker]]'s singing as the Angel.&lt;ref name=gram/&gt; [[Benjamin Britten]]'s 1971 recording for [[Decca Records|Decca]] was noted for its fidelity to Elgar's score, showing, as the ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' reviewer said, that "following the composer's instructions strengthens the music's dramatic impact".&lt;ref name=gram/&gt; Of the other dozen or so recordings on disc, most are directed by British conductors, with the exception of a 1960 recording in German under [[Hans Swarowsky]] and a Russian recording (sung in English by British forces) under [[Yevgeny Svetlanov]] performed 'live' in Moscow in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Essex, Walter, [http://www.elgar.org/3gerontr.htm#disco "The Recorded Legacy"], The Elgar Society, accessed 22 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Another Russian conductor, [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], performed the work with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and its choral and vocal soloists in 2008 and this too has been released on CD.

The [[BBC]] [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] feature "Building a Library" has presented comparative reviews of all available versions of ''The Dream of Gerontius'' on three occasions. Comparative reviews also appear in ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music]]'', 2008, and ''Gramophone'', February 2003. The recordings recommended by all three are Sargent's 1945 EMI version and Barbirolli's 1964 EMI recording.&lt;ref name=gram /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/building/data2/rev_771_1808.shtml Building a Library]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} BBC Radio 3; [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/building/data2/rev_771_1815.shtml Building a Library]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, BBC Radio 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;March, pp. 438–40{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''The Fountain of Life''''' or '''''The Fountain of Grace and the Triumph of the Church over the Synagogue''''' are names given to an oil on [[panel painting]] completed c 1432. For most of its history the painting has been in Spain, where it is currently features in a special exhibition in the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.&lt;ref name="Eldiario"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.eldiario.es/cultura/fuente-Van-Eyck-recupera-Prado_0_827667671.html |title='La fuente de gracia' de Van Eyck recupera la gloria |date=2018 |access-date=11 November 2018 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically and thematically, the painting is related to the work of [[Jan van Eyck]], but it is unsigned and there have been competing theories as to whether it is by van Eyck himself.

The subject matter of the painting would have been of particular interest in 15th century Spain which had the world´s largest [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jewish community]].
There has been recent speculation that it was painted by van Eyck himself, possibly while he was on a diplomatic mission to the Iberian peninsula. However, technical analysis suggests that it was painted in the Netherlands, albeit possibly in response to a commission from Spain, in van Eyck's workshop.&lt;ref name="Eldiario" /&gt; 

''The Fountain of Life'' closely resembles passages in the 1432 ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' by Jan and his brother [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al, 58&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is consensus among specialists that it is the product of a workshop, some attribute ''The Fountain of Life'' to a youthful Jan, his brother Hubert,&lt;ref&gt;Borchert, 71&lt;/ref&gt; or much later, and less likely, [[Petrus Christus]].&lt;ref name="F132"&gt;Ferrari, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is structured into three levels. The top terrace shows a [[Deesis|Deësis]] of [[God the Son]], the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and St. [[John the Evangelist]]. The middle section shows four groups of angels, while the lower level has two groups of holy men; with Christians led by a Pope and princes to the right, and Jews led by blindfolded high priests to the left. These two groups represent true believers and non true believers in Christ as the messiah respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Devonshire Jones et al, 213&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Fountain of Life]] is a symbol referring to baptism and or eucharist. The water that flows from the top to the lower terrace, is intended as a symbol of "the Grace that illuminates the Triumphant Church and blinds the Synagogue".&lt;ref name="prado"&gt;''[https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/the-fountain-of-grace-and-the-triumph-of-the-church-over-the-synagogue/ The Fountain of Grace and the Triumph of the Church over the Synagogue]''. [[Museo del Prado]]. Retrieved 22 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting is organised into three horizontal levels or planes, each showing a terrace on which the figures are positioned.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt;

===Upper terrace===

 | caption3  = ''Ghent Altarpiece'': John the Baptist
}}
The top level shows a Deësis scene, with [[God the Father]] in the center, flanked by the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and St. [[John the Evangelist]]. This passage closely resembles a similar scene in the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]''.&lt;ref name="F132" /&gt; All three figures are seated in front of hanging [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|oriental style carpets]].

[[File:The Fountain of Life after van Eyck Detail3.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Detail showing the Virgin Mary]]
God holds a staff in his right hand, and holds up his left up in the act of blessing. He is enthroned within a tall, elaborate Gothic architectural setting. His throne contains symbols of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelists]], while the [[baldachin]] around and above him is decorated with illusionistic painted [[relief]]s of [[Old Testament]] prophets intended to look like sculptures. The lamb sits on a pedestal before God, on a structure through which the water of grace,&lt;ref name="c61"&gt;Colas, 61&lt;/ref&gt; symbolising the rite of baptism, flows before reaching the [[fountain of life]] in the lowest terrace.&lt;ref name="r56"&gt;Roth, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary is seated and reading a red book, probably a [[book of hours]]. She wears a blue gown, the folds and cloth of which are closely detailed. She has blond hair which is unbranded and falls over her shoulders. In contrast to her depiction in the ''Ghent Altarpiece'', here her dress is plain, lacks any embroidery or gilded lining, while her book is not [[Girdle book|girdled]]. John is dressed in a green robe, also has blond hair and sits writing in a holy book.

===Middle terrace===
[[File:The Fountain of Life after van Eyck 9.jpg|thumb|260px|Detail showing musical angels]]
[[File:Jan van Eyck - The Ghent Altarpiece - Singing Angels (detail) - WGA07642.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail from the "Musical Angels" panel of the ''Ghent Altarpiece'', before 1432]]
The middle level shows two groups of musical angels dressed in white robes and sitting on grass. Choirs of singing angels are positioned in towers on either side of them. This section is again similar to a panel in the ''Ghent Altarpiece''. The instruments include a [[harp]], a type of [[viol]] and a [[lute]].

===Lower terrace===
The lower section represents the triumph of the Church over the Jewish Synagogue, through the depiction of the Christians as collect as almost serene, and the Jews as chaotic, blinded and resistant. The fountain of life is positioned in the center, with a group of Christians to its left, including a Pope (possibly [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]]), members of his [[retinue|service]],&lt;ref name="r56" /&gt; an emperor and various princes.&lt;ref name="c61" /&gt;

[[File:The Fountain of Life after van Eyck 8.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Detail showing the blinded High Priest in the lower terrace]]
To the right is a grouping of "despairing Jews" who seem to be fleeing from the scene.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; The figure on the far left of this group is a high priest who has been blindfolded,&lt;ref name="F132" /&gt; symbolising his blinding to the true significance of Jesus.&lt;ref name="b163"&gt;Benjamin, 163&lt;/ref&gt; A rabbi in the immediate foreground holds a [[Torah]] scroll with, according to historian Norman Roth, "gibberish Hebrew writing", while another "Jew shows a scroll to a figure, apparently Christian, who tears his clothing at the sight". In contrast to the Christians, the Jews do not wear grand, ceremonious hats or badges.&lt;ref name="r56" /&gt;

They carry a variety of [[banner]]s, [[scroll]]s and [[parchment]]s, which contains texts that while illegible, can be recognised as mostly written in Hebrew, with some lettering that is almost nonsensical. The texts are arranged across the passage in a haphazard way, reflecting the disorder of the figures, and more generally within the Synagogue.&lt;ref name="b162"&gt;Benjamin, 162&lt;/ref&gt; This placement must be contrasted with those on the two level, where the books held by Mary and John rest stably on their laps.&lt;ref name="b163" /&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting's first documentary record is in the ''Libro becerro'' (vellum acquisitions register) of the [[Monastery of Santa María del Parral|Monastery of the Parral]] outside Segovia, which recorded it as the gift of King [[Henry IV of Castile]] in 1454. That year marked the beginning of Henry's reign, as well as a building programme at the monastery. He may have inherited the painting from his father [[John II of Castile|John II]].

It was secured to the wall of the [[Sacristy|vestry]], being gradually painted into the wall as the vestry was redecorated down the centuries, until it was removed in 1838 as part of the [[Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizábal|secularisation of the monasteries]]: parts of the border were lost in the removal but the painting is generally in good condition. The painting was moved to the Trinidade monastery opposite the Atocha station in Madrid, used as a general store for the religious wealth collected.

The painting was photographed in 1859 by [[Jean Laurent (photographer)|Jean Laurent]].&lt;ref name="Eldiario" /&gt; Its first formal attribution was in 1870 when it was transferred to the Prado, dating it as 1454 on the strength of the entry: however, it was stylistically anachronistic, an accurate dating should have read "before 1454", a mistake which has caused no end of confusion in the 130 years following as scholars attempted to identify a non-existent atelier or pupil/follower of van Eyck's. Following a dendrochronological study undertaken by the Prado in the late 1990s, which dated the felling of the wood to 1418, it was dated to "after 1428" after allowing a standard ten years for seasoning: the Prado currently attributes it to c1432. During the time in the Parral, it became highly influential and was widely copied, one copy was later housed in [[Palencia Cathedral]]. Today it is in the collection of the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; The Prado version was the star of an exhibition of its reassessments in 2003, and it was previously the subject of the 1957 Utrecht doctoral thesis of Josua Bruyn, who went on to become Professor of the History of Art at Amsterdam and establish the Rembrandt Foundation.

'''''The Painter's Studio: A real allegory summing up seven years of my artistic and moral life''''' (''L'Atelier du peintre'') is an 1855 oil on canvas painting by [[Gustave Courbet]]. It is located in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris, France.

Courbet painted ''The Painter's Studio'' in [[Ornans]], France in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Riat|2008|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The world comes to be painted at my studio," said Courbet of the [[Realism (art movement)|Realist]] work. The figures in the painting are [[allegory|allegorical]] representations of various influences on Courbet's artistic life. On the left are human figures from all levels of society. In the center, Courbet works on a [[landscape]], while turned away from a nude model who is a symbol of [[Academic art]]. On the right are friends and associates of Courbet, mainly elite Parisian society figures, including [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Champfleury]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], and Courbet's most prominent [[Patronage#Arts|patron]], [[Alfred Bruyas]].&lt;ref name="harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=60"&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|1855 Paris World Fair]]'s jury accepted eleven of Courbet's works for the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]], but ''The Painter's Studio'' was not among them. In an act of [[Promotion (marketing)|self promotion]] and defiance, Courbet, with the help of [[Alfred Bruyas]], opened his own exhibition (The Pavilion of Realism) close to the official exposition; this was a forerunner of the various [[Salon des Refusés]]. Very little praise was forthcoming, and [[Eugène Delacroix]] was one of the few painters who supported the work. Of the painting, Courbet stated that ''The Painter's Studio'' "represents society at its best, its worst, and its average."&lt;ref name="harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=60"/&gt;

==Description==
The painting was produced during Courbet's involvement with [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]] in art in the mid-1800s. Due to the short amount of time Courbet had to paint it, many original plans for the work had to be discarded. The most noticeable example of this is in the background of the painting. On the back wall of the studio in the painting, Courbet planned to paint replications of other works of his. He ran out of time to paint these in their entirety, so he then covered them up with a reddish-brown preparation color, leaving the partially-finished paintings still relatively visible.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gust/hd_gust.htm Gustave Courbet (1819–1877)]", The Metropolitan Museum of Art, accessed September 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left side===
The left side of the painting depicts people of everyday life in France.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire_id/latelier-du-peintre-7091.html?no_cache=1 Gustave Courbet, The Artist's Studio]", Musée d'Orsay, accessed September 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish man and the Irishwoman were seen on a trip Courbet took to London in 1848, according to a letter Courbet wrote to Champfleury detailing what the painting would look like.&lt;ref name="Nicolson_23_33"/&gt; There is also a "[[Mannequin|lay figure]]"/"crucified figure" directly to the left of Courbet's easel. This figure appears contorted and potentially mangled. Art historians Benedict Nicolson and Georges Riat both interpret this figure as a symbol of the "death" of the art of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts|Royal Academy of Art]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|pp=23, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Riat|2008|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center===
The center of the painting depicts Courbet painting a landscape, a nude female figure, a young boy, and a white cat. On his canvas, Courbet paints the [[Loue|Loue River valley]]. This valley in the [[Franche-Comté]] region of France is a tribute to Courbet's homeland of [[Ornans]], France.&lt;ref name="harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=20"&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female figure is based on an 1854 photograph by J.&amp;nbsp;V. de Villeneuve and has been interpreted as a representation of the [[Academic art|art of the Academy]] or as Courbet's Muse for Realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right side===
The right side of the painting depicts a large number of Paris [[elite]]s, including friends of the artist. These are figures who played a role in the development of Courbet's career as an artist, or who inspired him in some way. Portrayals included on this side of the painting include [[Alfred Bruyas]] (a patron of Courbet), [[Champfleury]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], and a wealthy pair of art collectors, among other prominent society figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|pp=52–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of these portraits were copied from previous portraits or from photographs, since the painting was entirely made in [[Ornans]] but the subjects on this side of the painting resided in Paris. For example, the portrait of Charles Baudelaire was directly copied from Courbet's 1847 portrait of the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courbet was in written correspondence with Champfleury in regards to this painting (from which much of the interpretation of ''The Painter's Studio'' is derived) and requested a photograph of Proudhon, the philosopher and anarchist, so that he could be included in the painting. It is the photograph Courbet received from Champfleury on which Proudhon's portrait is based.

==Interpretations==
* The meaning of the oxymoron "real allegory" in the subtitle of the painting, as well as Courbet's intent in conjuring this phrase, is debated.
* Courbet chose to paint the Loué River Valley on his canvas-within-a-canvas as an act of defiant [[Parochialism|provincialism]]. He sought to bring a symbol of his home in the [[Doubs]] department of the [[Franche-Comté]] region of France straight into the heart of [[Paris]] and the eyes of Paris' [[socialite]] art viewers and collectors.&lt;ref name="harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=20"/&gt;
* The skull that rests on a copy of the ''[[Journal des débats]]'' is a symbol of the death of the [[Academic art|art of the Academy]].&lt;ref name="Nicolson_23_33"&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|pp=23–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The cluster of items at the foot of the hunter (on the left), including a guitar, a dagger, a plumed hat, and a buckled shoe, is a symbol of the death of the [[Romanticism#Romantic visual arts|Romantic art movement]]. It could be a symbol of the death of [[Romanticism#Romantic visual arts|Romanticism]] due to the rising popularity of Realism, or a symbol of the death of Romanticism in Courbet's own oeuvre.&lt;ref name="Nicolson_23_33"/&gt;

'''Universal Flowering''' (''Mirovoi rastsvet'') is the name given by [[Pavel Filonov]] to his system of analytical art.  The system arose from [[Cubo-futurism|cubo-futurist]] experiments and works that he undertook from 1913-1915.  It is characterized by very dense, minutely facetted, and relatively flat surfaces created by working from the particular to the general, using the smallest of brushes and the sharpest of pencils.  The images have both [[Cubism]]'s multiple vantage points and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]]'s representation of a figure over time. A number of the paintings, while having a given orientation, are painted as though they could be oriented in a variety of ways.  Filonov's philosophy was originally formalized in written form in 1915, which was revised and published as ''The Declaration of Universal Flowering'' in 1923 when Filonov was a professor at the (then) [[Petrograd]] [[St.Petersburg Academy of arts|Academy of Arts]].  Filonov's main theoretical work ''The Ideology of Analytical Art'' (''Ideologia analiticheskogo iskusstva'') was published in 1930.
