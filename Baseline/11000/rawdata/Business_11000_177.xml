'''Alfonso Fanjul Sr.''' (30 September 1909 &amp;ndash; 16 October 1980) was a Cuban-born American sugar baron.

==Early life==
Alfonso Fanjul was born in [[Havana]], Cuba.&lt;ref name="PBCHO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfonso Fanjul Sr.|url=http://www.pbchistoryonline.org/page/alfonso-fanjul-sr|website=Palm Beach County History Online|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had two brothers.&lt;ref name="palmbeachpostobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones Poit|first1=Katrina|title=Sugar Magnate Alfonso Fanjul Dead At 71|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/135020587/|accessdate=August 9, 2017|work=The Palm Beach Post|date=October 17, 1980|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Catholic University of America]] (CUA) in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="PBCHO"/&gt; 

==Career==
His family owned the Czarnikow-Rionda Company, with operations in New York, Havana and London, and the Cuban Trading Company in Cuba.&lt;ref name="PBCHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollander2009"/&gt; His 1936 marriage to Lillian Rosa Gomez-Mena, the daughter of [[José Gómez-Mena]], whose family owned Cuba's New Gomez-Mena Sugar Company,&lt;ref name="Hollander2009"/&gt; united two of the country's leading sugar fortunes, and created a combined business of ten sugar mills, three distilleries, and Cuban-wide real estate holdings.&lt;ref name="PBCHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/21/business/yourmoney/the-castro-collection.html|title=The Castro Collection|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the president of the Havana Country Club.&lt;ref name="miaminewsobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dewar|first1=Heather|title=Palm Beach Rites Today for Alfonso Fanjul, 71|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/302355816/|accessdate=August 9, 2017|work=The Miami News|date=October 17, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, the family moved to the US, after [[Fidel Castro]]'s communist regime began seizing all of their property.&lt;ref name="ibtimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/sugar-mogul-alfonso-fanjul-wants-invest-cuba-1553293|title=Sugar Mogul Alfonso Fanjul Wants To Invest In Cuba|author=Patricia Rey Mallén|date=5 February 2014 |website=ibtimes.com |accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Castro regime seized the Gomez-Mena mansion, and leaving its art and furnishings intact, renamed it the [[Museum of Decorative Arts, Havana|National Museum of Decorative Arts]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Fanjul purchased 4,000 acres of land near [[Lake Okeechobee]] and some Louisiana sugar mills, and expanded from there.&lt;ref name="Hollander2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gail M.

'''Ana Grepo''' (5 March 1975 – 10 November 2011)&lt;ref name="Index.hr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/trovanje-ugljicnim-monoksidom-bivsa-manekenka-ana-grepo-pronadjena-mrtva-u-kupaonici/582431.aspx |title=Bivša manekenka Ana Grepo ugušila se u kupaonici - Vijesti.net |language=Croatian|publisher=Index.hr |date= |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Croatian people|Croatian]] businesswoman and former model from [[Split (city)|Split]], Croatia. In 1995, she was crowned "Miss Dalmatia" at a regional beauty pageant in Split. In the last years of her life, she resided in [[Zagreb]], where she managed her own [[modeling agency]]. She was one of the main figures to gather young prospective models for the entire area of southeastern Europe and former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="grepo"&gt;[http://www.gt-studio.hr/nr_ana_grepo.aspx]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422200414/http://www.gt-studio.hr/nr_ana_grepo.aspx |date=22 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Her father Petar was a fisherman and her mother Andja a housewife.

==Modelling career==
While still in high school, Grepo was drafted by the Midiken modeling agency from Zagreb. Finishing her last high school year in Zagreb, Grepo had become one of the most wanted young models in Croatia.

In late 1995, Grepo moved to [[Milan]] and worked for modeling agencies. In the nine-year period between 1996 and 2005, Grepo worked in world fashion capitals, including Madrid, Paris, London, New York and Tokyo. In late 2000, while engaging a full-time model, she started a modelling agency based in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="modelling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacional.hr/en/articles/view/11826/ |title=Nacional.hr |publisher=Nacional.hr |date= |accessdate=15 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220235643/http://www.nacional.hr/en/articles/view/11826/ |archivedate=20 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post modelling career and personal life===
Holding Croatian and Italian citizenships, Ana relocated to Milan in 1995.  Over the next decade, she worked in such major cities as London, New York, Tokyo, and Paris. She was briefly married to businessman Dragan Jurilj. During this time, she benefited from business connections and accumulated great wealth and business notoriety.

In 2002, she purchased property on the Croatian shore near [[Dubrovnik]] and the Croatian government granted her right to build a five-star casino resort on the [[Brioni Islands]]. In the summer of 2006, she entered a bid to purchase a major Croatian basketball team in [[Cibona]], Zagreb; eventually withdrawing the offer.  Grepo's dual citizenship enabled her entry to the Italian business market. In early 2007, she bought a share of the Italian soccer club [[A.C. Chievo]] from [[Verona]], Italy. In March 2007, she reportedly paid 4.5 million euros for a 16th-century Italian traditional mansion in Verona, Italy.

===Death===
Ana Grepo died of [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning at her apartment in Osijek.&lt;ref name="Index.hr"/&gt;  This was deemed an accidental death.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''BRFplus''' (Business Rule Framework plus) is a [[business rule management system]] (BRMS) offered by [[SAP AG]]. BRFplus is part of the [[SAP NetWeaver]] [[ABAP]] stack. Therefore, all SAP applications that are based on SAP NetWeaver can access BRFplus within the boundaries of an SAP system. However, it is also possible to generate [[web service]]s so that BRFplus rules can also be offered as a service in a [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] landscape, regardless of the software platform used by the service consumers.

BRFplus development started as a supporting tool that was part of [[SAP Business ByDesign]], an [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] solution targeted at small and medium size companies. By that time, the tool was called “Formula and Derivation Tool” (FDT). Later on, it was decided to maintain BRFplus on those codelines that serve as the basis for [[SAP Business Suite]]. With that, [[business rule]]s that have been created for Business ByDesign can easily be taken over in a full-size SAP system where they are ready for use without any changes.

== Overview ==
BRFplus offers a unified modeling and runtime environment for business rules that addresses both technical users (programmers, system administrators) as well as business users who take care of operational business processes (like procurement, bidding, tax form validation, etc.). The different requirements and usage scenarios of the different target groups can be covered with the help of the SAP authorization system and a [[user interface]] that can be individually customized.

Being integrated into SAP NetWeaver, BRFplus-based applications can look at, and model, business rules from a strictly business-oriented perspective, rather than starting with the underlying technical artifacts. This is because the integration allows for direct access to the business objects available in the SAP dictionary (like customer , supplier, material, bill, etc.).

In addition to the predefined expression types (decision table, decision tree, formula, database access, loops, etc.) and actions (sending e-mails, triggering a workflow, etc.), BRFplus can be extended by custom expression types. Also, direct calls of function modules as well as ABAP OO class methods are supported so that the entire range of the ABAP programming language is available for solving business tasks.

BRFplus comes with an optional [[Software versioning|versioning mechanism]]. Versioning can be switched on and off for individual objects as well as for entire applications. Versioned business rules are needed in certain use cases for legal reasons, but they also allow for simulating the system behavior as it would have been at a particular point in time.

Once the rule objects are in a consistent state and active, the system automatically generates ABAP OO classes that encapsulate the functional scope of the underlying rule object. This is done on an on-demand base and speeds up processing.

The execution of functions as well as of single expressions can be [[Simulation|simulated]]. The processing log of the simulation is useful for checking the implementation and for investigating problems.

BRFplus applications can be exported and imported as an [[XML]] file. This is an easy way of creating a [[Backup|data backup]]. XML files can also be used for deploying rule applications throughout the company.

== Main Object Types ==

=== Application ===
The application object serves as a container for all the BRFplus objects that have been assembled to solve a particular business task.  It is possible to define certain default settings on application level that are inherited by all objects that are created in the scope of that application.

=== Function ===
A function is used to connect a business application with the rule processing framework of BRFplus. The calling business application passes input values to the function which are then processed by the expressions and rulesets that are associated with the called function. The calculated result is then returned to the calling business application.

=== Expression types and action types ===
* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]]
* BRMS Connector
* [[Switch statement|Case]]
* Database Lookup
* [[Decision table|Decision Table]]
* [[Decision Tree]]
* [[Formula]]
* Function Call
* Loop
* Procedure Call
* [[Random number generation|Random Number]]
* Search Tree
* Step Sequence
* Value Range1
* [[XSL Transformation]]

=== Ruleset ===
A ruleset is a container for an arbitrary number of rule objects which in turn carry out the necessary calculations with the help of assigned expressions and actions. Instead of assigning an expression to a function, it is also possible to assign any number of rulesets to a function. When the function is called, all assigned rulesets are subsequently processed.

=== Data Objects ===
BRFplus supports elementary data objects (text, number, boolean, time point, amount, quantity) as well as structures and tables. Structures can be nested. For all types of data objects it is possible to reference data objects that reside in the data dictionary of the backend system. With that, a BRFplus data object does not only inherit the type definition of the referenced object but can also access associated data like domain value lists or object documentation.

=== Other objects ===
With catalogs, it is possible to define business-specific subsets of the rule objects that reside in the system. This is helpful for hiding the complexity of a rule system, thus improving usability.

Object filters are used by system administrators to ensure that for selected users, only a predefined subset of object types is visible. This is useful to enforce access rights as well as modeling policies.

== Other BRM solutions offered by SAP ==
BRFplus is positioned as the successor product of an older business rule solution known as BRF (Business Rule Framework). For a longer transition phase, both solutions exist in parallel. However, an increasing number of SAP applications that used to be based on BRF are constantly migrating to BRFplus.

While BRFplus supports business rules for applications based on the SAP NetWeaver ABAP stack, SAP is offering another product named SAP NetWeaver Business Rules Management (BRM). BRM supports business rule modeling for the SAP NetWeaver [[Java (software platform)|Java]] stack. Both products do not compete. They are available in parallel and can be used in a collaborative approach to deal with use cases where both technology stacks are used in parallel. BRFplus comes with a special expression type that helps bridging the gap between the two different technologies.

== Availability ==
BRFplus has been delivered to the public with SAP NetWeaver 7.0 Enhancement Package 1 for the first time. Being part of SAP NetWeaver, the usage of BRFplus is covered by the "SAP NetWeaver Foundation for Third Party Applications" license, with no additional costs.

Although [[poverty]] is generally considered as the primary cause of child labour in Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ernest Harsch|title=Child labour rooted in Africa's poverty|journal=Africa Recovery|volume=15|number=3|date=October 2001|pages=14–15|url=https://www.un.org/en/africarenewal/vol15no3/153chil4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;, recent studies show that the relationship between child labour and poverty is not as simple as a downward linear relationship.

The [[International Labour Organization]] estimates that agriculture is the largest employer of child labour in Africa. Vast majority are unpaid family workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts on Child Labor - 2010|publisher=ILO, Geneva|year=2011|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_126685.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural history==
[[File:Kamerun children weaving cloth 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Africa has a long history of child labour. Above, colonial [[Cameroon]] children weaving in 1919.]]
Children in Africa have worked in farms and at home over a long history. This is not unique to Africa; large number of children have worked in agriculture and domestic situations in America, Europe and every other human society, throughout history, prior to 1950s. Scholars suggest that this work, specially in rural areas, was a form of schooling and vocational education, where children learned the arts and skills from their parents, and as adults continued to work in the same hereditary occupation. Bass claims this is particularly true in the African context.&lt;ref name=bass04&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Labor in Sub-Saharan Africa|author=Loretta Bass|year=2004|isbn=978-1588262868|pages=30–43|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hh09&gt;{{cite book|title=The World of Child Labor|author=Beverly Grier (Ed: Hugh Hindman)|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2009|pages=173–177|isbn=978-0-7656-1707-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa is a highly diverse and culturally continent. In parts of this continent, farming societies adhere to a system of patrilineal lineages and clans. The young train with the adults. The family and kinsfolk provide a cultural routine that help children learn useful practical skills and enables these societies to provide for itself in the next generation. Historically, there were no formal schools, instead, children were informally schooled by working informally with their family and kin from a very early age. Child labor in Africa, as in other parts of the world, was also viewed as a way to instill a sense of responsibility and a way of life in children particularly in rural, subsistence agricultural communities. In rural ''Pare'' people of northern Tanzania, for example, five-year-olds would assist adults in tending crops, nine-year-olds help carry fodder for animals and responsibilities scaled with age.&lt;ref name=bass04/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Introduction - Child Labour|author=Cindi Katz|journal=Anthropology of Work Review|volume=17|issue=1–2|pages=3–8|date=June–September 1996|doi=10.1525/awr.1996.17.1-2.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ThiMil FillBer.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Berber people|Berber]] shepherd girl in the [[Atlas Mountains]] of [[Morocco]].]]
In northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Islam is a major influence. Begging and child labour was considered as a service in exchange for quranic education, and in some cases continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talibes in Senegal|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=April 15, 2010|url=https://www.hrw.org/features/talib-s-senegal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children aged 7–13, for example, were called ''almudos'' in [[Gambia]], or ''talibés'' in [[Senegal]]. The parents placed their children with ''[[marabout]]'' or ''serin'', a cleric or quranic teacher. Here, they would split their time between begging and studying the Quran. This practice fit with one of the five pillars of Islam, the responsibility to engage in ''zakat'', or almsgiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Boyle|title=Quranic Schools: Agents of Preservation &amp; Change|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415946353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Njàngaan: The Daily Regime of Quranic Students in Twentieth-Century Senegal|author=Rudolph T. Ware III|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|volume=37|number=3|year=2004|pages=515–538|jstor=4129043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of colonial rule in Africa, from 1650 to 1950, by powers such as Britain, France, Belgium, Germany and Netherlands encouraged and continued the practice of child labour. Colonial administrators preferred Africa's traditional kin-ordered modes of production, that is hiring a household for work not just the adults. Millions of children worked in colonial agricultural plantations, mines and domestic service industries.&lt;ref name=bass04/&gt;&lt;ref name=hh09/&gt; Children in these colonies between the ages of 5-14 were hired as apprentice ''without'' pay in exchange for learning a craft. Colonial British laws, for example, offered the native people ownership to some of the native land in exchange for making labor of wife and children available to colonial government's needs such as in farms and as ''picannins''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Masters, Servants, and Magistrates in Britain and the Empire, 1562-1955 (Studies in Legal History)|author=Douglas Hay|year=2007|isbn=978-0807828779|pages=38–46|publisher= University of North Carolina Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shoe Shine Boy, Ethiopia (8198535107).jpg|thumb|right|A boy shoeshiner in [[Gondar]], [[Ethiopia]].]]
Child labour was also encouraged by new tax laws. [[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonial empires introduced new taxes to help pay for the local colonial government expenses. One of these, called the Head Tax, imposed a tax payable by every person, in some cases as young as 8 year old. Regional populations rebelled against such taxes, hid their children, and in most part had to ensure their children were involved in economic activity to pay such taxes and pay their living expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child labor in the Gold Coast: the economics of work, education and the family in late-colonial Africa, c.1940-57|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/11595/1/Jack_Lord%2C_Child_Labor_in_the_Gold_Coast.pdf|author=Jack Lord|journal=The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=4|issue=1|year=2011|pages=88–115|doi=10.1353/hcy.2011.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invisible Hands: Child Labor and the State in Colonial Zimbabwe by Beverly Grier (a review)|author=Karen Wells|journal=The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=1|number=3|date=Fall 2008|pages=481–483 |doi= 10.1353/hcy.0.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Head Tax, Social Structure and Rural Incomes in Cameroun, 1922-1937|author=Jane Guyer|journal=Cahiers d'Études Africaines|volume=20|issue=79|year=1980|pages=305–329|doi=10.3406/cea.1980.2338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian mission schools in Africa stretching from Zambia to Nigeria too required work from children, and in exchange provided religious education, not [[secular education]].&lt;ref name=bass04/&gt;

In late colonial period, colonial governments attempted to run schools and educate children in parts of Africa. These effort were generally unsuccessful both in terms of enrollment and impact. Few children enrolled. Even when children enrolled, it did not necessarily mean regular attendance. Chronic absenteeism, or children dropped out of the schools to instead “go to sea with the fishermen.” Jack Lord claims in his reviews of scholarly papers of African colonial history, that late colonial era experience suggests children and families made decisions based on complex combination of economic factors such as household income, state of the family, and cultural factors that considered working with families as a form of education and a form of developing social and human capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child labor in the Gold Coast: the economics of work, education and the family in late-colonial Africa, c.1940-57|year=2011|journal=The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=4|issue=1|pages= 88–115|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/11595/1/Jack_Lord%2C_Child_Labor_in_the_Gold_Coast.pdf|doi=10.1353/hcy.2011.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary child labour==
[[File:Mining diggerboys.jpg|thumb|upright|Child labour is common in informal mining industry of Africa. Above, children engaged in diamond mining in [[Sierra Leone]].]]
Agriculture alone employs more than 30% of all African children aged 10–14.&lt;ref name=iloafr/&gt; Informal economy such as small scale artisanal mines is another significant employer of child labour.

===Burkina Faso===
According to Burkina Faso’s United States Department of Labor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Department of Labor - Burkina Faso Reports Child Labor Findings|year=2012|url=https://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/findings/2012TDA/burkinafaso.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012, 37.8% of children in Burkina Faso, between the ages of 5-14 years, were working in granite quarries and gold mines. These children have worked 6 to 7 days a week for up to 14 hours per day. Payment is in the form of food to eat and a place to sleep. Since that time, the Government has adopted a National Action Plan, and in collaboration with Interpol, have since have rescued many children from child trafficking. 

Christian Children's Fund of Canada (CCFC) has partnered with EDUCO, a fellow member of the [[ChildFund Alliance]], to implement a European Union-funded project in north Burkina to prevent children from working in mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keeping Children Safe from Working in Gold Mines, 2017|publisher=Christian Children’s Fund of Canada|url=https://www.ccfcanada.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=823&amp;Itemid=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congo===
In 2008, Bloomberg claimed child labour in copper and cobalt mines of [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] that supplied Chinese companies. The children dig the ore by hand, carry sacks of ores on their backs, and these are then purchased by these companies. Over 60 of [[Katanga Province|Katanga's]] 75 processing plants are owned by Chinese companies and 90 percent of the region's minerals go to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China Lets Child Workers Die Digging in Congo Mines for Copper|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=July 22, 2008|author1=Simon Clark |author2=Michael Smith |author3=Franz Wild |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aW8xVLQ4Xhr8}}&lt;/ref&gt; An African NGO report claimed 80,000 child labourers under the age of 15, or about 40% of all miners, were supplying ore to Chinese companies in this African region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Strengthening the Civil society Perspective: China’s African impact| pages=9–15| author=Stephen Marks| year=2010| publisher=Fahamu| url=http://www.fahamu.org/downloads/strengthening_the_civil_society_perspective.pdf| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104005117/http://www.fahamu.org/downloads/strengthening_the_civil_society_perspective.pdf| archivedate=2011-01-04| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC, in 2012, accused [[Glencore]] of using child labour in its mining and smelting operations of Africa. Glencore denied it used child labour, and said it has strict policy of not using child labour. Glencore claimed being aware of child miners who it claimed were part of a group of artisanal miners. They had without authorisation raided Glencore's concession since 2010, and the company claimed it has been pleading with the government to remove the artisanal miners from its concession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mining giant Glencore accused in child labour and acid dumping row|author=John Sweeney|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 April 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/14/glencore-child-labour-acid-dumping-row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 4.7 million children aged 5–14 work in Congo. In addition to copper mines, children with their families participate in artisanal mining of [[cobalt]], [[wolframite]], [[cassiterite]], [[columbite-tantalite]], [[gold]], diamonds. Many of these use hammers to break free the ore, pour harsh chemicals with no protective equipment, and manually transport rocks from deep pit or open pit mines. Children also work in agriculture and continue to be recruited as child soldiers for Congolese National Army and various rebel groups. Child labour is commonly visible on the streets of Kinshasa region.&lt;ref name=dol10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Association of Trauma and PTSD Symptoms With Openness to Reconciliation and Feelings of Revenge Among Former Ugandan and Congolese Child Soldiers|author1=Christophe Pierre Bayer |author2=Fionna Klasen |author3=Hubertus Adam |journal=JAMA|year=2007|volume=298|number=5|pages=555–559|doi=10.1001/jama.298.5.555 |pmid=17666676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghana===
The 2010 [[United States Department of Labor]] estimated over 2.7 million child labourers in [[Ghana]], or about 43% of all children aged 5–14. Agriculture, fishing and artisan mining were the largest employers.&lt;ref name=dol10/&gt;

Children in Accra and Ashanti regions were common in domestic services. Child porters, locally called ''kayaye'', work in urban areas and some of them are as young as 6 years.

In southern Volta region, children work in [[Ritual servitude|religious servitude]] for a period ranging between few months to three years. They are known as ''trokosi'' (literally: wife of a god), ''fiashidi '', or ''vudusi''. This practice requires young girls to work and serve the religious order, in order to atone for family members’ alleged sins or as an offering for the family's good fortune. This practice is claimed to be also present in neighboring countries, even though it has been outlawed and imposes prison term under the laws of Ghana and neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pan-African Issues in Crime and Justice (Editors: Anita Kalunta-Crumpton, Biko Agozino) - See Chapter 2|author=Robert Kwame Ameh|publisher=Ashgate|year=2004|isbn=978-0754618829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, statistics on children's work have not changed much and according to the DOL's ''Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor'' in Ghana, the majority of working children engage in hazardous activities like pesticide spraying in the production of cocoa, fishing and gold mining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/ghana.htm Ghana, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor]&lt;/ref&gt; The Department's 2014 ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' includes fish and [[tilapia]] in particular, cocoa and gold as goods produced in such working conditions in Ghana.

===Kenya===
[[File:Young Maasai herder Kenya, 1979.jpg|thumb|250px|A child as [[Maasai people|Maasai]] herder in [[Kenya]].]]
Suda, in 2001, estimated that [[Kenya]] had 3 million children working in intolerable conditions and who were visible. The number of invisible child workers, claims Suda, were much larger. The visible child labour in Kenya were engaged in agriculture, tourism industry, quarries and mines, pastoral labour, mining, garbage collection, fishing industry, and the transport sector where they move from place to place as '' "Matatu" touts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Invisible Child Worker in Kenya: The Intersection of Poverty, Legislation and Culture|author=Collette Suda|journal=Nordic Journal of African Studies|volume=10|number=2|pages=163–175|year=2001|url=http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf-files/vol10num2/suda.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Kenya estimates there are 8.9 million children aged 5–13 who work, most of whom miss schooling. Agriculture is a major employer; of all labourers employed in coffee plantations, for example, 30% are children younger than age 27.

United Nations, in its country profile report for Kenya in 2009, estimated about one third of all children aged 5–14 were working. Agriculture and fishing were the largest employers, with former accounting for roughly 79% of child labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country profile report - Kenya|year=2009|publisher=United Nations|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4d4a6806d.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Department of Labor estimated, in its 2010 report, about 32% of all Kenyan children aged 5–14 work, or over 2.9 million. Agriculture and fishing are the predominant employers. The informal sectors witnessing the worst form of child labour include sugarcane plantations, pastoral ranches, tea, coffee, miraa (a stimulant plant), rice, sisal, tobacco, tilapia and sardines fishing. Other economic activities of children in Kenya include scavenging dumpsites, collecting and selling scrap materials, glass and metal, street vending, herding and begging. Forced exploitation of children in sex tourism, the report claims, is prevalent in major cities such as Nairobi, Kisumu, Eldoret and coastal cities of Kenya.&lt;ref name=dol10/&gt;

Poverty and lack of schooling opportunities are major causes of child labour in Kenya. The country faces shortages of teachers and schools, overcrowding in schools, and procedural complications from children’s unregistered status. Kenyan law prevents access to schools to a child if he or she is unregistered as a citizen with Kenyan authorities. Currently, 44% of Kenyan children in rural areas remain unregistered. Thus, even when schools may be available, rural children are unable to prove citizenship, and these unregistered children risk losing the opportunity for schooling.

===Madagascar===
[[File:Working Child Brickaville Madagascar.jpg|thumb|upright|Child labour in Brickaville, a city in [[Atsinanana]] region of Madagascar.]]
Children are common in small scale mines of [[Madagascar]]. Some children are involved in salt mining, quarry work, gem and gold ore collection. About 58% of children in these mines are younger than age 12. According to IPEC, Child labourers in these mines usually come from families who are in precarious economic situation.&lt;ref name=iloafr/&gt;

According to a United States-based 2010 report, about 22% of Madagascar children aged 5–14, or over 1.2 million work. Another French based group suggests Madagascar child labour exceeds 2.4 million, with over 540,000 children aged 5–9 working. About 87% of the child labour is in agriculture, mainly in the production of vanilla, tea, cotton, cocoa, copra (dried meat of coconut), sisal, shrimp harvest and fishing. Malagasy children engaged in domestic service work an average of 12 hours per day.&lt;ref name=dol10&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - U.S. Department of Labor|year=2011|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/PDF/2010TDA.pdf|access-date=2012-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915195911/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/PDF/2010TDA.pdf#|archive-date=2012-09-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enquête nationale sur le travail des enfants à Madagascar, 2007|publisher=ILO|year=2008|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipecinfo/product/viewProduct.do?productId=9350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several internationally funded efforts were involved in Madagascar to help reduce and prevent child labour. However these stopped, after the government change following 2009 coup, because much of the funding from international donors, including the African Union, European Union, World Bank and the United States, was suspended.

===Morocco===
A 2010 report estimates about 150,000 children aged between 5 and 14 were working in [[Morocco]]. Agriculture and domestic services are the predominant employers. Young girls, locally called as ''petites bonnes'' (little maids), are sent to work as live in domestic servants, many aged 10 or less. These ''petites bonnes'' come from very poor families, face conditions of involuntary servitude, including long hours without breaks, absence of holidays, physical, verbal and sexual abuse, withheld wages and even restrictions on their movement. They are denied education.
More visible forms of child labour includes street children in Casablanca, Marrakech, Fès and Mèknes. These children survive by selling cigarettes, begging, shining shoes, washing cars and working as porters and packers in ports.&lt;ref name=dol10/&gt;

The Ministry of Planning in Morocco estimates that there are between 60,000 and 100,000 ''petites bonnes'' in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Labour in Morocco: The Socio-economic Background of  the "Little Maids"  Phenomenon|author=Mehdi Lahlou|publisher=Ministry of Planning, Morocco|url=http://www.araburban.org/childcity/Papers/English/Lahlou%20Morocco.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303123720/http://www.araburban.org/ChildCity/Papers/English/Lahlou%20Morocco.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies commissioned by the Morocco government finds poverty and lack of school, often in combination, are primary causes of the little maids phenomenon in Morocco. Additionally, rural parents do not believe that an education or a diploma of any sort can help their girls find a job.

===Nigeria===
{{Main article|Child labour in Nigeria}}
In 2006, there were about 15 million child labourers younger than age 14 in [[Nigeria]]. Many of these worked in hazardous conditions and for long hours. Poverty was the main driver of child labour, and the income of these children was a major part of their impoverished families income. Vast majority of child labour in Nigeria worked in agriculture and semi-formal or informal economy. Domestic servants were the least visible form of child labour, and often sexually harassed. Amongst informal economy and public places, street vending employed 64%. Midst informal enterprises in semipublic places, children were often observed as mechanics and bus conductors.&lt;ref name=n2006&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Labour - Nigeria, 2006|publisher=UNICEF|year=2007|url=http://www.unicef.org/wcaro/WCARO_Nigeria_Factsheets_ChildLabour.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 6 million of Nigeria's children do not go to school at all. In the current conditions, these children do not have the time, energy or resources to go to school.

===Rwanda===
ILO estimates [[Rwanda]] has 400,000 child workers. Of these, 120,000 are thought to be involved in the worst forms of child labour and 60,000 are child domestic workers.&lt;ref name=iloafr/&gt;

=== Swaziland ===

===Zambia===
The government of [[Zambia]] estimates there are some 595,000 child workers in the country.  Of these, 58% are aged 14 or less. Many are employed in informal mining operations.

The United States Department of Labor estimated, in its 2010 report, about 33% of Zambian children aged 5–14 work. Agriculture is the dominant employer, and with mining employs 98% of all child labour in Zambia. The informal sectors witnessing the worst form of child labour include cotton plantations, tobacco, fishing, tea, coffee and charcoal. Child labour is common in mining. However, this is witnessed in small artisanal and traditional mines, where the children extract emeralds, amethyst, aquamarines, tourmalines and garnets. Child labour is also present in mines of lead, zinc and copper ores. They do not wear any protective equipment to protect their eyes or face or body; injuries are common.&lt;ref name=dol10/&gt;

Child trafficking for purposes of hazardous labour is prevalent in Zambia. Children in agriculture and domestic service are exchanged for money, goods and gifts to family members. Zambia has strict laws against trafficking and child labour. However, implementation and enforcement of its laws has proven to be difficult.

According to ILO, child labour in Zambia is a coping strategy for the children and families when adult breadwinners die, fall ill, or when families are simply unable to make ends meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The global crisis and rising child labour in Zambia’s mining communities: Are we facing a downward decent work spiral?|author=ILO Lusaka Office|year=2009|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/support/lib/financialcrisis/featurestories/story26.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamics==
[[File:Child labour in Egypt.jpg|thumb|upright|Home-based carpet weaving enterprise in [[Egypt]] deploying child labour.]]
International Labor Organization (ILO) stated that first of all, poverty is the greatest single force driving children into the workplace.&lt;ref name=ilo2008a&gt;{{cite web|title=Child labor - causes|year=2008|publisher=ILO, United Nations|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/eurpro/moscow/areas/ipec/causes.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major factor driving children to harmful labor is the lack of schools and poor quality of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHILD LABOR: ISSUES, CAUSES AND INTERVENTIONS|author1=Faraaz Siddiqi |author2=Harry Anthony Patrinos |publisher=The World Bank|year=1999|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099079934475/547667-1135281552767/Child_Labor_issues.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child labour laws in Africa===
[[File:Carte de ratification des conventions 138 et 182.png|thumb|Most African nations have ratified worldwide child labour-related conventions. African countries colored in green had national laws, as of 2006, equivalent to ILO Conventions 138 and 182. Additional countries, except South Sudan and Somalia, too have ratified ILO Conventions since then.]]
Most African governments have formally adopted the three [[Child labour#Child labour laws and initiatives|International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions]]. In addition, many have signed a memorandum of 
understanding with ILO to launch a programme under the International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC).
 
[[Nigeria]], for example, is now an active member of IPEC. It is also implementing the West Africa Cocoa Agriculture Project. Nigeria's Child Rights Act is now part of its Labour Act, and it prohibits exploitative labour from children. Some states, like [[Anambra State|Anambra]], have also banned children from working during school hours.&lt;ref name=n2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National programme on the elimination of child labour in Nigeria|year=2005|publisher=ILO|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_mas/---eval/documents/publication/wcms_149868.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Africa]] has made it a criminal offence to employ a child under the age of 15, except with a permit from the Department of Labour to employ children in the performing arts. Sections 43 through 47 of its Employment Act also makes it illegal to employ children aged 15 to 18 if the work is inappropriate for their age or something that places them at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Guide to Child Labour|publisher=Department of Labour, Republic of South Africa|year=2012|url=https://www.labour.gov.za/legislation/acts/basic-guides/basic-guide-to-child-labour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenya]] passed a Children's Act in 2001. Section 10 of this Act protects children and youth below age 18 from economic exploitation and any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education, or to be harmful to the childspiritual, moral or social development. The law also forbids hiring anyone less than age of 18 for military or in any armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Laws of Kenya - The Children Act 2001|year=2007|publisher=Kenya Police - National Council for Law Reporting|url=http://www.kenyapolice.go.ke/resources/Childrens_Act_No_8_of_2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ghana]], as another example, forbids child labour. Section 87 of its Children's Act 1998 forbids any person from employing a chiId in exploitative labour, or in any engagement that deprives the child of its health, education or development. Section 88 prohibits anyone from employing any child at night, that is between the hours of eight o'clock in the evening and six o'clock in the morning. The Act's section 89 to 90 allow children above the age of 13 to engage in light work, and those aged over 15 non-hazardous work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACT OF THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA ENTITLED THE CHILDREN'S ACT, 1998|publisher=Yale University|year=2002|url=http://www.law.yale.edu/rcw/rcw/jurisdictions/afw/ghana/ghana_childrens_act.pdf|access-date=2012-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917020312/http://www.law.yale.edu/rcw/rcw/jurisdictions/afw/ghana/Ghana_Childrens_Act.pdf#|archive-date=2012-09-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While substantial legislation is now in place in almost all of Africa, legal enforcement remains a challenge.

===Non-governmental organizations===
ILO has a number of projects in Africa that seek to reduce, and ultimately eliminate child labour in Africa. One such project, launched in 2006 is focussed on west African nations of [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Togo]]. This project, started in 2009, aims at worst forms of child labour in west Africa. It has two main components: the first will support national efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labour, while the second aims at mobilizing sub-regional policy makers and improving sub-regional cooperation for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour among all fifteen member States of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eliminating the Worst Forms of Child Labour in West Africa and Strengthening Sub-Regional Cooperation through ECOWAS–I|publisher=ILO, United Nations|year=2011|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/afpro/abuja/projects/nigecowas_1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KURET project, which is an acronym for Combating Exploitive Child Labor Through Education in [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Ethiopia]] Together, is a regional effort to prevent exploitive child labor through education. Funded by the United States Department of Labor and implemented by World Vision, the Academy for Educational Development, and the International Rescue Committee, KURET began in September 2004. The regional office is located in Kampala, Uganda. A report in 2009 claims it made a difference in the lives of thousands of children in this region of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Final Evaluation of the Combating Exploitive Child Labor Through Education in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Ethiopia Together (KURET) Project: Rwanda Country Report|author=Julian Ntezimana|year=2009|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/tcp/KURET-report3.pdf|access-date=2012-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209202550/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/tcp/KURET-report3.pdf#|archive-date=2012-12-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Confederación Empresarial de Sociedades Laborales de España''' ('''CONFESAL''') is a [[Spain|Spanish]] enterprise organization whose objectives are the representation and defense of the interests of companies in [[labor union|labor societies]] in Spain. CONFESAL formed on 4 July 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=afh0QNvA9OUC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Confederaci%C3%B3n+Empresarial+de+Sociedades+Laborales+de+Espa%C3%B1a+1987&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-6cuB04vXAhWQbFAKHSXcAH4Q6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Empresarial%20de%20Sociedades%20Laborales%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a%201987&amp;f=false|title=Diccionario de Economia Social, Volume 6|publisher=Ecobook - Editorial Del Economista |date=December 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Recommender systems}}

A '''decision support system''' ('''DSS''') is an [[Information systems|information system]] that supports business or organizational [[decision-making]] activities. DSSs serve the management, operations and planning levels of an organization (usually mid and higher management) and help people make decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified in advance—i.e. unstructured and semi-structured decision problems. Decision support systems can be either fully computerized or human-powered, or a combination of both.

While academics have perceived DSS as a tool to support [[decision making process]], DSS users see DSS as a tool to facilitate organizational processes.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, Peter; (1980),"Decision support systems : a research perspective."Cambridge, Massachusetts : Center for Information Systems Research, Alfred P. Sloan School of Management.http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/47172&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have extended the definition of DSS to include any [[system]] that might support [[decision making]] and some DSS include a [[decision-making software]] component; Sprague (1980)&lt;ref name='sprague1980'&gt;Sprague, R;(1980). "A Framework for the Development of Decision Support Systems." MIS Quarterly. Vol. 4, No. 4, pp.1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; defines a properly termed DSS as follows:
# DSS tends to be aimed at the less well structured, underspecified [[problem]] that upper level [[Management|manager]]s typically face;
# DSS attempts to combine the use of models or analytic techniques with traditional [[data access]] and retrieval functions;
# DSS specifically focuses on features which make them easy to use by non-computer-proficient people in an interactive mode; and
# DSS emphasizes [[flexibility]] and [[adaptability]] to accommodate changes in the [[Knowledge environment|environment]] and the [[decision making]] approach of the user.

DSSs include [[knowledge-based systems]]. A properly designed DSS is an interactive software-based system intended to help decision makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data, documents, and personal knowledge, or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions.

Typical information that a decision support application might gather and present includes:
*inventories of information assets (including legacy and relational data sources, cubes, [[data warehouse]]s, and [[data mart]]s),
*comparative sales figures between one period and the next,
*projected revenue figures based on product sales assumptions.

==History==
The concept of decision support has evolved mainly from the theoretical studies of organizational decision making done at the [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Institute of Technology]] during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the implementation work done in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Scott Morton "&gt;Keen, P. G. W. (1978). ''Decision support systems: an organizational perspective''. Reading, Mass., Addison-Wesley Pub. Co. {{ISBN|0-201-03667-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; DSS became an area of research of its own in the middle of the 1970s, before gaining in intensity during the 1980s. In the middle and late 1980s, [[executive information system]]s (EIS), group decision support systems (GDSS), and organizational decision support systems (ODSS) evolved from the single user and model-oriented DSS.

According to Sol (1987)&lt;ref name="HGS87"&gt;[[Henk G. Sol]] et al. (1987). ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence in decision support systems: proceedings of the Second Mini Euroconference, Lunteren, The Netherlands, 17–20 November 1985''. Springer, 1987. {{ISBN|90-277-2437-7}}. p.1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; the definition and scope of DSS has been migrating over the years: in the 1970s DSS was described as "a computer-based system to aid decision making"; in the late 1970s the DSS movement started focusing on "interactive computer-based systems which help decision-makers utilize data bases and models to solve ill-structured problems"; in the 1980s DSS should provide systems "using suitable and available technology to improve effectiveness of managerial and professional activities", and towards the end of 1980s DSS faced a new challenge towards the design of intelligent workstations.&lt;ref name="HGS87" /&gt;

In 1987, [[Texas Instruments]] completed development of the Gate Assignment Display System (GADS) for [[United Airlines]]. This decision support system is credited with significantly reducing travel delays by aiding the management of ground operations at various [[airport]]s, beginning with [[O'Hare International Airport]] in [[Chicago]] and Stapleton Airport in [[Denver]] [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Efraim Turban |author2=Jay E. Aronson |author3=Ting-Peng Liang |page=574 |year=2008 |title=Decision Support Systems and Intelligent Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in about 1990, [[data warehouse|data warehousing]] and [[Online analytical processing|on-line analytical processing]] (OLAP) began broadening the realm of DSS. As the turn of the millennium approached, new Web-based analytical applications were introduced.

The advent of more and better reporting technologies has seen DSS start to emerge as a critical component of  [[management]] design.  Examples of this can be seen in the intense amount of discussion of DSS in the education environment.

DSS also have a weak connection to the [[user interface]] paradigm of [[hypertext]].  Both the [[University of Vermont]] [[Problem-Oriented Medical Information System|PROMIS]] system (for medical decision making) and the Carnegie Mellon [[ZOG (hypertext)|ZOG]]/[[KMS (Hypertext)|KMS]] system (for military and business decision making) were decision support systems which also were major breakthroughs in user interface research.  Furthermore, although [[hypertext]] researchers have generally been concerned with [[information overload]], certain researchers, notably [[Douglas Engelbart]], have been focused on decision makers in particular.

==Taxonomies==
Using the relationship with the user as the criterion, Haettenschwiler&lt;ref name="Haettenschwiler 1999"&gt;Haettenschwiler, P. (1999). Neues anwenderfreundliches Konzept der Entscheidungsunterstützung. Gutes Entscheiden in Wirtschaft, Politik und Gesellschaft. Zurich, vdf Hochschulverlag AG: 189-208.&lt;/ref&gt; differentiates ''passive'', ''active'', and ''cooperative DSS''. A ''passive DSS'' is a system that aids the process of decision making, but that cannot bring out explicit decision suggestions or solutions. An ''active DSS'' can bring out such decision suggestions or solutions. A ''cooperative DSS'' allows for an iterative process between human and system towards the achievement of a consolidated solution: the decision maker (or its advisor) can modify, complete, or refine the decision suggestions provided by the system, before sending them back to the system for validation, and likewise the system again improves, completes, and refines the suggestions of the decision maker and sends them back to them for validation.

Another taxonomy for DSS, according to the mode of assistance, has been created by Daniel Power: he  differentiates ''communication-driven DSS'', ''data-driven DSS'', ''document-driven DSS'', ''knowledge-driven DSS'', and ''model-driven DSS''.&lt;ref name="Power 2002"&gt;Power, D. J. (2002). Decision support systems: concepts and resources for managers. Westport, Conn., Quorum Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*A '''communication-driven DSS''' enables cooperation, supporting more than one person working on a shared task; examples include integrated tools like Google Docs or [[Microsoft SharePoint Workspace]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanhope, P. (2002). Get in the Groove: building tools and peer-to-peer solutions with the Groove platform. New York, Hungry Minds&lt;/ref&gt;
*A '''data-driven DSS''' (or data-oriented DSS) emphasizes access to and manipulation of a [[time series]] of internal company data and, sometimes, external data.
*A '''document-driven DSS''' manages, retrieves, and manipulates unstructured information in a variety of electronic formats.
*A '''knowledge-driven DSS''' provides specialized [[problem-solving]] expertise stored as facts, rules, procedures, or in similar structures.&lt;ref name="Power 2002" /&gt;
*A '''model-driven DSS''' emphasizes access to and manipulation of a statistical, financial, optimization, or [[Computer Simulation|simulation]] model. Model-driven DSS use data and parameters provided by users to assist decision makers in analyzing a situation; they are not necessarily data-intensive. Dicodess is an example of an [[open-source model]]-driven DSS generator.&lt;ref&gt;Gachet, A. (2004). Building Model-Driven Decision Support Systems with Dicodess. Zurich, VDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using scope as the criterion, Power&lt;ref name="Power 1996"&gt;Power, D. J. (1996). What is a DSS? The On-Line Executive Journal for Data-Intensive Decision Support 1(3).&lt;/ref&gt; differentiates ''enterprise-wide DSS'' and ''desktop DSS''. An ''enterprise-wide DSS'' is linked to large data warehouses and serves many managers in the company. A ''desktop, single-user DSS'' is a small system that runs on an individual manager's PC.

==Components==
[[File:Drought Mitigation Decision Support System.png|thumb|360px|Design of a [[drought]] mitigation decision support system]]
Three fundamental components of a DSS [[Systems architecture|architecture]] are:&lt;ref name="Haettenschwiler 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Power 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sprague and Carlson 1982"&gt;Sprague, R. H. and E. D. Carlson (1982). Building effective decision support systems. Englewood Cㄴliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-086215-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haag, Cummings, ㅊㄴㅋMcCubbrey, Pinsonneault, Donovan (2000). Management Informatㅍㅈion Systems: For The Information Age. McGraw-Hill Ryerson Limited: 136-140. {{ISBN|0-07-281947-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marakas, G. M. 1999"&gt;Marakas, G. M. (1999). Decision support systems in the twenty-first century. Upper Saddle River, N.J., Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
# the [[database]] (or [[knowledge base]]),
# the [[Model (abstract)|model]] (i.e., the decision context and user criteria)
# the [[user interface]].

The [[End-user (computer science)|users]] themselves are also important components of the architecture.&lt;ref name="Haettenschwiler 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marakas, G. M. 1999" /&gt;

==Development frameworks==
Similarly to other systems, DSS systems require a structured approach. Such a framework includes people, technology, and the development approach.&lt;ref name="Sprague and Carlson 1982" /&gt;

The Early Framework of Decision Support System consists of four phases:
* '''Intelligence''' – Searching for conditions that call for decision; 
* '''Design''' – Developing and analyzing possible alternative actions of solution; 
* '''Choice''' – Selecting a course of action among those; 
* '''Implementation''' – Adopting the selected course of action in decision situation.

DSS technology levels (of hardware and software) may include:
#The actual application that will be used by the user. This is the part of the application that allows the decision maker to make decisions in a particular problem area. The user can act upon that particular problem.
#Generator contains Hardware/software environment that allows people to easily develop specific DSS applications. This level makes use of case tools or systems such as Crystal, [[Analytica (software)|Analytica]] and [[iThink]].
#Tools include lower level hardware/software. DSS generators including special languages, function libraries and linking modules

An iterative developmental approach allows for the DSS to be changed and redesigned at various intervals. Once the system is designed, it will need to be tested and revised where necessary for the desired outcome.

== Classification ==
There are several ways to classify DSS applications. Not every DSS fits neatly into one of the categories, but may be a mix of two or more architectures.

Holsapple and Whinston&lt;ref name="Holsapple Whinston 1996"&gt;Holsapple, C.W., and A. B. Whinston. (1996). Decision Support Systems: A Knowledge-Based Approach. St. Paul: West Publishing. {{ISBN|0-324-03578-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; classify DSS into the following six frameworks: text-oriented DSS, database-oriented DSS, spreadsheet-oriented DSS, solver-oriented DSS, rule-oriented DSS, and compound DSS. A compound DSS is the most popular classification for a DSS; it is a hybrid system that includes two or more of the five basic structures.&lt;ref name="Holsapple Whinston 1996" /&gt;

The support given by DSS can be separated into three distinct, interrelated categories:&lt;ref&gt;Hackathorn, R. D., and P. G. W. Keen. (1981, September). "Organizational Strategies for Personal Computing in Decision Support Systems." MIS Quarterly, Vol. 5, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal Support, Group Support, and Organizational Support.

DSS components may be classified as:
# '''Inputs:''' Factors, numbers, and characteristics to analyze
# '''User knowledge and expertise:''' Inputs requiring manual analysis by the user
# '''Outputs:'''  Transformed data from which DSS "decisions" are generated
# '''Decisions:'''  Results generated by the DSS based on user criteria

DSSs which perform selected [[cognitive]] decision-making functions and are based on [[artificial intelligence]] or [[intelligent agent]]s technologies are called [[intelligent decision support system]]s (IDSS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=F. Burstein |author2=C. W. Holsapple |year=2008 |title=Handbook on Decision Support Systems. Berlin: Springer Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nascent field of [[decision engineering]] treats the decision itself as an engineered object, and applies engineering principles such as [[design]] and [[quality assurance]] to an explicit representation of the elements that make up a decision.

==Applications==
DSS can theoretically be built in any knowledge domain.

One example is the [[clinical decision support system]] for [[medical diagnosis]]. There are four stages in the evolution of clinical decision support system (CDSS): the primitive version is standalone and does not support integration; the second generation supports integration with other medical systems; the third is standard-based, and the fourth is service model-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=A|author2=Sittig, D|title=A framework and model for evaluating clinical decision support architectures q|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|date=2008|volume=41|pages=982–990|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2008.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DSS is extensively used in business and management. [[Executive dashboard]] and other business performance software allow faster decision making, identification of negative trends, and better allocation of business resources. Due to DSS all the information from any organization is represented in the form of charts, graphs i.e. in a summarized way, which helps the management to take strategic decision. For example, one of the DSS applications is the management and development of complex anti-terrorism systems.&lt;ref name = "Zhang &amp; Babovic"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=S.X. |last2=Babovic |first2=V. |year=2011 |title=An evolutionary real options framework for the design and management of projects and systems with complex real options and exercising conditions |journal=Decision Support Systems |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=119–129 |doi= 10.1016/j.dss.2010.12.001|ssrn= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220197192_An_evolutionary_real_options_framework_for_the_design_and_management_of_projects_and_systems_with_complex_real_options_and_exercising_conditions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include a bank loan officer verifying the credit of a loan applicant or an engineering firm that has bids on several projects and wants to know if they can be competitive with their costs.

A growing area of DSS application, concepts, principles, and techniques is in [[agriculture|agricultural production]], marketing for [[sustainable development]].  For example, the [[DSSAT| DSSAT4]] package,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aglearn.net/resources/isfm/DSSAT.pdf DSSAT4 (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icasa.net/dssat/ The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer]&lt;/ref&gt; developed through financial support of [[USAID]] during the 80s and 90s, has allowed rapid assessment of several agricultural production systems around the world to facilitate decision-making at the farm and policy levels. [[Precision agriculture]] seeks to tailor decisions to particular portions of farm fields. There are, however, many constraints to the successful adoption on DSS in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, W. and Middleton, T. (2002). Why has the uptake of Decision Support Systems been so poor? In: Crop-soil simulation models in developing countries. 129-148 (Eds R.B. Matthews and William Stephens). Wallingford:CABI.&lt;/ref&gt;

DSS are also prevalent in [[forest management]] where the long planning horizon and the spatial dimension of planning problems demands specific requirements. All aspects of Forest management, from log transportation, harvest scheduling to sustainability and ecosystem protection have been addressed by modern DSSs. In this context the consideration of single or multiple management objectives related to the provision of goods and services that traded or non-traded and often subject to resource constraints and decision problems. The Community of Practice of Forest Management Decision Support Systems provides a large repository on knowledge about the construction and use of forest Decision Support Systems.&lt;ref&gt;Community of Practice Forest Management Decision Support Systems, http://www.forestdss.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A specific example concerns the [[Canadian National Railway]] system, which tests its equipment on a regular basis using a decision support system. A problem faced by any [[railroad]] is worn-out or defective rails, which can result in hundreds of [[derailment]]s per year. Under a DSS, the Canadian National Railway system managed to decrease the incidence of derailments at the same time other companies were experiencing an increase.

''Women In Trousers'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchessini|first=Demetri|title=Women In Trousers|year=2003|publisher=Ionian Illustrated Press|location=London|isbn=0954510704}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a photo-essay on women's fashion which aroused much controversy when it was published, and received critical coverage in several newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldwin|first=Clare|title=The man who hates women in trousers|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-105901508.htm|accessdate=6 September 2012|newspaper=The Mirror|date=28 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Does HIS bum look bug in this|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Does+HIS+bum+look+big+in+this%3F-a0106797855|accessdate=6 September 2012|newspaper=The Western Mail|date=August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liz Hoggard in ''The Observer'' describing it as "offensive, outdated, misogynistic claptrap."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoggard|first=Liz|title=Girls, if you want to get a man, drop your trousers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/jul/27/fashion.shopping|accessdate=6 September 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "Women know that men don't like trousers, yet they deliberately wear them".&lt;ref name="BBC220513"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22631003|title=UKIP donor Demetri Marchessini quits after controversy over views on women|first=Ross|last=Hawkins|publisher=BBC News|date=22 May 2013|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him: "This is hostile behaviour - they are deliberately dressing in a way that is opposite to what men would like. It is behaviour that flies against common sense, and also flies against the normal human desire to please."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Watt [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/may/17/ukip-donor-women-hostile-trousers "Ukip donor brands women 'hostile' for wearing trousers"], theguardian.com, 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A later book, ''Scams &amp; Hypocrisies''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchessini|first=D P|title=Scams &amp; Hypocrisies|year=2010|publisher=Askelon Publishing|location=London|isbn=9780956462206}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at perceived popular myths. On his blog, Marchessini has written that unmarried mothers are "naughty girls" who deserve a "smack" and that date rape accusations can only be meaningless because without a "violent act it is difficult to know whether any rape took place".&lt;ref&gt;Rowena Mason, and Steven Swinford [https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=opera&amp;q=%22Demetri+Marchessini%22&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=suggest "Ukip donor says women in trousers are 'hostile' and unmarried mothers need a 'smack'"], telegraph.co.uk, 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 2014, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' published an advertisement by Marchessini, in effect a comment piece which took the form of an 'open letter to [[Libby Purves]]'. in which he criticised the 'pro-gay' opinions of ''[[The Times]]'' columnist and dismissed her opposition to the government policies of Russia's [[Vladimir Putin]] on this issue which she had expressed in an article on 20 January.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Greenslade [https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jan/28/dailytelegraph-thetimes "Daily Telegraph publishes advert attacking 'pro-gay' Times columnist Libby Purves"], (Greenslade blog), theguardian.com, 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Responding, Purves was quoted in the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'': "He is free to approve of the beatings and hangings of young men across the world in the name of what he considers religion. In the same spirit, I am free to say he is a loony."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/progay-libby-purves-gets-a-ticking-off-from-ukip-9090566.html "Pro-gay Libby Purves gets a ticking off from Ukip"], ''London Evening Standard'', 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Marchessini made donations totalling £10,000 money to the [[UK Independence Party]],&lt;ref name="BBC220513"/&gt; ultimately&lt;!-- See below, the £10,000 was inaccurate. --&gt; the sixth largest donor to the party that year.&lt;ref name="C4 News3004"/&gt; Following criticism of his views in 2013, he stated he will no longer give money to UKIP: "There's been such a fuss about what I've given it's a bore."&lt;ref name="BBC220513"/&gt; At the time of the Telegraph advertisement, a UKIP spokeswoman said that Marchessini had severed his connection with the party after the organisation had "publicly opposed the crazy female trouser-wearing comments."&lt;ref&gt;Rowena Mason and Esther Addley [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/28/ukip-donor-telegraph-advert-sodomy-crime-libby-purves "Ukip donor pays for Telegraph advert to claim 'sodomy has always been a crime'"], ''The Guardian'', 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Channel 4 News'' interview===
In the run-up to the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European Parliament election]], [[Michael Crick]] of [[Channel 4 News]] interviewed Marchessini, in what Crick believed was the businessman's first ever television interview.&lt;ref&gt;''Channel 4 News'', 30 April 2014. This is also stated in the accompanying article.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to earlier reports, UKIP had continued to solicit donations from him, and a further donation of £5,000 (in addition to the previously admitted £10,000) had been made on 24 December 2013.&lt;ref name="C4 News3004"/&gt;

In the interview, Marchessini also asserted that homosexuals are motivated by lust rather than love, said that rape was impossible within a marriage, and reasserted his opinions about women wearing trousers. According to him, only skirts excite men and he advocates a ban on the practice of women wearing trousers:&lt;ref name="C4 News3004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/04/30/ukip-donor-gay-people-are-incapable-of-love-and-wives-cannot-be-raped-by-their-husbands/|title=UKIP donor: Gay people are incapable of love and wives cannot be raped by their husbands|publisher=[[Pink News]]|author=Scott Roberts|date=30 April 2014|accessdate=30 December 2014}} Swear word censored in the source and bleeped out in the television report.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|because that is the only way the world is going to continue. Because if they don't men are going to stop fucking them. Do you understand, and may I tell you with great respect, that the incidents of love making in Western Europe have fallen drastically?}}

{{Expand German|Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau|date=April 2011}}
The '''Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau''' is a [[Small and medium enterprises|medium-sized]] [[furniture|furniture-manufacturing]] business in the [[Hellerau]] district of the German city of [[Dresden]]. The company archives are deemed a valuable cultural asset and were provided with legal protection.
[[File:Dresden-HellerauDW.jpg|thumbnail|Original Hellerau workshops]]

==Company history==

The workshops were founded October 1, 1898&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Something to Celebrate|url=http://www.dwh.de/en/aktuell/details/article/something-to-celebrate/|website=www.dwh.de/|publisher=Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau GmbH|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Karl Schmidt-Hellerau]] (1873-1948) under the name '''Dresdner Werkstätten für Handwerkskunst Schmidt und Engelbrecht''', or Schmidt and Engelbrecht Dresdner workshops for craftsmanship. His partner 
In 1898-1899 Karl Schmidt-Hellerau and Johann Vincenz Cissarz developed a closet using plywood panels. They continued developing the technique of using plywood. In 1941 they received a patent for thermally tempered wood.

In 1907, Karl Schmidt-Hellerau established an industrial technical school and training workshops. Its first head was Joseph August Lux.

The cornerstone of a new factory was laid in 1909 in what is today Dresden-Hellerau at the same time as work began on the  [[Garden city movement|garden city]] of [[Hellerau]]. Following the commissioning of the new production hall, the company moved there in 1910. At the time the firm occupied 450 employees.

Despite the severe global economic crisis in 1929, the years of National Socialism and the devastation of the Second World War and the socialist planned economy in the [[GDR]], the company has endured. In 1967 the workshops began mass production of the Möbelprogramm Deutsche Werkstätten (MDW), a modular system developed by Rudolf Horn which remained in production for 24 years. Starting in 1970 Hellerau was the main plant of the [[Volkseigener Betrieb]] Möbelkombinat Hellerau, an industrial grouping of furniture producers of East Germany.

Following [[German reunification|reunification]] in 1991, the company was transformed into a [[GmbH]] in [[1992 in Germany|1992]] and privatized by the [[Treuhandanstalt|Treuhand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.dwh.de/en/mythos/chronology/|website=www.dwh.de|publisher=Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau GmbH|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then employed 80 people, with a focus on fulfilling public sector procurement.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0902-0120, Leipzig, Messe, Möbelausstellung.jpg|thumbnail|DWH wall units displayed at the [[Leipzig Trade Fair]], 1974]]
At the beginning of the 21st century, Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau employed over 200 people worldwide, with foreign subsidiaries and sales representatives in England and France.

==Social Commitment==
During his years in England, Karl Schmidt-Hellerau became familiar with the idea of the [[Garden city movement|garden city]]. In reaction to the conditions of worker's housing in [[Dresden]], he decided together with other people, among them Friedrich Naumann, to build [[Germany]]'s first garden city. This was accomplished in 1909.

==Awards==
*Three bronze medals at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris World Fair in 1900]]
*Awards at the Universal Exhibitions of [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|1904 in St. Louis]] and [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 in Paris]].

== The term "computer art" ==
On the title page of the magazine [[Computers and Automation]], January 1963, [[Edmund Berkeley]] published a picture by [[Efraim Arazi]] from 1962, coining for it the term "computer art." This picture inspired him to initiate the first [[Computer Art Contest]] in 1963. The annual contest was a key point in the development of computer art up to the year 1973.&lt;ref&gt;http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/Publication/206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W.

'''Eric Magnus Campbell Tigerstedt''' (August 14, 1887 &amp;ndash; April 20, 1925) was one of the most significant inventors in Finland at the beginning of the 20th century and has been called the "[[Thomas Edison]] of Finland". He was a pioneer of [[sound film|sound-on-film]] technology and made significant improvements to the amplification capacity of the [[vacuum tube|vacuum valve]]. Having seen a showing of the [[Lumière brothers]]' new motion picture technology as a 9-year-old boy in Helsinki in 1896, he was inspired to bring sound to silent pictures.

Many years later, in 1914, his demonstration film ''Word and Picture'' was presented to a gathering of scientific dignitaries in [[Berlin]], but his invention was never commercialised. In addition to improving the triode vacuum valve, he developed directional loudspeakers. Tigerstedt also predicted such future inventions as television and the mobile phone, and in 1917 he filed a patent for what he described as a "pocket-size folding telephone with a very thin carbon microphone". Tigerstedt was awarded a total of 71 patents in several countries between the years 1912 and 1924.

== Life ==

===Early interest in technology===
Tigerstedt was born in [[Helsinki]] and started to show a particular interest in all things technical at an early age. He studied his father’s scientific books with great interest, and at age 11 he built a simple [[photographic]] device. At age 13, he began experimenting with other technical devices and machines, and he built his own version of an [[electric motor]] and electrical [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. After a falling out with his father, he left home at the age of 15, supporting himself by working as a handyman and [[technician]] in mechanical workshops and shipyards in Helsinki. He later worked as a technician in the [[telephone]] industry, which was rapidly becoming a major business in Helsinki at that time.

===Studies in Germany===
In 1908, Tigerstedt moved to Germany to continue his studies. He completed his high school education and began studies in [[electrical engineering]] at the [[Friedrichs Polytechnikum]] in [[Köthen (Anhalt)|Köthen]]. After completing his studies there in 1911, he moved back to Finland with his fiancée Marjatta Nybom, whom he had met and fallen in love with while in Köthen. She had been studying the violin in Switzerland and met Tigersted through her brother Albert Nybom, who was also studying in Köthen and was a classmate of Tigerstedt. However, the engagement between Tigerstedt and Marjatta Nybom was broken off in 1912.

===Sound-on-film prototype===
After returning to Finland, he continued his experiments and succeeded in building a prototype of [[sound-on-film]] technology ("talking movies"). Tigerstedt then returned to Germany in 1913 and founded a company with the Swedish merchant [[Axel Wahlstedt]] and the Swedish engineer [[Hugo Swartling]]. This was the first in a series of unsuccessful business ventures. Although Tigerstedt was able to complete his work with the sound-on-film technology, the partners' [[laboratory]] was eventually confiscated due to unpaid rent. They managed to reclaim their laboratory, but it was then destroyed in a fire. The cooperation between Wahlstedt and Tigerstedt became strained and in January 1914 they dissolved their company. After breaking off their commercial partnership, Wahlstedt returned to Sweden, while Tigerstedt stayed behind in Berlin, more or less broke.

===Demonstration of sound-on-film===
Tigerstedt continued working on his sound-on-film technology and made progress in solving a major technical problem, that of how to amplify film audio sufficiently to fill a large theatre or hall. He did this by making major improvements to the vacuum tube design of [[Lee de Forest]], increasing the [[amplifier|amplification]] capacity substantially. In February–March 1914, Tigerstedt demonstrated his sound-on-film technology to a small group of scientists, using his own film ''Word and Picture''.

===1914-1917===
After being expelled from Germany in July 1914, Tigerstedt returned to Finland, but he moved to [[Sweden]] a few months later and then to [[Denmark]] in 1915. After another unsuccessful business venture, Tigerstedt once more returned to Finland. In 1917, he moved back to Denmark and founded yet another company, which was then sold. After that, he participated in the founding of the Norwegian company A/S Anod, in which he held a 45% stake.

===Finnish Civil War of 1918===
As a Finnish citizen, Tigerstedt was called back to take part in the [[Finnish civil war]] of 1918, and on 14 February 1918 he was on his way back to Finland. After the cessation of hostilities, he participated in the victory parade on 16 May 1918, but then returned to Denmark, where he married Ingrid Lignell in 1919. Their son Carl Axel Waldemar was born in 1921. However, their marriage soon began to deteriorate, and they separated not long after the birth of their son.

===Loss of German patents===
During [[World War I]], Germany invalidated all of Tigerstedt's patents. After the war, he received compensation from the German government, but the sum quickly became worthless due to the [[hyperinflation]] in Germany during 1921 to 1923. In 1922, Tigerstedt moved his laboratory to Finland and founded a new company called “Tigerstedts patenter”, which however also failed.

===Move to America===
In 1923, Tigerstedt moved to America where he founded his last company, the Tiger Manufacturing Co., to produce small [[Receiver (radio)|radio receivers]] and [[Cryptography|cryptographic devices]]. The Mexican government purchased two of the cryptographic devices, and the radio receivers also sold relatively well. Tigerstedt had the opportunity to meet with the great American inventor [[Thomas Alva Edison]], who wrote a letter of recommendation for Tigerstedt to the director of the [[Department of Commerce]].

=== Death ===
When it finally seemed that Tigerstedt was on the verge of commercial success, he was involved in an ultimately fatal car accident on April 20, 1924, when another car unexpectedly turned in front of the car Tigerstedt was travelling in. There were persistent rumours that a competitor had arranged for the accident, but there was never any proof of this.

Exactly one year later, on April 20, 1925, he succumbed to [[tuberculosis]] at the New York [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] Hospital, possibly due to side effects from his injuries in the car accident. He wrote his last letter to his brother Göran, in which he described the state of his company, explained the structure of a new [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|membrane]] that he was developing,&lt;ref&gt;Item ''a'' in [http://www.fsfl.se/voxbilder/filmhist/tigerstedt_2.jpg Image labelled "Zu der Patentschrift 309535"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsfl.se/backspegel/tigerstedt.html described as "membran" in its caption] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012532/http://www.fsfl.se/backspegel/tigerstedt.html |date=2007-09-27 }}, appears suitable to function as an [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|acoustic diaphragm]].&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that he was about to undergo a [[kidney]] operation due to the spreading tuberculosis. Unfortunately, medical science was not advanced enough to be able to save his life. After his death, his brother travelled to America and brought his ashes home for burial in Helsinki. As with many inventors, Tigerstedt's inventions were never fully appreciated during his own lifetime.

== Inventions ==
Tigerstedt experimented in many areas. He developed a new version of the [[shotgun]] that could be fired using the thumbs and that counted the number of shots fired. Unfortunately, he was perennially short of funds, and he did not have enough financial standing to file for a [[patent]].

===Sound-on-film technology===
Tigerstedt's greatest interest was in the field of sound recording. He had developed a prototype for recording sound on a metal wire as early as 1912 and was convinced that he could find a way to record sound directly on motion picture film. He started his first experiments in [[Helsinki]] using very primitive equipment. The sentence he attempted to record was in [[German language|German]]: "Grau ist alle Theorie. Grün ist nur des Lebens Baum". Finally, he succeeded and he called his invention the "photomagnetophone". Unfortunately, his achievements did not gain any recognition, nor did he reap any financial gains from his invention, so he had to maintain a day job in order to earn a modest living and could only continue his experiments in the evenings and into the nights, sometimes working all through the night without any sleep.
After meeting his former schoolmate Alfred Nybom in Berlin, he succeeded in using Nybom's connections to gain access to a [[research]] laboratory and employment as an inventor. Film with audio was recognised as a commercially promising field of endeavour, but Tigerstedt's invention needed further development before it could be commercialised. There was as yet no technology available to electronically amplify the audio signal sufficiently to fill a large movie theatre. Tigerstedt also enlarged his vision of [[video]] [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] in the future. He wrote: "There will come a time when people can sit at home and follow events in the world through a device I now call the 'electronic eye'. When people get used to film with sound, they will soon adopt the electric eye, or electrophtalmoscope". When his father learned of his thinking, he tried to persuade him to not let his imagination carry him away, " ... otherwise you will surely end your days in the [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] in [[Lapinlahti]]."

Tigerstedt returned to Germany in 1913 and continued developing the photomagnetophone, but there was still no solution to the problem of amplification. He experimented with early versions of the vacuum tube and eventually was able to amplify the sound, but with disappointing results.

Tigerstedt also continued developing the electrophtalmoscope. The prototype consisted of vibrating mirrors in both the sending and receiving apparatus, using the photoelectric properties of a [[selenium]] element at the sender and a [[light]] source at the receiving end which was [[modulation|modulated]] using a [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] device. The received picture was supposed to be displayed on a movie [[Projection screen|screen]]. Two electrophtalmoscopes were built and an experiment was conducted using an electrical cable running from London to Berlin. Tigerstedt arranged several demonstrations and gained a reputation as a knowledgeable scientist.

===Improving on Lee de Forest's vacuum tube===
Tigerstedt stubbornly continued to grapple with the problems of the early vacuum tubes, which were inefficient, expensive and prone to breaking. His German colleagues told him that the vacuum tubes could not be developed further and that there could be no solution to the problem with the weakness of amplification. Tigerstedt, however, continued to experiment and eventually succeeded in substantially improving on the design of [[Lee De Forest]], achieving much greater amplification than that of the original valves. Tigerstedt also patented his improvement of the [[triode]] vacuum valve, which consisted of improving the amplification by rearranging the [[electrodes]] cylindrically in the tube, changing the [[glass]] mold to prevent [[vacuum]] loss and using steel mirrors inside the tubes to prevent electrostatic [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]]. He had finally solved the most difficult practical problems of talking movies. It is worth noting that his achievement was purely experimental, as there were no prior experiments or mathematical models that he could have followed.

===Patent for sound-on-film technology and expulsion from Germany===
This was a major step forward for Tigerstedt, and he was soon able to show a film with sound which was electronically amplified and reproduced through a speaker system. Beginning in 1919, de Forest created his own sound-on-film system, which he called [[Phonofilm]] and which used some of Tigerstedt's concepts, along with some of the [[Tri-Ergon]] group and of inventor [[Theodore Case]]. Tigerstedt was awarded a German patent (number 309,536) on July 28, 1914 for his [[sound-on-film]] process.

One month later, Tigerstedt was summoned by the German authorities, told that he had been declared an unwanted Russian citizen, and given three days to leave the country. [[World War I]] had started and Finland was at that time part of the Russian empire, having been ceded to Russia after the [[Finnish War|1808-1809 war between Sweden and Russia]]. As another consequence of the declaration of war between Russia and Germany, the German government invalidated all German patents held by citizens of enemy nations.

===Ultrasound experiments===
Tigerstedt moved to Denmark, where he continued working on film sound recording devices at the Petersen &amp; Poulsen company. He befriended the Danish inventor [[Valdemar Poulsen]] (1869–1942), who was the inventor of the [[telegraphone]] steel wire magnetic recorder. Tigerstedt, too, had experimented with recording sound on a steel wire. He attempted to transmit speech across the [[Jutland]] straits using 30 [[Hertz|kHz]] ultrasound, but the results were not promising. He also experimented with transmitting sound underwater, which was more successful, and he was eventually granted a patent for this process.

===Communication device===
A [[Aviator|pilot]] suggested to Tigerstedt that he should develop a device to facilitate communication between two pilots while seated one behind the other in an open [[biplane]]. Tigerstedt invented a device which had a very small earpiece that could be plugged into the ear. Tigerstedt spent considerable time on designing the earpiece. The device was also found to be helpful to people who were hard of hearing, offering a possible alternative to the large ear trumpets then in use as hearing aids.

Its members are national sectorial digital SME associations in 28 countries and regions in the [[EU]] and neighboring countries, all together it associates more than 20.000 SMEs. DIGITAL SME was established in 2007 (back then it was named Pan European ICT &amp; eBusiness Network for SME) to represent the voice of ICT SMEs and their interests in the European institutions and other international organisations. DIGITAL SME is the first European association of the ICT sector exclusively.  A current president is [[Oliver Grün]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/pin-sme-changed-name-european-digital-sme-alliance/ European Digital SME Alliance], PIN-SME changed its name into European DIGITAL SME Alliance, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holacloud.eu/launch-of-the-european-digital-sme-alliance-at-cebit2016/ Hola Cloud], Launch of the European Digital SME Alliance at CEBIT2016, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/oliver-grun-elected-president-european-digital-sme-association/ European Digital SME Alliance], Oliver Grün elected President of the European Digital SME Association Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and main achievements ==

Following a prominent public discussion on patentability of software, the Pan European ICT &amp; eBusiness Network for SMEs was founded in 2007. Its establishment was initiated by [[UEAPME]] (European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ueapme.com/ Official website UEAPME],  Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; whose member DIGITAL SME has been from then on.

In 2013, the Pan European ICT &amp; eBusiness Network for SMEs was among the founding members of SBS (Small Business Standards).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs-sme.eu/ SBS], The European association representing and supporting SMEs in the standardisation process. Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, DIGITAL SME representatives have always been appointed to SBS Board, and its experts have been taking part in the technical committees of European [[standardisation]] bodies: George Sharkov – [[ETSI]] TC CYBER expert, Massimo Vanetti – OneM2M expert, Fabio Guasconi – ISO/IEC JCT 1 SC 27 expert, George Babinov – ETSI ATTM expert, Emil Dimitrov – ETSI TCCE expert.

In 2016, the Pan European ICT &amp; eBusiness Network for SMEs has changed its name to European DIGITAL SME Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/pin-sme-changed-name-european-digital-sme-alliance/ European Digital SME Alliance], PIN-SME changed its name into European DIGITAL SME Alliance Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, it became a founding member of another important body – European Cyber Security Organisation ([[ECSO]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ecs-org.eu/cppp ESCO], About the cPPP, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/commissioner-oettinger-launches-eu-cyber-security-partnership-digital-sme-founding-partner/ European Digital SME Alliance], Commissioner Oettinger launches EU Cyber Security Partnership – DIGITAL SME as founding partner Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; DIGITAL SME is particularly active also in the management of ECSO: its President Oliver Grün was appointed as SME member of ECSO Managing Board and of the Partnership Board,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/digital-sme-president-oliver-grun-appointed-sme-board-member-ecso-european-cyber-security-organisation/ Digital SME], DIGITAL SME President Oliver Grün appointed SME Board Member at ECSO, the European Cyber Security Organisation Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; while DIGITAL SME’s Secretary General Sebastiano Toffaletti is chairing the WG4 - Support to SMEs, coordination with countries (in particular East and Central EU) and regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecs-org.eu/working-groups/wg4-support-to-smes-coordination-with-countries-in-particular-east-and-central-eu-and-regions ESCO], WG4: Support to SMEs, coordination with countries (in particular East and Central EU) and regions, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year (2016), DIGITAL SME has also became a member and a pledger &lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-4081_en.htm European Commission], Commission launches Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition to help Europeans in their career and daily life, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.neweurope.eu/press-release/commission-launches-digital-skills-and-jobs-coalition-to-help-europeans-in-their-career-and-daily-life/ New Europa], Commission launches Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition to help Europeans in their career and daily life Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; of the newly created Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/become-member-digital-skills-and-jobs-coalition European Commission], Become a member of the Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; - an initiative created by the European Commission to tackle e-skills gap in Europe.

In the period of 2015-2016, DIGITAL SME was campaigning for the creation of an open market for data usage, where both manufacturers and users of data-producing machines are entitled to use the data. DIGITAL SME’s recommendations were taken up by the [[European Commission]] that announced the Communication on Building a European Data Economy&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-5_en.htm?locale=en European Commission], Commission outlines next steps towards a European data economy, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanying Staff Working document.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/staff-working-document-free-flow-data-and-emerging-issues-european-data-economy European Commission], Staff Working Document on the free flow of data and emerging issues of the European data economy, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The reference was made to DIGITAL SME’s position paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/digital/uploads/PS056-DIGITAL-SME_Position_Paper_Data_Economy.pdf  European Digital SME Alliance], Data Economy: an open data market unleashing

In May 2017, European DIGITAL SME Alliance launched the #digitalSME4skills campaign&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/digitalsme4skills/about-the-campaign/ European Digital SME Alliance], About the campaign Digital SME 4 Skills, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; that was initiated in the framework of Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition. The campaign calls European SMEs to train young professionals and help them gaining digital skills through Apprenticeship schemes. In addition, DIGITAL SME President Oliver Grün joined the Coalition’s governing board.

In July 2017, reacting to the upcoming review of European Cybersecurity Strategy, European DIGITAL SME Alliance has published its position paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/digital/uploads/20170731-DIGITAL-SME-Cybersecurity-Position.pdf European Digital SME Alliance], European Cybersecurity Strategy: Fostering the SME ecosystem, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; on cybersecurity, developed in a cooperation with ECSO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/europe-needs-cybersecurity-strategy-foster-sme-ecosystem/ European Digital SME Alliance], Europe needs a cybersecurity strategy to foster its SME ecosystem, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Corporate law|by country}}

'''French company law''' is the law governing corporations incorporated in [[France]] or under French corporate law.

==History==
In the wake of the [[French Revolution]] in 1791, the right to free registration for all private companies was proclaimed. There was a boom in registrations, but this was followed by a bust in 1793. The law was reversed until 1796 when the principle of free incorporation was established again.

The law was consolidated in Napoleon's ''[[Code de commerce]]'' of 1807 using a concession system. While previously public companies with special privileges were created by a special act of the state, the ''Code'' allowed the companies to be formed according to general company law rules. Specific state permission was still required. Article 33 recognised [[limited liability]] for members.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 33 Code de Commerce, adopted by Law No. 2804, November 1807, Bull. des Lois No. 164 (1808), 161–299 (France).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Code de commerce'' was applicable outside France in [[Baden]] and the [[Prussian Rhine]] province, and it came to serve as a model for all later European public company statutes. The first German public company statute was the Prussian Act of 1843, five years after the Prussian Act on railway enterprises of 1838. Under the ''[[Loi sur les Sociétés]]'' of 1867 France adopted a system for free registration of companies.&lt;ref&gt;See Law of July 24, 1867 amending the Code de Commerce, Bull. des Lois 11e S., B. 1513, n. 15, 328 p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horst van Cuyck''' (29 July 1939 – 26 June 2014) was a German business consultant.

== Biography ==
Horst Bernhard Gerd Hans van Cuyck, born in [[Göttingen]] on 29 July 1939, was the youngest son of [[Ernst Merk]] (1903–1975) and Beatrice van Cuyck (1901–1990). He had two sisters and one brother: Ingrid, Armgard and Albert. His paternal grandmother, Marie Sedlmayr, was a descendant of the famous [[Munich]] Sedlmayr family, owners of the [[Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu|Spaten and Franziskaner breweries]]. His maternal grandfather, Hans Friedrich van Cuyck (1880–1943), married to Carolina Hayotte (1880–1961), was a paediatrician in [[Krefeld]].

Up until 1945, due to the war, Horst van Cuyck mainly stayed in [[Walchsee]] (Austria), where the Sedlmayrs had a house. His father was captured in [[Courland]] on 11 May 1945 and remained in Russian captivity until October 1955.

Horst van Cuyck returned to [[Göttingen]] in 1947, where he attended school. After his [[Abitur]] in [[Bayreuth]], he studied [[Business Administration]] in [[Munich]] and was simultaneously in training at the [[Deutsche Bank]] there. He worked as an employee of the [[HypoVereinsbank|Bayerische Vereinsbank]] in [[Munich]] and of [[Merrill Lynch]] in [[Frankfurt]] and [[Munich]]. In 1971, he became Deputy Manager of [[Merrill Lynch]] [[Munich]], in 1973 Manager of [[E. F. Hutton &amp; Co.|E.F. Hutton]] Munich and in 1976 Manager of [[E. F. Hutton &amp; Co.|E.F. Hutton]] Germany.
From 1977, he became an independent business consultant and a few years later, he founded the company Diomedes AG in [[Meggen]] (Switzerland).
Horst van Cuyck had two sons (Christoph, born in 1968 and Alexander, born in 1969) from his first marriage to Helene Marie Haarmann (died 1990) and two children from his second marriage. On 28 January 2013, he married Caroline Gräfin von Arco-Zinnerberg.

Horst van Cuyck died in Munich on 26 June 2014 and was buried in [[Walchsee]].

== Heart for art and culture ==
Horst van Cuyck was an avid collector of art and antiques. It was his passion for the arts that drove him to study Art History and Archaeology at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] between 1991 and 1994. From 2010 to 2015, he financed a Chair in Art History and an assistant position at the [[University of Bern]]. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the [[Bavarian National Museum]] and of the Friends of the [[Munich Philharmonic]]. Moreover, he belonged to the inner circle of the Munich [[Glyptothek]].

Horst van Cuyck was involved in several exhibitions, including The Legacy of Charlemagne (Ename, [[Oudenaarde]], Provincial Heritage Centre, 9 May to 30 November 2014) and Offiziersehre und Widerstand. Das Reiterregiment 17 und die Wurzeln des Staatsstreiches vom 20. Juli 1944 ([[Ingolstadt]], Bavarian Army Museum, permanent exhibition since 25 November 2014 in Reduit Tilly).

== A rich family history ==
Horst van Cuyck was passionate about history in general and the history of the van Cuyck family, in particular, which goes far back in time and starts in the 11th century with Herman van Malsen and Ida van Boulogne, the sister of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and daughter of [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne]] and [[Ida of Lorraine|St Ida]]. Their descendants developed a power base in the area of [[Cuijk]] (Netherlands), but also in [[Utrecht]], [[Liège]], [[Namur]] and [[Hoogstraten]]. They were lords, but also, and above all, diplomats who often carried out foreign assignments on behalf of English and French royalty or comital and ducal families. From the 16th century, the van Cuycks were mayors or aldermen in [[Utrecht]]. One branch of the family founded a large peat company. They were, and remained, Catholic and that is why, in the 17th century, they moved to the area of [[Afferden, Limburg|Afferden]] (which belonged to the [[Southern Netherlands]]). A little later, they crossed the border and continued their history in Germany.

[[File:Wapenschild van Cuyck.jpg|thumb|Coat of Arms of Horst van Cuyck]]

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms consists of three different elements:
* In the first and the fourth quarter, we identify the coat of arms of the [[County of Boulogne|Counts of Boulogne]], a reference to [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne]] and his wife [[Ida of Lorraine|St Ida]], the parents of Ida of Boulogne who became the matriarch of the van Cuyck family.
* In the second and the third quarter, we can see the coat of arms of the lords of [[Cuijk]], obviously a reference to the medieval history of the van Cuyck family.
* Above the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] we see a gold crown, a reference to the comital title of the lords of [[Cuijk]].

The coat of arms of Horst van Cuyck is registered on the [[roll of arms]] of the ‘’Münchner Herold’’ under No. 092/11899.

It is out of this relationship that "Methodology for Creating Business Knowledge" was born and developed. His dissertation containing what is now considered classic methodological reorientations.&lt;ref name = "Sage1997"&gt;[http://www.arbnor.se/ingeman/ingeman.html About the Authors of "Methodology for Creating Business Knowledge"].

=== Methodology for Creating Business Knowledge ===
The book "Methodology for Creating Business Knowledge" (1997) wants to give the reader a foundation for handling questions about knowledge creation and for doing research efficiently and effectively in different situations and for various clients and employers.&lt;ref name = "Mark07"&gt;[http://amarvell.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default Research methods for Information Technology]. by Dr. Mark, 14 December 2007. Retrieved 26 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It describes and compares three different methodological approaches for gaining business knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;Ingeman Arbnor, Bjorn Bjerke (2007). ''Methodology for Creating Business Knowledge''. Sage Publications, Inc, 1997. Back cover.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* the analytical approach,
* the systems approach,
* and the actor's approach.

The Analytic Approach is the positivist approach, the Systems Approach favors the development of explanatory models and the Actors Approach is more commonly known as "[[structuration theory]]," which derives from the work of [[Anthony Giddens]], ''Central Problems in Social Theory'' from 1979 and ''The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration'' from 1984.&lt;ref name = "Mark07"/&gt;

It then examines the consequences of using each approach in various practical and theoretical situations. Techniques discussed include historical studies, case studies, dialogues, language development, collecting data, measurement, controlling reliability, and validation. Arbnor &amp; Bjerke further argue that qualitative research methods must be consistent with the epistemological presumptions of the researcher, the theory and the research problem.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Marschan (2004).

'''Innovation economics''' is a growing economic theory that emphasizes [[entrepreneurship]] and [[innovation]]. Ir is based on two fundamental tenets --  the central goal of economic policy should be to spur higher [[productivity]] through greater [[innovation]], and that markets relying on [[Information|input]] [[resource]]s and [[price signal]]s alone will not always be as effective in spurring higher [[productivity]] and [[economic growth]].

This is in contrast to the two other conventional economic doctrines, [[neoclassical economics]] and [[Keynesian economics]].

==Historical origins==

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] was one of the first and most important scholars who extensively tackled the question of innovation in Economics.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Theorie der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung'' (1911), ''Business Cycles'' (1939) and the most famous ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942).&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to his contemporary [[John Maynard Keynes]], Schumpeter contended that evolving institutions, [[entrepreneur]]s, and technological change were at the heart of [[economic growth]], not independent forces that are largely unaffected by policy. He argued that "capitalism can only be understood as an evolutionary process of continuous innovation and '[[creative destruction]]'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Freeman]] (2009) «Schumpeter's Business Cycles and Techno-economic Paradigms», in Wolfgang Drechsler, Erik Reinert and Rainer Kattel (Eds.) ''Techno-economic Paradigms: Essays in Honor of Carlota Perez, p. 126.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy|last=Schumpeter|first=J. A.|publisher=Routledge|year=1943|isbn=|edition=6th|location=|pages=81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2015}}

But it is only within the last 15 years that a theory and narrative of economic growth focused on innovation that was grounded in Schumpeter’s ideas has emerged. Innovation economics attempted to answer the fundamental problem in the puzzle of [[total factor productivity]] growth. Continual growth of [[output (economics)|output]] could no longer be explained only in increase of [[Information|inputs]] used in the production process as understood in [[industrialization]]. Hence, innovation economics focused on a theory of economic creativity that would impact the theory of the firm and organization decision-making. Hovering between [[heterodox economics]] that emphasized the fragility of conventional assumptions and [[Mainstream economics|orthodox economics]] that ignored the fragility of such assumptions, innovation economics aims for joint didactics between the two. As such, it enlarges the Schumpeterian analyses of new technological system by incorporating new ideas of information and communication technology in the global economy.&lt;ref name="Antonelli2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Antonelli |first=C. |year=2003 |title=The Economics of Innovation, New Technologies, and Structural Change |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0415406437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovation economics emerges on the wage of other schools of thoughts in economics, including [[new institutional economics]], [[new growth theory]], [[endogenous growth theory]], [[evolutionary economics]], neo-Schumpeterian economics—provides an economic framework that explains and helps support growth in today’s [[knowledge economy]].

Leading theorists of innovation economics include both formal economists, as well as management theorists, technology policy experts, and others. These include [[Paul Romer]], [[Elhanan Helpman]], [[Bronwyn Hall]], [[W. Brian Arthur]], [[Robert Axtell]], [[Richard R. Nelson]], [[Richard Lipsey]], [[Michael Porter]], [[Keun Lee]], [[Christopher Freeman]].

==Theory==

Innovation economists believe that what primarily drives economic growth in today’s knowledge-based economy is not [[Capital (economics)|capital]] accumulation, as claimed by neoclassicalism asserts, but innovative capacity spurred by appropriable knowledge and technological externalities. 
Economic growth in innovation economics is the end-product of:&lt;ref name="Antonelli2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Bjorn |year=2008 |title=Cities, systems of innovation and economic development |journal=Innovation: Management, Policy, and Practice |volume=10 |issue=2/3 |pages=146–55 |doi=10.5172/impp.453.10.2-3.146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* knowledge (tacit vs. codified); 
* regimes and policies allowing for [[entrepreneurship]] and innovation (i.e., [[R&amp;D]] expenditures, permits, [[license]]s); 
* technological [[Spillover effect|spillover]]s and [[externality|externalities]] between collaborative firms; 
* systems of innovation that create innovative environments (i.e., [[business cluster|cluster]]s, [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]]s, [[metropolitan area]]s).

In 1970, economist [[Milton Friedman]] said in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that a business’s sole purpose is to generate profits for their shareholders and companies that pursued other missions would be less competitive, resulting in fewer benefits to owners, employees, and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Friedman |first=M. |date=September 13, 1970 |title=A Friedman doctrine—; The Social Responsibility Of Business Is to Increase Its Profits |newspaper=[[New York Times Magazine]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet data over the past several decades shows that while profits matter, good firms supply far more, particularly in bringing innovation to the market. This fosters [[economic growth]], [[employment]] gains, and other society-wide benefits. [[Business school]] professor [[David Ahlstrom]] asserts: “the main goal of business is to develop new and innovative goods and services that generate economic growth while delivering benefits to society.”&lt;ref name="Ahlstrom2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahlstrom |first=D. |year=2010 |title=Innovation and Growth: How Business Contributes to Society |journal=Academy of Management Perspectives |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=11–24 |doi=10.5465/AMP.2010.52842948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to neoclassical economics, innovation economics offer differing perspectives on main focus, reasons for economic growth, and the assumptions of context between economic actors:
{| class="wikitable"; style=white-space; border="1"
|-
! Economic thought !! Focus !! Growth !! Context
|-
| Neoclassical || Market price signals in using scarce resources || Productive factor accumulation (capital, labor) || Individuals and firms behaving in vacuum
|-
| Innovation || Innovative capacity to create more effective processes, products, business models || Knowledge/technology (R&amp;D, patents) || Institutions of research, government, society
|}

Despite the differences in economic thought, both perspectives are based on the same core premise: the foundation of all [[economic growth]] is the [[optimization]] of the [[utilization]] of factors and the measure of success is how well the [[factor analysis|factor]] utilization is optimized. Whatever the factors, it nonetheless leads to the same situation of special [[Capital (economics)#Endowment|endowments]], varying relative [[price]]s, and [[production process]]es. So, while the two differ in [[Economics|theoretical concepts]], innovation economics can find fertile ground in [[mainstream economics]], rather than remain in diametric contention.&lt;ref name="Antonelli2003" /&gt;

==Evidence==

Empirical evidence worldwide points to a positive link between technological innovation and economic performance. The drive of [[biotechnology|biotech]] firms in [[Germany]] was due to the [[R&amp;D]] subsidies to joint projects, [[Business networking|network]] partners, and close cognitive distance of collaborative partners within a [[business cluster|cluster]]. For instance:
* These factors increased [[patent]] performance in the biotech industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fornahl |first=D. |last2=Broekel |first2=T. |last3=Boschma |first3=R. |year=2011 |title=What drives patent performance of German biotech firms? The impact of R&amp;D subsidies, knowledge networks and their location |journal=Papers in Regional Science |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=395–418 |doi=10.1111/j.1435-5957.2011.00361.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovation capacity explains much of the [[GDP]] growth in [[India]] and [[China]] between 1981–2004 but especially in the 1990s. Their development of a '''[[National innovation system|National Innovation System]]''' through heavy investment of R&amp;D expenditures and personnel, patents, and high-tech/service exports strengthened their innovation capacity. By linking the [[science]] sector with the [[business]] sector, establishing incentives for innovative activities, and balancing the import of [[technology]] and indigenous [[R&amp;D]] effort, both countries experienced rapid [[economic growth]] in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peilei |first=F. |year=2011 |title=Innovation capacity and economic development: China and India |journal=Economic Change and Restructuring |volume=44 |issue=1/2 |pages=49–73 |doi=10.1007/s10644-010-9088-2 |url=http://collections.unu.edu/view/UNU:4235 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also, the [[Council of Foreign Relations]] asserted that since the end of the 1970s, the U.S. has gained a disproportionate share of the world’s wealth through their aggressive pursuit of [[technological change]], demonstrating that technological innovation is a central catalyst of steady economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steil |first=B. |last2=Victor |first2=D. G. |last3=Nelson |first3=R. R. |year=2002 |title=Technological Innovation and Economics Performance. A Council of Foreign Relations Book |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Concisely, evidence shows that innovation contributes to steady [[economic growth]] and rise in [[per capita income]].&lt;ref name="Ahlstrom2010" /&gt;

However, some empirical studies investigating the innovation-performance-link lead to rather mixed results and indicate that the relationship is more subtle and complex than commonly assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salge |first=T. O. |last2=Vera |first2=A. |year=2009 |title=Hospital innovativeness and organizational performance |journal=[[Health Care Management Review]] |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=54–67 [in particular pp. 56–58] |doi=10.1097/01.HMR.0000342978.84307.80 |pmid=19104264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the relationship between innovativeness and performance seems to differ in intensity and significance across empirical contexts, environmental circumstances, and conceptual dimensions.

All of the above has taken place in an era of data constraint, as identified by [[Zvi Griliches]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Griliches. Z ‘Productivity, R&amp;D, and the Data Constraint’ ''American Economic Review'', Vol. 84, No. 1, (March 1994) pp. 1 – 23&lt;/ref&gt; Because the primary domain of innovation is commerce the key data resides there; continually out of campus reach in reports hidden within factories, corporate offices and technical centers. This recusal still stymies progress today. Recent attempts at data transference have led, not least, to the ‘positive link’ (above) being upgraded to exact algebra between R&amp;D productivity and GDP allowing prediction from one to the other. This is pending further disclosure from commercial sources but several pertinent documents are already available.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell C.J.‘Economics, R&amp;D and Growth', [http://www.techmatt.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

While innovation is important, it is not a happenstance occurrence as a [[natural harbor]] or [[natural resource]]s are, but a deliberate, concerted effort of [[Market (economics)|markets]], [[institution]]s, [[public policy|policymakers]], and effective use of [[geography|geographic space]]. In global [[economic restructuring]], location has become a key element in establishing [[competitive advantage]] as regions focus on their unique assets to spur innovation (i.e., [[information technology]] in [[Silicon Valley]], CA; [[digital media]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea). Even more, thriving [[metropolitan economy|metropolitan economies]] that carry multiple clusters (i.e., [[Tokyo]], [[Chicago]], [[London]]) essentially fuel [[national economy|national economies]] through their pools of [[human capital]], [[innovation]], [[public space|quality place]]s, and [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Mark |first=M. |last2=Katz |first2=B. |last3=Rahman |first3=S. |last4=Warren |first4=D. |year=2008 |title=MetroPolicy: Shaping A New Federal Partnership for a Metropolitan Nation |work=Brookings Institution: Metropolitan Policy Program Report |volume=2008 |pages=4–103 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cities]] become “innovative spaces” and “cradles of creativity” as drivers of innovation. They become essential to the system of innovation through the [[supply side]]: ready, available, abundant [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Labor (economics)|labor]]; good [[infrastructure]] for productive activities, and diversified production structures that spawn [[synergies]] and hence innovation. In addition they grow due to the [[demand|demand side]]: diverse population of varying occupations, ideas, skills; high and differentiated level of [[consumer demand]]; and constant recreation of urban order especially infrastructure of [[street]]s, [[water system]]s, [[energy]], and [[transportation]].&lt;ref name="Johnson2008" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23587">'''Interest rate parity''' is a no-[[arbitrage]] condition representing an [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] state under which investors will be indifferent to [[interest rate]]s available on [[demand deposit|bank deposits]] in two countries.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Macroeconomics | author = Feenstra, Robert C. | author2 = Taylor, Alan M. | year = 2008 | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4292-0691-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that this condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from [[covered interest arbitrage]]. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are [[capital mobility]] and [[substitute good|perfect substitutability]] of domestic and foreign [[assets]]. Given [[foreign exchange market]] equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected [[rate of return|return]] on domestic assets will equal the [[exchange rate]]-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing in a country with a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at [[maturity (finance)|maturity]].&lt;ref name="Mishkin 2006"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Economics of Money, Banking, and Financial Markets, 8th edition | author = Mishkin, Frederic S. | year = 2006 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Boston, MA | isbn = 978-0-321-28726-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: ''uncovered interest rate parity'' refers to the parity condition in which exposure to [[foreign exchange risk]] (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas ''covered interest rate parity'' refers to the condition in which a [[forward contract]] has been used to ''cover'' (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the [[forward exchange rate]] and the future [[spot exchange rate]].&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;

Economists have found [[empirical evidence]] that covered interest rate parity generally holds, though not with precision due to the effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest rate parity and [[purchasing power parity]] hold together, they illuminate a relationship named ''real interest rate parity'', which suggests that expected [[real interest rate]]s represent expected adjustments in the [[Exchange rate#Purchasing power of currency|real exchange rate]]. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among [[emerging markets|emerging market]] countries.

==Assumptions==
Interest rate parity rests on certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily exchange domestic assets for foreign assets. The second assumption is that assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in [[financial risk|riskiness]] and [[market liquidity|liquidity]]. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors would be expected to hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets.&lt;ref name="Mishkin 2006" /&gt; That is not to say that domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.&lt;ref name="Madura 2007"&gt;{{Cite book| title = International Financial Management: Abridged 8th Edition | author = Madura, Jeff | year = 2007 | publisher = Thomson South-Western | location = Mason, OH | isbn = 0-324-36563-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uncovered interest rate parity==
[[File:Uncovered-interest-rate-parity.svg|thumb|right|375px|A visual representation of uncovered interest rate parity holding in the foreign exchange market, such that the returns from investing domestically are equal to the returns from investing abroad.]]
When the no-arbitrage condition is satisfied ''without'' the use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be ''uncovered''. Risk-neutral investors will be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the exchange rate between those countries is expected to adjust such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on euro deposits, thereby eliminating the potential for [[uncovered interest arbitrage]] profits. Uncovered interest rate parity helps explain the [[spot exchange rate|determination of the spot exchange rate]]. The following equation represents uncovered interest rate parity.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(1 + i_\$) = \frac {E_t(S_{t + k})} {S_t} (1 + i_c)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;E_t(S_{t + k})&lt;/math&gt; is the expected future spot exchange rate at time ''t + k''
:''k'' is the number of periods into the future from time ''t''
:''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the current spot exchange rate at time ''t''
:''i&lt;sub&gt;$&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the interest rate in one country (for example, the [[United States]])
:''i&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the interest rate in another country or currency area (for example, the [[Eurozone]])

The dollar return on dollar deposits, &lt;math&gt;1 + i_\$&lt;/math&gt;, is shown to be equal to the dollar return on euro deposits, &lt;math&gt;\frac {E_t(S_{t + k})} {S_t} (1 + i_c)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Approximation===
Uncovered interest rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the interest rate available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn the interest rate available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;i_\$ = i_c + \frac {{\Delta}E_t(S_{t + k})} {S_t}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;{{\Delta}E_t(S_{t + k})}&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the expected future spot exchange rate
:&lt;math&gt;{{\Delta}E_t(S_{t + k})} / {S_t}&lt;/math&gt; is the expected rate of depreciation (or appreciation) of the dollar

A more universal way of stating the approximation is "the home interest rate equals the foreign interest rate plus the expected rate of depreciation of the home currency."&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;

==Covered interest rate parity==
[[File:Covered-interest-rate-parity.svg|thumb|right|375px|A visual representation of covered interest rate parity holding in the foreign exchange market, such that the returns from investing domestically are equal to the returns from investing abroad.]]
When the no-arbitrage condition is satisfied ''with'' the use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be ''covered''. Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for [[covered interest arbitrage]] profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity helps explain the [[forward exchange rate#Relation to covered interest rate parity|determination of the forward exchange rate]]. The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waki 2007"&gt;{{Cite news | title = No end in sight for yen carry craze | author = Waki, Natsuko | date = 2007-02-21 | publisher = Reuters | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/02/21/us-yen-carry-idUSL218404520070221 | accessdate = 2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(1 + i_\$) = \frac {F_t} {S_t} (1 + i_c)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;F_t&lt;/math&gt; is the forward exchange rate at time ''t''

The dollar return on dollar deposits, &lt;math&gt;1 + i_\$&lt;/math&gt;, is shown to be equal to the dollar return on euro deposits, &lt;math&gt;\frac {F_t} {S_t} (1 + i_c)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Empirical evidence==
Covered interest rate parity (CIRP) is found to hold when there is open capital mobility and limited [[capital control]]s, and this finding is confirmed for all currencies freely traded in the present day. One such example is when the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]] abolished capital controls between 1979 and 1981. [[Maurice Obstfeld]] and Alan Taylor calculated hypothetical profits as implied by the expression of a potential inequality in the CIRP equation (meaning a difference in returns on domestic versus foreign assets) during the 1960s and 1970s, which would have constituted arbitrage opportunities if not for the prevalence of capital controls. However, given financial liberalization and resulting capital mobility, arbitrage temporarily became possible until equilibrium was restored. Since the abolition of capital controls in the United Kingdom and Germany, potential arbitrage profits have been near zero. Factoring in [[transaction cost]]s arising from [[fee]]s and other [[financial regulation|regulations]], arbitrage opportunities are fleeting or nonexistent when such costs exceed deviations from parity.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levi 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 4th Edition | author = Levi, Maurice D. | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-30900-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While CIRP generally holds, it does not hold with precision due to the presence of transaction costs, [[political risk]]s, [[tax]] implications for interest earnings versus gains from foreign exchange, and differences in the liquidity of domestic versus foreign assets.&lt;ref name="Levi 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Economics, 6th Edition | author = Dunn, Robert M., Jr. | author2 = Mutti, John H. | year = 2004 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-31154-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frenkel &amp; Levich 1981"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Covered interest arbitrage in the 1970s | journal = Economics Letters | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | year = 1981 | author = Frenkel, Jacob A. | author2 = Levich, Richard M. | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016517658190077X | accessdate = 2011-07-15 | doi=10.1016/0165-1765(81)90077-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Researchers found evidence that significant deviations from CIRP during the onset of the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis|global financial crisis]] in 2007 and 2008 were driven by concerns over risk posed by counter parties to banks and financial institutions in Europe and the US in the [[foreign exchange swap]] market. The [[European Central Bank]]'s efforts to provide US dollar liquidity in the foreign exchange swap market, along with similar efforts by the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]], had a moderating impact on CIRP deviations between the dollar and the euro. Such a scenario was found to be reminiscent of deviations from CIRP during the 1990s driven by struggling Japanese banks which looked toward foreign exchange swap markets to try and acquire dollars to bolster their [[credit risk|creditworthiness]].&lt;ref name="Baba &amp; Packer 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Interpreting deviations from covered interest parity during the financial market turmoil of 2007-08 | journal = Journal of Banking &amp; Finance | volume = 33 | issue = 11 | year = 2009 | pages = 1953–1962 | author = Baba, Naohiko | author2 = Packer, Frank | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426609001083 | accessdate = 2011-07-21 | doi=10.1016/j.jbankfin.2009.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP) hold, such a condition sheds light on a noteworthy relationship between the forward and expected future spot exchange rates, as demonstrated below.

:&lt;math&gt;UIRP: (1 + i_\$) = \frac {E_t(S_{t + k})} {S_t} (1 + i_c)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;CIRP: (1 + i_\$) = \frac {F_t} {S_t} (1 + i_c)&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing the equation for UIRP by the equation for CIRP yields the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;1 = \frac {E_t(S_{t + k})} {F_t}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;{F_t} = E_t(S_{t + k})&lt;/math&gt;

This equation represents the [[forward exchange rate#Unbiasedness hypothesis|unbiasedness hypothesis]], which states that the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate.&lt;ref name="Delcoure et al. 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Forward Rate Unbiasedness Hypothesis Reexamined: Evidence from a New Test | journal = Global Finance Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | year = 2003 | pages = 83–93 | author = Delcoure, Natalya | author2 = Barkoulas, John | author3 = Baum, Christopher F. | author4 = Chakraborty, Atreya | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044028303000061 | accessdate = 2011-06-21 | doi=10.1016/S1044-0283(03)00006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ho 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = A re-examination of the unbiasedness forward rate hypothesis using dynamic SUR model | journal = The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | year = 2003 | pages = 542–559 | author = Ho, Tsung-Wu | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062976902001710 | accessdate = 2011-06-23 | doi=10.1016/S1062-9769(02)00171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given strong evidence that CIRP holds, the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis can serve as a test to determine whether UIRP holds (in order for the forward rate and spot rate to be equal, both CIRP and UIRP conditions must hold). Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for [[cointegration]] between the forward rate and future spot rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Delcoure et al. 2003" /&gt;

UIRP is found to have some empirical support in [[statistical hypothesis testing|tests]] for [[correlation]] between expected rates of [[depreciation (currency)|currency depreciation]] and the [[forward exchange rate#Forward premium or discount|forward premium or discount]].&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt; Evidence suggests that whether UIRP holds depends on the currency examined, and deviations from UIRP have been found to be less substantial when examining longer time horizons.&lt;ref name="Bekaert et al. 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Uncovered interest rate parity and the term structure | journal = Journal of International Money and Finance | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | year = 2007 | pages = 1038–1069 | author = Bekaert, Geert | author2 = Wei, Min | author3 = Xing, Yuhang | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560607000630 | accessdate = 2011-07-21 | doi=10.1016/j.jimonfin.2007.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies of monetary policy have offered explanations for why UIRP fails empirically. Researchers demonstrated that if a central bank manages interest rate spreads in strong response to the previous period's spreads, that interest rate spreads had negative coefficients in regression tests of UIRP. Another study which set up a model wherein the central bank's monetary policy responds to [[exogenous]] shocks, that the central bank's smoothing of interest rates can explain empirical failures of UIRP.&lt;ref name="Anker 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Uncovered interest parity, monetary policy and time-varying risk premia | journal = Journal of International Money and Finance | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | year = 1999 | pages = 835–851 | author = Anker, Peter | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560699000364 | accessdate = 2011-07-21 | doi=10.1016/S0261-5606(99)00036-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A study of central bank interventions on the US dollar and [[Deutsche mark]] found only limited evidence of any substantial effect on deviations from UIRP.&lt;ref name="Baillie &amp; Osterberg 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Deviations from daily uncovered interest rate parity and the role of intervention | journal = Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | year = 2000 | pages = 363–379 | author = Baillie, Richard T. | author2 = Osterberg, William P. | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042443100000299 | accessdate = 2011-07-21 | doi=10.1016/S1042-4431(00)00029-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; UIRP has been found to hold over very small spans of time (covering only a number of hours) with a high frequency of bilateral exchange rate data.&lt;ref name="Chaboud &amp; Wright 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Uncovered interest parity: it works, but not for long | journal = Journal of International Economics | volume = 66 | issue = 2 | year = 2005 | pages = 349–362 | author = Chaboud, Alain P. | author2 = Wright, Jonathan H. | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199604001175 | accessdate = 2011-07-21 | doi=10.1016/j.jinteco.2004.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional [[regime change]]s, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the [[Spanish peseta]] versus the [[pound sterling|British pound]], have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the [[European Union]] in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.&lt;ref name="Beyaert et al. 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Uncovered interest parity with switching regimes | journal = Economic Modelling | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | pages = 189–202 | author = Beyaert, Arielle | author2 = García-Solanes, José | author3 = Pérez-Castejón, Juan J. | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999306000745 | accessdate = 2011-07-21 | doi=10.1016/j.econmod.2006.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real interest rate parity==
When both UIRP (particularly in its approximation form) and purchasing power parity (PPP) hold, the two parity conditions together reveal a relationship among expected real interest rates, wherein changes in expected real interest rates reflect expected changes in the real exchange rate. This condition is known as ''real interest rate parity'' (RIRP) and is related to the [[international Fisher effect]].&lt;ref name="Cuthbertson &amp; Nitzsche 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Quantitative Financial Economics: Stocks, Bonds and Foreign Exchange, 2nd Edition | author = Cuthbertson, Keith | author2 = Nitzsche, Dirk | year = 2005 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester, UK | isbn = 978-0-47-009171-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Juselius 2006"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Cointegrated VAR Model: Methodology and Applications | author = Juselius, Katarina | year = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, UK | isbn = 978-0-19-928566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management, 6th Edition | author = Eun, Cheol S. | author2 = Resnick, Bruce G. | year = 2011 | publisher = McGraw-Hill/Irwin | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-07-803465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moosa 2003"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Operations: Arbitrage, Hedging, Speculation, Financing and Investment | author = Moosa, Imad A. | year = 2003 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-333-99859-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bordo 2000"&gt;{{Cite conference | title = The Globalization of International Financial Markets: What Can History Teach Us? | author = Bordo, Michael D. | author2 = National Bureau of Economic Research | conference = International Financial Markets: The Challenge of Globalization | publisher = Texas A&amp;M University | location = College Station, TX| date = 2000-03-31 | url = http://econweb.rutgers.edu/bordo/global.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following equations demonstrate how to derive the RIRP equation.

:&lt;math&gt;UIRP: {\Delta}E_t(S_{t + k}) = E_t(S_{t + k}) - S_t = i_\$ - i_c&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;PPP: {\Delta}E_t(S_{t + k}) = {\Delta}E_t({p^\$}_{t + k}) - {\Delta}E_t({p^c}_{t + k})&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; represents inflation

If the above conditions hold, then they can be combined and rearranged as the following:
:&lt;math&gt;RIRP: i_\$ - {\Delta}E_t({p^\$}_{t + k}) = i_c - {\Delta}E_t({p^c}_{t + k})&lt;/math&gt;

RIRP rests on several assumptions, including [[Efficient-market hypothesis|efficient markets]], no country risk premia, and zero change in the expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize between countries and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage. There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective of differences in the degree of financial integration among the country groups analyzed.&lt;ref name="Baharumshah et al. 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = A panel study on real interest rate parity in East Asian countries: Pre- and post-liberalization era | journal = Global Finance Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | year = 2005 | pages = 69–85 | author = Baharumshah, Ahmad Zubaidi | author2 = Haw, Chan Tze | author3 = Fountas, Stilianos | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044028305000177 | accessdate = 2011-07-21 | doi=10.1016/j.gfj.2005.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years.&lt;ref name="Chinn 2007"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Interest Parity Conditions | author = Chinn, Menzie D. | encyclopedia = Princeton Encyclopedia of the World Economy | editor = Reinert, Kenneth A. | editor2 = Rajan, Ramkishen S. | editor3 = Glass, Amy Jocelyn |display-editors = 3 | editor4 = Davis, Lewis S. | year = 2007 | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, NJ | isbn = 978-0-69-112812-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Law practice management''' ('''LPM''') is the [[management]] of a [[law practice]]. In the [[United States]], [[law firm]]s may be composed of a single [[lawyer|attorney]], of several attorneys, or of many attorneys, plus support staff such as [[paralegal|paralegals/legal assistants]], [[Secretary|secretaries]] (including [[legal secretary|legal secretaries]]), and other personnel.

Debate over law as a [[profession]] versus a [[business]] has occurred for over a century; a number of observers believe that it is both.&lt;ref&gt;Champ S. Andrews, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/784941 The Law: A Business or a Profession?] (June 1908), ''Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 107, No. 7, pp. 602-610.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy M. Miller, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=929749 Is Law a Business or a Profession-And Does it Really Matter?] (1994), ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'' Vol. 107, No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lippe, [http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/law_is_both_a_profession_and_a_business--forget_that_at_your_own_peril/ Law Is Both a Profession and a Business—Forget That at Your Own Peril] (January 27, 2011). Legal Rebels, ABA Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law practice management is the study and practice of [[business administration]] in the legal context, including such topics as [[workload]] and [[staff management]]; [[Managerial finance|financial management]]; [[office management]]; and [[marketing]], including [[legal advertising]].

Many lawyers have commented on the difficulty of balancing the management functions of a law firm with client matters.&lt;ref&gt;Anita J. Cicero, as told to Elizabeth Olson. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/jobs/04pre.html Preoccupations: The Tightrope of Managing a Law Office] (January 3, 2009). ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lawyers started practicing centuries ago. Law firms as an institution date back to the 19th century, and in the United States began appearing in the period before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. and Angelo Dondi, ''Legal Ethics: A Comparative Study'' (2004). Stanford University Press, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; predating the development of modern [[management theory]].

Today, the [[George Washington University]] College of Professional Studies (CPS) offers a [[Master of Professional Studies]] and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nearyou.gwu.edu/lawfirm/index1.html Master of Professional Studies and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management], George Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ABA Law Practice Division==
The leading organization focused on law practice management is the Law Practice Division of the [[American Bar Association]] which traces its history back to the creation of the ABA Special Committee on Economics of Law Practice by the ABA Board of Governors on July 30, 1957.  In August 1957, when Charles S. Rhyne became President of the ABA, he made one of his major objectives the institution of a “comprehensive program to aid members of the ABA in the field of economics of law practice”.  He appointed the first Committee which consisted of five members and was increased in May of the following year to seven by action of the Board.  The first Chair of the Special Committee was John C. Satterfield of Yazoo City, Mississippi.

The Committee was charged with the duty of laying the groundwork for the development of practical suggestions to lawyers, designed to improve their economic status.  Combined with this, there was to be an increase in coordination of assistance to lawyers in the business phase of the practice of law, achieved by ABA through its staff, committees and sections and by the state and local bar associations.

An early publication from the Committee was ''The 1958 Lawyer and His 1938 Dollar''. Satterfield was elected President of the [[American Bar Association]] in 1961 during which ''The Lawyers Handbook'' was first published and distributed to all attorneys who joined the ABA that year.

By action of the Board of Governors at the ABA Annual Meeting in August 1961, the Special Committee was made a standing committee of the Association and [[Lewis F. Powell]] of Richmond, Virginia, was appointed as the first Chair of the ABA Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice.  Shortly after the completion of his term as Chair in 1962, he was elected President of the American Bar Association and subsequently became an Associate Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1972.

The Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice published a bimonthly newsletter, Legal Economics News, and more than 30 books and pamphlets, three educational films, and an audio cassette program.  The Committee continued to publish The Lawyer’s Handbook.  The Committee’s staff answered over one hundred inquiries a month from attorneys regarding the application of sound management principles to the law office operation.  In addition, a small group of attorneys led by J. Harris Morgan of Greenville, Texas, Kline Strong of Salt Lake City, Utah, Lee Turner of Great Bend, Kansas and Jimmy Brill of Houston, Texas, traveled throughout the US, presenting programs on law firm management. Their efforts created the need for the Section.

Commencing in 1965 when John D. Connor served as Chair, the Committee presented the first of six National Conferences of Law Office Economics and Management in Chicago, which attracted approximately 500 lawyers throughout the country and several foreign countries.

As activities expanded and lawyer interest in law office management increased, it became apparent that the committee structure could not meet the demonstrated need of American lawyers for assistance in law practice issues and limited the participation and contribution of interested and informed lawyers in the vital economics and efficiency programs of the Association.  Accordingly, two members of the Committee, Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle, Washington, the former Chair of the Young Lawyers Section, and Richard A. Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas were joined by William J. Fuchs of Haverford, Pennsylvania; John “Buddy” Thomason of Memphis, Tennessee; and  Robert P. Wilkins of Columbia, South Carolina, and commenced efforts to form a section to address the subject of law office economics and management.

Proponents for a new Section originally proposed that the Board of Governors recommend to the House the creation of a Section of Law Office Practice and Efficiency, but after deliberation it was determined that the new Section should be called by the Standing Committee name.  At the ABA Midyear Meeting in Houston, Texas in February 1974, the House of Delegates approved establishing the Section of Economics of Law Practice.  This action culminated a two-year effort to expand the Committee’s work to a much wider lawyer population.

The organizational meeting of the Section was held in April 1974 at the close of the Sixth National Conference of Law Office Economics and Management.  Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle Washington, who had served as the Chair of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice was elected the new Section chair with 1074 charter members. Those chosen to serve on the initial Section Council were selected from the members of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice and the Committee on Legal Assistants, other ABA contacts, speakers from the National Conferences and attorneys active at the state level.

The current chair of the American Bar Association Law Practice Division is Tom Bolt, a St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands lawyer with BoltNagi PC.

==Other Organizations and Consultants==
The Association of Legal Administrators (ALA) [[professional association]], which was founded in 1971 is another organization that is concerned with law practice management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanet.org/about/ About ALA], Association of Legal Administrators.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of law practice [[consulting firm]]s also exist. Many [[bar association]]s have a law practice section or division which they allow non-attorney members due to the technical, non-legal basis of law office management.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://www.michbar.org/lawpractice/ Law Practice Management and Legal Administrators Section] of the [[State Bar of Michigan]]; the [http://www.massbar.org/member-groups/sections/law-practice-management Law Practice Management Section] of the [[Massachusetts Bar Association]]; and the [http://lpmt.calbar.ca.gov/ Law Practice Management and Technology Section] of the [[State Bar of California]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of law-practice management==
Law practice management includes management of people (clients, staff, vendors), workplace facilities and equipment, internal processes and policies, and financial matters such as collection, [[budgeting]], [[Internal control|financial controls]], [[payroll]], and client [[trust account]]s.

===Software and legal research===
{{Main|Law practice management software}}

Software applications have become increasingly important in modern law practice. Picking the best software for a law office depends on many variables.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Calloway, [http://www.okbar.org/members/map/Picking%20the%20Best%20Law%20Office%20Software.pdf Picking the "Best" Law Office Software] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229015452/http://www.okbar.org/members/map/Picking%20the%20Best%20Law%20Office%20Software.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }}. Oklahoma Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Law practice management software|Practice management software]], a form of [[customer relationship management]] software, is among the most important, and features and functions of such management software often include case management ([[database]]s, [[conflict of interest]] checking, [[statute of limitations]] checking), time tracking (for billing), [[document assembly]], [[contact management]], and calendaring and [[Docket (court)|docket]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/groups/departments_offices/legal_technology_resources/resources/charts_fyis/casemanagementcomparison.html Practice and Case Management Software: Comparison Chart]. American Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Other software used includes [[password]] security, [[disk encryption]], [[mindmapping]], desktop notes, [[word processing]], and [[email management]]. Some firms use modified versions of [[Open-source software|open source]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Steph Kimbro, [http://lawyerist.com/open-source-virtual-law-firm/ Open Source and the Virtual Law Firm] (May 3, 2011). Laywerist.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Lambert, [http://www.geeklawblog.com/2009/07/open-source-in-law-firms-unimaginable.html Open Source in Law Firms - Unimaginable or Brilliant?] (July 8, 2009), ''3 Geeks and a Law Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most law firms also subscribe to a [[computer-assisted legal research]] database for [[legal research]]. Such databases provide [[case law]] from [[Law report|case reporters]], and often other legal resources. The two largest legal databases are [[Westlaw]] (part of [[West (publisher)|West]], which is owned by [[Thomson Reuters]]) and [[LexisNexis]], but other databases also exist, such the free [[Google Scholar]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Carton, [http://legalblogwatch.typepad.com/legal_blog_watch/2011/01/improved-google-scholar-becomes-more-useful-to-lawyers.html Improved Google Scholar More Useful to Lawyers] (January 18, 2011). ''Law.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geri L. Dreiling, [http://lawyertechreview.com/2011/how-to-use-google-scholar-for-legal-research/ How to Use Google Scholar for Legal Research] (May 11, 2011). ''Lawyer Tech Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtney Minick and David Tsai, [http://www.sfbar.org/articles/google_scholar.aspx Google Scholar:  A New Way to Search for Cases and Related Legal Publications]. [[Bar Association of San Francisco]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the newer [[Bloomberg Law]], as well as [[Loislaw]] (operated by [[Wolters Kluwer]]) and several smaller databases.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Schachner Chanen, [http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/exclusive_inside_the_new_westlaw_lexis_bloomberg_platforms/ Exclusive: Inside the New Westlaw, Lexis &amp; Bloomberg Platforms] (January 24, 2010). ''ABA Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alyssa Altshuler, [http://www.vsb.org/publications/valawyer/oct01/altshuler.pdf An Overview of Five Internet Legal Research Alternatives to Westlaw and LexisNexis] (October 2011). ''Virginia Lawyer''. Virginia State Bar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tami Kamin-Meyer, ''Westlaw Versus Lexis: The Debate Rages On'' (2008). ''Plaintiff''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Document automation has also become a crucial part of legal practice management, with companies like Thomson Reuters,  HotDocs (acquired by AbacusNext)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/sites/legaltechnews/2017/11/13/abacusnext-acquires-document-automation-company-hotdocs/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=35e92ab8-ab46-45b4-86d7-ce963c2f8ec8&lt;/ref&gt; and HelpSelf Legal (web-based platform)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.helpselflegal.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/helpself-uses-simple-ai-to-help-those-in-legal-trouble/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt; providing document automation services that allow lawyers to customize their own interview workflows to merge into legal documents.  These and other sites are incorporating artificial intelligence into their document automation software.&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt;.  

These document automation tools allow any lawyer to create their own workflows, in the same way that companies like LegalZoom and RocketLawyer offer standardized automated document production for individuals and small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-buy-legal-documents-online-without-reading-this-story-2015-11-23 Article:Don’t buy legal documents online without reading this story]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Some [[bar association]]s and lawyers' organizations have their own software; for example, the American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys' CounselPro program is designed for [[estate planning]] lawyers and assists in producing [[Will (law)|wills]], [[Trust law|trusts]], and other [[legal document]]s, as well as other documents such as thank-you letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaepa.com/cpdf.aspx/ American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018125101/http://www.aaepa.com/cpdf.aspx |date=2009-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firm personnel===
[[Human resource management]] (managing personnel) is an important aspect of law practice management, and many books and other resources offer advice to firms on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v35_is7_pg34.html Resources for Managing Law Firm Personnel - Shape Up! Practice Management Tips for 2010] (November/December 2009). ''Law Practice'' Vol. 35, No. 7, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law firms often employ a number of non-legal personnel or support staff; according to one figure, the average attorney to non-attorney ratio is 1 to 1.3.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Freedman, How Many Non-Lawyers Does It Take to Run a Law Firm? (2005). Freedman Consulting, Inc. (version of article originally appearing in the ''Pennsylvania Lawyer'' (March/April 2001 issue).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many firms and other organizations employ a professional non-attorney legal administrator, or law firm administrator, to manage non-attorney personnel and the administrative aspects of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rose, [http://nysbar.com/blogs/Tipoftheweek/2010/02/role_of_law_firm_administrator.html Role of Law Firm Administrator] (February 18, 2010). ''Law Practice Management Tip of the Week''. [[New York State Bar Association]], Committee on Law Practice Management.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[professional association]] for legal administrators is the Association of Legal Administrators (ALA), founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanet.org/about/ About ALA], Association of Legal Administrators.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past two decades, the role of legal administrator has changes as duties have expanded and become more complex, and as more firms hired administrators; the ALA grew from less than a thousand members in 1976 to over 8,000 in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weilandco.com/new/article.html Deciding When And How To Effectively Use A Legal Administrator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110031330/http://weilandco.com/new/article.html |date=2012-01-10 }}, John P. Weil &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ALA, in 2007 some 76 percent of legal administrators were women in their 40s and 50s. The main duties of legal administrators are the financial, operation, and human resource management of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Ott Mayer, [http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/2007/04/30/focus3.html Role of legal administrators changing as duties expand, become more complex] (April 29, 2007). ''Memphis Business Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert W.

''Law Practice'' Vol. 34, No. 3, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Smith and Ashby Jones, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303630404577388180888033106 Practicing Business: Professional Managers Gain Wider Presence at Law Firms] (May 6, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

A legal administrator is similar to an [[office manager]] or [[executive director]], but often with some expanded duties. Depending on the size, needs, and type of law firm, the firm may employ a separate [[database manager]], [[network administrator]], [[marketing director]], [[computer systems]] or [[Information technology management|information technology manager]], [[bookkeeper]], [[accounts payable]] and [[accounts receivable]] clerk, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Freedman, How Many Non-Lawyers Does It Take to Run a Law Firm?

In [[management]], a '''line function''' is any kind of daily operation such as [[purchasing]], [[manufacturing]], and [[marketing|selling]] that is directly involved in carrying out the purpose of an [[organization]]. This contrasts to a [[staff function]] (such as the [[human resources]] department), which involves the provision of advice and other support to those involved in a line function.

'''Malchiel Gruenwald''' ({{lang-he-n|מלכיאל גרינוולד}}; also written '''Grünwald''', '''Gruenvald''', and '''Greenwald''') (1882–1958) was an [[Israel]]i hotelier, amateur journalist and stamp collector, who came to public attention in 1953, when he accused an Israeli government employee, [[Rudolf Kastner]], of having collaborated with the [[Nazi]]s during [[the Holocaust]].

==Biography==
Gruenwald was born in [[Hungary]],&lt;ref name=Hecht3&gt;{{cite book |last=Hecht |first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Hecht |title=Perfidy |location= |publisher=Milah Press |year=1999 |isbn= |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Segev255&gt;{{cite book |last=Segev |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Segev |title=The Seventh Million: Israelis and the Holocaust |location= |publisher=Owl Books |year=2000 |isbn= |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lived there and in [[Vienna]],&lt;ref name=Maoz&gt;According to Asher Maoz, he was born in Vienna. ({{cite journal |last1=Maoz |first1=Asher |year=2000 |title=Historical Adjudication: Courts of Law, Commissions of Inquiry, and "Historical Truth" |journal=Law and History Review |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages= |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/18.3/maoz.html |accessdate=26 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120913063847/www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/18.3/maoz.html |archivedate=13 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; working in a number of trades, including as a part-time journalist. In 1937, while in Vienna with his family, he was caught in a [[pogrom]] in which his teeth were smashed out, tongue slashed, arms and legs broken, and he was beaten unconscious and left for dead.&lt;ref name=Hecht3/&gt;

In 1938, when he had recovered from his injuries, he emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine]] along with his wife, son Itzhak, and daughter Rina. There he settled in [[Jerusalem]], where, with his life savings, he bought the "Hotel Austria",&lt;ref name=Hecht4&gt;Hecht, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; a ten room hotel on Zion Square&lt;ref name=Segev255/&gt; that he ran with his wife.

The Gruenwalds as a family were committed [[Zionism|Zionists]]. After the [[White Paper of 1939]], Malchiel and his two brothers assisted [[Ha'apala|illegal immigration]] to Palestine, organizing immigrant runs, particularly of Jews trying to escape the Holocaust. His son joined the [[Irgun]], and was killed in the battle for [[Mount Zion]] during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], after which Gruenwald renamed the hotel the "Mount Zion Hotel". His daughter meanwhile worked as a nurse in a [[Hadassah]] hospital by day, and at night tended to the Irgun's wounded.&lt;ref name=Hecht4-6&gt;Hecht, pp. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shlomo Aronson]] in his book ''Hitler, the Allies, and the Jews,'' claims that Gruenwald's personal file, released by Israeli Home Intelligence, provides a very different picture of Gruenwald's early activities. Gruenwald was a criminal in Hungary and Austria, he would inform on Labour Zionists, threaten Orthodox leaders and swindle refugees. The file also accuses Gruenwald of asking British authorities to stop a ship carrying refugees, the [[Patria disaster|SS ''Patria'']], from entering Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=Shlomo |title=Hitler, the Allies, and the Jews |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn= |page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political pamphlets ==
In the early 1950s Gruenwald decided to devote his remaining years to journalism, but as [[Ben Hecht]] writes, no one was about to employ a 72-year-old man who wrote no [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Gruenwald therefore began self-publishing a more-or-less weekly three-page mimeographed pamphlet, which he would have translated from German into Hebrew before distributing up to 1,000 copies himself,&lt;ref name=Segev256&gt;Segev, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; by mail or by hand in local cafés, all free of charge. Titled ''Michtavim el haveray be'Mizrahi'' ("Letters to my Friends in [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrahi]]"), the pamphlets consisted of attacks "on leaders who were corrupt, on religious officials who in his opinion were not worthy of their positions, on greedy public officials and on people in authority."&lt;ref name=Maoz/&gt; Gruenwald's targets included various leaders of religious groups, including Mizrahi, and ministers and members of the [[Knesset]] and other politicians from all parties, in particular those from the ruling [[Labor (Israel)|Mapai]] party.&lt;ref name=Segev256/&gt; Occasionally one of the targets of his pamphlets would threaten to sue him for libel; in response Gruenwald would make a public apology, often in the "Café Vienna", which occupied the ground floor of his hotel.&lt;ref name=Segev256/&gt;

In August 1952 he published the 51st such pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Segev257&gt;Segev, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; This one accused [[Rudolf Kastner]] &amp;mdash; the press spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Commerce and Industry, a senior member of Mapai, and the former ''de facto'' head of the Hungarian-Jewish [[Aid and Rescue Committee]] during the Holocaust &amp;mdash; of being a [[Nazism|Nazi]] collaborator. The pamphlet alleged that Kastner's collaboration had resulted in the deaths of 400,000 [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jews in Hungary]], and that after the war, he had testified at the [[Nuremberg trials]] on behalf of [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] ''Standartenführer'' (colonel) [[Kurt Becher]], thereby saving him from punishment for his [[war crime]]s. According to Hecht, Gruenwald obtained his information from an anonymous letter and a conversation with a stranger at the "Café Vienna",&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; though a 1955 ''[[Time Magazine]]'' article says he was attempting to discover who had betrayed his relatives in Hungary, and drew his conclusions "after poring through mountains of yellowed records."&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,807322,00.html |title=ISRAEL: On Trial - Printout |publisher=TIME |date=1955-07-11 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual text of the pamphlet included the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I have waited a long time to expose this careerist whom I consider, because of his collaboration with the Nazis, an indirect murderer of my dear people.
Who is this spokesman for the Ministry of Trade and Industry; who is this big shot leader of the Hungarian Jews; who is this fellow who has been put high on the list of candidates for Israel's parliament by the government party Mapai?
This character is Dr. Rudolf Kastner, political adventurer, driven by sickly megalomania.
For whom, on whose account, Dr. Kastner, did you go like a thief in the night to Nuremberg to become a witness for the defense of S.S. Colonel Kurt Becher, the murderer of Jews, the man who wallowed in the blood of our brothers in Hungary? Kurt Becher - Economic Administrator of the Gestapo!
Why did you save him from the death penalty which he had so richly earned?
You flew to Nuremberg to save a mass murderer of Jews. What induced you to do that?
What kind of gentleman's agreement was there between this murderer Becher and this man who I accuse as a collaborator with the Nazis?
And it is this same Kastner that Mapai has taken to its bosom and place high on its list of officials.
My God! Kastner's deeds in Budapest cost us the lives of hundreds of thousands of Jews!
We demand an impartial public committee of investigation.
Kastner must be removed from the politics and from the society of this land.
We shall keep this on our agenda until the evil is ended.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, pp. 44-45, citing the Official charge sheet of the Attorney General v. Malchiel Greenwald in Criminal Case 124/53 in the District Court, Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gruenwald answered his charges as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;He wanted to save himself, so that Becher would not reveal to international court their deals and their joint acts of robbery...
Where now is the money of the Jews of Hungary, millions for which no accounting is given...
He saved no fewer than fifty-two of his relatives, and hundreds of other Jews&amp;mdash;most of whom had converted to Christianity&amp;mdash;bought their rescue from Kastner by paying millions! That's how Kastner saved the members of Mapai...
He saved people with connections, made a fortune in the process. But thousands of senior Zionists, members of the Mizrahi and ultrareligious parties&amp;mdash;these, Kastner left in the valley of the shadow of death.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, pp. 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The only Israeli newspaper to pay attention to Kastner's charges was ''Herut''. In it, political columnist Yoel Marcus stated that for three years [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jews]] had been claiming that "a man with an official position" had testified for Nazi war criminals, been involved in shady deals, and had made profits "at the expense of operations to rescue Jews". Marcus challenged Kastner to exonerate himself. Kastner's superior, the Minister of Commerce and Industry Dov Yoseph, felt that whether Kastner wanted to take action regarding these accusations was purely a personal matter.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, pp. 262-263.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Attorney General]] Haim Cohen felt that the charges were serious enough that Kastner would either have to resign or attempt to clear his name. In Cohen's words "in our new, pure, ideal State ... a man cannot officiate in a senior position ... when there is a stain on him, or even only a grave suspicion of collaboration with the Nazis."&lt;ref name=Maoz/&gt; Feeling he had no choice, Kastner allowed the Israeli government to file a lawsuit on his behalf against Gruenwald.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kastner trial ==
{{main article|Kastner trial}}
[[Image:Gruenwald in courthouse.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Gruenwald (front) in the [[Supreme Court of Israel]].]]
In 1953 Cohen, who also held the position of Minister of Justice, filed criminal defamation charges against Gruenwald; according to Asher Moaz, this was "against the wishes of many public figures, including the person who later reoccupied the post of minister of justice, Pinhas Rosen, and the minister in charge of Kastner, Dov Yoseph."&lt;ref name=Maoz/&gt; Gruenwald engaged as his lawyer [[Shmuel Tamir]], a 31-year-old lawyer who had been born in [[Jerusalem]] as Shmuel Katzenelson.  Tamir was the son of Reuven Katzenelson, a member of the [[Jewish Legion]] and [[Joseph Trumpeldor]]'s sergeant and companion in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], and the nephew of Joseph Katzenelson, a companion of [[Zeev Jabotinsky]], and one of the [[Irgun]]'s two Chiefs of Illegal Immigration.  Shmuel Katzenelson joined the Irgun at the age of 15, and was nicknamed ''Tamir'' ("tall and straight" in Hebrew), a name he later adopted legally.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, pp. 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Tamir had been the Irgun's Chief of Intelligence in Jerusalem, and Gruenwald's daughter Rina had been under his command as a nurse.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, pp. 41-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial, which government lawyers expected to last four days, lasted for two years, and resulted in 1955 in an acquittal of Gruenwald and a statement from the judge that Kastner had "sold his soul to the devil." The basis of the allegation and the judge's statement was that Kastner had collaborated with SS officer {{Interlanguage link multi|Hermann Krumey|de}}, and later [[Adolf Eichmann]], by betraying the Hungarian Jewish masses in return for the rescue of a few hundred Jewish VIPs. The judge also condemned Kastner because after the war, he had given a positive affidavit on behalf of another SS officer, [[Kurt Becher]], which convinced the [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg authorities]] not to prosecute Becher for war crimes. Although the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] overturned the collaboration finding in the verdict in 1958, Kastner had already been assassinated.

'''''Mall Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game]], released in 2002 for [[Windows 95]]/98/ME. It was developed by [[Holistic Designs]] and published by [[Take-Two Interactive]].&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/pc-games/mall-tycoon-pc/4505-9696_7-30984195.html|title=Mall Tycoon Review - PC Games - CNET Reviews|work=[[CNET]]|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two sequels: Mall Tycoon 2 (which also had a "Deluxe" extended edition) and Mall Tycoon 3.

==Gameplay==
The game begins as an empty plot of land upon which the player develops his or her mall. Players can build shops, customize decorations, organize special events such as fashion shows, and manage mall employees. It is important for the player to work out what is profitable and what is not to ensure the survival of the fledgling mall. The mall may become overrun with zombies or aliens which can be eradicated when the player calls upon the [[Men in Black]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the United States, ''Mall Tycoon'' sold 420,000 copies and earned $7.6 million by August 2006, after its release in January 2002. It was the country's 36th best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of all ''Mall Tycoon'' series entries released between January 2000 and August 2006 had reached 820,000 units in the United States by the latter date.&lt;ref name=edgesales&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017165955/http://www.edge-online.com/features/top-100-pc-games-21st-century/ |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/top-100-pc-games-21st-century/ |title=The Top 100 PC Games of the 21st Century| author=''Edge'' Staff | date=August 25, 2006 |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |archivedate=October 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game received "generally unfavorable" reviews, according to video game [[review score aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=Metacritic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/mall-tycoon/critic-reviews |title=Mall Tycoon Critic Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=August 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826010101/http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/mall%2Dtycoon/critic%2Dreviews|archivedate=August 26, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' criticized the game for its wonky camera and frustrating interface. The magazine opined that even the poorly received [[Airport Tycoon]] is a better game than Mall Tycoon.&lt;ref name=CGW&gt;{{cite journal|author=Editors of ''CGW''|journal=[[Computer Gaming World]]|title=Sim Games that Suck|date=July 2004|issue=240|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mall Tycoon 2'' is a [[business simulation game]], released in [[2003 in video gaming|2003]]. It is the sequel to ''Mall Tycoon'', which allows the gamer to construct, expand and thereafter manage a shopping mall. It describes itself as the "Ultimate Mall Experience".

The Mall is visited by many types of customers, from children to seniors. There are also criminals among the clientele, who should be caught by the mall's security guards, and visits by [[dog]]s, which indicates a low level of hygiene and security. Staff can be hired to perform these duties, such as janitors for cleaning floors,  but some of the hiring specifications require background checks, which cost money and affect bottom line.

The number of stores and the rating also affect the number of customers the mall gets. For every store, five people can fit into your shopping mall, and the higher the rating, the more people come to your mall. The game provides a wide variety of stores. They include electronics, clothing, food, entertainment, sports and services. Many of the more advanced stores need to be researched before they can be constructed. A player can build a mall atrium and arrange monthly events to promote the mall. Such promotions include car shows, a mall oasis and a circus. An "owner" also can build restaurants, movie theaters, bowling alleys and arcades to attract customers. As with hiring research, these new additions also must be researched and evaluated.

Floors may be changed easily and can be customised. Wood is the most common flooring medium, but other types include a puzzle floor for the kids' area and tiles for the food court. Adding floors to the mall is expensive, but is a necessary investment when all vacant areas have been occupied and expanded to their limits.

The Deluxe version of ''Mall Tycoon 2'' adds certain scenarios, more customer types and other new features.

''Mall Tycoon 3'' is a [[business simulation game]], released in [[2005 in video gaming|2005]]. It was developed by [[Cat Daddy Games]] and published by [[Global Star Software]]. It is the third and final installment in the Mall Tycoon series, after the original ''Mall Tycoon'' and ''[[Mall Tycoon 2]]''. The game was released to mixed reviews, getting lower than the previous games.

After selecting to play in sandbox mode, three starting locations are given. You may choose to build your mall in a neighborhood, a big city, or beside the beach. One may also choose to play a campaign game instead, and select from several different challenges.
[[Image:Malltycoon3 screencap.jpg|thumb|left|Interior view of mall in Career Mode]]

Unlike in the previous installments of the series, Mall Tycoon 3 allows players to create customized stores. Over 40 types of stores of various types are available for placement in a pre-made store or a player may design their own, putting in everything from sale signs to the merchandise racks. Also customizable are the employees; their job capabilities and personal appearances are adjustable. In addition to regular in-line stores, there are also a handful of kiosks, such as one that sells cellular phones.

In the first two Mall Tycoon games, stores were created by placing the set store size, and then adding a store to them. In Mall Tycoon 3, the player paints the floor to create a store, allowing for them to be of any shape or size.

Mall Tycoon 3 features a total of 5 buildable mall levels.

'''Medical materiel''' are [[medical supply]] technicians employed by hospitals, clinics, and the military; these professionals are responsible for managing and requisitioning, receiving, storing, issuing, safeguarding and accounting for supplies and medical equipment used in healthcare. In addition, medical supply technicians are responsible for maintaining requirements and records on storage/war reserve materiel; establishing stock control levels and inventory control; controlled medical items (i.e. drugs and precious metals); and delivering supplies and equipment to the customers. [[Medical logistics]] is often confused with and falls over the professional group in the hospital, the medical materiel/medical supply technicians.

Medical supply technicians have many specialized areas of which they work, such as medical equipment management office (MEMO), acquisitions, controlled medical items, inventory management, warehouse and distribution, and customer service.

==Medical materiel technician training==
Sound knowledge of high school courses in management, basic electronic data processing, bookkeeping, accounting, and business administration is highly desirable, and therefore tend to have a bachelor's in business and advanced degrees from major universities. Most entry level Loggies enter into the field with a two-year associate degree in medical materiel technology and have at least four years' experience in the field, or they spend around one year in full-time military training.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} A four-year graduate acts as a business administrator that perform the same medical materiel management duties similar to a medical supply or sales manager. Practical experience is gained through [[internship]]s. Continuing education in the form of mentoring and service schools is typically provided by specific medical supply manufacturers.

==Professional certification==
Medical materiel technicians typically require a type of professional certification, such as satisfying certain education requirements and passing an examination to become a certified materials &amp; resources professional (CMRP, certified medical manager (CMM)), or certified professional logistician. In many cases, carrying the title of "CMRP" is highly encouraged, not mandatory, and is respected within the community.

==Employment==
In-house they typically work in the hospital's medical logistics department, but can also find employment as a third-party supply organization. Sales/supply organizations they work for OEM or Third Parties and are often called sales specialists.

==Military roles==

In [[accounting]], '''minority interest''' (or '''non-controlling interest''') is the portion of a subsidiary corporation's stock that is not owned by the parent corporation. The magnitude of the minority interest in the subsidiary company is generally less than 50% of [[shares outstanding|outstanding shares]], or the corporation would generally cease to be a subsidiary of the parent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.groco.com/readingroom/bus_dloc_mid.aspx. The Minority Interest Discount&lt;/ref&gt;

It is, however, possible (such as through special voting rights) for a controlling interest requiring consolidation to be achieved without exceeding 50% ownership, depending on the accounting standards being employed. Minority interest belongs to other investors and is reported on the consolidated [[balance sheet]] of the owning company to reflect the claim on [[assets]] belonging to other, non-controlling shareholders. Also, minority interest is reported on the consolidated [[income statement]] as a share of profit belonging to minority shareholders.

The reporting of 'minority interest' is a consequence of the requirement by [[accounting standards]] to 'fully' consolidate partly owned subsidiaries. Full consolidation, as opposed to partial consolidation, results in financial statements that are constructed as if the parent corporation fully owns these partly owned subsidiaries; except for two line items that reflect partial ownership of subsidiaries: net income to common shareholders and common equity. The two minority interest line items are the net difference between what would have been the common equity and net income to common, if all subsidiaries were fully owned, and the actual ownership of the group. All the other line items in the financial statements assume a fictitious 100% ownership.

Some investors have expressed concern that the minority interest line items cause significant uncertainty for the assessment of value, leverage and liquidity.&lt;ref&gt;http://eumedion.nl/en/public/knowledgenetwork/position-papers/position_paper_full_consolidation_of_partly_owned_subsidiaries_requires_additional_disclosure.pdf.  Position paper by corporate governance forum 'Eumedion'&lt;/ref&gt; A key concern of investors is that they cannot be sure what part of the reported cash position is owned by a 100% subsidiary and what part is owned by a 51% subsidiary.

Minority interest is an integral part of the [[enterprise value]] of a company. The converse concept is an [[associate company]].

==Accounting treatment==
Under the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]], the non-controlling interest is reported in accordance with [[IFRS 5]] and is shown at the very bottom of the Equity section on the consolidated [[balance sheet]] and subsequently on the [[statement of changes in equity]]. Under [[US GAAP]] minority interest can be reported either in the liabilities section, the equity section, or the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The Mezzanine section is located between liabilities and equity. FASB FAS 160 and FAS 141r significantly alter the way a parent company accounts for non-controlling interest (NCI) in a subsidiary. It is no longer acceptable to report minority interest in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet.

The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) is a partnership between government, academia, and the private sector focused supporting the country’s ability to address current and future cybersecurity education and workforce challenges through standards and best practices. NICE is led by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] in the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]]. 

==History==
The [[Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative|Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI)]], established by President George W. Bush in January 2008, included over twelve Initiatives, one of which, Initiative 8, was aimed at making the Federal cybersecurity workforce better prepared to handle cybersecurity challenges.

In May 2009, the [https://csrc.nist.gov/Topics/Laws-and-Regulations/executive-documents/Cyberspace-Policy-Review Cyberspace Policy Review], directed by President Barack Obama,  elevated the CNCI Initiative 8, which had initially been focused on improving the Federal cybersecurity workforce’s ability to perform cybersecurity work. The scope was expanded beyond the Federal workforce to include the private sector workforce, truly making it a national charge. 

In March 2010, the Obama administration declassified limited material regarding the CNCI, making Initiative 8 public: ''Initiative #8. Expand cyber education.'' ''While billions of dollars are being spent on new technologies to secure the U.S. Government in cyberspace, it is the people with the right knowledge, skills, and abilities to implement those technologies who will determine success. However there are not enough cybersecurity experts within the Federal Government or private sector to implement the CNCI, nor is there an adequately established Federal cybersecurity career field. Existing cybersecurity training and personnel development programs, while good, are limited in focus and lack unity of effort. In order to effectively ensure our continued technical advantage and future cybersecurity, we must develop a technologically-skilled and cyber-savvy workforce and an effective pipeline of future employees. It will take a national strategy, similar to the effort to upgrade science and mathematics education in the 1950’s, to meet this challenge.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative|date=2018-07-17|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_National_Cybersecurity_Initiative&amp;oldid=850689173|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the CNCI described training, education, and professional development programs as lacking “unity of effort”. 

[https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1353/text Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014] Title IV established the “National cybersecurity awareness and education program”, which is now known as the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE).

==Publications==
'''NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework'''
[[File:NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.jpg|thumb|NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework seven categories in color boxes.]]
The NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NICE Framework), NIST Special Publication 800-181&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework|last=Newhouse|first=William|publisher=NIST|year=2017|isbn=|location=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-181.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a national focused resource that categorizes and describes cybersecurity work. The publication serves as a fundamental reference to support a workforce capable of meeting an organization’s cybersecurity needs by establishing a taxonomy and common lexicon that describes cybersecurity work and workers irrespective of where or for whom the work is performed. The NICE Framework is intended to be applied in the public, private, and academic sectors. Although the NICE Framework was published as a NIST Special Publication in August 2017, working drafts of the document have been in use since 2010. The publication is intended to be a living document that will be updated periodically based on change requests to the NICE Program Office.  A plethora of tools and resources exist for learning about and implementing the NICE Framework. Learn more at [https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework nist.gov/nice/framework].   

'''NICE Strategic Plan'''

The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 requires that a strategic plan be developed and implemented every five years. The current [https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/about/strategic-plan NICE Strategic Plan] includes a multitude of guiding values and three primary goals: 1) Accelerate Learning and Skills Development, 2) Nurture a Diverse Learning Community, and 3) Guide Career Planning and Workforce Development. See the current and past versions of the NICE Strategic Plan at [https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice nist.gov/nice]. 

'''Supporting the Growth and Sustainment of the Nation's Cybersecurity Workforce: Building the Foundation for a More Secure American Future'''

In May 2017, President Donald Trump issued the Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. In part, the order states that it is the policy of the United States “to support the growth and sustainment of a workforce that is skilled in cybersecurity and related fields as the foundation for achieving our objectives in cyberspace.” Consequently, the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of Homeland Security were directed to provide a report to the President with findings and recommendations regarding how to support the growth and sustainment of the Nation's cybersecurity workforce in both the public and private sectors. The report, ''[https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/executive-order-13800 Supporting the Growth and Sustainment of the Nation's Cybersecurity Workforce: Building the Foundation for a More Secure American Future]'', is the response to this charge. 

'''NICE Framework Work Role Capability Indicators: Indicators for Performing Work Roles''' 

The [https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8193/draft NICE Framework Work Role Capability Indicators: Indicators for Performing Work Roles, draft NIST Interagency Report 8193], was co-authored by representatives from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. The document helps determine what qualities or accomplishments indicate that someone is suitable to perform a particular job or activity. These qualities are defined in this report as “capability indicators.”

==Organization==
NICE is headquartered at NIST facilities in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The NICE Program Office activities are organized into three categories: government engagement, industry engagement, and academic engagement. 

'''Committees'''

NICE has several committees: 

* [https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/national-initiative-cybersecurity-education-nice/nice-interagency NICE INTERAGENCY COORDINATING COUNCIL]  - The NICE Interagency Coordinating Council convenes Federal Government partners of NICE for consultation, communication, and coordination of policy initiatives and strategic directions related to cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development. The meetings provide an opportunity for the NICE Program Office, to communicate program updates with key partners in the Federal Government to learn about other Federal Government activities in support of NICE. The group will also identify and discuss policy issues and provide input into the strategic directions for NICE. 
* [https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/about/working-group NICE WORKING GROUP] - The NICE Working Group provides a mechanism for public and private sector participants to develop concepts, design strategies, and pursue actions that advance cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development. The meetings provide an opportunity for consultation and information-sharing between the government, academia, and the private sector. The NICE Working Group also identifies new initiatives that support the strategic objectives of NICE. 
* [https://niceconference.org/about NICE CONFERENCE PROGRAM COMMITTEE] – The NICE Conference Program Committee serves as expert advisors to the NICE Program office, coordinators, and hosts of the [https://niceconference.org/ NICE Conference]. The Program Committee is responsible for identifying the conference theme and tracks as well as soliciting and selecting speaker proposals for the conference. 
* [https://www.k12cybersecurityconference.org/conference-planning-committee/ NICE K12 CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION CONFERENCE PLANNING COMMITTEE] – The NICE K12 Cybersecurity Education Conference Planning Committee assists and supports the NICE Program office, coordinators, and hosts of the [https://www.k12cybersecurityconference.org/ NICE K12 Cybersecurity Education Conference]. 

== Funded Projects ==
'''NICE Challenge Project'''

The [https://nice-challenge.com/ NICE Challenge Project], led by California State University, San Bernardino, is designed to create a flexible set of challenge environments and supporting infrastructure with a low barrier of use in which one would be able to perform the tasks outlined in the [https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework]. It can be used as a platform for instruction as well as to evaluate those who endeavor to be part of the cybersecurity workforce. 

'''CyberSeek'''

[https://www.cyberseek.org/ CyberSeek], an interactive heat map and pathway tool, developed by [[CompTIA]] in partnership with Burning Glass Technologies, provides a data visualization of the need for and supply of cybersecurity workers to guide employers, job seekers, policy makers, education and training providers, and guidance counselors. CyberSeek includes a Cybersecurity Jobs Heat Map which shows information on the supply of workers with relevant credentials. This project also shows Career Pathways in cybersecurity that map opportunities for advancement in the field. 

'''Regional Alliances and Multistakeholder Partnerships to Stimulate Cybersecurity Education and Workforce Development (RAMPS)''' 

[https://www.nist.gov/nice/regional-alliances-and-multistakeholder-partnerships-stimulate-ramps RAMPS] was a program that provides funding opportunities to build multistakeholder workforce partnerships of employers, schools and institutions of higher education, and other community organizations.

The '''Offshore Energy and Jobs Act''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|2231}}) is a bill that was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].  The Offshore Energy and Jobs Act would revise existing law governing the leasing, operation, and development of oil and natural gas resources available in the [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS).&lt;ref name="cbo2231" /&gt;  The bill is primarily supported by [[Republican party (United States)|Republicans]] and is opposed by President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="pete1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obama1" /&gt;

==Provisions/Elements of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=2231sum&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 2231 – Summary |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2231 |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Offshore Energy and Jobs Act''' would amend the [[Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act]] (OCSLA) to direct the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] to implement a leasing program that includes at least 50% of the available unleased acreage within each [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS) planning area considered to have the largest undiscovered, technically recoverable [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] resources, with an emphasis on offering the most geologically prospective parts of the planning area.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;

The act instructs the Secretary, in developing a five-year oil and gas leasing program, to determine a specified domestic strategic production goal for the development of oil and natural gas as a result of that program.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;

It would also require the Secretary to: (1) develop and submit a new five-year oil and gas leasing program, (2) conduct offshore oil and gas Lease Sale 220 within one year after enactment of this Act, (3) make replacement lease blocks available in the [[Offshore drilling on the US Atlantic coast#Future lease sales|Virginia lease sale planning area]] that are acceptable for oil and gas exploration and production if the [[Secretary of Defense]] proposes deferral from a lease offering due to [[United States offshore drilling debate#Military training argument|defense-related activities]] irreconcilable with mineral exploration and development.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;

The bill instructs the Secretary to conduct a lease sale within two years after enactment of the Act for areas off the coast of [[South Carolina]] that have the most geologically promising hydrocarbon resources and constituting at least 25% of the leasable area within the South Carolina offshore administrative boundaries.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;

It also directs the Secretary to: (1) offer for sale by December 31, 2014, leases of tracts in the [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]] and [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]/Ventura Basins of the Southern California OCS Planning Area; and (2) prepare a multisale [[environmental impact statement]] pursuant to the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] of 1969 for all lease sales required under this Act.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;

The Offshore Energy and Jobs Act, if passed, would also:
:*Allocate 37.5% of the amount of new federal leasing revenues to coastal states that are: (1) impacted by the leases under which those revenues are received by the United States, and (2) within 200 miles of the leased tract.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Establish in the [[Department of the Interior]]: (1) an Under Secretary for Energy, Lands, and Minerals, (2) an Assistant Secretary of Ocean Energy and Safety, (3) an Assistant Secretary of Land and Minerals Management, (4) a Bureau of Ocean Energy, (5) an Ocean Energy Safety Service, and (6) an Office of Natural Resources Revenue.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Instruct the Secretary to establish: (1) a National Offshore Energy Safety Academy, and (2) an Outer Continental Shelf Energy Safety Advisory Board.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Require the Secretary to: (1) certify annually that all Interior Department personnel having regular, direct official contact with government contractors, or conducting investigations, issuing permits, or overseeing energy programs, comply fully with federal employee ethics laws and regulations; and (3) conduct a random [[drug test]]ing program of such personnel.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Abolish the [[Minerals Management Service]].&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Direct the Secretary to collect non-refundable fees from the operators of facilities subject to inspection.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Establish in the Treasury the Ocean Energy Enforcement Fund as depository for such fees.&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;
:*Redefine the outer Continental Shelf to include all submerged lands lying within the U.S. [[exclusive economic zone]] and the Continental Shelf adjacent to any [[United States territory|U.S. territory]].&lt;ref name="2231sum" /&gt;

==Congressional Budget office report==
{{cbo summary}}&lt;ref name=cbo2231&gt;{{cite web |title=CBO {{!}} HR 2213|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44355|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.R. 2231 would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). It would direct the Department of the Interior (DOI) to adopt a new leasing plan for the 2015–2020 period, require auctions of leases in certain areas in the Atlantic and Pacific OCS, and reduce the department’s discretion regarding which regions would be included in future lease sales. Under this bill, some of the offsetting receipts from leases issued in newly available areas would be spent, without further appropriation, to make payments to states. Finally, H.R. 2231 would direct DOI to collect fees from certain firms that operate in the OCS and to implement various administrative reforms.&lt;ref name="cbo2231" /&gt;

CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 2231 would reduce net direct spending by $1.5 billion over the 2014–2023 period. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the legislation would reduce direct spending. In addition, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost $40 million over the 2013–2018 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Enacting this bill would not affect revenues.&lt;ref name="cbo2231" /&gt;

==Procedural history==
===House===
The Offshore Energy and Jobs Act was introduced into the House on June 4, 2013 by [[Doc Hastings|Rep. Doc Hastings (R-WA)]].&lt;ref name=2231majoractions&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 2231 – Major Actions |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2231/actions |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] and the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources]] on June 4, 2013.&lt;ref name=loc2231allcongactions&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 2231 – All Congressional Actions |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:H.R.2231:@@@X |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subcommittee held hearings on June 6 and 11, before discharging the bill back to the full committee on June 12, 2013.&lt;ref name="loc2231allcongactions" /&gt;  On June 12, the House Committee on Natural Resources marked-up the bill and ordered it reported in amended form by a vote of 23-18.&lt;ref name="loc2231allcongactions" /&gt;  On June 24, 2013, the bill was reported alongside [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt125/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt125.pdf House Report 113-125].&lt;ref name=hreport113125&gt;{{cite web |title=House Report 113-125 |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt125/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt125.pdf |publisher=Government Printing Office |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 28, 2013, the House voted 235-186 in [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll304.xml Roll Call Vote 304] to pass the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act.&lt;ref name="loc2231allcongactions" /&gt;  Sixteen [[Democratic party (United States)|Democrats]] voted in favor of the bill.&lt;ref name=pete1&gt;{{cite news |last=Kasperowicz |first=Pete |title=House votes to expand offshore oil-and-gas leases |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/308433-house-votes-to-expand-offshore-oil-and-gas-leases |accessdate=July 2, 2013 |newspaper=The Hill |date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential reaction===
In a statement released on June 25, 2013, [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] issued a statement threatening to veto the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act if changes weren't made.&lt;ref name=obama1&gt;{{cite web |title=STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY H.R. 2231 – Offshore Energy and Jobs Act |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/113/saphr2231r_20130625.pdf |publisher=Executive Office of the President |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his statement, the President criticized the bill for setting "unworkable deadlines," for reducing the net return to taxpayers of money from the leasing of public land, and for the details of the reorganization of the former Minerals Management Service.&lt;ref name="obama1" /&gt;  Three days later, the House passed the bill over the President's objections.&lt;ref name="loc2231allcongactions" /&gt;

==Debate and discussion==

The House [[Republican party (United States)|Republicans]] have three main talking points about their reasons for supporting the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act.&lt;ref name=2231gop&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 2231 – Legislative Digest |url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/113/1/hr2231 |publisher=House Republicans |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Those three talking points are:
:*"The President has implemented a virtual moratorium on oil and natural gas exploration and production in the OCS.  His current 5-year leasing program blocks 85% of offshore areas from potential energy production."&lt;ref name="2231gop" /&gt;
:*"By blocking OCS exploration and production, the President is also blocking the vast economic benefits it would provide."&lt;ref name="2231gop" /&gt;
:*"In the long-run, offshore drilling has the potential to create 1.2 million jobs, $70 billion in wages, $2.2 trillion in tax receipts, and $8 trillion in additional economic output (GDP)."&lt;ref name="2231gop" /&gt;

Democrats responded to these arguments by insisting that there were enough open areas for energy companies to lease from and denied that the President's plan had increased gas prices.&lt;ref name="pete1" /&gt;

'''PaperWorks''' was a [[computer program]] introduced by [[Xerox Corporation]] in 1992, which allowed a business traveler to [[communicate]] with his or her [[personal computer]] while away from the [[office]].

PaperWorks could be used to send and retrieve documents between the fixed computer system and the business traveler, by using [[fax]] machines.  

The software created special [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] [[Form (document)|forms]], similar to the type of forms used to score [[standardized tests]].  (Related topic: [[Optical mark recognition|OMR]])

The [[user (computing)|user]] would then [[fax]] the form back to the central computer, commanding one of several tasks to be performed.  For example:
* the user could attach a document to the form which would be stored at the home office (for possible later processing), or

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12149">'''Peer production''' (also known as [[mass collaboration]]) is a way of producing goods and services that relies on [[self-organizing]] communities of individuals. In such communities, the labor of a large number of people is coordinated towards a shared outcome.

==Overview==
Peer production is a process taking advantage of new [[collaborative]] possibilities afforded by the [[internet]] and has become a widespread mode of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Benkler |first=Yochai|title=Freedom in the Commons: Towards a Political Economy of Information|journal=Duke Law Journal|date=April 2003|volume=52|issue=6|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1191&amp;context=dlj|accessdate=28 November 2011|page=1245}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[free software|Free]] and [[open source software]] and [[open source hardware]] are two examples of peer production. One of the earliest instances of networked peer production is [[Project Gutenberg]], a project in which volunteers make out-of-copyright works available online.&lt;ref name="duguid" /&gt; Examples include [[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia, and [[Linux]], a computer operating system. For-profit enterprises mostly use partial implementations of peer production, and would include such sites as [[Flickr]], [[Etsy]], [[Digg]], and [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]].&lt;ref&gt;Benkler, Y., Shaw, A., &amp; Hill, B. M. (2015). ''Peer production: A form of collective intelligence'' (pp. 175-204). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Peer production can also be utilized by sharing [[open source hardware]] designs to be replicated with digital manufacturing technologies such as [[RepRap]] 3-D printers.&lt;ref&gt;RepRap stands for self '''rep'''licating '''rap'''id prototyper and the design of the printer itself is an example of peer production.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of such designs is growing exponentially on free design sites such as [[Youmagine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wittbrodt | first1 = B.T. | last2 = Glover | first2 = A.G. | last3 = Laureto | first3 = J. | last4 = Anzalone | first4 = G.C. | last5 = Oppliger | first5 = D. | last6 = Irwin | first6 = J.L. | last7 = Pearce | first7 = J.M. | year = 2013 | title = Life-cycle economic analysis of distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printers | url = | journal = Mechatronics | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 713–726 | doi = 10.1016/j.mechatronics.2013.06.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer production refers to the production process on which the previous examples are based. [[Commons-based peer production]] is a subset of peer production.

Peer production occurs in a socio-technical system which allows thousands of individuals to effectively cooperate to create a non-exclusive given outcome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benkler, Yochai]] and [[Nissenbaum Helen]], "Commons based Peer Production and Virtue"&lt;/ref&gt; These collective efforts are informal. Peer production is a collaborative effort with no limit to the amount of discussion or changes that can be made to the product. However, as in the case of Wikipedia, a large amount, in fact the majority, of this collaborative effort is maintained by very few devoted and active individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Huberman, Bernardo A, Wilkinson, Dennis M, Wu, Fang "Feedback loops of attention in peer production"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[Crowdsourcing]] products such as community [[cookbooks]] are a form of peer production. [[Gooseberry Patch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gooseberry Patch|url=http://www.gooseberrypatch.com/|publisher=Gooseberry Patch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has used its customer/friend community to create its line of exclusive cookbooks for over 18 years.

For example, there are now several types of open-source solar-powered [[3-D printers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = Debbie L. | last2 = Babasola | first2 = Adegboyega | last3 = Rozario | first3 = Joseph | last4 = Pearce | first4 = Joshua M. | year = | title = Mobile Open-Source Solar-Powered 3-D Printers for Distributed Manufacturing in Off-Grid Communities | url = https://www.academia.edu/8603622/Mobile_Open-Source_Solar-Powered_3-D_Printers_for_Distributed_Manufacturing_in_Off-Grid_Communities | journal = Challenges in Sustainability | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 18–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for production in [[off grid]] locations&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Pangburn, How 3D Printers Are Boosting Off-The-Grid, Underdeveloped Communities - MotherBoard available at http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-3d-printers-are-boosting-off-the-grid-underdeveloped-communities Nov. 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and other forms of [[open source appropriate technology]] like the use of biomaterials.&lt;ref&gt;Rocco, G.R., 2015. Developing Maker Economies in Post-Industrial Cities: Applying Commons Based Peer Production to Mycelium Biomaterials.http://scholarworks.umass.edu/masters_theses_2/257/&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer production has also been utilized in producing collaborative [[Open Educational Resources]] (OERs). [[Writing Commons]], an international open textbook spearheaded by Joe Moxley at the [[University of South Florida]], has evolved from a print textbook into a crowd-sourced resource for college writers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;"About."{{cite web|title=Writing Commons|url=http://writingcommons.org/about|publisher=CC BY-NC-ND 3.0|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massive open online course]] (MOOC) platforms have also generated interest in building online [[eBooks]]. The Cultivating Change Community (CCMOOC) at the [[University of Minnesota]] is one such project founded entirely on a grassroots model to generate content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Anders |first=Abram |title=Experimenting with MOOCs: Network-based Communities of Practice. |booktitle=Great Plains Alliance for Computers and Writing Conference |date=November 9, 2012 |location=Mankato, MN |url=https://cultivatingchange.wp.d.umn.edu/community/ccmooc-experimenting-with-moocs-at-gpacw/ |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107091212/https://cultivatingchange.wp.d.umn.edu/community/ccmooc-experimenting-with-moocs-at-gpacw/ |archivedate=November 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 10 weeks, 150 authors contributed more than 50 chapters to the CCMOOC eBook and companion site.&lt;ref&gt;"About."{{cite web|title=Cultivating Change Community|url=https://cultivatingchange.wp.d.umn.edu/community/about/|publisher=CC BY-NC 3.0|accessdate=11 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630121618/https://cultivatingchange.wp.d.umn.edu/community/about/|archivedate=30 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peer to Peer University]] has applied peer production principles to online open learning communities and [[peer learning]].

==Criticism==
Several critics have challenged the prevailing optimism with which peer production is viewed.

Daniel Kreiss, Megan Finn, and Fred Turner criticize the consensus perspective on peer production as utopian. Asserting that this new mode of production challenges the traditional form of [[bureaucracy]], they reference [[Max Weber]]’s analysis of modern bureaucracy and urge that this analysis be applied to peer production. They argue that bureaucracy is better equipped to handle social problems than peer production, which they consider unsustainable. As bureaucracy promotes a rationally organized, rule-oriented functioning of society,  Kreiss, Finn, and Turner claim that peer production undermines this aspect due to its tendency to encourage individual behavior based on private morality. This tendency, they argue, degrades [[autonomy]] by “collapsing public and private boundaries,” allowing people’s professional lives to extend into their private domains.&lt;ref name=Kreiss&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kreiss|first1=Daniel|last2=Finn|first2=Megan|last3=Turner|first3=Fred|title=The limits of peer production|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/13/2/243.full.pdf+html|website=Sage Journals|publisher=Sage|accessdate=24 May 2014|pages=243–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics claim that the participatory nature of peer production is apt to generate misinformation and products of inferior quality. In his book [[The Cult of the Amateur]], [[Andrew Keen]] assesses peer-produced content on the [[Internet]] and asserts that it exists as a “smokescreen” which emptily promises more truth and deeper knowledge, but actually leading to the disappearance of truth. According to Keen, the Internet advocates peer production to a questionable degree by permitting anyone to post information freely. This form of peer production, he cautions, leaves room for people to plagiarize ideas and distort original thoughts, which he says ultimately creates an uncertainty in the validity of information.&lt;ref name=Keen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keen|first1=Andrew|title=The Cult of the Amateur: How Today's Internet Is Killing Our Culture|date=2007|publisher=Crown Business|edition=3rd|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critic, [[Jaron Lanier]], cites [[Wikipedia]] as an example of how dependence on mass collaboration may result in unreliable or biased information. He warns that websites like Wikipedia promote the notion of the “collective” as all knowing, and that this concentrated influence stands in direct contrast to representative [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=Lanier&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lanier|first1=Jaron|title=You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto|date=2010|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|edition=1st|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these adversarial views, some critics assert that peer production does not perform as well in some contexts as it does in others.&lt;ref name=Benkler&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benkler|first1=Yochai|last2=Shaw|first2=Aaron|last3=Mako Hill|first3=Benjamin|title=Peer Production: A Modality of Collective Intelligence|url=http://mako.cc/academic/benkler_shaw_hill-peer_production_ci.pdf|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Duguid suggests that peer production works less efficiently outside of [[software development]], stating that continued reliance on peer production in various domains of information production will necessitate a search for new ways to guarantee quality.&lt;ref name="duguid"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1396-0466| volume = 11| issue = 10| last = Duguid| first = Paul| title = Limits of self-organization: Peer production and "laws of quality"
| journal = First Monday| accessdate = 2014-09-26| date = 2006-10-02| url = http://ojphi.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1405}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yochai Benkler]] similarly proposes that peer production may produce functional works like [[encyclopedias]] more proficiently than creative works.&lt;ref name="Benkler" /&gt; Despite the valuable potential of peer production, several critics continue to doubt extensive collaboration and its ability to yield high quality outputs.&lt;ref name="Benkler" /&gt;

'''PT Pertamina (Persero)''' or '''Pertamina''' (was ''Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak dan Gas Bumi Negara'', lit. 'State Oil and Natural Gas Mining Company') is an Indonesian [[state-owned]] [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] corporation based in [[Jakarta]].&lt;ref&gt;Useful details about the history of Pertamina are contained in the book about Pertamina by Rhenald Kasali, ''DNA mutation of powerhouse: Pertamina on the move'', PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama Publisher, Jakarta, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  It was created in August 1968 by the merger of ''Pertamin'' (established 1961) and ''Permina'' (established 1957). The firm is currently (2013) the second-largest crude oil producer in Indonesia behind the US-based Chevron Pacific Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Amahl S. Azwar, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/07/re-elected-ceo-bring-pertamina-number-one.html Re-elected CEO to bring Pertamina to "number one"'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 7 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013 for the first time, Pertamina ranked no. 122 in the [[Fortune Global 500]] list of companies with revenues totalling to $70.9 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indonesia-investments.com/doing-business/indonesian-companies/pertamina/item341|website=Indonesia-investments.com|title=Pertamina company profile|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pertamina is also the sole Indonesian company to be featured in the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bisniskeuangan.kompas.com/read/2013/07/16/1102230/Pertamina.Masuk.Daftar.500.Perusahaan.Terbesar.Dunia|website=Bisinkeuangan.kompas.com |title=Pertamina Masuk Daftar 500 Perusahaan Terbesar Dunia |date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Nationalization===
In 1957, Dutch assets in petroleum were nationalised, from which Permina was founded as a state-owned oil monopoly, headed by Lieutenant-General [[Ibnu Sutowo]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (2005), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibnu Sutowo's position as the second deputy of [[Abdul Haris Nasution]] was the beginning of the army's involvement in the oil industry.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, ''A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300'', 2nd ed., Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Permina distributed oil for the entire archipelago.

Permina founded the Apprentice Technical School (''Sekolah Kader Teknik'') in [[Brandan]] to train and produce experts in the field.  To meet this goal Permina established the Oil Academy in [[Bandung]] in 1962. Oil Academy's curriculum pertains to the technical aspects of the oil industry, and the graduates became the main forces of Pertamin (which later transformed to Pertamina).

In 1960, the Congress enacted a policy that the mining of Indonesian oil and ground gases are only permitted for the state, through a state-administered company. Pertamin, established in 1961, was responsible for the administration, management and controlling of the exploration and production.  The policy was short lived. An agreement between the state and foreign companies was affirmed that gradually, [[oil refinery]] manufactures and other assets in marketing and distribution were to be sold to Indonesia within five to fifteen years.

In 1968, to consolidate oil and gas industry for its management, exploration, marketing and distribution, Permina and Pertamin merged and became PN. Pertamina. It continued to do little drilling itself, but made production-sharing agreements with foreign companies.

===The 1970s===
After the merge, Pertamina's production rose considerably (about 15% each in 1968 and 1969, and nearly 20% in 1973).&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, 296&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1973, it directly produced 28.2% of Indonesia's oil, with agreements of [[Caltex]] and [[Standard Vacuum Oil Company|Stanvac]] to produce the rest (67.8% and 3.6%, respectively). Its assets included seven [[oil refinery|refineries]], [[oil terminal]]s, 116 [[oil tanker|tankers]], 102 other vessels and an airline. It was also active in [[cement]], [[fertiliser]], [[liquid natural gas]], [[steel]], [[hospital]]s, [[real estate]], a [[rice]] estate, and [[telecommunications]].

The 1974 oil price increases produced revenues of $4.2 billion in that year, equivalent to approximately one sixth of Indonesia's gross domestic product. Much of this revenue was used by Sutowo to expand Pertamina's interests far beyond oil production to include investments in oil tankers, steel and construction.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (1994), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Pertamina built the [[Bina Graha]], the presidential executive office building in [[Jakarta]].&lt;ref name="R301"&gt;Ricklefs, 301&lt;/ref&gt;  The global oil crisis of the 1970s greatly increased oil prices and profits. Pertamina initially provided a fiscal lift to the hopes of [[Berkeley mafia|Indonesia's development planners]].

For President [[Suharto]] and other members of the ruling elite revenue from Pertamina was "an ongoing source of funding" without accountability. "They ran this cash-cow into the ground, using it for both military and personal ends."&lt;ref name="Vickers, Adrian 2005. p. 185"&gt;Vickers, Adrian. 2005. ''A History of Modern Indonesia,'' Cambridge: University of Cambridge Press, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Adrian Vickers]] describes the endemic corruption at Pertamina:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At each stage of the transaction chain somebody was getting a percentage... If accidents occurred, as in 1972 when eighty impoverished people died... they could be covered up.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, Adrian. 2005. ''A History of Modern Indonesia,'' Cambridge: University of Cambridge Press, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Fokker F.27-200 PK-PFV Pertamina Seletar 14.09.74 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fokker Friendship|Fokker F.27 Series 200 Friendship]] of Pertamina used for transport of employees and equipment during the 1970s]] 
In 1973, the government's ability to borrow money from overseas was constrained, and Pertamina was no longer providing revenues to the state.  Instead, the massive enterprise turned out not to be making money, but compiling exponentially large losses.  In February 1975, Pertamina could no longer pay its American and Canadian creditors.&lt;ref&gt;McCawley, Peter. 1978. "Some Consequences of the Pertamina Crisis in Indonesia," ''Jour of Southeast Asian Studies'', IX(1), March.&lt;/ref&gt;   An investigation followed, which revealed over [[US dollar|US$]]10 billion in debts, mismanagement, and corruption within the company.  This debt was equivalent to approximately thirty percent of Indonesia's [[GNP]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Schwartz55"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwarz |first=A. |year=1994 |title=A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia in the 1990s |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=1-86373-635-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others offer a figure of a $15 billion debt.&lt;ref&gt;cf., Vickers, Adrian. 2005. ''A History of Modern Indonesia,'' Cambridge: University of Cambridge Press, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; A public investigation hurt the reputation of the national elite both among Indonesians and foreigners. The charges against [[Ibnu Sutowo]] were dismissed.  [[Ibnu Sutowo]] and his family were among the richest and most powerful in Indonesia, into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Vickers, Adrian 2005. p. 185"/&gt;  The government took over the operation of the company and sought means by which to repay its debts.&lt;ref name="R301"/&gt; Pertamina's debt problems were eventually solved through a large government bail-out, which nearly doubled Indonesia's foreign debt.&lt;ref name="Schwartz55"/&gt;

===Since the 1980s===

[[Human rights]] observers have long expressed concerns about Indonesia's hostility to [[Trade union|labour unions]].  According to the ''[[Multinational Monitor]]:'' "In 1985, the government ordered the firing of over 1,600 workers at Pertamina and foreign oil companies, charging that they had been members of the [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Indonesian Communist Party]], which had been banned 19 years earlier when [[Suharto]] took power." &lt;ref&gt;Weissman 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Pertamina legally became PT. Pertamina (Persero), as per the enactment of Government Regulation No.31/2003. Pertamina is now under the coordinator of the State Minister of State-owned Enterprises.

Like other contractors, Pertamina holds Cooperation Contract to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Body. With its transformation into a [[limited liability company]], Pertamina has become a business entity with the main target of making a profit.

==President directors==
During the 1970s, until 1976, the president director of Pertamina was [[Ibnu Sutowo]], a well-known figure in Indonesia.  Since then, there have been a number of president directors.  Recent president directors have included the following:

'''Soegijanto''' (1996 to 1998).

'''Martiono Hadianto''' (1998&amp;ndash;2000).  Before his appointment as president director of Pertamina, Martiono was briefly Finance Director of the state-owned airline company [[Garuda Indonesia]]&lt;ref&gt;Satria Rangga Fausta, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/12/11/martiono-hadianto-in-zero-competition-reputation-alone-exists.html Martiono Hadianto: In zero competition, reputation alone exists'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 11 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

('''Note.''' By world standards, none of Indonesia's refineries are large.  The world's largest refinery, at [[Jamnagar Refinery|Jamnagar]] in India, has a production capacity of over 1,200,000 bopd.  As a rule of thumb, refineries need to produce at least 200,000 bopd to reach reasonable international standards of efficiency.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a comparative list of oil refineries across the world, see this [[List of oil refineries]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the refineries which Pertamina owns, Pertamina has invested in two operating companies which manage output from LNG plants.

* PT Badak LNG operates a plant in [[Bontang]], East Kalimantan, with 8 trains having a total capacity of 22.5 million tons per annum.
* PT Donggi Senoro LNG in Uso Village, Batui Subdistrict, Banggai Regency, Central Sulawesi Province, with 1 train with a capacity of 2 million tons per annu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donggisenorolng.co.id/dslng-project/eng/DSLNG-project/|title=Donggi Senoro LNG project|website=Donggisenorolng.co.id|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pertamina also invested in the PT Arun 6 LNG trains near [[Lhokseumawe]], Aceh, which had a total capacity of 12.5 million tons per annum. They closed down due to lack of feed gas in 2014, and now Arun is used an LNG import terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lngworldnews.com/new-lng-story-begins-for-arun-terminal/|title=New LNG story begins for Arun terminal|website=Lngworldnews.com|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2012 and early 2013, it was announced several times that there were plans to build two more large fuel refineries, each with a capacity of around 300,000 bopd, perhaps in Balongan, West Java (or, alternatively, in Bontang, East Kalimantan) and in Tuban, East Java.  The first facility was planned to be built by Pertamina in partnership with [[Kuwait Petroleum Corporation|Kuwait Petroleum]], while the second was expected be built by Pertamina in co-operation with [[Saudi Aramco]].  Total investment was expected to be around $20 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Amahl S.

The crude oil for this alternative project was expected to be supplied from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Amahl S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5899">'''Pier Francesco Guarguaglini''' (born 1937 in [[Tuscany]], Italy) is an Italian engineer, university educator and businessman. He is best known for his nine-year term (2002–2011) as chairman of [[Finmeccanica]] (since 2017 Leonardo), a partly state-owned Italian aerospace and defence conglomerate.

==Biography==
Guarguaglini was born in Tuscany in 1937. He studied electrical engineering at the [[University of Pisa]] and Collegio Pacinotti of [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] (present day [[Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies]]), then received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

Gargauglini began his career as an assistant lecturer in nuclear electronics at the University of Pisa. He later became an assistant lecturer in radar systems at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], remaining there for 15 years. He also worked for nearly 20 years at Italian electronics firm [[Alenia Aeronautica|Selenia]] in various managerial positions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com] ''Pier Francesco Guarguaglini Bio'', google books (website)&lt;/ref&gt;

His various industry positions include general manager, and later chief executive officer, of Officine Galileo (1984–94); a managing director of Oto Melara and Breda Meccanica Bresciana (1994–96); head of Finmeccanica Defence Consortium (1996–99); chairman of the board of directors of Alenia Marconi Systems (1998–2000); chief executive officer of Fincantiere SPA and Cantieri Navali Itaniani (Italy's largest shipbuilding consortium)(1999–2002).

In 2002 Guarguaglini returned to Finmeccanica, being named to the posts of chief executive officer and president on 24 April.

While at Finmeccanica, he also remained busy elsewhere. He was an independent lecturer at the University of Rome, and was named an independent director of [[Eutelsat]] Communications on 26 July 2007. He sat on the counsels of [[Confindustria]], and AECMA (European Association of Aerospace Industries, later changed to AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe).&lt;ref&gt;[http://executivepeoples.com/pier-francesco-guarguaglini/] ''Pier Francesco Guarguaglini'', Executive People Biography (website)&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), and served as a member of the IEEE board representing the United States and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;google books&lt;/ref&gt;

Gargauglini received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/ppr/docs/network-winter-2010.pdf|title=Honorary Graduates 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412085029/http://www1.hw.ac.uk/ppr/docs/network-winter-2010.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departure from Finmeccanica==
Guarguaglini had been nominated to head the Finmeccanica group by the Italian Finance Ministry, which holds some 30 percent of the company's stock. He was considered extremely successful in restoring the company's position in the worldwide industry - under his direction, Finmeccanica gained full control of European helicopter company [[AgustaWestland]] in 2004, and used that control to win the competition to provide [[Marine One|helicopter transportation for the President of the United States]] in 2005. Partly in recognition of this success, US industry magazine [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]] named him its 2005 Person Of The Year.&lt;ref&gt;Person of the Year 2005-2012, ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', 14 January 2013 issue, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; He gained a greater foothold in the US aviation electronics market by purchasing the US electronics fabricator DRS Technologies Inc. in 2008.

By 2009, Italian investigators were looking into bribery charges that had been leveled at several Italian companies. They tried to determine whether executives at one of Finmeccanica's divisions, Selex Sistemi Integrati, had inflated the value of contracts with an air-traffic manager, then used the resulting funds to bribe various politicians. That division was managed by Guarguaglini's wife, Marina Grossi. By early 2011 the government (as represented by Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]]) was convinced that a top-to-bottom shakeout of Finmeccanica management was necessary, and in April 2011 they brought in Giuseppi Orsi (born 1945) to replace Guarguaglini as chief executive officer. Guarguaglini retained responsibility for company strategy, acquisitions, asset sales, and government relations.

The dual-manager situation proved difficult, however, and on 1 December 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scandal at Finmeccanica Revives Questions in Italy|first=Elisabetta|last=Provoledo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/business/global/scandal-at-finmeccanica-revives-questions-in-italy.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guarguaglini held a showdown with the board of directors in an attempt to more clearly define the division of responsibilities between the two managers. Unable to achieve his desired goad, he submitted his resignation effective immediately. It was accepted, and he received a 4.5 million-euro payout on his remaining contract, with another 1.5 million-euro payment at the end of a one-year non-compete agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-01/finmeccanica-s-guarguaglini-faces-showdown-with-board-amid-probe.html] Finmeccanica Chairman Guarguaglini Resigns Amid Probe; Orsi Assumes Role, ''Bloomberg News'', 1 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2014, Guarguaglini was placed under house arrest in connection with the Sistri bribery probe.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelocal.it/20140630/ex-finmeccanica-chief-arrested-in-bribery-probe&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4841">In [[economics]] and [[engineering]], the '''price–performance ratio''' refers to a product's ability to deliver performance, of any sort, for its price. Generally speaking, products with a lower price/performance ratio are more desirable, excluding other factors.

Price–performance is often written as '''cost–performance''' or '''cost–benefit'''.  Even though this term would seem to be a straightforward ratio, when price performance is improved, better, or increased, it actually refers to the performance divided by the price, in other words exactly the opposite ratio (i.e. an inverse ratio) to rank a product as having an increased price/performance.  

==Examples==

===Consumer and medical products===
According to futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil]], products start out as highly ineffective and highly expensive.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"/&gt;

Gradually, products become more effective and cheaper until they are highly effective and almost free to buy.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"/&gt; Some of the products that have followed this example include [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] medications (which are now affordable to the majority of AIDS sufferers{{which|date=September 2014}}), [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] programs, and [[digital camera]]s.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"&gt;{{cite book
  |last = Kurzweil
  |first = Raymond
  |authorlink = Raymond Kurzweil
  |title = The Singularity is Near
  |publisher = [[Penguin Books]]
  |year = 2005
  |isbn = 0-14-303788-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, products that rely primarily on paper (e.g., newspapers and toilet paper) and/or fossil fuels (e.g., electricity in most countries and petroleum gasoline for automobiles) have only increased in price.  

This directly contradicts the trend of electronic gadgets like [[netbook]]s, [[desktop computer]]s, and [[laptop]] computers that also have been decreasing in price. However, the prevailing [[inflation rate]] of a country or province/state may negate the plummeting costs of software, AIDS medications, and/or digital cameras in certain regions along with certain governmental policies. This has the effect of keeping costs high in certain areas while they are dramatically reduced in others. 

In theory, this means that the rich people have earlier access to highly inefficient technologies, medical treatments, and [[Therapy|therapies]] (that are prototypical in nature) while the poor get access to these same products when they become more efficient and easier to manufacture several years down the road.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"/&gt;

===Business world===
During the latter 1990s, the cost–performance ratios of the larger [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] systems fell tremendously in comparison to a number of smaller [[microcomputer]]s handling the same load. As a result, many of the older computer companies were shut down and people were [[unemployment|put out of work]]. However, most of them were able to be re-hired at the newer corporations after undergoing a series of re-training involving the newer technologies.

In the business world, there is usually a value associated with a typical cost–performance ratio analysis. This value can either be positive, neutral, or negative depending on the amount of money spent versus the results achieved by the spending of the available [[Financial capital|capital]]. A cost-performance ratio with a positive value (i.e. greater than 1) indicates that costs are running under budget.&lt;ref name="wideman"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.maxwideman.com/pmglossary/PMG_C11.htm#Cost%20Performance%20Indicator | title = Cost–performance ratio indicator | publisher = Max Wideman| date = | accessdate = 2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A negative value (i.e. less than 1) indicates that costs are running over budget.&lt;ref name="wideman"/&gt; However, a neutral cost-performance ratio (between 1.0 and 1.9) could suggest a certain degree of stagnation in the budget. [[Business trip]]s can also be factored into the cost–performance ratio because spending $50 to do a journey spanning {{convert|100|mi|km}} in two hours is a better cost–performance ratio than spending $105 to do the journey in one hour.

===Computer technology===
The term tends to be used quite a bit when comparing computer hardware. During the latter 1990s, the price–performance ratios of midrange and large [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] systems fell tremendously in comparison to a number of smaller [[microcomputer]]s handling the same load. Many companies were forced out of the industry as this happened, including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[Data General]] and many [[multiprocessor]] vendors such as [[Sequent Computer Systems]] and [[Pyramid Technology]].

'''Rakon Limited''' is a technology company founded in 1967 that designs and manufactures frequency control products, primarily [[quartz crystal]]s and temperature-compensated crystal oscillators ([[TCXO]]), oven controlled crystal oscillators ([[OCXO]]) and voltage controlled crystal oscillators ([[VCXO]]). Its head office is in [[Auckland]], New Zealand with wholly owned subsidiaries in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] with joint venture operations in [[India]] and [[China]]. The company specialises in supplying frequency-control products to the [[GPS]] industry.

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
Rakon was founded on 4 April 1967 by Warren Robinson. Robinson had previously operated a business manufacturing marine radios, Marlin Electronics. These marine radios required between 6-12 quartz crystals with each region within New Zealand requiring a different set of frequencies.

The only source for these crystals was the NZPO ([[New Zealand Post Office]]), and delivery times were often measured in months, which was an ongoing problem for Robinson in his ability to supply his radios. Warren Robinson realising there was an opportunity to compete with the NZPO sold Marlin Electronics to Autocrat Radio and went on to found Rakon Industries (RIL) a few years later (1967). Initially, the New Zealand government blocked Robinson's application to import crystal manufacturing equipment as they didn't wish there to be undue competition to the post office, however by 1967 Robinson was able to secure an import license for the equipment and started manufacturing quartz crystals, in his garage, to supply the local radio market.

=== Early growth ===
By supplying quality crystals on short lead-times, Rakon grew quickly, riding the wave of growth in the radio-communications industry. By 1971, Rakon had moved into its own premises and employed over 30 staff; it had also begun exporting the crystals to Australia and South East Asia. In 1972 Warren Robinson set up a second manufacturing plant in Singapore to supply the growing markets of [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]] and [[Taiwan]].

=== Crystal crash ===
Around 1980, Warren Robinson's eldest son, Brent Robinson, joined Rakon as Managing Director. Brent was made responsible for the crystal manufacturing business, while Warren focused on his other expanding business, Rakon Computers, which at the time owned the distribution rights for [[Unix]] in Australia and New Zealand.

Around this time, a new technology began being widely adopted in radio designs, [[synthesization]]. This meant that rather than a radio requiring a pair of crystals for every frequency band (one for transmit and a second for receive), only one single crystal was required. The impact of this was that Rakon's core crystal business was in rapid decline, with the total market size shrinking to a mere 10% of its previous size.

=== TCXO development ===
Brent Robinson immediately started looking for new related technologies that Rakon could adopt to turn around the rapidly falling sales. In the mid-1980s, Brent came across a product type known as temperature-compensated crystal oscillators. These were mainly being manufactured in Japan at the time and were used, in particular, in [[cellular phone]]s. With NEC in Australia looking for a local supplier of TCXOs, Brent committed Rakon to developing a product of equivalent performance to anything that could be sourced out of Japan.

By the late 1980s, Rakon was supplying TCXOs to NEC Australia's Melbourne factory. The supply of these products became the main focus of Rakon's operations, and the entire manufacturing process for quartz crystals was revamped in order to support this new technology. The early TCXOs that Rakon supplied were imitations of the Japanese products, but Rakon was unable to replicate the highly automated manufacturing processes that existed in Japan. Also the performance of these early products, although good enough, was not satisfactory to the young Brent Robinson.

In order to increase the manufacturing volume, reduce the cost and improve the performance of the products, Rakon developed its manufacturing processes. This was largely due to the fact that there was no local industry to teach the Rakon engineers how to do things, and all manufacturing developments had to be done from a blank sheet of paper.

By 1990, Rakon released a product with an, at the time, unprecedented frequency stability of 1 part per million (1ppm) in a miniature package, nearly {{convert|20|x|10|mm}}.

=== GPS market ===
In 1990, Brent's younger brother, Darren Robinson, joined the company as head of marketing. He had been working in Australia in the computer industry and came on board in part to find new customers for the 1ppm TCXO. At around the same time, NEC Australia halted its mobile phone manufacturing and moved its operations back to Japan, dropping Rakon in preference of a local Japanese supplier at the same time.

Initially Darren Robinson canvased all the emerging cellular phone manufacturers in order to find a new customer for their TCXO. It soon became apparent that although the Rakon product out-performed anything else on the market, it was too expensive for any of the high-volume applications Rakon was set up to support.

In 1991, the Robinson brothers came across an advertisement for a hand-held [[GPS]] unit from a company called [[Magellan Navigation|Magellan]]. After making contact with Magellan, the Robinsons were quickly made aware that the emerging GPS market was seeking for a high stability frequency reference, in a small package available in volume (which at the time was tens of thousands of units).

Initial samples were approved, and volume orders placed shortly afterward. Rakon immediately began approaching all the major GPS suppliers in North America, and within a couple of years, was supplying frequency references widely in the GPS industry.

[[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] had been instrumental in the development and deployment of the GPS system and were the technology leaders at the time.

=== Public listing ===
Rakon continued to focus on developing products for the GPS market. In 2006, they claimed to still hold over 50% market share in the autonomous GPS market (GPS which functions without assistance from the CDMA phone network).{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} There had been massive growth in the number of GPS devices available between 1990 and 2006.

In early 2006, Rakon announced they would list on the New Zealand stock exchange, and on the 13th of April, released their [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] prospectus. The IPO generated a lot of interest in the New Zealand market and although no official numbers were released the listing was heavily over subscribed. The IPO price was $1.60 and shares commenced trading on the 16th of May at $2.30 per share. On 16 May 2007 the share price opened at $5.30 and reached a high a few days later of $5.80. Rakon is often referred to in media as the share market darling, although some commentators point to the lack of other high growth stocks on the [[NZX]] as a reason for Rakon's popularity.

=== Overseas expansion and recent financial performance ===
In March 2007, Rakon acquired the frequency-control products division of [[C-MAC Microtechnology]]. This acquisition gave Rakon a European-based operation, including 2 factories located in the UK and France. The new business unit specialised in other forms of wireless communications and allowed Rakon to become less dependent on the GPS market, and expanded Rakon's product range greatly to include oven-controlled [[crystal oscillator]]s ([[OCXO]]), voltage-controlled crystal oscillators ([[VCXO]]), the Pluto ASIC and a range of low performance commodity products.

In 2008 Rakon formed a joint venture with ([[Centum Electronics]]) to manufacture high value telecommunications infrastructure products and to commercialise Rakon France's R&amp;D programme. Also in 2008, Rakon formed a joint venture with ([[Timemaker]]) to vertically integrate quartz crystal supply.

In 2010 Rakon acquired the company ([[Temex]]) in France, supplying frequency control solutions for the space market.

In 2011 Rakon opened a joint venture facility, Rakon Crystal Chengdu, in China. The investment was an unsuccessful one, with Rakon exiting from its 80% stake in the Chengdu factory in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Rakon sells Chinese subsidiary stake|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/8883230/Rakon-sells-Chinese-subsidiary-stake|newspaper = Stuff.co.nz|date = 2013-07-05|access-date = 2016-01-01|language = English|first = Laura|last = Walters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2012-2014, Rakon suffered a drop in revenue and margins and made a series of losses, shedding up to 86% of its market capitalisation compared to five years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Rakon loss doubles on writedowns, restructure|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11259585|newspaper = New Zealand Herald|date = 2014-05-22|access-date = 2016-01-01|issn = 1170-0777|language = en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2013, the NZ Shareholders Association demanded the resignation of Rakon's Chairman, Bryan Mogridge, and another director, Darren Robinson (son of founder Warren Robinson), after the company announced poor results and a $30m write down of assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Shareholders' Assoc challenge Rakon leaders|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/9105779/Shareholders-Assoc-challenge-Rakon-leaders|newspaper = Stuff.co.nz|date = 2013-08-30|access-date = 2016-01-01|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rakon was also fined $30,000 by the [[New Zealand Exchange|NZX]] after it failed to maintain continuous disclosure obligations over selling 80% of its shareholding in its Chengdu factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Rakon censure timely reminder, says Shareholders Assn|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11214233|newspaper = New Zealand Herald|date = 2014-03-05|access-date = 2016-01-01|issn = 1170-0777|language = en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rakon returned to a small profit in November 2015 but with much reduced revenues compared to pre-[[Financial crisis of 2007–08|GFC]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rakon turns to profit but annual earnings likely to be flat|url = http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/rakon-turns-1h-profit-annual-earnings-likely-be-flat-b-181806|website = The National Business Review|accessdate = 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Weapons components controversy ==
Since 2005, Rakon has been the subject a number of allegations relating to the use of their products in military applications. Rakon has never denied that they supply products into military applications and have, at various times, stated this accounts for 1% of their output, or 10% of their revenue.

In August 2005, the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' quoted Rakon Marketing Director, Darren Robinson, as saying that the company's technology went into "smart bombs and missiles" used by the US military.&lt;ref name="NZH22"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10342322 |title=NZ firm denies weapons claim |author=Booker, Jarrod |date=25 August 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rakon denied the claims, stating the company was not privy to the "end-use systems, equipment or applications used by its customers.&lt;ref name=NZH22/&gt;

In May 2006 the ''Herald'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/index.cfm?c_id=1501071 NZH71&lt;/ref&gt; ran a large expose around Rakon products being supplied to Rockwelll for incorporation in [[United States Armed Forces]] '[[smart bombs]]'. The claims were based around the facts that Rakon had known of the end-use of their products since 1994 and may in fact be in breach of New Zealand export restrictions.

In July 2006, Rakon was the target of by [[Global Peace and Justice Auckland]] (GPJA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=99298 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929115454/http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=99298 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Israeli attacks on [[Lebanon]] in July 2006, GPJA issued a media release&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0607/S00365.htm&lt;/ref&gt; appealing "to the Prime Minister to close the loophole which allows New Zealand's Rakon Industries to export parts for Israeli bombs being dropped on [[Lebanon]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].".

Rakon continueS to maintain that their products had not been designed for military use and the question of where they were used was up to their customers to answer. Rakon listed Rockwell Colline as a customer in their IPO prospectus. In June 2006, the [[New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] cleared Rakon products for export, stating that they were unlikely to have been specifically designed for military use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=1501071&amp;objectid=10386803 | work=The New Zealand Herald | title=Rakon's exports lawful, says Goff - National - NZ Herald News | date=16 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/6FE07A4AFB092369CC25718000808015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rakon share price saw a significant rise after the ''Herald'' story went to press. However, various peace activist groups have maintained calls for Rakon to be prohibited from supplying any products to companies involved in the manufacture of weapons or weapons-related systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greens.org.nz/searchdocs/PR9903.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== World's smallest GPS ==
In January 2006, Rakon was announced as having the world's smallest GPS. Rakon actually released the world's smallest GPS RF Front End Module, which is a component in a GPS system; however, various media sources slightly misrepresented the title of the release.

This GPS module allows systems designers to connect an antenna and GPS baseband to the Rakon module and create a small, simple GPS receiver. The concept is that all the 'difficult' radio frequency design is done by Rakon, and the equipment manufacturer can focus on their application, rather than designing GPS. Rakon has not reported any specific sales of the GPS module but claims there is still significant interest in it.

'''Ritual servitude(trokosi system)
''' is a practice in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], and [[Benin]] where traditional religious shrines (popularly called [[fetish shrines]] in Ghana) take human beings, usually young virgin girls, in payment for services, or in religious atonement for alleged misdeeds of a family member. In Ghana and in Togo it is practiced by the [[Ewe people|Ewe tribe]] in the Volta region; in Benin it is practiced by the [[Fon people|Fon]].&lt;ref&gt;FAQ About the Form of Slavery Called Trokosi, ECM Publications, 2002, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

These shrine slaves serve the priests, elders, and owners of a traditional religious shrine without remuneration and without their consent, although the consent of the family or clan may be involved.  Those who practice ritual servitude usually feel that the girl is serving the god or gods of the shrine and is married to the gods of the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Field Findings on the System of Slavery Commonly Known as Trokosi'', L W Rouster, M.R.E., ECMAfrica Publications, 2005, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a girl runs away or dies, she must be replaced by another girl from the family. Some girls in ritual servitude are the third or fourth girl in their family suffering for the same crime, sometimes for something as minor as the loss of trivial property.

It is still practiced in the Volta region in Ghana, in spite of being outlawed in 1998, and despite carrying a minimum three-year prison sentence for conviction. Among the Ewes who practice the ritual in Ghana, variations of the practice are also called ''trokosi'', ''fiashidi'', and ''woryokwe'', with "trokosi" being the most common of those terms.&lt;ref&gt;"The Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery/Human Rights Violations" by Stephen Awudi Gadri, Authorhouse, UK, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In Togo and Benin it is called ''voodoosi'' or ''vudusi''.&lt;ref&gt;"Field Findings on the System of Slavery Commonly Known as Trokosi", L W Rouster, M.R.E., ECMAfrica Publications, 2005, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Victims are commonly known in Ghana as fetish slaves because the gods of African Traditional Religion are popularly referred to as fetishes and the priests who serve them as fetish priests.

==Use of the terms "servitude", "slave" and "slavery"==
Human rights organizations and other NGO's commonly use the words "servitude", "slaves", and "slavery" as non-technical, popularly understood terms that describe the reality of this practice.  They point out that the practice meets all the commonly accepted definitions of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;''Rouster, Wives of the gods'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shrine slaves perform services which are not voluntary and are not paid.  Their lives are totally controlled by the shrines, who in a sense become their owners.

Proponents of the system  of ritual servitude by any of its names object to this term, but except for the technical terms "trokosi", "vudusi", "fiashidi", "woryokoe", the problem is coming up with a suitable alternative.  Sometimes they have compared the trokosi to traditional queen mothers, implying a sense of respect for them, but one representative of an NGO who claims to have interviewed hundreds of participants reports that the participants themselves are offended at being called queens and insist they are/were simply slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Wives of the gods'' p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Juliana Dogbadzi, who served 17 years as a trokosi, says she was "slave to a fetish priest".&lt;ref&gt;Juliana Dogbadzi, PARADE magazine, "One Voice," September 24, 2000, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Cudjoe Adzumah made a study of the practice in the Tongu Districts of Ghana and defined "trokosi" as "slaves of the gods".&lt;ref&gt;Cudjoe Adzumah, "The Trokosi Practice in N Tongu: Its Impact on the Rights of Women and Children, BA Thesis, Sociology Department, University of Ghana, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmanuel Kwaku Akeampong, a native Ghanaian of Harvard University, says that "tro" means a "god" and "kosi" is used at different times to mean either "slave", "virgin", or "wife".&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Kwaku Akeampong, ''Between the Sea and the Lagoon, an Eco-Social History of the Anlo of Southeastern Ghana c. 1850 to Recent Times,'' Ohio University Press, Athens, OH, James Currey, Oxford, 2001, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Anita Ababio, a Ghanaian lawyer who has extensively researched the issue, explains that the Adangbe and Ga word, "woryokwe" comes from "won" meaning cult, and "yokwe", meaning "slave".  Thus, she claims, a "woryokwe" is a "slave of a cult".&lt;ref&gt;Anita Mamusina Heymann Ababio, "Trokosi, Woryokwe, Cultural and Individual Rights: A Case Study of Women's Empowerment and Community Rights in Ghana, St. Mary's University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, August 22, 2000, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Kwame Amen in ''Ghana Studies'' also refers to trokosi as an institution of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Kwame Amen, ''Trokosi (Child Slavery) in Ghana, a Policy Approach'', Ghana Studies I, 1998, p. 35-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, Stephen Awudi Gadri, President of the Trokosi Abolition Fellowship of Ghana, and also himself from a shrine family, claims that trokosi are "slaves of the deities of the shrines".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Awudi Gadri, ''History of the Trokosi System in Ghana'', Vol. 1, Paper presented to the First National Congress on the Trokosi System, June 29, 2000, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;   "Though euphemistically, they are called the 'deity's wives', yet they serve the priests and elders of the shrine and do all the hard chores, as well as becoming sexual partners of the priest," Gadri says.&lt;ref&gt;Gadri, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also says, "the trokosi works for the priest without any form of remuneration whatsoever", and "it is a form of slavery".&lt;ref&gt;Gadri, p. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ababio claims, "The servile status of the trokosi is seen in the duties they perform in the shrines, for which no payment is made...unfortunately for most trokosi, when they are freed they are still bound by rituals which keep them connected or attached to a shrine for life. Practically it means that these victims of ritual servitude always have the rights of ownership exercised over them."&lt;ref&gt;Ababio, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; She then goes on to quote Article 7 of ''The Convention on Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery'', which defines a slave as "a person over whom any or all powers attaching to the rights of ownership are exercised".  Angela Dwamena-Aboagye, a Ghanaian lawyer, says ritual servitude is "slavery, pure and simple.  It violates every human right."&lt;ref&gt;Ababio, quoting ''The Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery'', 1956, ECOSOC, Res. 608, XXI, 1956.  This convention has been ratified and acceded to by Ghana.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the traditional priests also admit the trokosi are slaves.  For example, Togbe Adzimashi Adukpo, a shrine priest, admitted in an interview with BBC in February 2001, "Yes, the girls are my slaves.  They are the property of my shrine."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Hawaley, "Ghana's Trapped Slaves", BBC News, February 8, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the question of whether trokosi is a form of slavery and whether sexual abuse is involved the answers are polarized into two camps.  Some traditionalists defend the system saying that it is simply a cultural practice of certain shrines and as such should be protected.  These defenders claim that while instances of sexual abuse may occur, there is no evidence that sexual or physical abuse is an ingrained or systematic part of the practice.  According to them, the practice explicitly forbids a Trokosi to engage in sexual activity or contact.  The other camp is represented by NGOs working with the trokosi and by former trokosi who have been liberated.  These opponents of the practice have recorded testimony of hundreds of former (now liberated) trokosi who say that sexual abuse was a regular part of their time at the shrine, claiming the number of children born to them by the priest and shrine elders is a witness.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, Field Findings, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although virtually everyone recognizes that the victims themselves have no choice or say in their lot, Stephen Awudi Gadri says that "both the parents (of the victims) and the girls (that is, the victims) have no choice".&lt;ref&gt;The Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery", p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious connections==
Simon Abaxe has researched the practice in Ghana.  He says that ritual servitude is part of African Traditional Religion in some places, but not a universal practice of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Abaxer, "Trokosi Situation on the Ground in Volta Region", ECMAfrica Publications, 2007, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  A form of it is also practiced in India and Nepal as part of Hindu religion, and various forms of it were part of ancient religious traditions of devotion to various gods and goddesses.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  It is distinguished from the Christian monastic tradition at a basic level since ritual servitude is involuntary on the part of the participant, in contrast to Christian monasticism, which is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Field Findings'' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==
There are two major reasons for the practice of ritual servitude.  Most common is the concept of atonement.  A girl is given to the shrine or to the gods as a kind of "living sacrifice" to atone for the real or alleged crimes of a family member or ancestor, as discerned by the priest of the shrine.  During a process of divination he calls on the gods of the shrine to reveal this information.  Girls given to atone for such crimes in a sense are considered a kind of savior, for as long as she remains in the shrine or under its control, the anger of the god is believed to be averted from the rest of the family.&lt;ref name="Rouster, Field Findings p. 5"&gt;Rouster, ''Field Findings'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second most frequent reason for the practice of ritual servitude is that the girl is given for the continuous repayment of the gods for services believed to have been obtained or favors believed to have been rendered from the shrine.  Thus a girl may be given into ritual servitude when someone believes a child has been conceived or a person has been healed, for example, through the intervention of the shrine.&lt;ref name="Rouster, Field Findings p. 5"/&gt;

Proponents of the practice claim that some participants choose a life of ritual servitude of their own volition, but human rights organizations claim that while this may be theoretically possible, they haven't found one yet.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Field Findings'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the traditions of the shrines were veiled in secrecy, and people dared not discuss them, fearing the wrath of the gods if they dared to do so.  For this reason, the practice was neither widely known nor well understood.  In more recent times, since the 1990s at least, abolitionists and human rights advocates have penetrated the veil of secrecy.  The issue has been widely discussed, for instance, in the newspapers and on the radio in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Every Child Ministries, ''The Three Pillars of Trokosi'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and history==

===In the Dahomey Empire===
The giving of virgin girls to the gods was part of many ancient religions.  In West Africa, the practice has gone on for at least several hundred years.  Similar practices using similar terminology were found in the royal court of the Kingdom of Dahomey (in what is now Benin) in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Wives, slaves, and in fact all persons connected with the royal palace of Dahomey were called "ahosi", from "aho" meaning "king", and "si" meaning "dependent" or "subordinate."&lt;ref&gt;Wives of the Leopard-- Gender, Politics &amp; Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey, Edna G. Bay, University of Virginia Press, 1998, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;   By one estimate there were 5,000 to 7,000 ahosi living in the palace at Abomey,&lt;ref&gt;Warrior Women, The Amazons of Dahomey &amp; the Nature of War", Robert B. Edgerton, University of California at Los Angeles, Westview Press, 2000, p. 15 &amp; 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and no men lived there except for a few hundred eunuchs were charged with controlling the women.  After sunset no men at all were allowed in the palace except the king, and he was guarded by women guards called Amazons.  The king controlled every aspect of the lives and even the deaths of the ahosi.  Visitors to old Abomey today are shown a mass grave and told that the king's wives "volunteered," on his death, to be buried alive with him in order to accompany him and serve him in the world to come.  One researcher pointed out, "Of course, one should not make the mistake of ascribing modern democratic meaning to the word "volunteered" as if the wives wanted to die or had any choice in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;"Lorella Rouster, Report on Visit to the Ancient Kingdom of Dahomey, May 2006, ECM Publications, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahosi who became too powerful or too independently minded were simply sacrificed (literally and physically) in the annual office ceremony lasting several days in which the power of the king was renewed by hundreds of human sacrifices, usually performed by public beheadings.&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, Warrior Women, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was documented by [[A. B. Ellis]] who was an eyewitness of the practice in the Dahomey Empire (now Benin) in 1879. According to Ellis, one god called "Khebioso" had 1500 wives in Dahomey alone, the women being called "kosio".  He said they cared for the shrines of the gods, but their main business was religious prostitution.  According to Ellis, most of the gods of the Ewe-speaking people at that time had such women who were similarly consecrated to their service and were commonly considered "wives" of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Ellis, Major, First Battalion West India Regiment, ''The Ewe-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa'', Bahamas, 1890, republished by Benin Press, Chicago, 1965, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

One might argue that those ahosi were wives of the king and lived in the palace, not wives of the gods living in the shrines.  But that distinction is not as clearcut as it might first seem, for the palace was the center of Dahomean religious life, and the place where sacrifices were made and rituals to the ancestors were performed.  Over time, then, it was an easy jump from being ahosi living lives totally controlled by the king in the palace where sacrifices were offered and rituals were performed, to being trokosi living lives totally controlled by a priest in a shrine where sacrifices were offered and rituals were performed.  It was a very easy transition indeed.  Even in the time of the Kingdom of Dahomey, one reads of the vodun or gods successfully demanding that someone become a devotee or vodunsi (wife or follower of the god).&lt;ref&gt;Wives of the Leopard, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Ghana===
As people migrated within West Africa, the practice spread.  Sandra Greene has noted that in Ghana, the practice dates to at least the late 18th century.  At the time the Amlade clan Sui became very powerful, and began to demand female slaves from those who sought its services.  The practice called "replacement" also began in Ghana at that time.  Under this practice, if a shrine slave died or ran away, the family was required to replace her with another girl.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra E. Greene, Gender, Ethnicity and Social Change on the Upper Slave Coast: A History of the Anlo-Ewe, Portsmouth, 1996, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 19th century, Nyigbla became the chief Anlo deity, and its shrines also began to demand slaves for its services.  Involuntary slavery, however, was not at that time and in that place common, since Nyigbla also instituted a practice called foasi, whereby two servants were recruited annually on a more-or-less voluntary basis.  At that time, the slaves were often married to members of powerful priestly families.&lt;ref&gt;Akeampong,p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of opposition to the practice==

===In colonial times===
It is reported by traditionalists that since the mid-18th century the Bremen missionaries decried the practice and purchased freedom for individual trokosi, which were then called "new made slaves", converting them to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mypage.bluewin.ch/yehwehpyramid/trokosi.html Pyramid of Yahweh, about trokosi, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ghana (then [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]) was under colonial rule, a few citizens complained about the practice, but the colonial masters turned their heads.  They derided him{{who|date=July 2012}} as "the blind man who wants to help others see".  The colonial government did investigate the practice at Atigo shrine near Battor from 1919 to 1924.  The investigating District Commissioner, W. Price Jones, called it "a pernicious habit of handing girls over to the fetish", but for economic reasons, decided not to interfere.  As a result of that inquiry, shrine slaves held at the Atigo shrine were told they could return home if they wished.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Ghana, Accra, ADM 11/1/768 Acting District Commissioner of Ada, W. Price Jones to Commissioner for the Eastern Province (CEP), 10 March 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, the colonial government ignored another complaint that the shrine was still keeping trokosi.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Ghana, CEP, to Secretary of Native Affairs, Koforidua, 10 September 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the practice slid back into secrecy and was not brought to the public consciousness again until 1980.

===In the 1980s===
The practice was drawn into the national spotlight at that time when [[Mark Wisdom]], a Baptist pastor, responded to what he claims was a vision from God, and challenged the system in the national media. Wisdom claimed that as he prayed, he saw a vision of women in bonds, crying out for help.  Wisdom claimed to have later discovered these same women on one of his evangelistic missions, held in bondage in a shrine just across the Volta River from his home, but previously unknown to him.  He began publicly denouncing the practice, so much so that headlines in Ghana screamed that he was not afraid of the shrine priests.  Wisdom wrote a book on the subject, founded FESLIM (Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement), and was instrumental in some of the earliest liberations, but it was his bold public statements reported in the news that pricked the national consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Mark Wisdom granted to the VR staff of Every Child Ministries, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the 1990s===
In the early 1990s, Ghanaian journalist Vincent Azumah found courage to write publicly about the practice and sparked a nationwide debate.  Then the International Federation of Women Laywyers in Ghana (FIDA) organized an investigation into shrine practices and issued a report in 1992.  These events took place while [[Jerry Rawlings]] still held the presidency of Ghana with an iron fist.  Rawlings and his administration were defenders of African Traditional Religion, calling it the "African Heritage" and a cause for national pride.  One example of this was his granting of free air time to the founder of the Afrikania movement, Okomfo Damuah, at a time when Christian churches were virtually denied access to both radio and TV.  Azumah and FIDA's actions were very bold in the light of the political climate of the day.&lt;ref name="Ababio, p. 21"&gt;Ababio, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghana National Commission on Children brought attention to the issue during the celebration of the Organization of African Unity Day of the African Child on June 16, 1993. In 1994 and 1995 Ghanaian lawyer Anita Heymann Ababio researched the practice in the light of Ghanaian law, and recommendations from this research later became a Law Reform Commission report to the Ghana government in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, Ababio A., ''The Impact of the Constitutional Provisions on the Customary Disabilities of Women in Ghana'', Report on the Abolition of Ritual Slavery, Forced Labour and Other Related Practices, Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, University of London, April 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emmanuel Kweku Akeampong, a Ghanaian professor of history at Harvard University, the practice of trokosi was much in the national attention in 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Akeampong, p. 221-226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outlawed in Ghana 1998===
In 1998 the Law Reform Commission, drawing on the recommendations of Ababio and others, drafted a law specifying "ritual or customary servitude" as a crime.  The law passed, requiring a mandatory three-year prison term for those found guilty.&lt;ref name="Ababio, p. 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Criminal Code of Ghana, Act. 1998 Act. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International award 1999===
In 1999 Juliana Dogbadzi, a former trokosi, won the Reebok Human Rights Award for her efforts in speaking up on behalf of her fellow trokosi.&lt;ref&gt;James Aidoo, "Ghana, Liberating the Trokosi" p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NGOs oppose the practice===
Although the practice was outlawed in Ghana in 1998, it continued, due to fear and the reluctance of the government to interfere with traditional practices.  Some NGOs had already worked to liberate shrines, but after the law did not solve the problem, NGOs began to get even more seriously involved in advocating against the practice and in working for agreements to reduce the practice by liberating individual shrines.
Some of the organizations that have joined the effort are UNICEF, International Needs Network Ghana, the Swiss "Sentry Movement", Trokosi Abolition Fellowship, the Anti-Slavery Society, and Every Child Ministries.  Survivors for Change is a group of former trokosi who have banded together to speak up against the practice.  Organizations that have been most active in liberating ritual slaves are FESLIM (Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement), founded by Mark Wisdom, International Needs, and Every Child Ministries.  Christian NGOs and human rights organizations have been fighting it—working to end the practice and to win liberation for the shrine slaves.  They have carried out their activities with strong support from CHRAJ—The Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice—and the Ministry of Women's and Children's Affairs.  A Court of Women was organized in Accra in 2003 to continue the fight against the practice.

==Meaning of "Trokosi" and "Vudusi"==
The word '''''trokosi''''' comes from the [[Ewe language|Ewe]] words "tro", meaning deity or fetish, and "kosi", meaning female slave.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Trokosi Terms, www.trokosi.com&lt;/ref&gt; The "tro" deity is not, according to African traditional religion, the Creator or what might be called the "High" or Ultimate God.  "Tro" refers to what African Traditional Religion calls the "small gods" or "lesser deities"—spirits of nature, etc. which are venerated in traditional religion.  The term '''''trokosi''''' is commonly used in English in Ghana, as a [[loanword]].

===Categories of ''Tro'' adherents===

#Those who join the ''Tro'' of their own volition (extremely rare) and those who were born to women associated with the ''Tro'' and initiated as children (''Trovivo'');
#Those thought to have been born through the intervention of the ''Tro'' (''Dorflevivo'') and thus incur a lifetime obligation of servitude to the tro;
#Those allegedly called by the tro to serve as priest and priestesses of the shrine (''Tronua'');
#Those who were forced to become ''Trokosi'' to repay the ''Tro'' because their family supposedly benefited from it.
#Those ''Trokosi'' who are sent by families, often against the will of the girl involved, out of fear that if they do not do so, further calamities may afflict them through the anger of the shrine deities. This last group consists of those vestal virgins who are sent into servitude at the shrines of the ''Troxovi'' due to crimes allegedly committed by their senior or elder family members, almost always males like fathers, grandfathers, and uncles.  The trokosi is sort of a "living sacrifice," who by her suffering is thought to save the family from trouble.

Opponents of the practice claim that all except those who joined of their own volition are virtually slaves in every normal sense of the word.

NGO's point out that practices in traditional shrines vary, but trokosi are usually denied education, suffer a life of hardship, and are a lonely lot, stigmatized by society.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, Field Findings, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of servitude varies from a few months to life.  In some cases it involves payment of a heavy fine to the shrine, which can require many years of hard labor or even a lifetime of service to pay.  In shrines where the period of servitude is limited, after a ritual and sometimes after months or years in the shrine, the Trokosi returns to her family, but her life is still controlled by the shrine for the rest of her life. Supporters of the practice claim that in the vast majority of cases, there is no particular stigma attached to one's status as a former Trokosi shrine participant. NGOs working to rehabilitate former trokosi say that the social stigma is immense and that it is the most enduring and difficult aspect of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Lorella Rouster, International Director of Every Child Ministries, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main variations in the practice==
Ritual slavery shows a high degree of cohesiveness, but there are many significant differences as it is practiced in various shrines and in various areas.  Every Child Ministries, a Christian NGO that has done much research on the topic, lists these as variations that they have observed in their work:&lt;ref name="Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006"&gt;Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entry age of the participants===
Most frequently those in ritual servitude are young virgin girls at the time of entry into the shrine.  Of course, the girls grow up, so where their servitude is long or lifetime, the participants are of all ages.

===Length of service===
There are two basic lengths of service—perpetual or lifetime service and limited service.  One traditional priest expressed the view that once a crime had been committed, it had to be atoned for until the end of time.  This is the view of lifetime or perpetual service.  Shrine slaves serving for a lifetime have no hope of ever getting free unless outsiders intervene on their behalf.  In some shrines, in some areas, and for some alleged crimes, the service is limited to a specific number of years.  In other cases, a substantial fee is exacted from the shrine slave or her family.  The girls work to try to earn that fee, but in reality the fee is so high and their means of paying it so low that there is virtually no hope of ever paying off the debt that has been laid on them.
Some shrines have taken so many slaves that they cannot contain them all.  Some slaves become unattractive or unuseful to the priest.  In these cases trokosia may be given what is called "temporary" release.  This is actually a misnomer, since it is a permanent condition.  The temporary part only gives the slave permission to live outside the shrine temporarily.  All the important decisions of her life are still controlled by the shrine, she is still at the beck and call of the priest, and she has to serve at the annual festival of the god every year, for which she is required to bring gifts that may take her all year to accumulate.
One child of a trokosi on "temporary release" said, "whenever my mother goes fishing or does any work, she must divide it into three, with two parts going to the priest."&lt;ref&gt;"Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery", p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practice of replacement===
Where perpetual or lifetime servitude is practiced, the shrines often, but not always, practice what they call "replacement."  when a trokosi or vudusi dies or runs away, she has to be replaced by another virgin from the same family or clan.  Some human rights interviewers report that they have interviewed numerous girls who were the third or fourth replacements for their families for a crime that was allegedly committed long ago.&lt;ref name="Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006"/&gt;

===Practice of rape by the priest and elders of the shrine===
In most shrines it is considered a duty of the shrine slaves to have obligatory sex with the priest and sometimes the elders.  The priest's genital organs have been dedicated to the gods of the shrine, so having sex with him is considered a sacred act - in a sense, copulating with the gods.  This is the origin and meaning of the term "wives of the gods."  Many trokosi and vudusi have described beatings and other severe punishments imposed on them for refusing sex with the priest.  In Ghana, human rights organizations monitoring the practice of "trokosi" claim that shrine slaves often end up with an average of four children while in servitude, many of them by the priest or elders of the shrines.  Proponents of ritual servitude deny that this is a part of the practice.  There seem to be wide differences between practices in different districts, but Rouster claims that the problem of forced sex in many of the shrines is too well documented to be disputed.&lt;ref name="Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006"/&gt;
Stephen Awudi Gadri, founder of Trokosi Abolition Fellowship, speaks of "ritual violation after menarche" (first menses) as the beginning of a life of coerced sex.&lt;ref&gt;"The Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery", p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to the trokosi as "vestal virgins." &lt;ref&gt;Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of shrine slaves===
Treatment of girls in the shrine varies as to feeding practices, reasons for and severity of punishments, sleeping and living conditions.  Severe and widespread problems have been documented in all these areas by human rights organizations.  Many of the shrine slaves are required to do heavy physical labor like cultivating fields with a hand hoe.  Other common duties are weaving mats, making and selling firewood (with all profits going to the priest or the shrine), fetching wood and water, sweeping the compound and attending the images of the gods.

==Liberation of shrine slaves==
[[NGO]]'s and other [[human rights]] organizations are fighting the practice.  Since the 1990s, these groups have actively sought to liberate girls held in ritual servitude.  Liberation has been done on a shrine-by-shrine basis, with NGO's seeking to reach community-wide agreements that all the slaves of a particular shrine will be liberated and the practice of slavery or ritual servitude will be permanently ended in that place.  When such an agreement is reached, a public ceremony is held for the signing of the documents and often, liberation certificates for the former slaves.  The shrine is compensated for its loss and the former trokosi begin a process of rehabilitation which usually includes learning vocational skills.

The most active groups in liberating shrine slaves through negotiated community agreements have been FESLIM, Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement, International Needs Network, and Every Child Ministries.

The first liberation ceremonies were held at Lomo and Me shrines in Volo in October 1996, at three shrines in Dorfor in December 1996, and at Atigo shrine in Battor in January 1997.[54] International Needs Network liberated 400 trokosi from a group of small shrines in November 2000, and 126 at Adidome in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Nirit Ben-Ari, "Liberating Girls from Trokosi" from Africa Recovery, Vol 15, #4, Dec. 2001, p. 26.
&lt;/ref&gt; Every Child Ministries cooperated with International Needs Network to liberate 465 trokosi from three shrines of the Agave area in January 2003 and with Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement to liberate 94 shrine slaves from Aklidokpo shrine near Adidome in January 2004.  They continued the effort, liberating 120 from Sovigbenor shrine in Aflao in December 2005, and 52 "yevesi" or servants of the thunder god from the Kadza Yevesi Shrine at Aflao in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"African Jewels",a 2nd Quarter 2010, Every Child Ministries&lt;/ref&gt; Shrines of the Anlo clan in Ghana also hold trokosi, but have resisted liberation and defended the practice, defending their practice of trokosi as being more humane than the practices of other districts. Human rights organizations insist that the practice must be totally eradicated.

'''Samuel "Sam" Cawthorn''' (born 15 December 1979) is an Australian [[motivational speaker]], success coach, self-help author and [[entrepreneur]].  Cawthorn is best known as the 2009 [[Young Australian of the Year]] for Tasmania and his work as a motivational speaker.&lt;ref name="aoty"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/media/?view=news&amp;id=555 | work=Australian of the Year Awards website| date=26 November 2008 | accessdate=17 November 2010 | title=Tasmania's Australian of the Year award recipients announced}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Cawthorn was born in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]] to an Indian mother,Annie (Kharagpur, West Bengal) and Scottish father,Peter, in a family of 11 children.  While still a young child his family relocated to rural [[Tasmania]] where he grew up on country farm outside of [[Hobart]].  He now resides in [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]], [[Sydney]] with his wife Kate Cawthorn and their three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.bemotivated.com.au/speakers.html | work=Be Motivated website| date= | accessdate=17 November 2010 | title=About Sam Cawthorn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
After completing Matriculation College, Cawthorn worked in sales  at good ol’ Pizza Hut 😍😍 before discovering a passion for helping people.  This inspired him to work as a trainer in Northern Tasmania and lead to his promotion as a training manager.   He later established himself as a Regional Industry Careers Adviser and assisted local industry to identify skill shortages and provide solutions for youth entering the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.bemotivated.com.au/speakers.html | work=Be Motivated website| date= | accessdate=17 November 2010 | title=Sam Before Losing His Arm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cawthorn was also involved in numerous musical theatre productions and established his own music and dance studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= | publisher=The Examiner Newspaper| location=Tasmania | date=15 December 2005 | accessdate= | title=Singers are tuned up for Gigantic Carols Evening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Near Fatal Car Accident ===
In October 2006, Cawthorn was involved in a head-on collision with a semi-trailer, he was travelling at a speed of 210 km/h and needed to be resuscitated.  He faced severe injuries including the [[amputation]] of his right arm above the elbow and severe damage to his right leg.  Initially distraught by the prospect he may never walk again he maintained a strong mental attitude and conceptualized "Be Motivated" during his nine months of [[physical therapy|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= | publisher=The Examiner Newspaper| location=Tasmania |  first1=Danielle| last1=Blewett| year=2006 | accessdate= | title=Alive and planning for a miracle future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Be Motivated and Motivational Speaking ===
In 2007 Cawthorn established Be Motivated, a program aimed at providing young people with skills to improve their confidence and self-belief in order to attain personal goals while remaining positive when faced with adversity.   To deliver this information he regularly conducts motivational assemblies at schools in Australia and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.youngentrepreneurs.net.au/sam-cawthorn-be-motivated.html | publisher=Young Entrepreneurs Network| location= |  first1= | last1= | date= 30 January 2009 | accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Sam Cawthorn – Be Motivated}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2009/03/26/2527147.htm | publisher=Conversations with Richard Fidler | location=Brisbane |  first1=Richard | last1=Fidler| date=26 March 2009 | accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Sam Cawthorn – ABC Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teachings ==
A large part of Cawthorn’s teachings focus on challenging people to discover a purpose and develop goals.  He strongly emphasises the importance of a healthy mental attitude and not allowing excuses to hinder achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.errachidia.biz/clip/video-above elbow amputation-1-dd1WgrkbQuE.html | publisher=Errachidia.org | location= |  first1= | last1= | date=| accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Sam Cawthorn BOUNCE!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cawthorn also advocates "bouncing forward" after a crisis and not being discouraged by challenges and setbacks which may arise. According to his philosophy, a "Plan B" is unnecessary. He encourages audiences to create environments which leverage collective thinking in order to reach challenging decisions that enable recovery from difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.samcawthorn.com/about/the-speaker/ | publisher=SamCawthorn.com | location= |  first1= | last1= | date=| accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Thought Leader Topics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.o2speakers.com/speakers/sam-cawthorn.html#twoj_fragment1-2 | publisher=o2 Speakers | location= |  first1= | last1= | date=| accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Sam Cawthorn - Bounce Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:sam cawthorn encounter former prime minster kevin rudd.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Sam Cawthorn meets Kevin Rudd|Sam Cawthorn meets former Australian prime minister ''[[Kevin Rudd]]''.]] --&gt;
In November 2008 Sam Cawthorn was awarded the 2009 Young Australian Year Award for Tasmania.&lt;ref name="aoty" /&gt;

=== Encounter with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd===
Before gathering at The Lodge with fellow Australian of the Year finalists, Cawthorn accepted a dare from his young daughter to play a practical joke upon then [[Australian Prime Minister]], [[Kevin Rudd]].  As the two shook hands, Cawthorn detached his artificial hand from its [[prosthetic]] arm leaving a surprised but highly amused Rudd holding the artificial hand.   The former prime minister later told the reception honouring the finalists he had not recovered from shock and was still "in therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= | publisher=The Daily Telegraph| location=Sydney| date=24 January 2009 | accessdate= |  first1=Alison | last1=Rehn | title=Armless prank stumps Kevin Rudd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cawthorn Foundation ==
In 2009 the Cawthorn Foundation was established to assist disadvantaged youth in [[Developing country|developing countries]] to enjoy basic [[human rights]]. The foundation partners with like-minded organisations to create awareness in businesses and schools across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cawthornfoundation.org/?page_id=2 | publisher=CawthornFoundation.org | location= |  first1= | last1= | date=| accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=About}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2009 Cawthorn travelled to India and held a series of motivational seminars for students and the [[Indian army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cawthornfoundation.org/?page_id=85 | publisher=CawthornFoundation.org | location= |  first1= | last1= | date=| accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Sonnamucki School Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Create2Change ===
In mid-2009 [[Christian Blind Mission|CBM Australia]] approached Cawthorn to become ambassador for their human rights advocacy movement which creates awareness for people living with disabilities in developing nations.  Under a campaign titled ‘Create2Change’ Cawthorn travelled around India with a film crew to find stories of individuals living with a disability in the most poverty stricken communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cawthornfoundation.org/?p=1 | publisher=CawthornFoundation.org | location= |  first1= | last1= | date=| accessdate=18 November 2010 | title=Create2Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''springboard theory''' or '''springboard perspective''' is an international [[Business Strategy|business theory]] that elucidates the unique motives, processes and behaviors of international expansion of [[Emerging markets|emerging market]] [[Multinational corporation|multinational enterprises]] (EM MNEs). Springboard theory was developed by [[Yadong Luo|Luo]] and Tung (2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luo|first1=Y.|last2=Tung|first2=R. L.|title=International expansion of emerging market enterprises: A springboard perspective|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=2007|volume=38|issue=4|pages=481–498}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been used to examine EM MNEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Beulea|first1=F.|last2=Eliab|first2=S.|last3=Piscitellob|first3=L.|title=Entry and access to competencies abroad: Emerging market firms versus advanced market firms|journal=Journal of International Management|date=2014|volume=20|issue=2|pages=137–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kotharia|first1=T.|last2=Kotabeb|first2=M.|last3=Murphy|first3=P.|title=Rules of the game for emerging market multinational companies from China and India|journal=Journal of International Management|date=2013|volume=19|issue=3|pages=276–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramamurti|first1=R.|title=What is really different about emerging market multinationals?|journal=Global Strategy Journal|date=2012|volume=2|issue=1|pages=41–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=V.|last2=Li|first2=J.|last3=Shapiro|first3=D.|title=International reverse spillover effects on parent firms: Evidences from emerging-market MNEs in developed markets|journal=European Management Journal|date=2012|volume=30|issue=3|pages=204–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jormanainen|first1=I.|last2=Koveshnikov|first2=A.|title=International activities of emerging market firms|journal=Management International Review|date=2012|volume=52|issue=5|pages=691–725}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yaprak|first1=A.|last2=Karademir|first2=B.|title=The internationalization of emerging market business groups: An integrated literature review|journal=International Business Review|date=2010|volume=27|issue=2|pages=245–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaur|first1=A.|last2=Kumar|first2=V.|title=Internationalization of emerging market firms: A Case for theoretical extension|journal=Advances in International Management: The past, present and future of international business and management|date=2010|volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gubbi|first1=S.|last2=Aulakh|first2=P.|last3=Ray|first3=S.|last4=Sarkar|first4=M. B.|last5=Chittoor|first5=R.|title=Do international acquisitions by emerging-economy firms create shareholder value? The case of Indian firms|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=397–418}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of this theory is the argument that EM MNEs systematically and recursively use international expansion as a [[springboard]] to acquire critical resources needed to compete more effectively against their global rivals at home and abroad and to reduce their vulnerability to institutional and market constraints at home. These efforts are systematic in the sense that “springboard” steps are deliberately designed as a grand plan to facilitate firm growth and as a long-range strategy to establish more solidly their competitive positions in the global marketplace. They are also recursive because such “springboard” activities are recurrent and revolving (i.e., outward activities are strongly integrated with activities back home).

==Unique motives==

According to Luo and Tung (2007), EM MNEs use international expansion as a springboard to (1) compensate for their [[Competitive advantage|competitive disadvantages]], (2) overcome their [[First-mover advantage|latecomer disadvantage]], (3) counter-attack global competitors’ major foothold in their home country market, (4) bypass stringent [[Trade barrier|trade barriers]] into [[Developed market|advanced markets]], (5) alleviate domestic institutional and market constraints, (6) secure preferential treatments from home governments, and (7) exploit [[competitive advantage]] in other emerging and developing countries. In so doing, EM MNEs overcome their latecomer disadvantage in global competition via a series of aggressive, radical, risk-taking [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) measures by proactively acquiring or buying critical assets from mature, often Western-based MNEs to compensate for their competitive weaknesses. EM MNEs are both asset seeking (especially critical capabilities they need, such as global brands, key technologies, global talents and international channels) and opportunity seeking (especially leveraging their mass and cost-efficient production capabilities to tap other developing countries and low- to mid-end markets in developed countries).

Thus, unlike Western MNEs who are generally motivated to go global to exploit their ownership-specific capabilities they have already possessed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckley|first1=P. J.|last2=Hashai|first2=N.|title=Formalizing internationalization in the eclectic paradigm|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=2009|volume=40|issue=1|pages=58–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunning|first1=J. H.|title=The eclectic paradigm of international production: A restatement and some possible extensions|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=1988|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; EM MNEs go global to acquire strategic capabilities they do not have but critically needed to upgrade their capability portfolio in search for competitiveness in global competition. In contrast to newly industrialized economy MNEs (e.g., those from [[List of companies of South Korea|South Korea]], [[List of companies of Singapore|Singapore]], [[List of companies of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[List of companies of Taiwan|Taiwan]]) whose international expansion has been largely triggered by “push” factors such as appreciating currencies, rising labor costs and shortages, escalating operating costs, and smaller home markets, EM MNEs’ global expansion has been driven mainly by “pull” factors such as securing critical capabilities and resources, circumventing host country trade barriers, upgrading home-market capabilities, and seeking international reputation.

==Strategic behaviors==

EM MNEs uniquely use their inward FDI experience and networks (e.g., original equipment manufacturing, international joint ventures) at home before aggressively undertaking outward FDI. Through inward internationalization, EM MNEs have accumulated some experience and absorptive capabilities dealing with international competition, deepening their understanding of international markets before conducting outbound FDI.

More evidently, there are several leapfrog trajectories to mirror EM MNEs’ springboard behaviors. First, they tend to internationalize very rapidly and not in an incremental fashion as predicted by conventional internationalization process theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johanson|first1=J.|last2=Vahlne|first2=J. E.|title=The internationalization process of the firm: A model of knowledge development and increasing foreign market commitment|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=1977|volume=8|pages=23–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; As global latecomers, EM MNEs accelerate their pace of internationalization so as to catch up with that of incumbents. Large EM MNEs rapidly expand internationally through high-risk, high-control entry modes such as big acquisitions and greenfield investments. Second, EM MNEs tend to be radical in their choice of location (country), showing a pattern of path departure from cultural, institutional, economic and geographical distances. Very often, they first venture into advanced markets. Third, EM MNEs’ initial commitment tends to be large and does not necessarily involve many small steps. Also, departing from the conventional wisdom of control, EM MNEs tend to use localized senior management team, rather than parent country nationals.

==Facilitating forces==

Luo and Tung (2007) also explained some internal and external conditions that foster EM MNEs to springboard. Springboard behaviors of EM MNEs are promoted by (1) home government support for going global, (2) willingness of global players to share or sell strategic resources and offshore availability of standardized technology, (3) corporate entrepreneurship and strong motivation to enter key foreign markets, (4) increasing competitive pressure from global rivals, and (5) quick changes in technological and market landscapes and a heightened borderless world economy.

==Challenges==

The springboard theory cautions that despite opportunities and expected gains for springboard behavior, EM MNEs also encounter some huge challenges associated with such behavior. First, due to underdeveloped [[Stock market|stock markets]] at home, poor accountability, and lack of transparency stemming from their ties with their host government, corporate governance of EM MNEs is generally weak. These limitations, in turn, tarnish their organizational reputation and hinder confidence of global stakeholders. Second, they face enormous post-springboard, post-acquisition difficulties. These can range from building effective working relationships with host country stakeholders, reconciling disparate national- and corporate-level cultures, organizing globally dispersed complex activities, to integrating home and host country operations. Third, lack of global experience, managerial competence and professional expertise have posed critical bottlenecks for many EM MNEs. Finally, weaker innovation can continue to handicap EM MNEs’ success in global competition.

'''TÜV NORD GROUP''' is a technical service provider with worldwide activities. Founded in 1869 and headquartered in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]], the Group employs more than 10,000 people in more than 70 countries of Europe, Asia, America and Africa. The Group is divided into the following operative brands and business units:

* TÜV NORD: Industrial Services, Mobility, Training, IT 
* DMT: Natural Resources
* ALTER TECHNOLOGY: Aerospace

TÜVs (German abbreviation: [[Technischer Überwachungsverein]], English: Technical Inspection Association) are German organizations that work to validate the safety of products and services of all kinds to protect humans, material assets and the environment against hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of the Association of TÜVs - VdTÜV|url=http://www.vdtuev.de/vdtuev/mitglieder|publisher=VdTÜV-Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524082823/http://www.vdtuev.de/vdtuev/mitglieder|archivedate=2012-05-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The story of TÜV NORD GROUP has its roots in the traditional boiler inspection associations founded by the industry, which in 1869 voluntarily undertook to begin monitoring and ensuring the operational safety of boilers. Gradually, the government gave the DÜV, later known as the TÜV (Technical Inspection Association) additional safety-related tasks, such as the regular inspection of automobiles, still a watchword for road safety in Germany today.
