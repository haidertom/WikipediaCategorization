'''''A Dance to the Music of Time''''' is a painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]] in the [[Wallace Collection]] in London. It was painted between about 1634 and 1636 as a commission for Giulio Rospigliosi (later [[Pope Clement IX]]), who according to [[Gian Pietro Bellori]] dictated its detailed iconography.  The identity of the figures remains uncertain, with differing accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace.  The date is purely based on style, and Ingamells, 310 thought "1639-40 or perhaps slightly earlier".&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is well known for giving its name to the ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time]]'' novel cycle, though this title is first seen in a Wallace Collection catalogue of 1913. Before that it was given titles referring to the [[Season#Traditional season divisions|Four Seasons]]. In the 1845 sale it was called ''La Danse des Saisons, ou l'Image de la vie humaine''.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 311&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Four figures, holding each other by the hand, dance in a circle, as Time plays a [[lyre]] on the right.  The scene is set in the early morning, with [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], goddess of dawn, preceding the chariot of [[Apollo]] the sun-god in the sky behind; the Hours accompany him and he holds a ring representing the [[Zodiac]].  According to [[Giovanni Pietro Bellori|Bellori]], the subject was devised by Rospigliosi.  The four dancers represented, beginning with the one at the back seen mostly from behind: Poverty, Labour, Riches, and Pleasure or Luxury. These represent a progression in human life, completed by Pleasure or Luxury leading to Poverty again.  As the Four Seasons Poverty would be Autumn, Labour Winter, and so on. The suggestion of [[Anthony Blunt]] that, unusually for a group of the seasons, Autumn/Poverty at the rear of the group was male is now generally accepted, and the museum now describe him as [[Bacchus]].  This follows the story invented by [[Boitet de Frauville]] in his ''Les Dionysiaques'' that, responding to complaints from the Seasons and Time, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] gave the world Bacchus and his wine in order to compensate for the miserable living conditions mortals must endure.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 309-310; Wallace&lt;/ref&gt;  [[André Félibien]], the friend and biographer of Poussin, explained the picture in the same terms, except that where Bellori identified Summer with Luxury, Félibien said that it represented Pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 309-310&lt;/ref&gt; 

These identifications are disputed by Malcolm Bull, at least as the original intention.  He traces the [[iconography]] of the painting to the Late Greek poet [[Nonnus]], reflected in the ''Hymne de l'Automme'' of [[Pierre de Ronsard]]. Nonnus' descriptions of the four seasons, as translated into French, are closely followed by Poussin: "on the left is Spring, with a garland of roses in her hair; at the back is Autumn, whose hair has been cropped by the winds but whose brow is wreathed with olive branches; Winter is next, with her bound hair and shadowed face, and at the front is Summer, dressed in white with ears of corn in the braids of her hair."&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 258&lt;/ref&gt;  Bacchus himself appears, in his double aspect as a young and old figure, in the [[herma]] at left.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 258-259&lt;/ref&gt;  Bull suggests that Rospigliosi, an intellectual and author with a taste for [[allegory]], invented the other interpretation "during or after its completion",&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 260&lt;/ref&gt; while Ingamells feels that "Poussin was not unduly concerned with the precise identification of the figures".&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 310&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are several [[pentimenti]], including the removal of a second, larger, tree on the right between Winter/Labour and Time.  The painting is in generally good condition, but has been retouched in places, including over the repair of a large L-shaped tear running right through the central group.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 307-309&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthony Powell==
At the start of [[Anthony Powell]]'s [[A Dance to the Music of Time|series of novels]] named after the painting, the narrator, Nicolas Jenkins, reflects on it in the first two pages of ''[[A Question of Upbringing]]'':

:''These classical projections, and something from the fire, suddenly suggested Poussin's scene in which the Seasons, hand in hand and facing outward, tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard plays. The image of Time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outward like the Seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure, stepping slowly, methodically sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognisable shape: or breaking into seemingly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again, once more giving pattern to the spectacle: unable to control the melody, unable, perhaps, to control the steps of the dance.''

==Provenance==
It passed from the Rospigliosi family to the [[Joseph Fesch|Joseph Fesch collection]] in 1806, when it was taken to France for a period. It was then bought, along with several other paintings, by [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford]], in the great Fesch sale in Rome in 1845. It then passed to his son, [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Wallace]].  It was exhibited in the [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 311&lt;/ref&gt;

The film explores the [[Executive Order 9981|racial integration]] of the American military, centering on the [[African-American]] sergeant's struggle to win the trust and respect of the men in his unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939200,00.html |title=Cinema: The New Pictures, Aug. 29, 1960 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
When a lieutenant is mortally wounded in a winter ambush that decimates his platoon, he passes command to the highest ranking survivor, Sergeant Towler ([[Sidney Poitier]]). However, with the exception of African-American Towler, all of the men left alive are white. Towler feels Private Kincaid ([[Alan Ladd]]), an ex-sergeant with eleven years experience (demoted for doing things his way), is better suited for command, but the lieutenant orders him to take charge and complete their vital mission: to take and hold a farmhouse strategically positioned in a mountain pass for the advance of their [[battalion]]. After the lieutenant dies, [[White Southerners|Southerner]] Private Bracken ([[Paul Richards (actor)|Paul Richards]]) initially refuses to take orders from Towler, but Towler forces him, at gunpoint, to back down. 

With their radio not working, Towler leads ten healthy survivors and a badly wounded Private Casey on a stretcher to their objective. As they warily approach the farmhouse, one soldier spots someone inside and throws a grenade, which wounds a Korean woman. The only other occupants are her young son and her adult, part-French daughter Maya. Kincaid and some of the others want to leave before the enemy attacks, but Towler keeps them there.

They repel an attack later that night. Hunter, a [[Navajo]], volunteers to scout the area in place of Towler. They agree on a password. Hunter is captured, but despite being hit repeatedly, refuses to say the password when he is forced toward the outpost manned by Towler and Kincaid. After his challenges are not answered, Towler fires, striking Hunter and some enemy soldiers. After the enemy is repelled, Hunter gives the password. Towler and Kincaid find him; he talks to Towler before dying.

Bracken tries to force himself on Maya. Her scream brings Towler, but Bracken ignores Towler's order to leave and strikes him. Towler knocks him down, but Bracken remains defiant.

Lazitech, manning the outpost, is the next casualty. At his own request, Casey is carried to a gunport to fight; he dies in the next assault. Towler and Kincaid start brawling when Towler catches Kincaid slacking off afterward, but they break off when they hear a tank approaching. After driving off the accompanying infantrymen with a machine gun, Towler and Kinkaid use kerosene and torches to set the tank on fire. When a tank man opens the hatch, Kinkaid tosses in a grenade. The tank runs over his leg when he jumps off; Corpsman Wade has to amputate it, but the only man who has the right type blood for a transfusion is Towler. The operation is a success, despite Wade's lack of training.

When a column of tanks is spotted, Towler sends his men and the civilians up the pass, while he goes back and carries Kinkaid to the outpost. Fortunately, friendly aircraft appear and bombard the enemy infantry as they advance, signalling the approach of the battalion.

==Production==
[[Hall Bartlett]] designed a film as a vehicle for [[Sidney Poitier]], based on the integration of the military in the [[Korean War]]. Bartlett came up with the original story with Gene Coon and wrote the script himself. He  aimed to make the film independently, though the exact start date was going to be dependent on Poitier's success in ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pryor|first1=Thomas M.|title=Poitier Will Play Marine in Movie — Signs to Star in 'All the Young Men' — Replacement Sought for Lana Turner|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/10/18/91424647.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=436|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=March 4, 1959|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Columbia Pictures]] agreed to finance on the proviso that Bartlett rewrite the script for a white co-star.  Bartlett found the only major star willing to do the movie was [[Alan Ladd]] who co-produced the film.&lt;ref name="Aram"&gt;pp.180-181 Goudsouzian, Aram '' Sidney Poitier: Man, Actor and Icon'' 2004 UNC Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ladd, Poitier to Co-Star in War Movie Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963) [Chicago, Ill] 06 May 1959: b3.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartlett:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I could have done it [the film] on a shoestring in some canyon in the Hollywood Hills, but I felt that now is the time for me to prove myself with a picture in the million-plus category. I realized that I could not stay in my ivory tower forever, making nice, small, critically praised films. You don't go very far here if you're not successful when the right time comes.&lt;ref name="hal"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The film features an unusual cast who works well together. In addition to Ladd and Poitier, the cast includes comedian Mort Sahl, who does a comedy routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schumach|first1=Murray|title=U.S. Legionnaires to Hear Red Issue — California Unit Will Take Resolution Criticizing Film Industry to Convention|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/07/07/89219847.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=36|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=July 7, 1959|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Darren]] who sings the title song (he was meant to sing three songs in all&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ole in Warm Film to James Darren — Actor Will Join the Cast of 'All the Young Men' — 'Powder Keg' Planned|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/06/19/80586050.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=28|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=June 19, 1959|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and boxer [[Ingemar Johansson]] in his American film debut. Bartlett cast his Argentine wife Ana María Lynch/Ana St. Clair as a French Korean,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Writer Liberated Schulberg Claims: Creator Now Follows Through; Bartlett Imports 'Only Girl' |author=Philip K.

"I just play myself," said Johansson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Johansson Weeps in Film on Korea — Heavyweight Champion Will Mourn Death of a Buddy in 'All the Young Men'|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/10/12/80556372.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=14|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=October 12, 1959|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''All the Young Men'' was filmed in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in Montana and [[Mount Hood]], Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.communitywalk.com/location/glacier_park_all/movies/1189617&lt;/ref&gt; Poitier's commitment to make the film meant he had to leave the run of ''A Raisin in the Sun'' early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zolotow|first1=Sam|title=Play is Canceled by Michael Ellis — Tryout of 'Intermission' by Ned Armstrong Dropped — Author Brings Charges|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/07/28/80540613.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=24|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=July 28, 1959|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia planned two separate advertising campaigns for the film to white and black audiences.&lt;ref&gt; ''Shared Pleasures: A History of Movie Presentation in the United States'', Gormery, Douglas, University of Wisconsin Press, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia also used [[Quentin Reynolds]] to promote the film in advertising campaigns.  A [[paperback]] novelisation of the film was written by [[Marvin Albert]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysteryfile.com/GM_Albert/goldmedal_albert.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marine Corps provided [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Clement J. Stadler, who had been awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/02_awards/index_nx/index-NXs.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[World War II]] as a [[technical advisor]]; a function he also performed in ''[[Hell to Eternity]]'', ''The Outsider'', ''[[Ambush Bay]]'' and ''[[The Lieutenant]]'' television series. The [[United States Marine Corps]] had disbanded separate black Marine units and bases since 18 November 1949.&lt;ref&gt; ''African-Americans at War:An Encyclopedia'', Sutherland, Jonathan, 2004 ABC-CLIO, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Bosley Crowther]], critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote, "Racial integration in the United States Marines is sluggishly celebrated in a variation on a well-used Western plot in the picture that opened at the Forum yesterday."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/08/27/archives/screen-korean-episode-bias-under-fire-seen-in-all-the-young-men.html |title=Screen: Korean Episode; Bias Under Fire Seen in 'All the Young Men' |author=Bosley Crowther |date=August 27, 1960 |newspaper=The New York Times |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8919">'''Art competitions''' were held as part of the '''[[1948 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[London]], [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]].  Medals were awarded in five categories ([[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]]), for works inspired by sport-related themes.

The art exhibition was held at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] from 15 July to 14 August, and displayed works of art from 27 different countries.  The literature competition attracted 44 entries, and the music competition had 36 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Official Report of the Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad |author=(ed.)

The art competitions included multiple subcategories for each of the five artistic categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympic Art Competition 1948 London |work=Olympic Games Museum |author=Wagner, Juergen |url=http://olympic-museum.de/art/1948.htm |accessdate=2008-03-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080216203615/http://www.olympic-museum.de/art/1948.htm| archivedate= 16 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judges declined to award any medals for dramatic works in literature, and no gold medals in another five subcategories.  [[Alex Diggelmann]] of [[Switzerland]] won both a silver medal and a bronze medal for two different entries in the applied arts and crafts subcategory, a feat unlikely to be duplicated in any event in the [[Olympic sports|current Olympic program]].

These were the last Games in which art competitions were held, after being in the official program for all Games since 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=In Search of the Lost Champions of the Olympic Art Contests |last=Kramer |first=Bernhard |journal=Journal of Olympic History |volume=12 |issue=2 |date=May 2004 |pages=29–34 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv12n2/johv12n2m.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080410082301/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv12n2/johv12n2m.pdf| archivedate= 10 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At a meeting of the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1949 it was decided to hold art ''exhibitions'' instead, as it was judged illogical to permit professionals to compete in the art competitions while only amateurs were permitted to compete in sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report on Art Exhibitions |last=Bolanaki |first=A. |journal=Bulletin du Comité International Olympique |issue=27 |date=June 1951 |page=34 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |location=Lausanne |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1951/BDCE27/BDCE27l.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080410082302/http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1951/BDCE27/BDCE27l.pdf| archivedate= 10 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1952 a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

'''Australia ICOMOS''' is the peak cultural heritage conservation body in Australia. It is a branch of the United Nations-sponsored [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] (ICOMOS), a non-government professional organisation promoting expertise in the conservation of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=PlanAust&gt;Susan Thompson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cE37xlhiF1cC ''Planning Australia: An Overview of Urban and Regional Planning''] (Cambridge University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Its secretariat is based at the [[Cultural Heritage Centre for Asia and the Pacific]] at [[Deakin University]].

==Formation and role==

Australia ICOMOS was formed in 1976 and is one of over 100 current ICOMOS national committees. ICOMOS was formed in 1965 to advise [[UNESCO]] in the assessment of sites proposed for the [[World Heritage List]]. Membership of Australia ICOMOS comprises over 650 members, managed by an Executive Committee of 15 people who are elected from the membership. Several Australia ICOMOS members are also represented on various ICOMOS [[International Council on Monuments and Sites#International committees|International Scientific Committees]], and expert committees and boards in Australia.&lt;ref name=AI&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/about-us/australia-icomos/mission-statement/ Australia ICOMOS Website]&lt;/ref&gt; It plays an important role in co-ordinating advocacy activities to raise the profile of Australia's cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.au/Assets/1176/1/AustralianHeritagePartnership-3August20111.pdf National Trust Australia, Media Release 3 August 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618020304/http://www.nationaltrust.org.au/Assets/1176/1/AustralianHeritagePartnership-3August20111.pdf |date=18 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting which led to the formation of Australia ICOMOS was in Melbourne on 20 October 1976, and the first ICOMOS conference was in Beechworth in 1978, where they devised a committee to work up a local version of the [[Venice Charter]]. The actual ICOMOS meeting where the committee's draft was provisionally endorsed was in the town of [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=PlanAust/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/publications/charters/ Australia ICOMOS &gt; The Burra Charter] Full text of the 1999 revised version of the Burra Charter. Retrieved 16 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; Australia ICOMOS played the pivotal role in developing and [[Burra Charter]], regarded as the best-practice standard for cultural heritage management in Australia, which has influenced subsequent heritage legislation and conservation guidelines and practices in Australia.&lt;ref name=PlanAust/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marta De la Torre, Getty Conservation Institute, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pj24e6iE7DoC ''Heritage Values in Site Management: Four Case Studies''] (Getty Publications, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia ICOMOS has also been responsible for producing the Australia [[State of the Environment]] Report (SoE), to advise the Minister for Environment on ''...the current condition of the Australian environment, the pressures on it and the drivers of those pressures.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2011/report/heritage/pubs/soe2011-supplementary-heritage-icomos-workshop-notes.pdf Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Australia ICOMOS State of the environment 2011 workshop, summary notes DECEMBER 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022175529/http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2011/report/heritage/pubs/soe2011-supplementary-heritage-icomos-workshop-notes.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia ICOMOS also organises an annual national conference on themes relevant to conservation and heritage in Australia and South East Asia, often on a specific heritage and conservation theme for example on the Australian Capital city's 100th anniversary in 2012.&lt;ref name="canberra100.com.au"&gt;[http://www.canberra100.com.au/calendar/view/1942/icomos-national-conference-imagined-pasts-imagined-future/ ICOMOS National Conference, 'Imagined Pasts, Imagined Futures']&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent collaboration between the Chinese government, the Getty Conservation Institute and Australia ICOMOS has seen the export of Australian conservation expertise in developing '''China Principles''', ''...the Middle Kingdom's statement of conservation philosophy and method that is based on Australia's highly regarded Burra Charter''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/selling-heritage-to-china/story-e6frg8n6-1226067465487#sthash.HZJLffKT.dpuf Robert Bevan, 'Selling heritage to China' ''The Australian'' June 02, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Australia ICOMOS and the Burra Charter have also been held up as a world standard in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20051218/opinion/conserving-local-heritage-through-heritage-management.68715 Samantha Fabry' Conserving local heritage through heritage management ''Times of Malta'' December 18, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2405">A '''bible''' (also known as a '''story bible''', '''show bible''', '''series bible''', or '''pitch bible'''){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} is a [[reference document]] used by [[screenwriter]]s for information on a television series' characters, settings, and other elements.

==Types==
Show bibles are updated with information on the characters after the information has been established on screen.&lt;ref name="Jane"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Espenson |first1=Jane |title=How to Give Maris Hives, Alphabetized |url=http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000550.php |website=JaneEspeson.com |accessdate=2013-10-26 |date=2007-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''[[Frasier]]'' show bible was "scrupulously maintained", and anything established on air — "the name of [[Frasier Crane|Frasier's]] mother, [[Niles Crane|Niles']] favorite professor, [[Martin Crane|Martin's]] favorite bar...even a list of [[Maris Crane|Maris]]' [dozens of] food allergies" — was reflected in the bible.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt; The updated bible then serves as a resource for writers to keep everything within the series consistent.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt; 

Other show bibles are used as sales documents to help a [[television network]] or [[television studio|studio]] understand a series, and are sometimes given to new writers when they join the writing staff for the same reason.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt; These types of bibles discuss the backstories of the main characters and the history of the series' fictional universe.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt;

Television series often rely on writers' assistants and [[script coordinator]]s to serve as "walking bibles" in remembering details about a series.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt;

==Writers Guild of America==
In the United States, writing the show bible of a produced series earns that writer the 24 units of required credit necessary to qualify for membership in the [[Writers Guild of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Become a Member |url=http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=84 |website=Writers Guild of America West |accessdate=2013-10-26 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{United Kingdom in the European Union}}
'''''Brexit: The Movie''''' is a 2016 British [[documentary film]] written and directed by [[Martin Durkin (television director)|Martin Durkin]], advocating for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the [[European Union]], commonly called ''[[Brexit]]'' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''British'' and ''exit''). The film's production was funded through crowdfunding via Kickstarter as well as £50,000 from the hedge fund Spitfire Capital. 

It premiered in London on 11 May 2016, before being released the following day on YouTube and Vimeo.

== Reception ==
''Brexit: The Movie'' received over 1.5 million views on ''YouTube'' by 23 June 2016 (the date of the referendum).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The film's reviews upon release included both praise and [[Film criticism|criticism]].

Paul Baldwin writing for ''[[Daily Express|The Daily Express]]'', a pro Brexit newspaper, called it a "powerful" exposure of the lack of accountability within the European Union.&lt;ref name="Express"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/669367/Brexit-The-Movie-reveals-terrifying-TRUTH-about-anti-democratic-EU|title=Watch: Brexit movie reveals how smug Eurocrats have shot our democracy down in flames|last=Baldwin|first=Paul|date=12 May 2016|work=[[The Daily Express]]|access-date=24 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Dunn-McAfee of the [[Public Relations and Communications Association]] commented that the film was "easily digestible" and "witty" but felt that it was a "little too late and a little too stretched".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prweek.com/article/1394642/brexit-movie-shows-power-simplifying-story|title=Brexit: The Movie shows the power of simplifying the story|last=Dunn-McAfee|first=Nicholas|work=PRWeek|date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Newsweek]]'' noted the film's attempt to market to [[Conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservative]], [[anti-establishment]] audiences, calling it "a [[Libertarianism in the United Kingdom|libertarian's]] wet dream of [[Ayn Rand|Randian]] proportions", and criticising alleged inconsistencies in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Lowe|first=Josh|date=12 May 2016|title=Brexit: The Movie is a Libertarian's Wet Dream|url=http://www.newsweek.com/brexit-movie-review-nigel-farage-michael-gove-douglas-carswell-eu-referendum-459234|magazine=[[Newsweek]]|doi=|pmid=|access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' criticised the film, stating it relied on [[ethnic stereotypes]] and omitted certain perspectives.

In the arts, '''bricolage''' ([[French language|French]] for "[[DIY]]" or "do-it-yourself projects") is the construction or creation of a work from a diverse range of things that happen to be available, or a work created by mixed media.

The term ''bricolage'' has also been used in many other fields, including [[anthropology]], philosophy, critical theory, education, computer software, and business.

==Origin==
''Bricolage'' is a French [[loanword]] that means the process of [[improvisation]] in a human endeavor. The word is derived from the French verb ''bricoler'' ("to tinker"), with the English term [[DIY]] ("Do-it-yourself") being the closest equivalent of the contemporary French usage. In both languages, ''bricolage'' also denotes any works or products of DIY endeavors.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms |last= Baldick |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Baldick |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn= 9780199208272 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=dictionary%20of&amp;pg=PA42 |accessdate=29 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Broady&gt;{{Cite book |title=Colloquial French 2: The Next step in Language Learning |last=Broady |first=Elspeth |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-26647-5 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JM2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arts==

===Music===
Instrumental bricolage in music includes the use of [[found object]]s as instruments, such as:

*[[Spoon (musical instrument)|Spoons]]
*[[Musical saw]]
*Australasian [[Slapping (music)|slap bass]] made from a [[tea chest]]
*Comb and wax paper for [[humming]] through
*[[eucalyptus|Gumleaf]] humming
*[[Lagerphone]] (made from a stick and bottle tops)
*[[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[steelpan|steel drums]] (made from [[drum (container)|industrial storage drums]])
*[[African drums]] and [[thumb piano]]s made from recycled pots and pans.
*American super instruments made from recorders and bicycle bells or metal rods and keys
*[[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp dancing]] is an example of the use of bricolage in music and dance, utilizing everyday objects, such as trash cans and broom sticks, to produce music.
*Many of the musical instruments created by American composer [[Harry Partch]] utilize unusual items, such as automotive [[hubcap]]s and [[pyrex]] [[carboy]]s.

Stylistic bricolage is the inclusion of common musical devices with new uses.  Shuker writes, "Punk best emphasized such stylistic bricolage".&lt;ref&gt;Shuker ''Popular Music: Key Concepts'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical bricolage flourishes in music of sub-cultures where: 
*experimentation is part of daily life (pioneers, immigrants, artistic communities),
*access to resources is limited (such as in remote, discriminated or financially disconnected sub-cultures) which limits commercial influence (e.g. acoustic performers, ghetto music, hippie, folk or traditional musicians), and
*there is a political or social drive to seek individuality (e.g. rap music, peace-drives, drummers' circles)

Unlike other bricolage fields, the intimate knowledge of resources is not necessary. Many punk musicians, for instance, are not musically trained, because they believe training can discourage creativity in preference for accuracy. Also, careful observation and listening is not necessary, it is common in spontaneous music to welcome 'errors' and disharmony. Like other bricolage fields, bricolage music still values trusting one's ideas and self-correcting structures such as targeted audiences.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Visual art===
In art, bricolage is a technique or creative mode, where works are constructed from various materials available or on hand, and is seen as a characteristic of many [[postmodern]] works.

These materials may be [[mass-produced]] or "junk". See also: [[Kurt Schwitters|Merz]], [[polystylism]], [[collage]], [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]].

Bricolage can also be applied to [[Improvisational theatre|theatrical forms of improvisation]], where the main strategy is to use the environment and materials at hand. The environment is the stage and the materials are often pantomimed. The use of the stage and the imaginary materials are all made up on the spot, so the materials which are at hand are actually things that the players know from past experiences (i.e. an improvisation of ordering fast food: One player would start with the common phrase "How may I help you?").

Bricolage is also applied in [[interior design]], through blending styles and accessorizing spaces with what is "on hand". Many designers use bricolage to come up with innovative and unique ideas.

===Architecture===
Bricolage is considered the jumbled effect produced by the close proximity of buildings from different periods and in different architectural styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bricolage |title=bricolage - definition of bricolage by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a term that is admiringly applied to the architectural work of [[Le Corbusier]], by Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter in their book ''Collage City'', suggesting that he assembled ideas from found objects of the [[history of architecture]]. This, in contrast to someone like [[Mies Van der Rohe]], whom they called a "hedgehog", for being overly focused on a narrow concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Academics==

===Literature===
In literature, bricolage is affected by [[intertextuality]], the shaping of a text's meanings by reference to other texts.

===Cultural studies===
In [[cultural studies]] bricolage is used to mean the processes by which people acquire objects from across [[social division]]s to create new [[cultural identity|cultural identities]]. In particular, it is a feature of [[subculture]]s such as the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement. Here, objects that possess one meaning (or no meaning) in the dominant culture are acquired and given a new, often subversive meaning. For example, the [[safety pin]] became a form of decoration in punk culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hebdige, Dick. ''Subculture: the Meaning of Style.'' London: Routledge, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social psychology&lt;!--linked from 'Claude Lévi-Strauss'--&gt;===
The term "psychological bricolage" is used to explain the mental processes through which an individual develops novel solutions to problems by making use of previously unrelated knowledge or ideas they already possess. 
The term, introduced by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Matthew J. Karlesky and Fiona Lee&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Karlesky, M., &amp; Lee, F. (in press). Psychological Bricolage and the Creative Process. In C. Shalley, M. Hitt, and J. Zhou (Eds.), Oxford Handbook of Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOEwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=oxford+creativity+bricolage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9YO2B5AYJD&amp;sig=fUzbuH-bEH_OB4D3iaqMu-DbRjk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J3MgVbe9KcjosAXC1oGABw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=oxford%20creativity%20bricolage&amp;f=false] of the [[University of Michigan]], draws from two separate disciplines.  The first, “social bricolage,” was introduced by cultural anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] in 1962. Lévi-Strauss was interested in how societies create novel solutions by using resources that already exist in the collective social consciousness. The second, "creative cognition,” is an intra-psychic approach to studying how individuals retrieve and recombine knowledge in new ways.  Psychological bricolage, therefore, refers to the cognitive processes that enable individuals to retrieve and recombine previously unrelated knowledge they already possess.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Karlesky, M., &amp; Lee, F. "Psychological Bricolage, Integrating social identities to produce creative solutions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Shalley, M. Hitt, &amp; J. Zhou. Oxford Handbook of Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychological bricolage is an intra-individual process akin to [[Karl E. Weick]]’s notion of bricolage in organizations, which is akin to Lévi-Strauss' notion of bricolage in societies.&lt;ref name="organizational1"&gt;Karl Weick, "Organizational Redesign as Improvisation", reprinted in ''Making Sense of the Organization''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
In his book ''[[The Savage Mind]]'' (1962, English translation 1966), French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] used  "bricolage" to describe the characteristic patterns of mythological thought. In his description it is opposed to the engineers' creative thinking, which proceeds from goals to means. Mythical thought, according to Lévi-Strauss, attempts to re-use available materials in order to solve new problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Claude |last=Lévi-Strauss |title=La Pensée sauvage |location=Paris |year=1962 }} English translation as ''The Savage Mind'' (Chicago, 1966). {{ISBN|0-226-47484-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tesugen.com/archives/03/08/bricolage |title=Bricolage [Tesugen&amp;#93; |publisher=Tesugen.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035434/http://tesugen.com/archives/03/08/bricolage |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varenne.tc.columbia.edu/bib/info/levstcld066savamind.html |title=Varenne: quotes from Lévi-Strauss (1963 [1962&amp;#93;) |publisher=Varenne.tc.columbia.edu |date=1999-05-11 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]] extends this notion to any discourse. "If one calls ''bricolage'' the necessity of borrowing one's concept from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, it must be said that every discourse is ''bricoleur''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacques |last=Derrida |authorlink=Jacques Derrida |url=http://hydra.humanities.uci.edu/derrida/sign-play.html |title=Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences |publisher=Hydra.humanities.uci.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], in their 1972 book ''[[Anti-Œdipus|Anti-Oedipus]]'', identify ''bricolage'' as the characteristic [[mode of production]] of the schizophrenic producer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], ''[[Anti-Œdipus|Anti-Oedipus]]: Capitalism and Schizophrenia''. Trans. Robert Hurley, Mark Seem, and Helen R. Lane. Continuum edition. London: Continuum, 2004 (1972). p.7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In the discussion of [[Constructionism_(learning_theory)|constructionism]], [[Seymour Papert]] discusses two styles of solving problems. Contrary to the analytical style of solving problems, he describes bricolage as a way to learn and solve problems by trying, testing, playing around.

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] and [[Shirley R. Steinberg]] have used the term bricolage in educational research to denote the use of multiperspectival research methods. In Kincheloe's conception of the research bricolage, diverse theoretical traditions are employed in a broader critical theoretical/critical pedagogical context to lay the foundation for a transformative mode of multimethodological inquiry. Using these multiple frameworks and methodologies, researchers are empowered to produce more rigorous and praxiological insights into socio-political and educational phenomena.

Kincheloe and Steinberg theorize a critical multilogical epistemology and critical connected ontology to ground the research bricolage. These philosophical notions provide the research bricolage with a sophisticated understanding of the complexity of knowledge production and the interrelated complexity of both researcher positionality and phenomena in the world. Such complexity demands a more rigorous mode of research that is capable of dealing with the complications of socio-educational experience. Such a critical form of rigor avoids the reductionism of many monological, mimetic research orientations (see Kincheloe, 2001, 2005; Kincheloe &amp; Berry, 2004; Steinberg, 2015; Kincheloe, McLaren, &amp; Steinberg, 2012).

==Information technology==

===Information systems===
In [[information systems]], bricolage is used by [[Claudio Ciborra]] to describe the way in which [[strategic information system]]s (SIS) can be built in order to maintain successful [[competitive advantage]] over a longer period of time than standard SIS. By valuing tinkering and allowing SIS to evolve from the bottom-up, rather than implementing it from the top-down, the firm will end up with something that is deeply rooted in the [[organisational culture]] that is specific to that firm and is much less easily imitated.&lt;ref&gt;Ciborra, Claudio (1992). "From Thinking to Tinkering: The Grassroots of Strategic Information Systems", ''The Information Society'' 8, 297–309&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
In her book ''[[Life on the Screen]]'' (1995), [[Sherry Turkle]] discusses the concept of bricolage as it applies to problem solving in code projects and workspace productivity.  She advocates the "bricoleur style" of programming as a valid and underexamined alternative to what she describes as the conventional structured "planner" approach.  In this style of coding, the programmer works without an exhaustive preliminary specification, opting instead for a step-by-step growth and re-evaluation process.  In her essay "Epistemological Pluralism", Turkle writes: "The bricoleur resembles the painter who stands back between brushstrokes, looks at the canvas, and only after this contemplation, decides what to do next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Turkle |first=Sherry |url=http://www.papert.org/articles/EpistemologicalPluralism.html |title=Epistemological Pluralism |publisher=Papert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==
The visual arts is a field in which individuals often integrate a variety of knowledge sets in order to produce inventive work. To reach this stage, artists read print materials across a wide array of disciplines, as well as information from their own social identities.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbledick, Susie. "Information-Seeking Behavior of Artists: Exploratory Interviews."&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the artist [[Shirin Neshat]] has integrated her identities as an Iranian exile and a woman in order to make complex, creative and critical bodies of work.&lt;ref&gt;2010 TED Talk, "Shirin Neshat: Art in Exile."&lt;/ref&gt; This willingness to integrate diverse knowledge sets enables artists with multiple identities to fully leverage their knowledge sets. This is demonstrated by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Chi-Ying Chen and Fiona Lee, who found that individuals were shown to exhibit greater levels of innovation in tasks related to their cultural identities when they successfully integrated those identities.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Cheng, C. &amp; Lee, F. "Increasing Innovation Through Identity Integration."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
[[Karl Weick]] identifies the following requirements for successful bricolage in organizations.&lt;ref name="organizational1"/&gt;
 
*Intimate knowledge of resources
*Careful observation and listening
*Trusting one's ideas
*Self-correcting structures, with feedback

Nasim Nicholas Taleb mentions it in his book ''[[Antifragile]]''.

==In popular culture==

===Fashion===
In his essay "Subculture: The Meaning of Style", [[Dick Hebdige]] discusses how an individual can be identified as a bricoleur when they "appropriated another range of commodities by placing them in a symbolic ensemble which served to erase or subvert their original straight meanings".&lt;ref&gt;"Subculture: The Meaning of Style". Dick Hebdige. In ''Cultural Studies: An Anthology''. Ed. Michael Ryan. 2008. p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion industry uses bricolage-like styles by incorporating items typically utilized for other purposes. For example, candy wrappers are woven together to produce a purse. The movie ''[[Zoolander]]'' parodies this concept with "Derelicte", a line of clothing made from trash.

===Television===
* ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' is a television series in which the protagonist is the paragon of a bricoleur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ian |last=Bogost |title=Comparative Video Game Criticism |url=http://gac.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/41 |work= [[Games and Culture]] |volume= 1, No. 1 |pages=41–46 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating solutions for the problem to be solved out of immediately available found objects.

In [[drama]], particularly the [[tragedies]] of [[classical antiquity]], the '''catastrophe''' is the final resolution in a poem or narrative plot, which unravels the intrigue and brings the piece to a close. In comedies, this may be a marriage between [[main character]]s; in tragedies, it may be the death of one or more main characters. It is the final part of a play, following the [[protasis]], [[epitasis]], and [[catastasis]].

The catastrophe is either simple or complex, for which also the [[fable]] and action are denominated. In a simple catastrophe, there is no change in the state of the main characters, nor any discovery or unravelling; the plot being only a mere passage out of agitation, to quiet and repose. This catastrophe is rather accommodated to the nature of the [[Epic poetry|epic]] poem, than of the tragedy.&lt;ref name="cyclo"&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a complex catastrophe, the main character undergoes a change of fortune, sometimes by means of a discovery, and sometimes without. The qualifications of this change are that it be probable and necessary: in order to be probable, it must be the natural result or effect of the foregoing actions, ''i.e.'' it must spring from the subject itself, or take its rise from the incidents, and not be introduced merely to serve a turn.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

The ''discovery'' in a complex catastrophe must have the same qualifications as the catastrophe itself, of which it is a principal part: it must be both probable and necessary. To be probable, it must spring out of the subject itself; not affected by means of marks or tokens, rings, bracelets, or by a mere recollection, as is frequently done both in ancient and modern times. To be necessary, it must never leave the characters it concerns in the same sentiments they had before, but still produce either love or hatred, etc. Sometimes, the change consists in the discovery, sometimes it follows at a distance, and sometimes results immediately from it; the last was used, for example, in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

Among critics, it has long been debated whether the catastrophe should always end happily, and favorably on the side of virtue, or not; ''i.e.'' whether virtue is always to be rewarded, and vice punished, in the catastrophe. [[Aristotle]], for example, preferred a shocking catastrophe, rather than a happy one; in that regard, the moving of terror and pity, which is the aim of tragedy, is better effected by the former than the latter.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

[[René Le Bossu]], a 17th-century French critic, divides the catastrophe, at least with regards to epics, into the unravelling, or ''[[denouement]]'', and the finishing, or ''achievement''; the latter of which he makes the result of the former, and to consist in the hero's passage out of a state of trouble and agitation, to rest and quiet. This period is but a point, without extent or duration; in which it differs from the former, which comprehends everything after the plot is laid. He adds, that there are several unravellings in a piece, each interconnected. The ''finishing'' is the end of the last unravelling.&lt;ref name="cyclo"/&gt;

In the twentieth century, [[John Ronald Reuel Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]] distinguished between what he called the ''catastrophe'' and the ''[[eucatastrophe]]''. The eucatastrophe is a classical catastrophe with an unexpected positive outcome for the protagonist. This term was coined to distance itself from the vernacular use of the word 'catastrophe' to signify disaster (which gave the term negative connotations in everyday usage).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5903">'''David Olère''' (January 19, 1902 in [[Warsaw]] – August 21, 1985 in [[Paris]]) was a [[Polish people|Polish]]-born [[French people|French]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[Sculpture|sculptor]] best known for his explicit drawings and paintings based on his experiences as a [[Jewish]] ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' inmate at [[Auschwitz]] [[concentration camp]] during [[World War II]].

== Life ==
Olère studied at the Warsaw [[Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw|Academy of Fine Arts]], and upon completion of his studies there at the age of 16, moved to [[Danzig]] and later [[Berlin]], where he exhibited woodcuts at museums and art houses.&lt;ref name=dob&gt;{{cite web|title=David Olere Biography|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/ARTS/DOBIO/DOarts.HTM|publisher=Florida Center for Instructional Technology|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he was hired by [[Ernst Lubitsch]] at the ''Europäische Film Allianz'' to work as a set builder for the film ''[[Das Weib des Pharao]]''.&lt;ref name=sujo&gt;Sujo ''et al'' (2001), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Olère also lived in Munich and Heidelberg &lt;ref name="uahc"&gt;Union of American Hebrew Congregations ''et al'' (1981), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to Paris in 1923 and settling in [[Montparnasse]], where he designed costumes and publicity posters for [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref name=sujo/&gt; In 1930, Olère married Juliette Ventura who gave birth to his son, Alexandre.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; When war broke out, Olère was drafted into the infantry regiment at [[Lons-le-Saunier]].&lt;ref name=dob/&gt;

== The Holocaust ==
On February 20, 1943, Olère was arrested by French police during a round up of Jews in [[Seine-et-Oise]] and placed in [[Drancy internment camp]].&lt;ref name=dob/&gt;  On March 2, 1943, he was one of approximately 1,000 Jews deported from Drancy to Auschwitz.&lt;ref name=hoffmann264&gt;Hoffmann (1998), p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; From this transport, Olère was one of 119 people selected for work; the rest were gassed shortly after arrival.&lt;ref name=hoffmann264/&gt; He was registered as prisoner 106144 and assigned to the ''Sonderkommando'' at Birkenau, the unit of prisoners forced to empty gas chambers and burn the bodies, firstly working in Bunker 2 and later in Crematorium III.&lt;ref name=hoffmann264/&gt; In addition to these duties, he was also forced to work as an illustrator, writing and decorating letters for the SS.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt;

Olère remained at Auschwitz until January 19, 1945, when he was taken on the evacuation [[death march]], eventually reaching [[Mauthausen concentration camp]], then the Melk and [[Ebensee concentration camp|Ebensee]] subcamps,&lt;ref name=hoffmann264/&gt; from which he made five unsuccessful escape attempts.&lt;ref name=uahc/&gt; Following his liberation on May 6, 1945,&lt;ref name=hoffmann264/&gt; he learned that his entire family had been exterminated in Warsaw.&lt;ref name=uahc/&gt; He subsequently moved back to Paris.&lt;ref name=uahc/&gt;

== Art ==
Olère began to draw at Auschwitz during the last days of the camp, when the SS became less attentive.&lt;ref name=uahc/&gt; His work has exceptional documentary value: there are no photos of what happened in the gas chambers and crematoria,&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; and Olère was the only artist to have worked as a member of the ''Sonderkommando'' and survived.&lt;ref name=hoffmann264/&gt; He was also the first witness to draw plans and cross-sections to explain how the crematoria worked.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt;

Olère felt compelled to capture Auschwitz artistically to illustrate the fate of all those that did not survive.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; He sometimes depicts himself in his paintings as a ghostly witnessing face in the background.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; He exhibited his work at the State Museum of [[Les Invalides]] and the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris, at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City]], at the [[Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive|Berkeley Museum]], and in Chicago.&lt;ref name=uahc/&gt; He retired from being an artist in 1962, and died in 1985.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; His widow and son have continued to inform the world about Auschwitz via his artwork.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt;

The '''Federal Theatre Project''' ('''FTP'''; 1935–39) was a [[New Deal]] program to fund [[theatre]] and other live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the [[United States]] during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. It was one of five [[Federal Project Number One]] projects sponsored by the [[Works Progress Administration]]. It was created not as a cultural activity but as a relief measure to employ artists, writers, directors and theater workers. It was shaped by national director [[Hallie Flanagan]] into a federation of regional theatres that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation in new forms and techniques, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time. The Federal Theatre Project ended when its funding was canceled after strong Congressional objections to the left-wing political tone of a small percentage of its productions.

Part of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project was a New Deal program established August 27, 1935,&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|29}} funded under the [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935]]. Of the [[United States Dollar|$]]4.88 billion allocated to the WPA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=14926 |title=Letter on Allocation of Work Relief Funds |last=Roosevelt |first=Franklin D.  |authorlink=Franklin Delano Roosevelt |date=August 26, 1935 |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley |access-date=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; $27 million was approved for the employment of [[Federal Art Project|artists]], [[Federal Music Project|musicians]], [[Federal Writers' Project|writers]] and actors under the WPA's [[Federal Project Number One]].&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|44}}

Government relief efforts through the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] and [[Civil Works Administration]] in the two preceding years were amateur experiments regarded as charity, not a theatre program. The Federal Theatre Project was a new approach to unemployment in the theatre profession. Only those certified as employable could be offered work, and that work was to be within the individual's defined skills and trades.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|15–16}}

"For the first time in the relief experiments of this country the preservation of the skill of the worker, and hence the preservation of his self-respect, became important," wrote [[Hallie Flanagan]], director of the Federal Theatre Project.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|17}} A theater professor at [[Vassar College]] who had studied the operation of government-sponsored theatre abroad for the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]],&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|9}} Flanagan was chosen to head the Federal Theatre Project by WPA head [[Harry Hopkins]],&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|20}} a former classmate at Grinnell College.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|7}} Roosevelt and Hopkins selected her despite considerable pressure to choose someone from the commercial theatre; they believed the project should be led by someone with academic credentials and a national perspective.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;{{Rp|39}}

Flanagan was given the daunting task of building a nationwide theater program to employ thousands of unemployed artists in as little time as possible. The problems of the theatre preceded the financial collapse of 1929. By that time it was already threatened with extinction due to the growing popularity of films and radio, but the commercial theatre was reluctant to adapt its practices.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;{{Rp|38}} Many actors, technicians and stagehands had suffered since [[1914 in film|1914]], when movies began to replace [[Repertory theatre|stock]], [[vaudeville]] and other live stage performances nationwide. [[Sound film#Triumph of the "talkies"|Sound motion pictures]] displaced 30,000 musicians. In the [[Great Depression]], people who had no money for entertainment found an entire evening of entertainment at the movies for 25 cents, while commercial theatre charged $1.10 to $2.20 admission to cover the cost of theater rental, advertising and fees to performers and union technicians. Unemployed directors, actors, designers, musicians and stagecrew took any kind of work they were able to find, whatever it paid, and charity was often their only recourse.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|13–14}}

"This is a tough job we're asking you to do," Hopkins told Flanagan at their first meeting in May 1935. "I don't know why I still hang on to the idea that unemployed actors get just as hungry as anybody else."&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|7–9}}

Hopkins promised "a free, adult, uncensored theatre"&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|28}} — something Flanagan spent the next four years trying to build.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|29}} She emphasized the development of local and regional theatre, "to lay the foundation for the development of a truly creative theatre in the United States with outstanding producing centers in each of those regions which have common interests as a result of geography, language origins, history, tradition, custom, occupations of the people."&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|22–23}}

==Operation==
On October 24, 1935, Flanagan prefaced her instructions on the Federal Theatre's operation with a statement of purpose:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The primary aim of the Federal Theatre Project is the reemployment of theatre workers now on public relief rolls: actors, directors, playwrights, designers, vaudeville artists, stage technicians, and other workers in the theatre field.

"In any consideration of the cost of the Federal Theatre," Flanagan wrote, "it should be borne in mind that the funds were allotted, according to the terms of the Relief Act of 1935, to pay wages to unemployed people. Therefore, when Federal Theatre was criticized for spending money, it was criticized for doing what it was set up to do."&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|34–35}}

The Federal Theatre Project established five regional centers in [[New York, New York]], [[Boston]] (Northeast), [[Chicago]] (Midwest), [[Los Angeles]] (West), and [[New Orleans]] (South).&lt;ref&gt;[https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/6858/umi-umd-4347.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y UMD ]- Retrieved 2018-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; The FTP did not operate in every state, since many lacked a sufficient number of unemployed people in the theatre profession.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434}} The project in Alabama was closed in January 1937 when its personnel were transferred to a new unit in Georgia. Only one event was presented in Arkansas. Units created in Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin were closed in 1936; projects in Indiana, Nebraska, Rhode Island and Texas were discontinued in 1937; and the Iowa project was closed in 1938.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434–436}}

Many of the notable artists of the time participated in the Federal Theatre Project, including [[Susan Glaspell]] who served as Midwest bureau director.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|266}} The legacy of the Federal Theatre Project can also be found in beginning the careers of a new generation of theater artists. [[Arthur Miller]], [[Orson Welles]], [[John Houseman]], [[Martin Ritt]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[Joseph Losey]], [[Marc Blitzstein]] and [[Abe Feder]] are among those who became established, in part, through their work in the Federal Theatre.  Blitzstein, Houseman, Welles and Feder collaborated on the controversial production, ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''.

The Federal Theatre Project was the most costly of the Federal One projects, consuming 29.1 percent of Federal One's budget, which was itself less than three-fourths of one percent of the total WPA budget.

On June 30, 1939, the Federal Theatre Project ended when its funding was canceled, largely due to strong Congressional objections to the overtly left-wing political tones of less than 10 percent of the Federal Theatre Project productions.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|361–363}}

==Living Newspaper==
{{main|Living Newspaper}}
[[Living Newspaper]]s were plays written by teams of researchers-turned-playwrights. These men and women clipped articles from newspapers about current events, often hot button issues like [[farm]] policy, [[syphilis]] testing, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], and housing inequity. These newspaper clippings were adapted into plays intended to inform audiences, often with [[progressivism|progressive]] or left-wing themes. ''Triple-A Plowed Under'', for instance, attacked the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] for killing an aid agency for farmers.  These politically themed plays quickly drew criticism from members of [[United States Congress|Congress]].

Although the undisguised political invective in the Living Newspapers sparked controversy, they also proved popular with audiences.  As an art form, the Living Newspaper is perhaps the Federal Theatre's most well-known work.

Problems with the Federal Theatre Project and Congress intensified when the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] objected to the first Living Newspaper, ''Ethiopia'', about [[Haile Selassie]] and his nation's struggles against [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invading Italian forces]]. The U.S. government soon mandated that the Federal Theatre Project, a government agency, could not depict foreign heads of state on the stage for fear of diplomatic backlash. Playwright and director [[Elmer Rice]], head of the New York office of the FTP, resigned in protest and was succeeded by his assistant, Philip W. Barber.

The Negro Theatre Unit was part of the Federal Theatre Project and had units that were set up in cities throughout the United States. The units were located in four different geographical regions of the country. In the West, units were located in Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles, California. In the East, units were located in New York City, New York, Boston, Massachusetts, Hartford, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Newark, New Jersey. In the South, there were units in Raleigh, North Carolina, Durham, North Carolina, and Birmingham, Alabama. In the Midwest, units were located in Chicago, Illinois, Peoria, Illinois, and Cleveland, Ohio. The project provided employment and apprenticeships to black playwrights, directors, actors, and technicians. The project offered a much needed source of assistance for African-American theatre from 1935 to 1939. The project's inspiring purposes further influenced the founding within a year of the [[American Negro Theater]], 1940 – 1949.

The Negro Theatre Unit of New York City was the best known. It was headquartered at the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]] in Harlem, where some 30 plays were presented. The first was [[Frank H. Wilson]]'s folk drama, ''Walk Together Chillun'' (1936), about the deportation of 100 African-Americans from the South to the North to work for low wages. The second was ''Conjur' Man Dies'' (1936), a comedy-mystery adapted by [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Countee Cullen]] from [[Rudolph Fisher]]'s novel. The most popular production was the third, which came to be called the ''[[Voodoo Macbeth]]'' (1936), director [[Orson Welles]]'s adaptation of Shakespeare's play set on a mythical island suggesting the Haitian court of King [[Henri Christophe]].&lt;ref name="A to Z"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Anthony D.  |date=2009 |title=The A to Z of African American Theater|url= |location=Lanham |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing Group |isbn=9780810870611}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|179–180}}

==Radio==
The Federal Theatre of the Air began weekly broadcasts March 15, 1936. For three years the radio division of the Federal Theatre Project presented an average of 3,000 programs annually on commercial stations and the NBC, Mutual and CBS networks. The major programs originated in New York; radio divisions were also created in 11 states.&lt;ref name="Arena"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flanagan |first=Hallie  |authorlink=Hallie Flanagan |date=1965 |title=Arena: The History of the Federal Theatre |url= |location=New York |publisher=Benjamin Blom, reprint edition [1940] |oclc=855945294}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|267–268, 397}}

Series included ''Professional Parade'', hosted by [[Fred Niblo]]; ''Experiments in Symphonic Drama'', original stories written for classical music; ''Gilbert and Sullivan Light Opera'', the complete works performed by Federal Theatre actors and recordings by [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte]]; ''Ibsen's Plays'', performances of 12 major plays; ''Repertory Theatre of the Air'', presenting literary classics; ''Contemporary Theatre'', presenting plays by modern authors; and the interview program, ''Exploring the Arts and Sciences''.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|268}}

The radio division presented a wide range of programs on health and safety, art, music and history. The American Legion sponsored [[James Truslow Adams]]'s ''Epic of America''. The children's program, ''Once Upon a Time'', and [[Paul de Kruif]]'s ''Men Against Death'' were both honored by the National Committee for Education by Radio. In March 1939, at the invitation of the BBC, Flanagan broadcast the story of the Federal Theatre Project to Britain. Asked to expand the program to encompass the entire WPA, the radio division produced ''No Help Wanted'', a dramatization by [[William N. Robson]] with music by [[Leith Stevens]]. ''[[The Times]]'' called it "the best broadcast ever sent us from the Americas".&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|268–269}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p2.cgi?ProgramName=No%20Help%20Wanted |title=No Help Wanted  |publisher=RadioGOLDINdex |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions criticized by Congress==
A total of 81 of the Federal Theatre Project's 830 major titles were criticized by members of Congress for their content in public statements, committee hearings, on the floor of the Senate or House, or in testimony before Congressional committees. Only 29 were original productions of the Federal Theatre Project. The others included 32 revivals or stock productions; seven plays that were initiated by community groups; five that were never produced by the project; two works of Americana; two classics; one children's play; one Italian translation; and one Yiddish play.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|432–433}}

The Living Newspapers that drew criticism were ''Injunction Granted'', a history of American labor relations; ''[[One-Third of a Nation]]'', about housing conditions in New York; ''Power'',&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}} about energy from the consumer's point of view;&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|184–185}} and ''Triple A Plowed Under'', on farming problems in America.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}} Another that was criticized, on the history of medicine, was not completed.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434}}

Dramas criticized by Congress were ''American Holiday'', about a small-town murder trial; ''Around the Corner'', a Depression-era comedy; ''Chalk Dust'', about an urban high school; ''Class of '29'', the Depression years as seen through young college graduates; ''Created Equal'', a review of American life since colonial times; ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s parable of democracy and dictatorship; ''No More Peace'', [[Ernst Toller]]'s satire on dictatorships; ''Professor Mamlock'', about Nazi persecution of Jews; ''Prologue to Glory'', about the early life of Abraham Lincoln; ''The Sun and I'', about [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] in Egypt; and ''Woman of Destiny'', about a female President who works for peace.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

Negro Theatre Unit productions that drew criticism were ''The Case of Philip Lawrence'', a portrait of life in Harlem; ''Did Adam Sin?'', a review of black folklore with music; and ''Haiti'', a play about [[Toussaint Louverture]].&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

Also criticized for their content were the dance dramas ''Candide'', from Voltaire; ''How Long Brethren'', featuring songs by future [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] recipient [[Lawrence Gellert]]; and ''Trojan Incident'', a translation of Euripides with a prologue from Homer.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

''Help Yourself'', a satire on high-pressure business tactics, was among the comedies criticized by Congress. Others were ''Machine Age'', about mass production; ''On the Rocks'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]]; and ''The Tailor Becomes a Storekeeper''.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

Children's plays singled out were ''Mother Goose Goes to Town'', and ''[[Revolt of the Beavers]]'', which the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York American]]'' called a "pleasing fantasy for children".&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

The musical ''Sing for Your Supper'' also met with Congressional criticism, although its patriotic finale, "[[Ballad for Americans]]", was chosen as the theme song of the 1940 Republican National Convention.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

==Cultural references==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3938">'''Feminist Art Gallery''' (or '''FAG''') is an art gallery and collective based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], described as a “geographical footprint” co-founded by artists [[Allyson Mitchell]] and Deirdre Logue in 2010.&lt;ref name="Allyson Mitchell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allysonmitchell.com/html/fagGallery.html |title=Allyson Mitchell |publisher=Allyson Mitchell |date= |accessdate=2015-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929051023/http://www.allysonmitchell.com/html/fagGallery.html |archivedate=2015-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Allyson Mitchell]] and [[Deirdre Logue]] founded the Feminist Art Gallery (FAG) in 2010."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ago.net/fag-feminist-art-gallery |title=FAG Feminist Art Gallery &amp;#124; AGO Art Gallery of Ontario |publisher=Ago.net |date= |accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FAG’s mission is to grow sustainable [[feminist]] and [[queer]] art that proposes an alternative model for artist-run centres by not depending on formal funding sources such as government and corporate institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accessgallery.ca/archive/fag-satellite/ |title=Access Gallery FAG Satellite |publisher=Accessgallery.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAG provides a space for art exhibitions, and opportunities for artists who are emerging, and invisible such as queer artists and [[People of color|POC]].

Their mandate states that it "is a response, a process, a site, a protest, an outcry, an exhibition, a performance, an economy, a conceptual framework, a place and an opportunity. We host we fund we advocate we support we claim."&lt;ref name="Allyson Mitchell"/&gt; The gallery operates alternatively to traditional galleries in the sense that artists do not submit proposals, and Mitchell and Logue act as "feral curators", which means they look to friends and peers to suggest which artists to show.&lt;ref name="Macleans.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/feminist-art-gallery-fights-back-with-fabric/ |title=The Feminist Art Gallery fights back with fabric |publisher=Macleans.ca |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art is also not for sale, rather the artists receive a fee from private donations raised through its "matronage program".&lt;ref name="Macleans.ca"/&gt;

Their most notable project are a series of banners funded by the [[University of Brighton]] for an Exhibition called "Civil Partnerships-Queer &amp; Feminist Art &amp; Activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/projects/irn/civil-partnerships-event/exhibition |title=Exhibition &amp;#124; Civil Partnerships Programme &amp;#124; Arts and Humanities |publisher=Arts.brighton.ac.uk |date=2012-05-21 |accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series of four banners made of crochet granny squares read: "WE CAN’T COMPETE", "WE WON’T COMPETE", "WE CAN’T KEEP UP", "WE WON’T KEEP DOWN". These slogans are central to FAG’s mandate in which they ask " "Why would you want to be a winner in this hierarchical structure?" and "How do we both resist and reconcile our participation in this oppressive system?".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

FAG has collaborated with institutions such as [[SFMOMA]], [[Tate Modern]], and were the artists in residence in 2015 at [[The Art Gallery of Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Art Gallery of Ontario|title=AGO Artists in Residence, 2011-2016|date=2017|publisher=Art Gallery of Ontario|location=Toronto|isbn=9781894243940|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also done projects with the Whippersnapper Gallery,  [[The Power Plant]], The Gallery of York University, Access Gallery, and Artists Independent Archives .&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

[[File:Coat of Arms of the Diocese of St Davids.svg|thumb|165x165px|Arms of the Diocese of St. David's, Sable, (a cross Or with five cinquefoils sable).  The arms, lacking cinquefoils, forms the basis of the flag.]]
The '''flag of Saint David''' ({{lang-cy|Baner Dewi Sant}}) is normally a yellow cross on a black field, but it has also appeared as a black cross on a yellow field or with an [[Line (heraldry)#Engrailed and invected|engrailed]] cross. It represents the 6th-century [[Saint David]] ({{lang-cy|Dewi Sant}}; {{circa|500}} – {{circa|589}}), a Welsh [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Menevia|bishop of Menevia]] and the [[patron saint]] of [[Wales]].

The Flag of Saint David has been used as a flag representing [[Wales]] (as an alternative to the [[Flag of Wales|Red Dragon]] flag), in the same sense that the crosses of [[St George's Cross|Saint George]], [[flag of Scotland|Saint Andrew]] and [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|Saint Patrick]] are used to represent [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]] (of which they are respectively [[patron saint]]s). It is similar to the arms of the [[Diocese of St David's]].

The flag can be seen throughout Wales, but not as frequently as the [[Flag of Wales|Red Dragon]]. On [[Saint David's Day]] it often plays a central role in the celebrations.

== History ==
[[File:St Davids Day in Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The flag of Saint David ''(right)'' alongside the flag of Wales ''(left)'' on [[Saint David's Day]].]]
The flag of Saint David was mostly unknown in Wales until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-w-std.html|title=St. Davids Flag (Wales)|website=www.crwflags.com|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a large one along the roof in [[St David's Cathedral]] with the [[Charge (heraldry)#Plants|cinquefoils]] thereon but hardly any others in use. The Welsh Tartan Company (WTC){{who|date=April 2015}} were looking around for a 'brand' to complete the ''Brithwe Dewi Sant'' (St David's Tartan). J Wake, then of the WTC, set out to see if the flag could be used commercially or indeed patriotically across Wales. The feeling at the time was that the Union flag did not contain any Welshness, the [[St George's Cross]] representing Wales as a principality of [[England]]. The Dean of St David's said that the cinquefoil and the cross were their property and advised help from a London royal official office.

The WTC was then told the Prince of Wales probably owned the rights to the flag and may not give permission. There was neither outright animosity to the flag being produced and used, nor any enthusiasm. It was decided, after a lawyer was consulted, that the flag could be used as long as there were no cinquefoils on it. A thousand flags were produced without the cinquefoils; they were distributed around Wales and a PR campaign took place to increase knowledge of the St David's flag.

The flags were hung prominently in the Welsh shop in the centre of Cardiff and at other locations. Within 10 years, the St David's Flag was known and flown across Wales in patriotic use. It was never a flag to usurp the Red Dragon but to complement it, and perhaps to get Wales's own Patron Saint's emblem to proudly fly alongside the emblems of the other nations, St George, St Andrew and St Patrick.

== Uses ==
The history of the flag is somewhat obscure, but it seems to have emerged at the beginning of the 20th century. One theory is that it was developed to fly atop [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches in Wales (possibly with colours reversed as a black cross on a yellow field) in the same way that the [[St George's Cross]] was flown outside churches in [[England]], but since 1954 churches are more likely to fly a [[flag of the Church in Wales]]  based on its armorial badge granted that year.

In any case, the colours of the flag, black and gold, have certainly long been associated with the Welsh saint, even if not always in the form of a symmetrical cross. St David's University College, [[Lampeter]] (now the Lampeter campus of the [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]]), founded in 1822, adopted these colours as the 'college colours' in 1888,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Price | first = DT William | location = Cardiff | title = A History of Saint David's University College, Lampeter | volume = 1 | publisher = [[University of Wales Press]] | isbn = 978-0-7083-0606-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the flag of St David continues to be associated with the college, and is often flown today in a form defaced to include the cinquefoils of the crest of St David's College.

A stylized version of the flag was also used as the shoulder badge of the [[38th (Welsh) Infantry Division]] during [[World War II]].

Between 2003 and 2008, [[Cardiff City F.C.]] incorporated the flag into their logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardiff City|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Cardiff_City/Cardiff_City.htm|work=Historical Football Kits|accessdate=26 March 2013|first=Dave|last=Moor}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crusaders Rugby League|Crusaders]] RLFC, who started playing [[rugby league]] in [[Bridgend]] in 2006, also incorporated the flag on their logo.

In 2007 [[George Hargreaves (politician)|George Hargreaves]], leader of the [[Christian Party (UK)|Welsh Christian Party]], campaigned to replace the [[Flag of Wales]] with the St David's Cross, claiming that the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] on the Welsh flag was "nothing less than the sign of Satan".&lt;ref&gt;Molly Watson, "[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/christian-group-wants-evil-welsh-2263878 Christian group wants 'evil' Welsh flag changed]" ''Western Mail'', 3 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freedom Monument''' (or ''Nasb al-Hurriyah'') ({{lang-ar|نصب الحرية}}), located in [[Liberation Square, Baghdad|Tahrir Square (Liberation Square)]] in the centre of [[Baghdad]], is the city's most well-known and well-loved monument.

==Background and History==
The  monument was commissioned in 1959, shortly after Iraq gained independence. Iraqi's leading sculptor, [[Jawad Saleem]], who was well-known for works that integrated Iraq's ancient history with contemporary themes and techniques was commissioned by the new leader of the republic, Brigadier General [[Abd al-Karim Qasim|'Abd al-Karim Qasim]], who wanted to create a monument that would be a celebration of Iraq's declaration of independence. It was to be situated in the heart of Baghdad's central business district, overlooking Liberation Square and Jamhouriyya Bridge. The sculptor understood that the monument would need to be a symbol of a new nation state, and designed a work that was more than a simple narrative of the 1958 revolution, but that also paid homage to Iraq's deep art history by including [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abassid]] and Bayblonian wall-reliefs, producing a sculpture that was both "strikingly modern" yet also referenced tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saleem laboured on the project under difficult conditions, resisting all attempts by Qasim to have his image incorporated into the monument.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Saleem had wanted the sculpture to be at ground level, but the project architect, [[Rifat Chadirji|Rifa'at Chadirchi]], insisted that it be elevated so that it would look more 'monumental'. As a result, the completed work faces the busy traffic rather than people walking in the adjacent gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, N., "Political Modernism, Jabrā, and the Baghdad Modern Art Group," ''CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture,'' Vol. 12, No. 2, 2010, Online: https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1603&amp;context=clcweb, DOI: 10.7771/1481-4374.160; Floyd, T., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat," [Biographical Notes] in: ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Islamic World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the monument was Saleem's design, he did not see the project through to completion. Following his premature death in January, 1961, the project was finalised in 1961 by the sculptor's wife; artist, [[Lorna Selim|Lorna Saleem]], along with Saleem's friend and colleague, sculptor, [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]], who had previously been assisting on the project by casting the bronze figures.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, N., "Political Modernism, Jabrā, and the Baghdad Modern Art Group," ''CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture,'' Vol. 12, No. 2, 2010, Online: https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1603&amp;context=clcweb, DOI: 10.7771/1481-4374.160; Floyd, T., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat," [Biographical Notes] in: ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Islamic World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The completed monument, known as ''Nasb al-Hurriyah'' (''Monument of Freedom''), has survived various attempts to have it pulled down and is one of Baghdad's most iconic public works.&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description==
The monument was opened in 1961, after the sculptor's death. It consists of 14 bronze castings, representing 25 figures, on a travertine slab, raised 6 metres off the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,''Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The monument is 10 metres in height and 50 metres long. The figures, which are in bas-relief, are intended to evoke Babylonian, Assyrian and Arab artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Baram A., "Art With Local and Mesopotamian Components", In: ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba‘thist Iraq: 1968–89'', [St Antony’s/Macmillan Series], London, Palgrave Macmillan, 1991, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

It depicts historic Iraqi events up to the [[14 July Revolution]] led by [[Abdul Karim Qasim]]; a key date which marks the beginning of Republican rule in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 215; Kohl, P.L., Kozelsky, M. and Ben-Yehud, N., ''Selective Remembrances: Archaeology in the Construction, Commemoration, and Consecration of National Pasts,'' University of Chicago Press, 2008,  p.200; [https://papers.iafor.org/submission34296/ Art and Politics in Iraq: Examining the Freedom Monument in Baghdad]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The monument is intended to be read as a verse of Arabic poetry - from right to left - beginning with events that preceded the revolution - and concluding with harmony following independence.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, pp 82-83&lt;/ref&gt; The multiple references and hidden layers of meaning in the work inspired Arab artists across the region and encouraged them to pursue artwork with a national identity at a time when many Arab nations were attaining independence.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,''Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The sculpture featured on the 250 Dinar bank-note in 1995 and the 10,000 dinar bank note for 2013-2015 in honour of the sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;''Coinweeek,'' 24 June, 2017, Online: https://coinweek.com/paper-money-2/iraqi-10000-dinar-note-mosque-destroyed-isis/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fumage''' is a [[surrealist techniques|surrealist art technique]] popularized by [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in which impressions are made by the [[smoke]] of a [[candle]] or [[kerosene lamp]] on a piece of paper or canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnitz|first=Jacqueline|title=Twentieth-Century Art of Latin America|year=2001|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=0292708580|pages=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WhsUW7jkc0C&amp;pg=PT141&amp;dq=Fumage+Paalen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ti23UMm0L4eG0QG-0IHwCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paalen´s first Fumage ''Dictated by a Candle'' was presented 1936 in the International Surrealist Exhibition in London. In the same year Paalen painted his first oil based on the fumage, "[[Pays interdit/Forbidden Land (Wolfgang Paalen)|Pays interdit]]" ("Forbidden Land"). Several other Surrealists as [[Roberto Matta]], but also [[Salvador Dalí]] later utilized the technique, Dali calling the technique "sfumato".&lt;ref name="HDS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspley|first=Keith|title=Historical Dictionary of Surrealism|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0810858479|pages=209–210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KK7JHqNrRsC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=Fumage+Dali&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0i23UKO0H6KT0QGbkoG4Cw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Fumage%20Dali&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique has been utilized by artists including Bimal Banerjee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaitanya|first=Krishna|title=History of Indian Painting: The Modern Period|year=1994|publisher=Abhinav Pubns|isbn=8170173108|pages=240|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=McSbSMhArFgC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=%22Bimal+Banerjee%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wgK3UI2_GsW40QHF5YEY&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bimal%20Banerjee%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Blakemore,&lt;ref&gt;[http://adamblakemore.com/category/smoke-art "Smoke Art"] Asam Blakemore catalog&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alberto Burri]], [[Burhan Doğançay]], [[Jiri Georg Dokoupil]], [[Hugh Parker Guiler]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Antonio Muñiz]], and [[Otto Piene]].

==In popular media==
Guiler's usage of the fumage technique is depicted briefly in the 1987 film ''[[Henry and June]]'' and his fumage pictures were often used as the covers for his wife [[Anaïs Nin|Anaïs Nin's]] books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herron|first=Paul|title=Anaïs Nin: a book of mirrors|year=1996|publisher=Sky Blue Press|isbn=0965236404|pages=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLqwAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Guiler+Fumage&amp;dq=Guiler+Fumage&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eS63UL7OFYjr0gGA1oHQAQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geoffrey Harley Mewton''' (1905–1998) was an Australian architect and leading proponent of [[modern architecture]] in Melbourne during the 1930s.&lt;ref name=bayside&gt;Heritage Alliance (2007).

"Australian Dictionary of Biography: 1981–1990. A-K. Vol. 17.", Melbourne University Publishing, Carlton, Australia. {{ISBN|9780522853827}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for the Woy Woy flats at Elwood designed in partnership with [[Roy Grounds]], considered to be the first modern block of flats in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=langmore /&gt;

== Personal life ==

Geoffrey Mewton was the youngest child of William Arthur Mewton and Violet May Ratcliff Ford (1868–1953). His siblings were Beryl Harley Mewton (1898–1982) and Roydon Harley Mewton (1900–1964). Born on 21 January 1905 in Brighton, Melbourne, Mewton was educated at [[Wesley College, Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=ancestry /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia&gt;Goad, P and Willis, J (2012). "The Encyclopaedia of Australian Architecture", p. 452-453. Cambridge University Press, Victoria, Australia. {{ISBN|978-0-521-88857-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mewton married Elma Ellen Gotz and lived in Sandringham for 20 years.&lt;ref name=langmore /&gt; They had a child Noelle Margret Mewton. Mewton died in London, England in March 1998 aged 93.&lt;ref name=ancestry /&gt;

== Architectural career ==
[[File:207 Bluff Road, Sandringham.jpeg|thumb|207 Bluff Road, Sandringham, Victoria, Australia. Mewton's residence for two decades.]]
Mewton began his architectural career in 1923, working at the [[Blackett, Foster &amp; Craig]] office while studying at night at the Working Men's College (later to be known as the [[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]], RMIT).&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Throughout 1926 to 1928 Mewton attended night classes at the [[Melbourne University Architectural Atelier]] (MUAA).&lt;ref name=langmore /&gt; After graduating from MUAA on 27 August 1928 Mewton travelled to London with [[Roy Grounds]] and [[Oscar Bayne]], colleagues at the University Atelier.&lt;ref name=langmore /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Here Grounds, Mewton and Bayne lived together in rented accommodation in London.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

During his time in London, Mewton worked for [[Adems Holden &amp; Pearson]], the firm is known for the design of the modernist brick and concrete suburban [[London Underground]] railway stations.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

In 1929 after travelling to New York Mewton started working in the [[Van Alen]] office. At the time the firm was in the completion stage of the Chrysler buildings.&lt;ref name=ancestry&gt;[http://search.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?new=I&amp;gsfn=Geoffrey+Harley&amp;gsln=Mewton&amp;gl=ROOT-CATEGORY&amp;rank=I&amp;gss+sfs62_&amp;msbdy=1905], www.ancestrylibrary.com, viewed 24 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

At the age of 25 on 20 October 1930 Mewton returned to London to sit his [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) examinations and took the opportunity to travel throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=ancestry /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

On returning home to Melbourne, Australia on 13 September 1932, Mewton set up his own office.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; A year later Roy Grounds returned to Melbourne and the pair formed the office [[Mewton &amp; Grounds]].&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Together they were subsequently responsible for the design of several buildings that introduced modernism to Melbourne.&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt; Their partnership was informal and each worked individually, collecting their own profits.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Quickly the pair became acknowledged as the protagonists of modernism in Melbourne.

Within this body of work Mewton demonstrates a skill in rectilinear arrangement which also exhibits an interest in the work of Dutch Modernist Architect [[William Dudok]] and Russian architect [[Lakov Chernikov]].&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; The Watt House Toorak, VIC (1934), Fairbairn House, Toorak VIC (1935–1936) and Mewton's own home 207 Bluff Road (1938) epitomise his interest in living room garden windows. To create a house that opened to the garden Mewton used windows that could be folded back completely.&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] described Mewton's work as "the perfect example of the Victorian type, house and garden are really planned as one."&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt;

In 1939 the partnership between Mewton and Grounds was dissolved. From here Mewton began partnership with [[Edward Billson]]. The pair practised together from 1939 to 1942.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

Mewton worked for the [[Department of Labour and National Service]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=madge&gt;Madge, J and Peckham, A (2006).

Mewton worked briefly in 1945 for the firm A.C. Leith &amp; Barttett. He assisted in the design of the Housing Commission of Victoria.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; He was nominated that same year as judge for the Sun Post War Homes competition (1945). He was an advocate and committee member of 'Small Homes Service' [[Royal Victorian Institute of Architects]] (RVIA).&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

Later in 1945 Mewton joined the firm [[Godfrey &amp; Spowers]]. Also joining the partnership were Eric Hughes and John Lobb. Together they formed '[[Godfrey&amp;Spowers, Hughes, Mewton and Lobb]]'.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;Peterson, R (2005). "A Place of Sensuous Resort: Buildings of St Kilda and their people", www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/42.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding in the late 1950s the firm began to undertake industrial and office buildings such as; Allan’s Music Building, Collins St (1965), National Mutual Centre Melbourne (1965) and Dallas Brooks Hall (1963–1969).&lt;ref name=spowers&gt;[http://www.spowers.com.au/company-profile/spowers-history/, "Spowers Background"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Mewton continued to work for Godrey&amp;Spowers, Hughes, Mewton and Lobb as a partner until he retired in 1980 from practice.&lt;ref name=spowers /&gt;

== Key Works ==

[[File:Woy Woy.jpeg|thumb|Woy Woy, 77 Marine Parade, Elwood, Victoria, Australia. First modernist block of flats in Melbourne. Designed by Mewton&amp;Gounds.]]
*[[Woy Woy]] is the earliest of a small group of multi-storied modernist flats in Elwood, it is also the earliest of its kind in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=peterson /&gt; Built in 1925–1936 the flats were designed by Mewton&amp;Grounds. Woy Woy is located at 77 Marine Parade, Elwood, Victoria, Australia. The design of the apartment block is extremely minimal.&lt;ref name=spowers /&gt; The interlocking cubic forms in the design reveal an interest in architect [[Willem Dudok]].&lt;ref name=peterson /&gt;&lt;ref name=nez&gt;Neville, G (2010). [modernismus.wordpress.com/modern-idea/], "Melbourne: Woy Woy", viewed 19 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[207 Bluff Road]], Sandringham, Victoria, Australia, is a single-storeyed clinker brick house. It exhibits terracotta tiles a gabled roof and timber window frames have been painted white. Mewton designed this home for his own residence in 1938. Within the inner city of Melbourne, Australia this house is a rare example of modern architecture during the 1930s in Melbourne. The home has been defined as the modern '[[bush house]]'. [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] described the house "as a wise house that knows not to be jealous of the garden."&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

==Biography==
'''Gleb Alexandrovich Savinov''' was born September 27, 1915 in [[Krasnokutsk Raion|Natalievka]] village, [[Kharkov Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Kharkiv Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]). Children and youth Gleb Savinov were on the Volga River at Saratov. His father, [[Alexander Savinov|Alexander Ivanovich Savinov]] (1881–1942), a talented painter, draftsman and teacher, was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. Friendship bound him to the well-known artists from the Saratov School - [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], Alexander Matveev, Piotr Utkin, Pavel Kuznetsov. They often gathered in the Savinov house in Saratov. Their judgments about art, the creativity of his father, his extraordinary personality had a strong impact on the formation of the young artist.

In 1922 the family of Savinov finally moved from Saratov in Petrograd. In 1928-1930 Savinov started working in the studio of his father while still attending school. In 1934, after graduating from high school he enrolled at the painting department of the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]], where he studied with Pavel Naumov, Michael Bernstein, Nicholai Radlov, [[Genrikh Pavlovsky]], [[Semion Abugov]], and [[Alexander Osmerkin]]. In 1940 Gleb Savinov graduated from [[Repin Institute of Arts|Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]] in [[Alexander Osmerkin]] workshop. His graduation work - painting named "Childhood Gorky" - was awarded first prize in 1940 in Moscow at the All-Union Exhibition of graduation works of Art Institutes and Colleges. In the same year Gleb Savinov married his classmate and talented artist [[Olga Bogaevskaya]]. This happy family and a creative union lasted sixty years.

Since 1940 Gleb Savinov participated in Art Exhibitions. He painted portraits, historical and genre paintings, landscapes, genre scenes, still lifes, interiors. In August 1940 Savinov was called to serve in the Navy fleet. After the beginning of the [[Great Patriotic War]] Savinov served in parts of the [[Baltic Fleet]], including the defense of Leningrad. Command drew attention to his artistic training. Savinov nominated artist Baltic crew. He was appointed manufacturer of patriotic and anti-fascist panels and posters. He draws a distinction in battle soldiers, wounded in the hospitals, also participates in the preparation of exhibitions of artists of the Red Army devoted to the fighting troops of the [[Leningrad Front]] and the [[Baltic Fleet]]. In 1944, Savinov was admitted to the [[Leningrad Union of Artists|Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists]].
 
After the [[Great Patriotic War]], Savinov included in the creative and educational activities that will combine almost to the end of life. In 1945-1947 he taught in [[Repin Institute of Arts|Ilya Repin Institute of Arts]], then in 1949-1979 in the Vera Mukhina Institute, where since 1969 he was Professor of Painting.

In 1957 on the [[All-Union art exhibition (Moscow, 1957)|All-Union Art Exhibition in Moscow]], devoted to the 40th Anniversary of the October Revolution, Savinov first showed two large narrative paintings: "The University Embankment",&lt;ref&gt;'' All-Union Art Exhibition of 1957 dedicated to the 40th Anniversary of October Revolution. Catalogue.'' - Moscow: Soviet artist, 1957. - p.68.&lt;/ref&gt; and "At the street"&lt;ref&gt;''1917 - 1957. Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists. Catalogue.'' - Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1958. - p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; (both 1957). They have played a great role in changing of his artistic creation. In these works he appeared as a mature artist, a talented colorist and composer who knows how everyday street scene to lift up to the level of highly generalized image of civil sound. The artist has made great achievements in painting, clean, brighten, and enriched his palette. The color scheme of works was built on the harmony of light, bright colors. In both pictures Savinov demonstrated ability in a small space of the canvas clearly convey the feeling of the era, with its household characteristics, originality of types, relationships between people.

Since that time Savinov gained fame and recognition as a master of genre painting. Among his most famous paintings are "About Russian women"&lt;ref&gt;''Soviet Russia. Republican exhibition of 1960.

'''''Horton Hatches the Egg''''' is a children's book written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel under the pen name [[Dr. Seuss]] and published in 1940 by [[Random House]]. The book tells the story of Horton the Elephant, who is tricked into sitting on a bird's egg while its mother, Mayzie, takes a permanent vacation to [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]]. Horton endures a number of hardships but persists, often stating, "I meant what I said, and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful, one hundred percent!" Ultimately, the egg hatches, revealing an elephant-bird, a creature with a blend of Mayzie's and Horton's features.

According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel claimed the story was born in early 1940, when he left a window open in his studio, and the wind fortuitously blew a sketch of an elephant on top of a sketch of a tree. However, according to later biographer Charles Cohen, this account is probably apocryphal. He found elements of ''Horton'' in earlier Dr. Seuss works, most notably the 1938 short story "Matilda, the Elephant with a Mother Complex".

''Horton Hatches the Egg'' was published to immediate critical acclaim and financial success and has remained popular with the general public. The book has also been used as the basis for academic articles on a variety of topics, including economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption. Horton appeared again in the 1954 Dr. Seuss book ''[[Horton Hears a Who!]]'' These two books later provided the thrust of the plot for the 2000 Broadway musical ''[[Seussical]]''.

==Plot summary==
The book centers on [[Horton the Elephant|Horton]], a genial elephant, who is convinced by Mayzie, a lazy, irresponsible bird, to sit on her egg while she takes a short "break", which turns into her permanent relocation to [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]].

As Horton sits on the egg, waiting for it to hatch, he is exposed to the elements, laughed at by other jungle animals, captured by hunters, forced to endure a terrible sea voyage, and finally placed in a traveling circus. However, despite his hardships and Mayzie's clear intent not to return, Horton refuses to leave the nest because he insists on keeping his word, often repeating, "I meant what I said, and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful, one hundred per cent!"

The traveling circus ends up visiting near Mayzie's new Palm Beach residence. She visits the circus just as the egg is due to hatch (after 51 weeks in Palm Beach) and demands that Horton return it, without offering him a reward. However, when the egg hatches, the creature that emerges is an "elephant-bird", a cross between Horton and Mayzie, and Horton and the baby are returned happily to the jungle.

==Background==
According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, ''Horton Hatches the Egg'' was born in 1940, the day after New Year's, when he took a break from drawing in his [[Park Avenue]] apartment and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1995, pp. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt; This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen 2004, pp. 2-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Cohen, on the other hand, found traces of ''Horton Hatches the Egg'' in early Dr. Seuss works. In an early installment of Geisel's cartoon feature "Boids and the Beasties", which began in [[Judge (magazine)|''Judge'']] magazine in 1927, he juxtaposed a bird and an elephant. A few weeks later, he drew a story in which a whale ends up passed out in a catalpa tree. In a 1959 cartoon for [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine, he depicted a dachshund who sits on eggs for storks. In 1961, he drew an illustration for ''Judge'' that showed a walrus sitting in a tree, trying to hatch the eggs in a bird nest. Some of his earlier work also featured elephant-bird hybrids, which prefigured the elephant-bird that hatches at the end of ''Horton Hatches the Egg''.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen 2004, pp. 6-11&lt;/ref&gt;

In  1938, two years before ''Horton Hatches the Egg'', ''Judge'' published perhaps the most obvious precursor to ''Horton'', "Matilda, the Elephant with a Mother Complex", a short story by Geisel about an "old maid elephant" who sits on a chickadee egg until it hatches, only to have the newborn chickadee fly away from her. In 1939, Geisel created an advertisement for NBC featuring a sympathetic-looking elephant lashed with ropes and contained in a cage made of sticks, similar to Horton's situation when the hunters capture him in ''Horton Hatches the Egg''.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen 2004, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In early drafts, the elephant's name changed from Osmer to Bosco to Humphrey. The final choice, Horton, was apparently after Horton Conrad, one of Geisel's classmates at [[Dartmouth College]]. The bird's name changed from Bessie to Saidie and finally Mayzie. In the first draft, the elephant character volunteered to sit on the eggs for the bird, who was very reluctant.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1995, pp. 97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and reception==
''Horton Hatches the Egg'' was published by [[Random House]] in fall 1940 to immediate success.&lt;ref name="Morgan 1995, p. 99"&gt;Morgan (1995), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; It received primarily positive notice from critics. ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called it "sheer nonsense, but good fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Horton Hatches the Egg|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/dr-seuss-2/horton-hatches-the-egg/|work=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer for ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' wrote, "A moral is a new thing to find in a Dr. Seuss book, but it doesn't much interfere with the hilarity with which he juggles an elephant up a tree. To an adult the tale seems a little forced compared to his first grand yarns, less inevitable in its nonsense, but neither young nor old are going to quibble with the fantastic comedy of his pictures."&lt;ref name="Morgan 1995, p. 99"/&gt;

The book also found early success with book buyers and the general public. It sold 6,000 copies in its first year and 1,600 in its second.&lt;ref&gt;Minear (1999), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Frances Chrystie, the juvenile buyer for [[FAO Schwarz]], wrote to [[Bennett Cerf]], Geisel's publisher, "I've been sitting alone in my apartment reading ''Horton'' aloud to myself over and over again... It's the funniest book I've ever seen... [Our] merchandise manager thinks he can find an elephant in the store, and we can make a tree and lay an egg and have a very fine window for Book Week."&lt;ref name="Morgan 1995, p. 99"/&gt; Mary Stix of James Book Store in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, noted the book's popularity with adults as well as children. Numerous booksellers invited Geisel to hold autographing events at their stores, and Cerf sent him on a tour across several U.S. cities to promote the book. However, the book was less well received in England, where it was rejected by seven publishers before [[Hamish Hamilton]] finally published it, to modest success, in 1947. This mirrored a general trend, as Dr. Seuss books were slow to catch on in England.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (1995), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

''Horton Hatches the Egg'' has remained popular in the United States. In 2001, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reported that the book had sold 987,996 to that point, placing it at 138 in the magazine's list of the best-selling children's books of all time.&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA186995.html|title=All-Time Bestselling Children's Books, 17 December 2001, Publishers Weekly.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225125934/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA186995.html|archivedate=December 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was included in ''Six by Seuss: A Treasury of Dr. Seuss Classics'', which was the main selection for the [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] in June 1991.&lt;ref name="Morgan 1995, p. 286"&gt;Morgan (1995), p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, less than a year after Geisel's death, Horton's refrain was included in the 16th edition of ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]''.&lt;ref name=nel-journal/&gt; In 2007, the [[National Education Association]] named the book one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children", based on an online poll.&lt;ref name=NEA2007&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |publisher= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
''Horton Hatches the Egg'' has been used in discussions on a wide variety of topics, including economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption. [[James W. Kemp]], a retired [[United Methodist Church|United Methodist]] pastor, compared Horton to the early Christians to whom the [[First Epistle of Peter]] was addressed. Like those early Christians, Horton faces persecution and ridicule for his actions, but Horton is faithful to his mission and is rewarded, as evidenced by the elephant-bird that hatches at the end of the book.&lt;ref name="kemp"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gospel According to Dr. Seuss|last=Kemp|first=James|publisher=Judson Press|year=2004|location=Valley Forge, PA|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard B. Freeman]], writing in 2011 about the contemporaneous economic situation in the United States, called ''Horton Hatches the Egg'' a tale of [[investment]]. Freeman argued that "economic growth requires long-term investments", as embodied by Horton's sitting on the egg, and that "trust is important in a well-functioning economy", as embodied by Horton's repeated maxim, "I meant what I said,/ and I said what I meant."&lt;ref name=freeman&gt;{{cite book|title=Reconnecting to Work|year=2012|publisher=W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research|location=Kalamazoo, MI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=puUfUXz-N4oC&amp;pg=PR14 |author=Freeman, Richard B.|authorlink=What happened to shared prosperity and full employment and how to get them back: A Seussian perspective|editor=Applebaum, Lauren D.|pp=xiii&amp;ndash;xv|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alison Lurie]], in a 1990 article about Dr. Seuss from a feminist perspective, criticized ''Horton Hatches the Egg'' as a statement for fetal rights and for its negative treatment of Mayzie. Lurie pointed out the almost complete lack of strong female protagonists in Dr. Seuss books and argued that Mayzie, who is obviously an antagonist and is depicted as lazy and irresponsible, is "the most memorable female character in [Dr Seuss's] entire oeuvre".&lt;ref name="deans"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deans|first=Jill R.|title=Horton's Irony: Reading the Culture of Embryo Adoption|journal=Interdisciplinary Literary Studies|volume=2|issue=Fall 2000|pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel responded to Lurie's criticism, by way of his biographers near the end of his life, by remarking that most of his characters are animals, noting, "if she can identify their sex, I'll remember her in my will."&lt;ref name="Morgan 1995, p. 286"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nel-journal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nel|first=Philip|title=The Disneyfication of Dr. Seuss: Faithful to Profit, One Hundred Percent?|journal=Cultural Studies|volume=15|issue=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o7AvNW597DkC&amp;pg=PA596 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jill Deans, in a 2000 article, used the book in a discussion of adoption, surrogacy, and particularly, [[embryo donation]]. She noted that it is "a classic tale of surrogacy" and that it "evokes the intricacies of the [[Nature versus nurture|nature/nurture]] debate". She contends that the book celebrates adoptive parents and caregivers, in the form of Horton, but vilifies birth mothers, in the form of Mayzie.&lt;ref name=deans/&gt; Both Deans and [[Philip Nel]] point to the book's real-life implications for Geisel and his wife. Deans draws a connection between the elephant-bird in ''Horton'' and the Infantograph, a failed invention Geisel created that combined two photos and was meant to give couples an idea of what their children would look like. Nel, meanwhile, connected the book to the short story "Matilda the Elephant". Noting that the Geisels could not have children, Nel argued that "Matilda", and by extension ''Horton'', may have been manifestations of the Geisels' longing for children.&lt;ref&gt;Nel (2004), p. 113-115&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
The book was adapted into [[Horton Hatches the Egg (film)|a ten-minute animated short film]] by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]] and released in 1942 as part of [[Warner Bros.]]{{'}} ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blaise|first=Judd|title=Horton Hatches the Egg (1942)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/138097/Horton-Hatches-the-Egg/overview|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short was directed by [[Bob Clampett]] and marked the first time a Dr. Seuss work was adapted for the screen and also the only time a WB animated short was licensed to be based on pre-existing work still under copyright.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1966, [[Soyuzmultfilm]] released an 18-minute [[Russian language|Russian]] film adaptation called ''I Am Waiting for a Nestling''. It was directed by [[Nikolai Serebryakov]] and won the Silver Medal for Best Children's Film at [[Tours]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&amp;p=show_film&amp;fid=2207 I Am Waiting for a Nestling]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Random House released "Horton Hatches the Egg" in its series of Dr. Seuss videos, narrated by [[Billy Crystal]] and directed by [[Mark Reeder]]. "[[If I Ran the Circus]]" is second in the double feature video.&lt;ref&gt;''Dr. Seuss Horton Hatches the Egg/If I Ran the Circus'' [VHS] (1992) Random House Home Video&lt;/ref&gt;

Horton appeared again in ''[[Horton Hears a Who!|Horton Hears a Who]]'', published in 1954. The plot of the 2000 Broadway musical ''[[Seussical]]'', a retelling of a number of Dr. Seuss books, borrows heavily from both ''Horton'' books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seussical|url=http://www.broadwaymusicalhome.com/shows/seussical.htm|work=The Broadway Musical Home|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6314">The '''Kunstareal''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkʊnst.aʁeˌaːl|lang}}, "art district") is a [[museum]] quarter in the city centre of [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

== Area of arts ==
[[Image:Alte Pinakothek.JPG|thumb|290px|[[Alte Pinakothek]]]]
It consists of the three "Pinakotheken" galleries ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Neue Pinakothek]] and [[Pinakothek der Moderne]]), the [[Glyptothek]], the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] (both museums are specialized in Greek and Roman art), the [[Lenbachhaus]], the [[Museum Brandhorst]] (a private collection of modern art) and several galleries. Also the [[Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst]] (the state collection of Egypt art) was moved to the Kunstareal in 2013. The history of the museums in this area of Munich began in 1816 with the erection of the Glyptothek at [[Königsplatz, Munich|Königsplatz]] and was completed with the new building for the Egyptian Museum (2012) and the extension of the Lenbachhaus (2013). 

Close to the Pinakothek der Moderne the neo-classical ''Palais Dürckheim'' (constructed in 1842&amp;ndash;44) served at times as a building dedicated to bringing art closer to the visitors, while the adjoining ''[[Türkentor (Munich)|Türkentor]]'' (1826), the gate of a demolished royal caserne, is set to become a display window for temporary contemporary art. As of 2009 a general project plan is under discussion to ensure  the integration of the different museum buildings and to improve the access to the art district from the inner city.

The '''Alte Pinakothek's''' rather monolithic structure contains a treasure trove of the works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries. The collection reflects the eclectic tastes of the Wittelsbachs over four centuries, and is sorted by schools over two sprawling floors. Major displays include [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s Christ-like ''[[Self-Portrait (Dürer, Munich)|Self-Portrait]]'', his ''[[The Four Apostles]]'', [[Raphael]]'s paintings'' [[Canigiani Holy Family (Raphael)|The Canigiani Holy Family]]'' and'' [[Tempi Madonna (Raphael)|Madonna Tempi]]'' as well as [[Peter Paul Rubens]] self-portrait ''[[Honeysuckle Bower]]'' and his two-storey-high ''Judgment Day''. The gallery houses one of the world's most comprehensive Rubens collections. The ''[[Madonna of the Carnation]]'' is the only painting of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in a German gallery. 

The '''Neue Pinakothek''' is especially famous for its comprehensive collection of paintings of [[Impressionism]] from [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and many others.

The '''Pinakothek der Moderne''' unifies the ''Bavarian State Collection of Modern and Contemporary Arts'', the ''National Collection of Works on Paper'' and the ''Museum for Design and Applied Arts'' with the Munich Technical University's ''Museum of Architecture'' in one building and is deemed one of the most important and popular museums of modern art in Europe. It houses indeed the largest collection of industrial design. The Collection of Works on Paper ranges from masterpieces of Albrecht Dürer, [[Rembrandt]], [[Michelangelo]] and Leonardo da Vinci to Paul Cézanne, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Paul Klee]] and [[David Hockney]]. 
It is owned by the nearby '''[[Staatliche Graphische Sammlung München]]''', a world-renowned collection of 400,000 prints, engravings and drawings dating back to the Renaissance. The Collection of Modern Art keeps a large collection of paintings of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Max Beckmann]] and of the painters of [[Die Brücke]].

Before [[World War I]], the [[Der Blaue Reiter|Blaue Reiter]] group of artists worked in Munich. Many of their works can now be seen at the '''Lenbachhaus'''. 

[[Image:München - Pinakotheken (Luftbild).jpg|thumb|left|Pinakotheken in the Kunstareal]]
The modern '''Museum Brandhorst''' focus on the work of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Cy Twombly]].

An important collection of Greek and Roman art is held in the '''Glyptothek''' and the '''Staatliche Antikensammlung''' (State Antiquities Collection). King Ludwig I managed to acquire such famous pieces as the ''[[Medusa Rondanini]]'', the ''[[Barberini Faun]]'' and the ''figures from the [[Temple of Aphaea]]'' on [[Aegina]] for the Glyptothek. The internationally renowned collection of antique pottery is outstanding. The '''Museum für Abgüsse klassischer Bildwerke''' displays the world's most famous ancient Greek and Roman sculptures as plaster casts. 

The Kunstareal was further augmented by the completion of the '''Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst''' (Egyptian Museum). This museum displays exhibits from all periods of Ancient Egypt's history but also reliefs from Assyria and a lion from the [[Ishtar Gate]] of Babylon.

Nearby the Kunstareal are several natural scientific museums of the Bavarian state, like the ''[[Paläontologisches Museum München]]'', the ''[[Geologisches Museum München|Geological Museum]]'' and the ''Museum Reich der Kristalle'' as the public part of the "Mineralogische Staatssammlung Muenchen" (Bavarian State Collection for Mineralogy).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17192">'''[[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]], 1st  Duke of Bronté''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KB2}} (29 September 1758&amp;nbsp;– 21 October 1805) was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[flag officer]] in the [[Royal Navy]] famous for his participation in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], most notably in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], during which he was killed.  He was responsible for several famous victories that helped to secure British control of the seas, both securing Britain from French invasion and frustrating [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] imperial ambitions.  After his death during his defeat of the combined French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar, there was a public outpouring of grief.  Nelson was accorded a [[state funeral]] and was buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral]].  
[[File:Glasgow Green, Nelson Monument.jpg|thumb|The [[Nelson Monument, Glasgow|Nelson Monument]] on [[Glasgow Green]], erected in 1806, is claimed to be the first civic monument in Britain to Nelson's victories.]]

A number of '''monuments and memorials''' were constructed across the country to honour his memory.  The period of British dominance of the seas that his victories were considered to have ushered in led to a continued drive to create monuments in his name across the [[British Empire]].  These have taken many forms.

==Sited in the UK==
[[File:Lord Nelson, Nelson's Column.JPG|thumb|left|Lord Nelson atop [[Nelson's Column]] in [[Trafalgar Square]].]]
The monumental [[Nelson's Column]] (built in 1840s) and the surrounding [[Trafalgar Square]] are notable locations in [[London]] to this day, and Nelson's funerary monument can be found in the south transept of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. There are three great collections of items that belonged to him, or were made to commemorate him that are still visible today: at the [[Royal Naval Museum]] in [[HMNB Portsmouth]], at the [[National Maritime Museum]] at [[Greenwich]] and in the [[Lloyd's building]] in the heart of London. Also at Portsmouth, Nelson's [[flagship]] at Trafalgar, {{HMS|Victory}} is preserved; on the [[quarterdeck]], a small [[brass]] plaque with the inscription "Here Nelson fell 21st Oct 1805" records the place where Nelson was shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hms-victory.com/things-to-see/quarter-deck |title=HMS Victory - Things To See - The Quarter Deck |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.hms-victory.com |publisher=National Museum of the Royal Navy |access-date=8 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first large monument to Nelson was the {{convert|43.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall [[Nelson Monument, Glasgow|Nelson Monument]] on [[Glasgow Green]] erected less than a year after his death in 1806. The [[Nelson Monument, Edinburgh|Nelson Monument in Edinburgh]] was later constructed atop [[Calton Hill, Edinburgh|Calton Hill]] in [[Edinburgh]] between 1807 and 1816. The first monument in the [[British Empire]] to be funded by popular subscription was [[Nelson's Column, Montreal]], on August 17, 1809. In October 1809, the first monument to be funded by public subscription in Great Britain was erected in Birmingham. [[Statue of Horatio Nelson, Birmingham|The statue of Nelson in Birmingham]] was the first to be erected in Nelson's honour in Great Britain. It was sculpted by [[Richard Westmacott]] and is currently a [[Grade II* listed building]]. Westmacott also sculpted memorials in [[Liverpool]], which is also Grade II*, and [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]]. The [[Nelson Monument, Liverpool|Liverpool monument]] is a depiction of a goddess handing a naked Nelson the crowns of victory while a sinister, skeletal figure of [[Death (personification)|Death]] clutches at his breast. Four despondent French prisoners-in-chains sit at the base.  
[[File:Nelson Monument, Liverpool.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Nelson Monument, Liverpool|Nelson Monument]] in [[Liverpool]].]]

The officers and men who fought at Trafalgar erected [[The Nelson Monument, Portsdown Hill|a memorial column]] to the north of Portsmouth atop [[Portsdown Hill]].  The {{convert|36.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high obelisk features the inscription "Consecrated to the memory of Viscount Lord Nelson. By the zealous attachment of all those who fought at Trafalgar to perpetuate his triumph and their regret 1805. Foundation stone laid July 1807".

The {{convert|44|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall [[Britannia Monument|columnar Monument in Great Yarmouth]] to Nelson was started before his death but only completed in 1819. Properly called the Norfolk Naval Pillar, it is generally known as the "[[Britannia]] Monument" as it is topped by the martial female personification of the UK rather than a statue of Nelson; a statue of Nelson is, however, in the grounds of [[Norwich Cathedral]] alongside the other Napoleonic hero, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], near [[Norwich School (independent school)|the school]] he attended. Another columnar monument is situated on Castle Geen, [[Hereford]]. Nelson was made a freeman of the city in 1802, and he reportedly spent a lot of time at [[Ross-on-Wye]]. The column was erected in 1809, four years after Nelson's death, but has no statue at the top as there wasn't enough money left to commission one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/herefordandworcester/content/articles/2005/10/18/nelsons_column_feature.shtml |title=Why Nelson has a column in Hereford |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2005-10-18 |accessdate=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most unusual monuments was constructed on Salisbury Plain, within cannon shot of Stonehenge, on land then owned by the Marquess of Queensberry. The monument consists of a series of clumps of trees in otherwise arable farmland. Known as the [[Nile Clumps]] they have been arranged to represent the positioning of French and British ships at the [[Battle of the Nile]], considered as Nelson's greatest tactical victory. Some clumps still survive, and work is underway to replant some of those that have "sunk". They stand on land owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], forming part of the [[Stonehenge Landscape]] estate.

There is also a memorial to Nelson on the banks of the [[Menai Strait]] in [[North Wales]]. This memorial stands at an out-of-the-way site on the shore below Plas Llanfair, in [[Llanfairpwll]] on the [[Anglesey]] shore. It was created by Admiral [[Lord Clarence Paget]], who lived in the mansion and who was an enthusiastic amateur sculptor. The monument is made of stone, inscribed with the words "Nelson" on the base of the statue. The words "Fell at Trafalgar 1805" are ingraved in slate on the west side of the plinth and repeated in welsh on the east side. On the south side is a slate engraved with "England expects that every man will do his duty". The view from this position is of the Menai Strait, which Nelson was reputed to have described as "''one of the most treacherous stretches of sea in the world.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anglesey.gov.uk/doc.asp?cat=2012 |title=Lord Nelson Memorial, Anglesey |publisher=Discover Anglesey's Heritage | date=2006-01-03 |accessdate=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [[Nelson Memorial, Swarland|Nelson memorial]] in [[Swarland]], [[Northumberland]] which was raised as a private memorial of Nelson by his friend and sometime agent, Alexander Davison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/memorials/Memorial.cfm?Banner=3&amp;MemorialPage=3&amp;MemorialID=M4322 |title=Maritime Memorials List ,M4322 |publisher=National Maritime Museum|accessdate=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson also planted trees just to the west of the obelisk to represent the coastline of the Nile Delta and some of the ships that took part in the Battle of the Nile.

A small memorial to Nelson is located in the small [[County Antrim]] town of [[Dervock]], [[Northern Ireland]]. In the Allen Memorial Hall belonging to St Coleman’s Church of Ireland, a large stained glass triptych depicts the moment on the poop deck of the Victory when Nelson ordered the flying of the ‘England Expects’ signal just before the Battle of Trafalgar. The connection with Dervock is seen in the panel portraying the red-jacketed Captain William Adair, from Ballymena, in County Antrim, the commander of the marine force on the Victory, who was to die alongside Nelson. A smaller window in the hall shows the Victory locked in conflict with the French ship Redoubtable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dublin’s Fallen Hero:The Long Life and Sudden Death of Nelson’s Pillar (1809-1966) {{ISBN|978-0957256415}},  by [[Dennis Campbell Kennedy|Dennis Kennedy]].

Although his country house at Merton no longer exists and his estate was broken up and built over, Nelson's association with the area is commemorated in the names of a number of local roads, a trading estate on part of his former lands and Nelson Hospital in [[Merton Park]]. Nelson's [[funerary hatchment]] is displayed at St. Mary's Church of England, also in Merton Park, London SW19. 
[[File:Birchen Edge - Nelsons Monument.jpg|thumb|right|Nelson's Monument on [[Birchen Edge]] in [[Derbyshire]] dates from 1810.]]
There is a Nelson's Monument on [[Birchen Edge]], in the [[Peak District]] national park in [[Derbyshire]]. The monument itself consists of a 3 metre tall [[gritstone]] obelisk, surmounted by a ball 30 cm in diameter. The column is inscribed with the date of Nelson's death and some other letters which may be later [[graffiti]]. A modern metal plaque shows that the monument was restored in 1992 by the [[1805 Club]] and the [[Peak District National Park]]. Three nearby gritstone outcrops, known as the "Three Ships" because of their slight resemblance to ships' prows, are inscribed ''VICTORY'', ''[[HMS Defiance (1783)|DEFIANCE]]'' and ''[[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|ROYAL SOVERIN]]'' (''[[sic]]''), named after British warships at Trafalgar. The monument was created in 1810 and is thought to have been funded by John Brightman from the local village of [[Baslow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://derbyshirewarmemorials.com/ddales/57257/57257.html |title=Adm Lord Nelson - Nelson's Monument |last=Branson |first=Roy |date= |website=derbyshirewarmemorials.com |publisher=Derbyshire War Memorials |access-date=8 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, in honour of Nelson, The [[Admiral Lord Nelson School]] was built in Portsmouth. The school has established and maintains strong links with the [[Royal Navy]] and was involved in the [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]] commemoration of the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].

There are a hundred and ninety-nine street names in the U.K. today that refer to Nelson's final and possibly greatest victory, Trafalgar.&lt;ref&gt;U.K. Streetmap&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 survey of British [[pub names]] found seventy-eight [[pub]]s called "Lord Nelson", thirty-one called "Nelson", five called "Admiral Nelson" and five "Nelson's"; in addition, sixteen pubs were named "Trafalgar" and thirty-two "Victory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=14 April 2011 |title=A thousand rather popular pubs...

Throughout October, [[Trafalgar Night]] dinners are held in Royal Navy ships and establishments. After the Loyal Toast, there is always a toast drunk to Nelson's "Immortal Memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Nelson Encyclopaedia |last=White |first=Colin |year=2002 |publisher=Chatham Publishing, Lionel Leventhal Limited |location=Park House, Russell Gardens, London |isbn=1-86176-253-4 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several places overseas have been named after Nelson. The city of [[Nelson, New Zealand]] bears his name as well as [[Nelson Island (British Columbia)|Nelson Island]] on the [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia]], Canada. There is also [[Nelson's Island]], in [[Abu Qir Bay|Aboukir Bay]], the site of Nelson's victory at the [[Battle of the Nile]].

Two pillars were erected to Nelson in cities in [[Montreal]] and [[Dublin]], both by public subscription in the second half of 1809. [[Nelson's Pillar]] in Dublin survived controversy and rebellion and Ireland’s exit from the United Kingdom in 1922, but it was destroyed by a bomb planted by former [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] men in 1966, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Nelson's Column, Montreal]] is located in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] (where Nelson had reportedly fallen in love with a young woman). The monument was begun in 1808 and erected in 1809. It is located in [[Place Jacques-Cartier]], which was a marketplace at the time. As the Dublin monument is no longer extant it is the oldest surviving monument to Nelson. Subscribers for the monument included both English and French, since the [[French Revolution]] was popular with neither. The monument is located in [[Old Montreal]] (''Vieux Montréal''). It has carved scenes from Nelson's career around the base and the statue on top was claimed to be the oldest public statue of Nelson in the world. It was removed due to excessive weathering and has been placed in the Montreal History Centre. A copy now stands atop the column in its place.

A small monument was erected to Nelson in [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]]. It is claimed that it was erected within four days of the news of the admiral’s death reaching London on 6 November 1805. The monument consisted of a large rough stone arch on a hilltop near [[Castletownshend]]. It was destroyed 150 years later by Irish republicans. This Nelson Arch, as it was known, was the work of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson RN, then commander of the [[Sea Fencibles]] based in Castletownshend. One of the few surviving images of the arch dates from 1896. It is a photograph reproduced in the Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, and shows the arch largely intact, but with vegetation sprouting from it. The first mention of politically motivated damage to the arch comes in 1920, when according to some accounts it was ‘destroyed’ during the War of Independence, and re-erected two years later. It was again attacked in 1966, this time so seriously that the Townshend family, who whose land it stood, could do little more than erect a much smaller version from the wreckage. That in turn was demolished in 1976.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dublin’s Fallen Hero:The Long Life and Sudden Death of Nelson’s Pillar (1809-1966) {{ISBN|978-0957256415}}, by [[Dennis Campbell Kennedy|Dennis Kennedy]].  Ormeau Books, Belfast 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the island of Nevis, West Indies, where Nelson met and married [[Frances Nisbet]], there are two place names: Nelson's Spring and Nelson's Lookout.

On the island of [[Antigua]], West Indies, there is a house at [[Nelson's Dockyard]] that is historically taught to be Nelson's house while he was stationed in the Caribbean.

On 28 October 2005, a statue of Nelson was unveiled in [[Gibraltar]] 200 years after Nelson's death.

In 1813,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barbados.gov.bb/placesofInterest.htm |title=Places of Interest |publisher=Government of Barbados |accessdate=26 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113144604/http://www.barbados.gov.bb/placesofInterest.htm |archivedate=13 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a statue (pictured) was erected in [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]], in what was known as Trafalgar Square, (now renamed [[National Heroes' Square]]) in recognition of Nelson's bravery and as a tribute to his honour within the British Empire. This statue was sculpted from bronze by Sir [[Richard Westmacott]] and is considered by many as an exact likeness to the man himself. This statue was erected some 27 years before another one of the same likeness was erected in London.

'''Opera Europa''' is the international service organisation for professional opera companies and opera festivals in Europe. It is incorporated in Brussels as a not-for-profit organisation.

With roots going back to 1995, Opera Europa gained its present format and name in 2002, on the merger of the European Opera Network and the Eurolyrica associations.&lt;ref name=oehist&gt;Opera Europa website. [http://opera-europa.org/view.asp?id=340 The beginnings of Opera Europa: a short chronicle]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823191438/http://opera-europa.org/view.asp?id=340 |date=August 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had 160 member companies in 40 different countries as at May 2016.&lt;ref name=oemem&gt;Opera Europa website. [http://opera-europa.org/en/members Members list]. Retrieved 3 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
For the benefit of its member companies, it runs forums, databases, a quarterly newsletter, and twice-yearly conferences, and offers reciprocal membership benefits with [[Opera America]].&lt;ref name=oeabout&gt;Opera Europa website. [http://opera-europa.org/en/about-us/intro-to-oe About Us pages]&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Opera Days===
Opera Europa co-ordinates the annual European Opera Days when opera companies across Europe open their doors to the general public, with opera house tours, open rehearsals, talks and special events (both in and outside the conventional spaces).  The first European Opera Days were held in 2007, and since then have taken place each year on the weekend closest to the EU's [[Europe Day]], 9 May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://operadays.eu European Opera Days website] Retrieved 13 Aug 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Opera Platform===
Opera Europa is the lead partner behind The Opera Platform, a service launched in May 2015 to offer free live streams of operas via the web.  The three-year project to stream one free production every month received half of its 3.9 million euro budget from the European Union's [[Creative Europe]] programme, the other half coming from the 15 opera companies providing the content.  The Franco-German TV network [[Arte]] is providing the technological platform.&lt;ref name=nyttop&gt;{{Citation

The Opera Platform won the Accessibility category in the 2016 edition of the [[International Opera Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operaawards.org/archive/2016/ 2016 winners], International Opera Awards. Retrieved 22 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Opera-directing Prize (EOP)===
In collaboration with the [[Camerata Nuova e.V.]] in [[Wiesbaden]], Opera Europa supports a biennial competition, the European Opera-directing Prize (EOP, in German: Europäischen Opernregie-Preis) for young opera directors and design teams up to the age of 35.  Competition is fierce with more than 200 teams applying in 2009.&lt;ref name=eop&gt;Camerata Nuova website. [http://www.camerata-nuova.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=13 Was ist der EOP?] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The winning team receive prize money of 35,000 euros, but perhaps more importantly have their production mounted by a European opera company, receiving mentoring and support for this process.&lt;ref name=eopen&gt;Camerata Nuova website.[http://www.camerata-nuova.com/european-opera-directing-prize-eop/ Overview in English]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4652">'''Penguin Composition Rules''' were the guidelines written by typographer [[Jan Tschichold]] for use in composing the pages and typography of [[Penguin Books]]. The rules were embodied in a four-page booklet of typographic instructions for editors and compositors. The booklet includes headings for various aspects of composition: Text Composition; Indenting of Paragraphs; Punctuation Marks and Spelling; Capitals, Small Capitals, and Italics; References and Footnotes; Folios; The Printing of Plays; The Printing of Poetry; Make-up.

Beyond this specific set of guidelines, Tschichold made further changes to Penguin's graphic standards. Penguin is well known for its standardized book covers and formats, as well as the diversity of the standards.&lt;ref&gt;The seeming contradiction between standardization and diversity is explained by the vast numbers of books produced by Penguin over many years.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jan Tschichold and Penguin==
Penguin Books was founded by Allen Lane in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152710/http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic look of Penguin was established before Lane brought Tschichold to Penguin in the late 1940s as head of typography and production. Tschichold was in England at Penguin between 1947 and 1949 before returning to Switzerland.

Tschichold's standardization of Penguin covers essentially took existing elements and refined them visually and refined their arrangement. Under Tschichold the covers included the use of [[Eric Gill|Eric Gill's]] [[Gill Sans]] typeface, which he was careful to have spaced evenly. According to Tschichold establishing this quality was not immediately embraced by the compositors; “Every day I had to wade through miles of corrections (often ten books daily). I had a rubber stamp made: ‘Equalize letter-spaces according to their visual value.’ It was totally ignored; the hand compositors continued to space out the capitals on title-pages (where optical spacing is essential) with spaces of equal thickness.”&lt;ref name="doubleday"&gt;Richard Doubleday, "[http://www.dis.uia.mx/conference/2005/HTMs-PDFs/PenguinBooks.pdf Jan Tschichold at Penguin Books: A Resurgance [sic&amp;#93; of Classical Book Design]" (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Gill Sans, Tschichold made use of Monotype [[Bembo]], Monotype [[Centaur (typeface)|Centaur]] (by [[Bruce Rogers (typographer)|Bruce Rogers]]) and Gill's [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]] typeface.&lt;ref name="doubleday" /&gt;

The covers conformed to the golden ratio (4⅜" × 7⅛", 111mm × 181mm). For Penguin's distinctive orange color, Tschichold replaced it with a warmer tone.&lt;ref name="doubleday" /&gt;

'''Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät''' ('''PKN''', {{Langnf||Finnish|"Pertti Kurikka's [[name day]]s"}}) were a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[punk rock]] band, formed in 2009 in a charity workshop for adults with [[developmental disabilities]]. They are the main focus of the Finnish documentary film ''[[The Punk Syndrome]]''. In 2015, they qualified for the finals of [[Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu 2015|Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu]], which they later won; they represented Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 but got knocked out in the semi-final. The band disbanded in December 2016 when guitarist Pertti Kurikka turned 60 years old and retired from playing punk rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000005022200.html|title=Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivien viimeisellä keikalla Tapaninpäivänä oli hikistä, ahdasta ja tunteikasta eli aivan mahtavaa|date=27 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2017|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Formation (2004-2012)===
Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät began in a workshop run by Lyhty, a charity for adults with developmental disabilities. In 2004, Pertti Kurikka, the future guitarist of the band, met organizer Kalle Pajamaa of Lyhty.&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"&gt;{{cite web| title = Never mind the mall punks, here’s Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät!| author = Arttu Tolonen| work =Finnish Music Quarterly |date=June 2013| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://www.fmq.fi/2013/06/never-mind-the-mall-punks-heres-pertti-kurikan-nimipaivat/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pajamaa, who remains manager of the band today, noticed Kurikka's potential and sought to establish a band based upon him.&lt;ref name="Nyt2015a"&gt;{{cite web| title = Nytpedia: Tällainen yhtye on Pertti Kurikan nimipäivät|trans-title=Nytpedia: This is what the band Pertti Kurikan nimipäivät is like| work =Nyt| date = 2 March 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://nyt.fi/a1305932608636| language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked on the band's formation over the next five years,&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"/&gt; and in 2009 the band made its debut.&lt;ref name="Nyt2015a"/&gt;

In 2009, Finnish director [[Pekka Karjalainen]] sought music performed by people with disabilities for the film ''[[Vähän kunnioitusta]]'',&lt;ref name="Nyt2015b"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Story of PKN, the Finnish punk sensation ready to rock Eurovision| work = Nyt| date = 3 March 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://nyt.fi/a1305933792584}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tells the story of a young girl with a [[learning disability]] aspiring to live an independent and normal life.&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"/&gt; Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät is featured in the film with their first-ever [[Demo (music)|demo]]: "Kallioon!".&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mäenpää2015"&gt;{{cite web| title = Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät osallistuu Uuden Musiikin Kilpailuun| author = Arto Mäenpää| work =KaaosZine| date = 13 January 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://kaaoszine.fi/pertti-kurikan-nimipaivat-osallistuu-uuden-musiikin-kilpailuun/|trans-title=Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät takes part in Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song became a hit, and the band soon discovered that they had a following outside the circle of disabled people.&lt;ref name="Nyt2015b"/&gt;

In 2012, their fame grew as they were the main subject of ''[[The Punk Syndrome]]'', a Finnish documentary film. The documentary, depicting the band's story from its outset to their first European tour, earned them a following in Scandinavia and Germany.&lt;ref name="Hay2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hay|first1=Mark|title=A Finnish Punk Band with Learning Disabilities Is Going to Eurovision|url=https://www.vice.com/read/a-finnish-punk-band-with-learning-disabilities-is-going-to-eurovision-189|website=VICE|accessdate=4 March 2015|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014: Charity concert with Mr. Lordi===
In 2014, the band performed in a charity concert with [[Mr. Lordi]] of the Finnish rock band, [[Lordi]]. The charity concert was held in Rovaniemi on 23 May 2014 for benefit of the mentally-disabled community of [[Mozambique]] and the Lapland Metkat Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvtl.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/lisaa-ajankohtaisia/?nid=1173 |title=Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät point Mr. Lordi May Rovaniemi|publisher=Kvtl.fi |date=2014-02-28 |accessdate=2015-02-18 |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät's bold and unusual take on Eurovision has been compared to that of Lordi, [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006|Finland's 2006 Eurovision entry]] and the winner of [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|that year's contest]].&lt;ref name="Sputnik2015"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Punk Syndrome: Band With Down Syndrome Applies for Eurovision| work = [[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]]| date = 21 January 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://sputniknews.com/society/20150119/1017088930.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015: Eurovision Song Contest 2015===

==Authenticity==
For more than 100 years, it was attributed to the "School of [[Frans Pourbus the Younger|Porbus]]".&lt;ref name=bell/&gt; It was not attributed to Rubens until after World War II.&lt;ref name=christies /&gt;&lt;ref name=bell/&gt; According to [[Brian Sewell]], it is an "uncomfortable Rubens" and the attribution "doesn't quite ring true".&lt;ref name=bell/&gt; A panel of academics employed by Christie's examined the portrait and ultimately concluded that the painting is a genuine Rubens.&lt;ref name=christies/&gt;

The '''Sheffield Repertory Theatre''' was a [[theatre company]] in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]].

Herbert Prince, a railway clerk, founded the amateur dramatics society in 1919,&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;Frank Long "Sheffield" in Colin Chambers ''Twentieth Century Theatre'', London: Continuum, 2002, p.687&lt;/ref&gt; a first meeting is recorded at the Oxford Street Settlement in Shipton Street that year, which became the Sheffield Repertory Theatre in 1923. A meeting in October 1923 formed an Executive Committee for a professional Company, consisting of Wilfred Vickers, W.C. Landon, C.V. McNally, A. Ballard, H.W. d. Harkcom and [[Herbert M. Prentice]]. The subscription was 3 [[shilling]]s and [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]].

At the first Annual Meeting in January 1924, the aims were formulated:
#To promote and encourage interest in the Drama and kindred Arts.
#To produce Plays
#To arrange lectures, recitals, play-readings and discussions
#To promote social intercourse amongst the members
#To form a library of dramatuc literature for the use of members
#The establishment of a permanent Repertory Theatre in Sheffield

Their first performances took place at the Little Theatre in Shipton Street. Later the Company hired the South Street Schoolroom in Eldon Street. In 1928 the Company gained a permanent venue,&lt;ref name="Long"/&gt; and moved to the former Temperance Hall, in Townhead Street. The seating of this new Repertory Theatre was 319 in the saloon (Stalls) and 222 in the Balcony.

With the outbreak of war in 1939, the theatre was closed, along with nearly all British theatres by a government fearful of German bombing and consequent mass loss of life in such public buildings. This closure led to a most bizarre period. In order to resolve the financial crisis the Company arranged to reform in Southport, a de-restricted area, and carry on the business there. Despite the government allowing the theatre in Sheffield to re-open by 1940, a binding contract had already been signed in Southport. It thus proved impractical to operate in both towns and the decision was taken that the Company should remain in Southport. Over 240 productions took place in the [[Lancashire]] resort by a Yorkshire repertory during the war. The building in Townhead Street was eventually hired out for storage.

At the end of the war, the Company was able to return to its natural home, although it owed a debt to Southport for its survival. The theatre was in a dishevelled condition, following its utilitarian usage during the war, but the Company, helped by willing volunteers successfully renovated the auditorium in 1945, allowing it to re-open to the theatre-going public, with the appropriately titled play, ''The Peaceful Inn''.

By 1951, the theatre was a cultural and financial success. Most patrons bought season tickets, and so would attend every new performance. Sheffield was one of the few regional theatres to adopt a fortnightly cycle of plays. This was generally accepted to provide a much higher quality of performance; most repertory changed weekly. Plays running the gamut from Shakespeare to interpretations of the latest 'West End Smash' would alternate throughout the year. The festive season saw not a '[[Pantomime|Panto]]' but a play designed to appeal to children, that would nonetheless cultivate their minds.

By 1953 the theatre was struggling to cope with its success. The building failed to meet increasing health and safety demands. The management took the decision to completely rebuild it. Stripped back to its bare walls, the interior was entirely renewed as a sleek 'Fifties' auditorium replaced the stippled decor of the out-dated theatre. The Company had become so successful in the ensuing eight years since the war, that £20,000 could be invested in the internal rebuild of the premises.

In March 1954, the theatre re-opened and its success continued unabated, under the leadership of Geoffrey Ost, who had been the director since 1938, a service broken only by his wartime call-up. In 1959 Ost was awarded an honorary Doctorate at the University (a Scholarship still exists under his name). The future acting stars who were members of the Company include [[Peter Sallis]], [[Patrick McGoohan]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Paul Eddington]], [[Keith Barron]] and Sir [[Nigel Hawthorne]]. Actors such as Sir [[Alec Guinness]] and [[Patrick Macnee]] also performed in individually contracted productions and Sir [[Donald Wolfit]] was an assistant stage manager there. However Sheffield Rep. was really all about the local community - it only survived and prospered because many local people gave their labour and support on a voluntary or semi-professional basis, although plenty of local paid work was also provided.

The company was identified as a significant repertory company in the UK by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] during the 1960s, and a trust was formed to oversee the construction of a new building.&lt;ref name="Hartnoll"&gt;Phyllis Hartnoll (ed) ''The Oxford Companion to the Theatre'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Crucible Theatre]] replaced the old theatre in 1971 financed by the Arts Council, Sheffield City Council and public donations.&lt;ref name="Hartnoll"/&gt; Geoffrey Ost was still there, noted as 'General Advisor'.

==Plot==
Hari Prasad ([[Sarvadaman Banerjee]]), a blind [[flutist]] lives along with his younger sister in a village near [[Jaipur]], which was also a tourist attraction. Though he lacks knowledge of classical music, he plays flute beautifully and makes a living by playing it to tourists. One day, guide Jyothirmai ([[Moon Moon Sen]]) comes there along with a bunch of tourists and listens to his flute. She understands his talent and helps him understand nature and to become a famous flutist. Years pass and Hari Prasad becomes Pandit Hari Prasad. Unknown to her, Hari Prasad admires her very much and dedicates all his albums to her. Meanwhile, a mute painter Subhashini ([[Suhasini]]) who meets him in his village, falls for him.

Subhashini expresses her feelings through her paintings and gradually her brother understands her feelings regarding Hari Prasad. He approaches Hari Prasad's uncle with a marriage proposal. But at the same time Hari Prasad reveals his admiration for Jyothirmai. This shocks Jyothirmai as she previously worked as an escort to rich tourists. She tries to hint Hari Prasad about her not so decent past, but is overwhelmed by his pure love and disregard for her external characters. Though she herself admires him, she feels that she would taint him with her impure past. She tells Hari Prasad that she couldn't marry him as she already engaged to a doctor. Hari Prasad takes it well as he always wanted Jyothirmai to be happy.

On the wedding day, Jyothirmai commits suicide and requests in her last note that her eyes should be donated to Hari Prasad. She also requests that her funeral procession should appear like a marriage procession and her death should be hidden from Hari Prasad. Everyone tries to act normal and sends her as they are sending a bride to her in-laws. Hari Prasad keeps calm all the time and at last goes to the graveyard to say his final goodbyes to Jyothirmai. He tells shocked Subhashini that it's impossible to hide the death of his angel from him. The film ends with Hari Prasad and Subhashini mourning silently in the graveyard.

==Music==
''Sirivennela'' abounds in classical music composed by [[K. V. Mahadevan]] with flute renditions by the renowned [[flautist]] [[Hariprasad Chaurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;listing-index.ebay.com/movies/Sirivennela.html&lt;/ref&gt; The movie saw the debut of [[Sirivennela Sitaramasastri]] as a [[lyricist]], who wrote all of the songs. Because of "the wonderful songs," rich in meaning, he penned for the movie, Sitarama Sastry has taken the name Sirivennela. Each of the songs is remembered to this day.

The song "Vidhata Thalapuna", sung by [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam]] and [[P. Susheela]], is about [[Om|Aum]], the most sacred syllable in Hinduism, from which the [[Vedas|Veda]] traditions originated. Other notable songs include "Adibhikshuvu Vadinedi Koredhi" and "Ee gali Ee Nela."

'''Solid perfumes''' or cream perfumes are [[perfume]]s in solid state rather than the liquid mix of alcohol ([[ethanol]]) and water used in [[eau de parfum]], [[eau de toilette]], [[eau de cologne]], etc.  Normally the substance that gives the cream its base comes from a type of [[wax]] that is initially melted. Once melted, a [[scent]] or several scents may be added.  

Solid perfume is used either by rubbing a finger or dipping a [[cotton swab]] against it and then onto the skin. Sometimes solid perfume can take more time for the [[deeper note]]s to come out than a [[spray (liquid drop)|spray]] perfume.

The latest solid perfumes are designed as handbag aromas, so a compact way of making perfume more portable.

Historically, [[ointment]]-like [[unguents]] have been used as a type of solid perfume since [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://egyptmonth.com/mag08012000/mag4.htm Perfumes of Ancient Egypt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012170326/http://egyptmonth.com/mag08012000/mag4.htm |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Standpoint theory''' is a theory for analyzing [[inter-subjective]] [[discourse]]s. This body of work concerns the ways that authority is rooted in individuals' knowledge (their [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s), and the power that such authority exerts.

Standpoint theory's most important concept is that an individual's own perspectives are shaped by his or her social and political experiences. Standpoints are multifaceted rather than essentializing: while  Hispanic women may generally share some perspectives, particularly with regard to ethnicity or sex, they are not defined solely by their participation in these categories. The amalgamation of a person's many experienced dimensions form a standpoint—a [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]—through which that individual sees and understands the world.

Standpoint theorists emphasize the utility of a naturalistic''',''' or everyday experiential, concept of knowing (i.e., [[epistemology]]).  One's standpoint (whether reflexively considered or not)  shapes which concepts are intelligible, which claims are heard and understood by whom, which features of the world are perceptually salient, which reasons are understood to be relevant and forceful, and which conclusions credible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sprague|first=Joey|title=The standpoint of art/criticism|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=13&amp;sid=e26ca1ca-8c19-4976-ad8a-7d7af38f55a0%40sessionmgr15&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=66905263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standpoint theory supports what feminist theorist [[Sandra Harding]] calls [[strong objectivity]], or the notion that the perspectives of [[marginalized]] and/or oppressed individuals can help to create more objective accounts of the world. Through the outsider-within phenomenon, these individuals are placed in a unique position to point to patterns of behavior that those immersed in the dominant group culture are unable to recognize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Brenda J.|title=Feminist Standpoint Theory: a Black Woman's Review of Organizational Socialization|journal=Communication Studies|year=1996|volume=47|issue=4|pages=257–271|doi=10.1080/10510979609368482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standpoint theory gives voice to the marginalized groups by allowing them to challenge the status quo as the outsider within. The status quo representing the dominant white male position of privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buzzanell|first=Patrice M.|title=A Feminist Standpoint Analysis of Maternity and Maternity Leave for Women with Disabilities|journal=Women and Language|year=2003|volume=26|issue=2|pages=53–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant culture in which all groups exist is not experienced in the same way by all persons or groups. The views of those who belong to groups with more social power are validated more than those in marginalized groups. Those in marginalized groups must learn to be [[bicultural]], or to "pass" in the [[dominant culture]] to survive, even though that perspective is not their own.&lt;ref name="DeFranciscoVictoria"&gt;DeFrancisco, Victoria P. ''Communicating Gender Diversity: A Critical Approach''. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, INC., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original inspirations for standpoint theory can be seen in the works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], a [[German idealism|German idealist]] philosopher, who studied the different standpoints between slaves and masters in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J.T. (2008). Critical feminist theories. In L.A. Baxter &amp; D.O. Braithwaite (Eds.), Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives (pp. 323-334). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the master-slave relationship is about people's belonging positions, and the groups affect how people receive knowledge and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Em|title=A First Look at COMMUNICATION THEORY: Standpoint Theory|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|pages=441–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] also discussed how the position of a worker shapes his or her knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} From these two scholars' studies, Nancy Hartsock examined standpoint theory by using relations between men and women. She published "The Feminist Standpoint: Developing Ground for a Specifically Feminist Historical Materialism" in 1983. Hartsock used Hegel's ideas of masters and slaves and Marx's ideas of class and [[capitalism]] as an inspiration to look into matters of sex and gender.

Contemporary standpoint theory often focuses on the social positions such as gender, [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], class, [[culture]], and economic status.&lt;ref&gt;Wallance, R. A., and A. Wolf (1995). ''Contemporary Sociological Theory: Continuing the classical tradition''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Standpoint theory seeks to develop a particular [[feminist epistemology]], that values the experiences of women and minorities as a source for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;McCann and Kim, ''Feminist Theory Reader: Local and global perspectives'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Prominent standpoint theorists include [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]], [[Nancy Hartsock]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Sandra Harding]], [[Alison Wylie]], Lynette Hunter and [[Patricia Hill Collins]].

==Key concepts==
Generally, standpoint theory gives insight into specific circumstances only available to the members of a certain collective standpoint. According to Michael Ryan, "the idea of a collective standpoint does not imply an essential overarching characteristic but rather a sense of belonging to a group bounded by a shared experience."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Social Theory'', 789.&lt;/ref&gt;. Kristina Rolin states that "the assumption of essentialism is that all women share the same socially grounded perspective in virtue of being women, the assumption of automatic epistemic privilege is that epistemic advantage accrues to the subordinate automatically, just in virtue of their occupying a particular social position."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rolin|first=Kristina|date=2009|title=Standpoint Theory as a Methodology for the Study of Power Relations|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20618192|journal=Hypatia|volume=24|issue=4|pages=218–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to this approach:
* A standpoint is a place from which [[human beings]] view the [[world]].
* A standpoint influences how the people adopting it [[social construct|socially construct]] the world.
* A standpoint is a mental position from which things are viewed.
* A standpoint is a position from which objects or principles are viewed and according to which they are compared and judged.
* The inequalities of different social groups create differences in their standpoints.
* All standpoints are partial; so (for example) [[Standpoint feminism]] coexists with other standpoints.

==Applications==

Since standpoint theory focuses on marginalized populations, it is often applied within fields that focus on these populations. Standpoint has been referenced as a concept that should be acknowledged and understood in the [[Social Work]] field, especially when approaching and assisting clients.&lt;ref&gt;Swigonski, M. E. (1993). "Feminist Standpoint Theory and the Questions of Social Work Research". ''Affilia'', 8(2), 171–183.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many marginalized populations rely on the welfare system to survive.  Unfortunately, those who structure the welfare system typically have never needed to utilize its services before.  Standpoint theory has been presented as a method to improving the [[welfare]] system by recognizing suggestions made by those within the welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edmonds-Cady | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = Getting to the grassroots: Feminist standpoints within the welfare movement | url = | journal = Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 11–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Africa, standpoint theory has catalyzed a social movement where women are introduced to the radio in order to promote awareness of their experiences and hardships and to help these women heal and find closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gatua | first1 = M. W. | last2 = Patton | first2 = T. O. | last3 = Brown | first3 = M. R. | year = 2010 | title = Giving voice to invisible women: "FIRE" as model of a successful women's community radio in Africa | url = | journal = Howard Journal of Communications | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 164–181 | doi=10.1080/10646171003727441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example dealing with Africa is slavery and how slavery differed greatly depending on if one was the slave or the master. If there were any power relationships there could never be a single perspective. No viewpoint could ever be complete, and there is no limit to anyone's perspective.

Asante and Davis’s (1989) study of interracial encounters in the workplace found that because of different cultural perspectives, approaching organizational interactions with others with different beliefs, assumptions, and meanings often leads to miscommunication. Brenda Allen stated in her research that, "Organizational members' experiences, attitudes, and behaviors in the workplace are often influenced by race-ethnicity"&lt;ref&gt;Allen, B. J. (1995). "'Diversity' and organizational communication". ''Journal of Applied Communication Research'', 23, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Adler and John Jermier suggest that management scholars should be aware of their standpoints. They write that those studying management should "consciously choose [their] standpoints and take responsibility for the impact (or lack of impact) of [their] scholarship on the world"&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Paul, and John Jermier. 2005. "Developing a field with more soul: Standpoint theory and public policy research for management scholars". ''The Academy of Management Journal'' 48 (6): 942.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Jermier argued that all parts of a research study- identifying the problem, theorizing research questions, gathering and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and the knowledge produced are there to some extent because of the researcher’s standpoint. This caused him to question what standpoint to adopt in the management of scientists. To avoid falling into limitations of the status quo and certain standpoints, he said that "the view from below has greater potential to generate more complete and more objective knowledge claims." He continues to say that, “if our desire is to heal the world, we will learn more about how the root mechanisms of the world work and about how things can be changed by adopting the standpoints of those people and other parts of nature that most deeply suffer its wounds.”&lt;ref&gt;Jermier, J.M. 1998. "Critical perspectives on organizational control". ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 43: 235–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist standpoint theory&lt;!--Section may be linked from elsewhere (see [[MOS:HEAD]]: do not rename without fixing linking articles)--&gt;==
{{main|Standpoint feminism}}
Feminist standpoint theorists make three principal claims: (1) Knowledge is socially situated. (2) Marginalized groups are socially situated in ways that make it more possible for them to be aware of things and ask questions than it is for the non-marginalized.  (3) Research, particularly that focused on power relations, should begin with the lives of the marginalized.&lt;ref name=Bowell&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowell|first1=T.|title=Feminist Standpoint Theory|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fem-stan/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Feminist standpoint theorists such as Dorothy Smith, Patricia Hill Collins, Nancy Hartsock, and Sandra Harding claimed that certain socio-political positions occupied by women (and by extension other groups who lack social and economic privilege) can become sites of epistemic privilege and thus productive starting points for enquiry into questions about not only those who are socially and politically marginalized, but also those who, by dint of social and political privilege, occupy the positions of oppressors. This claim was specifically generated by Sandra Harding and as such, "Starting off research from women's lives will generate less partial and distorted accounts not only of women's lives but also of men's lives and of the whole social order."&lt;ref name="Griffin_b"&gt;Griffin, E. M. (2009). ''A first look at communication theory'' (7th edn). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is also quite evident when women enter into professions that are considered to be male oriented. [[Londa Schiebinger]] states, "While women now study at prestigious universities at about the same rate as men, they are rarely invited to join the faculty at top universities...The sociologist [[Harriet Zuckerman]] has observed that 'the more prestigious the institution, the longer women wait to be promoted.' Men, generally speaking, face no such trade-off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has feminism changed science?|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States of America|pages=33–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standpoint feminists have been concerned with these dualisms for two related reasons. First, dualisms usually imply a hierarchical relationship between the terms, elevating one and devaluing the other.&lt;ref name=WestTurner&gt;West, R., and H. L. Turner (2004). ''Communication Theory. Analysis and Application''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that when we suggest that decisions should be made rationally, not emotionally, for example, we are showing that reason holds a higher value in our culture than does emotion. Also, related to this issue is the concern that these dualisms often become gendered in our culture. In this process, men are associated with one extreme and women with the other. In the case of reason and emotion, women are identified with emotion. Because our culture values emotion less than reason, women suffer from this association. Feminist critics are usually concerned with the fact that dualisms force false dichotomies (partition of a whole) onto women and men, failing to see that life is less either/or than both/and, as [[relational dialectics theory]] holds.

==Criticisms==
Critics argue that standpoint theory, despite challenging essentialism, relies itself on essentialism, as it focuses on the dualism of subjectivity and objectivity.&lt;ref name=WestTurner /&gt; In regards to feminist standpoint theory: though it does dispel many false generalizations of women, it is argued that focus on social groups and social classes of women is still inherently essentialist. Generalizations across the entire female gender can be broken into smaller more specific groups pertaining to women's different social classes and cultures, but are still generalized as distinct groups, and thus marginalization still occurs. West and Turner stated that an author by the name of Catherine O'Leary (1997) argued that although standpoint theory has been helpful in reclaiming women's experiences as suitable research topics, it contains a problematic emphasis on the universality of this experience, at the expense of differences among women's experiences.&lt;ref name=WestTurner /&gt;

Another main criticism of Harding and Wood's standpoint theory is the credibility of strong objectivity vs. subjectivity. Standpoint theorists argue that standpoints are relative and cannot be evaluated by any absolute criteria, but make the assumption that the oppressed are less biased or more impartial than the privileged.&lt;ref name="Griffin_b" /&gt; This leaves open the possibility of an overbalance of power, in which the oppressed group intentionally or unintentionally becomes the oppressor. Intentional overbalance of power, or revenge, can manifest as justification for extremism and militarism, which can sometimes be seen in more extreme forms of feminism.

While the beginnings of standpoint theory are based on the critical paradigm from a Marxist view of social class oppression, a feminist philosophy developed in the 1970s and 1980s and the main focus has been on the feministic side. Other groups, as of now, need to be included into the theory and a new emphasis needs to be made toward other marginalized or muted groups. These groups envelop minorities, culturally different and the disabled or those that have a disability. When Harding and Wood conceived Standpoint theory they did not understand, when they defined it as a feminist view, that there are different cultures existing in the same social group. Many researchers are unsure of the idea of it having essentialism, as essentialism refers to the practice of generalizing all groups as though they were, in essence, the same.” Early standpoint theorists sought to understand the way in which the gendered identity of knowers affected their epistemic resources and capacities”&lt;ref name="Wylie" /&gt;{{rp|48}}. These other muted or marginalized groups have a more realistic approach to standpoint theory as they have different experiences than those that are in power and even within those muted groups differences defined by different cultures of people can have an altered standpoint. This view gives a basis that in part Standpoint Theory has a central principle of the inversion thesis and Joshua St. Pierre defined this as "the inversion thesis gives epistemic authority to those marginalized by systems of oppression insofar as these people are often better knowers than those who benefit from oppression. Put simply: social dispossession produces epistemic privilege."

Part of standpoint theory’s return to favor comes from a re-articulation of its methodology, aims, and limitations that directly answer the criticisms mentioned above.

Wylie has perhaps provided the most succinct articulation of second-wave standpoint theory. For her, a standpoint does not mark out a clearly defined territory such as “women” within which members have automatic privilege but is a rather a posture of epistemic engagement. Responding to the claim that the situated knowledge thesis reifies essentialism, Wylie thus argues that it is "an open (empirical) question whether such structures obtain in a given context, what form they take, and how they are internalized or embodied by individuals".&lt;ref name="Wylie" /&gt;{{rp|62}} Identities are complex and cannot be reduced to simple binaries. Likewise, she argues that the criticism of automatic privilege is falters insofar as a standpoint is never given, but is achieved. (St. Pierre)&lt;ref name="Wylie"&gt;Wylie, Alison. 2012. "Feminist Philosophy of Science: Standpoint Matters." Presidential Address delivered to the Pacific Division APA, in ''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', 86.2: 47–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Elgar 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Edward Elgar]]
[[Edward Elgar|Sir Edward Elgar]]'s '''Symphony No. 1 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op.&amp;nbsp;55''' is one of his two completed symphonies. The first performance was given by the [[The Hallé|Hallé Orchestra]] conducted by [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] in Manchester, England, on 3 December 1908. It was widely known that Elgar had been planning a symphony for more than ten years, and the announcement that he had finally completed it aroused enormous interest. The critical reception was enthusiastic, and the public response unprecedented. The symphony achieved what ''[[The Musical Times]]'' described as "immediate and phenomenal success", with a hundred performances in Britain, continental Europe and America within just over a year of its première.

The symphony is regularly programmed by British orchestras, and features occasionally in concert programmes in North America and Europe. It is well represented on record, with recordings ranging from the composer's 1931 version with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] to modern digital recordings, of which more than 20 have been issued since the mid-1980s.

==Composition and première==
Nearly ten years before composing his first symphony, Elgar had been intrigued by the idea of writing a symphony to commemorate General [[Charles George Gordon]] rather as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]] was originally intended to celebrate [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref name=reed96&gt;Reed p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 he wrote to his friend [[August Jaeger]] (the "Nimrod" of the [[Enigma Variations]]), "Now as to Gordon: the thing possesses me, but I can't write it down yet."&lt;ref name=reed96/&gt; After he completed his oratorio ''[[The Kingdom (Elgar)|The Kingdom]]'' in 1906 Elgar had a brief fallow period. As he passed his 50th birthday he turned to his boyhood compositions which he reshaped into ''[[The Wand of Youth]]'' suites during the summer of 1907.&lt;ref name=k53/&gt; He began work on a symphony and when he went to Rome for the winter&lt;ref&gt;"Court Circular", ''The Times'', 6 November 1907, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; he continued work on it, finishing the first movement. After his return to England he worked on the rest of the symphony during the summer of 1908.&lt;ref name=k53&gt;Kennedy, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Elgar had abandoned the idea of a "Gordon" symphony, in favour of a wholly non-programmatic work. He had come to consider [[abstract music]] as the pinnacle of orchestral composition. In 1905 he gave a lecture on [[Johannes Brahms]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 3]], in which he said that when music was simply a description of something else it was carrying a large art somewhat further than he cared for. He thought music, as a simple art, was at its best when it was simple, without description, as in the case of the Brahms symphony.&lt;ref&gt;"Brahms's Third Symphony – Sir E. Elgar's Analysis, ''The Manchester Guardian'', 9 November 1905, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The first page of the manuscript carries the title, "Symphony for Full Orchestra, Op. 55."&lt;ref name=reed97&gt;Reed, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; To the music critic [[Ernest Newman]] he wrote that the new symphony was nothing to do with Gordon, and to the composer [[Walford Davies]] he wrote, "There is no programme beyond a wide experience of human life with a great charity (love) and a massive hope in the future."&lt;ref name=k53/&gt;

[[File:HansRichter1876.png|thumb|left|175px|alt=black and white Victorian photograph of the head and shoulders of a bespectacled man with a large dark beard|[[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]], the dedicatee, conducted the première of the symphony]]
The symphony was dedicated "To Hans Richter, Mus. Doc. True Artist and true Friend."&lt;ref name=reed97/&gt; It was premiered on 3 December 1908 in the [[Free Trade Hall]] in Manchester, with Richter conducting the [[Hallé Orchestra]]. The London première followed four days later, at the [[Queen's Hall]], with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by Richter.&lt;ref name=k53/&gt; At the first rehearsal for the London concert, Richter addressed the orchestra, "Gentlemen, let us now rehearse the greatest symphony of modern times, written by the greatest modern composer – ''and not only in this country''."  [[William Henry Reed]], who played in the LSO at that concert, recalled, "Arriving at the ''Adagio'', [Richter] spoke almost with the sound of tears in his voice and said: 'Ah! this is a real Adagio – such an Adagio as Beethove' would 'ave writ'."&lt;ref name=reed97/&gt;

''[[The Musical Times]]'' wrote in 1909, "To state that Elgar's Symphony has achieved immediate and phenomenal success is the bare truth." Within weeks of the première the symphony was performed in New York under [[Walter Damrosch]], Vienna under [[Ferdinand Löwe]], St. Petersburg under [[Alexander Siloti]], and Leipzig under [[Artur Nikisch]]. There were performances in Chicago, [[Boston]], Toronto and 15 British towns and cities.&lt;ref name=mt1209&gt;The Musical Times, 1 February 1909, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; By February 1909 the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] had given two more performances at [[Carnegie Hall]] and had taken the work to "some of the largest inland cities&amp;nbsp;... It is doubtful whether any symphonic work has aroused so great an interest since [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikowsky]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Pathétique]]''."&lt;ref&gt;"Opera in New York – Our Own Correspondent", ''The Observer'', 14 February 1909, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period the work was played six times in London, under the baton of Richter, the composer, and [[Henry Joseph Wood|Henry Wood]].&lt;ref name=mt1209/&gt; Within just over a year there were a hundred performances worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Jack, Adrian. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/classical/elgar/notes/note_symph1.shtml "Edward Elgar, Symphony No 1".] BBC Radio 3. Retrieved 7 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Musical Times'' printed a digest of press comments on the symphony. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was quoted as saying, "[T]hematic beauty is abundant. It is exquisite in the adagio, and in the first and second allegros, the latter a kind of scherzo; when the rhythmic impulse, the power and the passion are at their extreme height, when the music becomes almost frenzied in its superb energy, the sense of sheer beauty is still strong." ''[[The Morning Post]]'', wrote, "This is a work for the future, and will stand as a legacy for coming generations; in it are the loftiness and nobility that indicate a masterpiece, though its full appreciation will only be from the most serious-minded; to-day we recognise it as a possession of which to be proud." ''[[The Evening Standard]] said, ''Here we have the true Elgar – strong, tender, simple, with a simplicity bred of inevitable expression.&amp;nbsp;... The composer has written a work of rare beauty, sensibility, and humanity, a work understandable of all."&lt;ref&gt;All extracts in this paragraph are from the digest in ''The Musical Times'', 1 January 1909, pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Musical Times'' refrained from quoting ''[[The Observer]]'', which was the only dissenting voice among the main newspapers. It complained that the work was derivative of [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Johannes Brahms]] and [[Richard Wagner]], and thought the theme of the slow movement "cheap ready-made material". It allowed, however, that "Elgar's orchestration is so magnificently modern that the dress disguises the skeleton."&lt;ref&gt;"Music: The Elgar Symphony", ''The Observer'', 13 December 1908, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; This adverse view was in contrast with the praise in ''[[The Times]]'': "[A] great work of art, which is lofty in conception and sincere in expression, and which must stand as a landmark in the development of the younger school of English music." In ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'', [[Samuel Langford]] described the work as  "sublime&amp;nbsp;... the work is the noblest ever penned for instruments by an English composer."&lt;ref&gt;Langford, Samuel, ''The Manchester Guardian'', 3 December 1908, p. 5; and 4 December 1908, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Times'' noted the influence of Wagner and Brahms: "There are characteristic reminiscences of ''[[Parsifal (opera)|Parsifal]]''...&amp;nbsp;and rhythmically the chief theme looks like an offspring of Brahms" but concluded "it is not only an original work, but one of the most original and most important that has been added to the stock of recent music."&lt;ref&gt;"The Queen's-Hall Orchestra", ''The Times'', 2 January 1909, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'', which also detected the influence of ''Parsifal'', and, in the finale, of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'', called the symphony "a work of such importance that conductors will not lightly let it drop."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/01/04/101860511.pdf "Elgar's Symphony – First Time Here".] ''The New York Times'', 4 January 1909, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical analysis==
The work is the only frequently-performed symphony whose main key is [[A-flat major]].
It is scored for three [[Western concert flute|flute]]s (one doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s and [[English horn|cor anglais]], two [[clarinet]]s and [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s and [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horn]]s, three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], percussion (including [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]] and [[cymbal]]s), two [[pedal harp|harp]]s, and [[string instrument|string]]s. It is in four movements:
{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman
|''Andante. Nobilmente e semplice — Allegro''
|''Allegro molto''
|''Adagio''
|''Lento — Allegro''
}}
[[File:Elgar1opening.jpg|thumb|450px|right|The opening and recurring theme]]The symphony is in a [[cyclic form]]:  the incomplete "nobilmente" theme from the first movement returns in the finale for a complete ''grandioso'' statement after various transformations throughout the work. Elgar wrote, "the opening theme is intended to be simple &amp;, in intention, noble &amp; elevating&amp;nbsp;... the sort of ideal call – in the sense of persuasion, not coercion or command – &amp; something above every day &amp; sordid things."&lt;ref&gt;Elgar, Edward. Letter to Ernest Newman, 4 November 1908, reproduced in ''Edward Elgar: Letters of a Lifetime'', ed. Jerrold Northrop Moore (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The musicologist [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] writes "One cannot call it a motto-theme, but it is an [[Idée fixe (psychology)|''idée fixe'']], and after its first quiet statement, the full orchestra repeat it ''fortissimo''. It gently subsides back to woodwind and violas and abruptly switches to D minor, an extraordinary choice of key for the first ''allegro'' of a Symphony in A flat."&lt;ref name=k54&gt;Kennedy, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Reed speculates that Elgar's choice of D minor was a gesture against academic rules.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; According to the conductor [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]], the clashing keys arose because someone made a bet with Elgar that he could not compose a symphony in two keys at once.&lt;ref name=k54/&gt; It has also been speculated that the contrast was intended to represent two sides of Elgar's own personality - the successful and popular 'Bard of Empire' is heard in the noble A flat motif, set against the inner worries that continually troubled him.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Johnson, notes to LSO Live recording LSO0017 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is in traditional [[sonata form]] with two main themes, a development and a recapitulation. It ends quietly, "an effect of magical stillness".&lt;ref name=k55&gt;Kennedy, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elgar1scherzo-and-adagio.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The theme of the second movement (top) transformed in the third movement (bottom)]]
The second movement is a brisk allegro. Elgar did not call it a [[scherzo]], and though Reed calls it "vivacious",&lt;ref name=reed160&gt;Reed, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; others, including Kennedy, have found it restless and even sinister in parts.&lt;ref name=k55/&gt; A middle section, in B{{music|flat}}, is in Elgar's ''Wand of Youth'' vein. He asked orchestras to play it "like something you hear down by the river."&lt;ref name=k55/&gt; As the movement draws to a close it slows down, and its first theme is transformed into the main theme of the slow movement,&lt;ref&gt;Excepting bar 7 of the slow movement where the top A is omitted and the shape is very slightly modified&lt;/ref&gt; despite their contrasting tempi and different keys. According to Reed, "Someone once had the temerity to ask Elgar which version, the ''allegro'' or the ''adagio'', was written first; but the question was not very well received and the subject was not pursued."&lt;ref name=reed162&gt;Reed, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy says of the ''adagio'' that it is "unique among Elgar slow movements in the absence of that anguished yearning usually to be found in his quieter passages. There is no ''Angst'' here, instead a benedictory tranquillity&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=k56&gt;Kennedy, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The second subject of the movement remains in the tranquil vein, and the movement ends in what Reed calls "the astounding effect of the muted trombones in the last five bars&amp;nbsp;... like a voice from another world."&lt;ref name=reed162/&gt;

The finale begins in D minor with a slow repeat of one of the subsidiary themes of the first movement, showing Elgar in "one of his most dreamy and mysterious moods."&lt;ref name=reed162/&gt; After the introduction there is a restless allegro, with a succession of themes including an "impulsive march-rhythm".&lt;ref name=k56/&gt; In a manner recalling the motivic transformation between the second and third movement, this material is later heard at half speed accompanied by harp arpeggios and with a lyrical string melody. The movement builds to a climax and ends with the ''nobilmente'' opening theme of the symphony returning "orchestrated with glittering splendour" to bring the work to a "triumphant and confident" conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 57 and Reed p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
[[Woodwind]]s: 3 [[Flute]]s, (Fl. III doubles [[Piccolo]]), 2 [[Oboe]]s, [[English Horn]], 2 [[Clarinet]]s in A and B flat, [[Bass Clarinet]] in A and B flat, 2 [[Bassons]] and [[Contrabasson]]

[[Brass]]: 4 [[Horn (instrument)|Horn]]s in F, 3 [[Trumpet]]s in B flat, 3 [[Trombone]]s (The 3rd trombone could be a [[bass trombone]]) and [[Tuba]]

[[Percussion]]: [[Timpani]], Small [[Snare Drum]], [[Bass Drum]] and [[Cymbals]]

[[String instrument|String]]s: 2 [[Harp]]s, [[Violin]]s I and II; [[Viola]]s, [[Violoncello]]s and [[ContraBass]]es

==Duration==
The composer's 1931 EMI recording of the First Symphony plays for 46 minutes and 30 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;EMI CD CDM 5-672-6-2: timings of the movements: I = 17:22, II = 7:37, III = 10:18, and IV = 11:13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]]'s archives show that in a 1930 broadcast performance Elgar took 46 minutes.&lt;ref name=cox&gt;Cox, David, "Edward Elgar" in ''The Symphony 2: Elgar to the Present Day'', ed. Robert Simpson (1967), Penguin Books, Harmondsworth. OCLC 500339917.&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar was noted for his brisk tempi in his own music, and later performances have been slower. Elgar's contemporaries, [[Henry Joseph Wood|Sir Henry Wood]] and [[Hamilton Harty|Sir Hamilton Harty]] took respectively 50:15 (1930) and 59:45 in 1940.&lt;ref name=cox/&gt; In 1972, while preparing a new recording, [[Georg Solti]] studied Elgar's 1931 performance. Solti's fast tempi, based on the composer's own, came as a shock to Elgarians accustomed to the broader tempi taken by Harty, [[John Barbirolli|Sir John Barbirolli]] and others in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;March, p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; Barbirolli's 1963 recording takes 53:53; Solti takes 48:48. Later examples of slower tempi include a 1992 recording conducted by [[Giuseppe Sinopoli]] (55:18), and a 2001 live recording conducted by [[Colin Davis|Sir Colin Davis]] (54:47).&lt;ref&gt;Notes to EMI CD 9689242; Decca CD 475-8226; DG CD 000289-453-1032-9; and LSO Live CD LSO 0072.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
{{Main|Elgar Symphony No. 1 discography}}
The first recording of the symphony was made by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in 1931, conducted by the composer for [[His Master's Voice]]. The recording was reissued on long-playing record ([[LP album|LP]]) in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/December%201970/120/833277/ELGAR.+The+Kingdom%2C+0p.+51%E2%80%94Prelude.+Symphony+No.+1+in+A+flat+major%2C+Op.+55t.+BBC+Symphony+Orchestra%2C+tLondon+Symphony+Orchestra+both+items+conducted+by+Sir+Edward+Elgar.+World+Record+Club+it+SH139+%2825s.%29.+Recorded+11.4.1938%2C+from+HNIV+DB1934+%28234%29%2C+trecorded+2022.11.1930%2C+from+D19449+%28931%29.

After 1931 the work received no further gramophone recordings until [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]]'s 1950 recording. During the 1950s there was only one other new recording of the symphony, and in the 1960s there were only two. In the 1970s there were four new recordings. In the 1980s there were six, and the 1990s saw twelve. Ten new recordings were released in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=gram&gt;[http://www.gramophone.net Gramophone archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the recordings have been by British orchestras and conductors, but exceptions include the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]], [[Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra]], [[Dresden Staatskapelle]], and [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]], and conductors [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], [[Daniel Barenboim]], [[Bernard Haitink]], [[Tadaaki Otaka]], [[André Previn]], [[Constantin Silvestri]], Giuseppe Sinopoli, and [[Leonard Slatkin]].&lt;ref name=gram/&gt;&lt;ref name=march/&gt;

[[BBC]] [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]]'s "Building a Library" feature, a comparative review of all available recordings, has considered the symphony three times since 1982. ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music]]'', 2008 edition, contains two pages of reviews of the work. The two recordings recommended by both the BBC and ''The Penguin Guide'' are by Boult and the London Philharmonic Orchestra (1977) and [[Vernon Handley]] with the same orchestra (1979).&lt;ref name=march&gt;March, pp. 431–32&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Birds of America''''' is a book by [[natural history|naturalist]] and painter [[John James Audubon]], containing illustrations of a wide variety of [[List of birds of the United States|birds of the United States]]. It was first published as a series in sections between 1827 and 1838, in [[Edinburgh]] and London. Not all of the specimens collected in the work were collected by Audubon himself, some were sent to him by [[John Kirk Townsend]] who had collected them on [[Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth]]'s 1834 expedition with [[Thomas Nuttall]].&lt;ref&gt; Mearns, B. &amp; R. ''John Kirk Townsend: Collector of Audubon’s Western Birds and Mammals'' (2007). &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Narrative of a Journey Across the Rocky Mountains to the Columbia River' by John Kirk Townsend &lt;/ref&gt; 

The work consists of 435 hand-coloured, life-size [[Printmaking|prints]], made from [[engraving|engraved]] plates, measuring around {{convert|39|by|26|in|cm}}. It includes images of six now-[[Extinction|extinc]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t birds:  [[Carolina parakeet]], [[passenger pigeon]], [[Labrador duck]], [[great auk]], [[Eskimo curlew]], and [[Heath hen|pinnated grouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web4.audubon.org/bird/boa/ExtinctBirds.html|title=Birds Extincted since Audubon's time|first=National Audubon|last=Society|website=web4.audubon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historians describe the quality of Audubon's work as being of high and printed with "artistic finesse."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The plant-life backgrounds of some 50 of the bird studies were painted by Audubon's assistant [[Joseph Mason (artist)|Joseph Mason]] but he is not credited for his work in the book.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, DeVere.

==Early publication history==
[[File:1 Wild Turkey.jpg|thumbnail|left|Plate 1 by [[John James Audubon]] depicting a wild turkey, ([[Wild turkey|''Meleagris gallopavo'']]).]]
About 1820, around the age of 35, Audubon declared his intention to paint every bird in North America.&lt;ref name="NYT2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/26/arts/antiques-central-park-s-winged-tenants-by-audubon.html|title=Central Park's Winged Tenants, By Audubon|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In his bird art, he mainly forsook oil paint, the medium of serious artists of the day, in favour of [[watercolours]] and pastel crayons (and occasionally pencil, charcoal, chalk, [[gouache]], and pen and ink). As early as 1807, he developed a method of using wires and threads to hold dead birds in lifelike poses while he drew them.&lt;ref name="NYT2003"/&gt;
[[File:AudubonCarolinaParakeet2.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Audubon Carolina parakeet ([[Carolina Parakeet|''Conuropsis carolinensis'']])&lt;br/&gt;now extinct]]
In 1823, Audubon went to [[Philadelphia]] and New York, looking for financial support using [[Subscription business model|subscription]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to enable him to publish his artwork. He sold the copper engraving plates through on a subscription basis in North America and Europe. Those subscribed obtained five plates at a time. Each subscriber received prints of three smaller birds, a larger bird and a mid-sized bird. The prints were produced from 1827 to 1838 that cost each subscriber around $1,000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is equivalent to $24,600 in 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.in2013dollars.com/1838-dollars-in-2015|title=1838 dollars in 2015 {{!}} Inflation Calculator|website=www.in2013dollars.com|language=en|access-date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that no more than 120 complete sets exist today. Each set consists of 435 individual plates that are based upon the original paintings. Each plate was engraved, printed, and hand colored by Robert Havell of London. While William Lizars, of Edinburgh, engraved the first ten plates, Havell actually finished some of those.

Audubon often found support lacking.&lt;ref name="NYT2003" /&gt; As a result, in 1826, he set sail for the United Kingdom with 250 of his original illustrations, looking for the financial support of subscribers and the technical abilities of [[Engraving|engraver]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and printers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/exhibitions/audubon/influence#lizars|title=Audubon and men of influence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After exhibiting his drawings in [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]], he journeyed to Edinburgh, where he met the accomplished engraver [[William H. Lizars]]. Lizars engraved up to ten of the first plates but was unable to continue the project when his colourists went on strike.&lt;ref name="loccat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liverpool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/artgall/audubon/birds_of_america.htm|title=Victoria Gallery &amp; Museum|publisher=University of Liverpool|work=liv.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, Audubon engaged the noted London animal engraver [[Havell family|Robert Havell Jr.]], and his father, [[Havell family|Robert Havell Sr]]. Havell Jr. oversaw the project through to its completion in 1838.&lt;ref name="Liverpool" /&gt;

The principal printing technique was [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] etching, but engraving and [[aquatint]] were also used.&lt;ref name="minnies"/&gt; Colorists applied each color in assembly-line fashion (over fifty were hired for the work).&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, 2004, pp. 273, 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audubon funded the costly printing project through a pay-as-you-go subscription. From 1826 to 1829, he travelled around the UK and to Paris, lecturing on ornithology and frontier American life&lt;ref name="NYT2000"/&gt; in an effort to entice wealthy patrons to subscribe to the series of prints. Subscribers included the French king [[Charles X]], the British queen [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]], [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]], and, later, the Americans [[Daniel Webster]] and [[Henry Clay]].&lt;ref name="NYT2000"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/03/books/antiques-rarae-aves-audubon-at-auction.html|title=Rarae Aves: Audubon At Auction|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prints were issued in sets of five every month or two in tin cases&lt;ref name="NYT2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/25/arts/antiques-vibrant-birds-of-america-via-germany.html|title=Vibrant Birds Of America, Via Germany|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each set usually included one very large bird, one medium-sized bird, and three small birds.&lt;ref name="NYT2000"/&gt; The plates were published unbound and without any text to avoid having to furnish free copies to the public libraries in England.&lt;ref name="loccat"/&gt; It is estimated that not more than 200 complete sets were ever compiled.&lt;ref name="minnies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2000"/&gt; An accompanying text, issued separately, was written by Audubon and the Scottish naturalist and ornithologist [[William MacGillivray]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/biographies/william-macgillivray/|title=William MacGillivray|work=nhm.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in five volumes in [[Edinburgh]] between 1831 and 1839, under the title ''Ornithological Biography, or, An account of the habits of the birds of the United States of America''.&lt;ref name="loccat"/&gt; The additional cost of the five volumes of text brought the total cost of plates and text to about $1000.&lt;ref name="minnies"/&gt;

After the folio edition was completed, Audubon decided to produce a more affordable edition and employed a lithographer from Philadelphia named J. T. Bowen. Bowen and his team created a smaller [[Octavo#Size|Royal Octavo]] edition, which was issued to subscribers in seven volumes and completed in 1844 after selling 1,199 sets.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Five more octavo editions were completed through 1877. The octavo edition used the text of the Ornithological biography but increased the number of plates to 500, separating some birds which had originally appeared together. Some new drawings were included, mostly by John Woodhouse though Audubon and members of Bowen's team also contributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audubonhouse.org/audubon/octavo/bowen.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703042004/http://www.audubonhouse.org/audubon/octavo/bowen.cfm |archivedate=3 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abirdshome.com/Audubon/VolI/00000.html|title=The Registry Of Nature Habitats - Audubon Birds of America - Publisher's Preface|work=abirdshome.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bien Edition (after [[chromolithography]] pioneer Julius Bien), was a full-sized reissue published in 1858 by Roe Lockwood in New York under the supervision of Audubon's youngest son, John Woodhouse Audubon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flynn|first=Ron|title=The Bien Edition / The Project, Quality, Errors and Market Value|url=http://www.auduboninfo.net/articles/BIEN%20ESSAY.htm|accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to the Civil War, the edition was never finished; only 15 parts of the 44 part series were completed. This edition consisted of 105 plates and included none of the original text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audubongalleries.com/guide/guide.php |title=Audubon Galleries Original Audubon Books and Prints |publisher=Audubongalleries.com |date= |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than 100 subscriptions were sold, making this edition rarer than other early editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ron Flynn |url=http://www.auduboninfo.net/articles/audubon_story.htm |title=About Audubon and His Octavo Edition Prints |publisher=Auduboninfo.net |date= |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audubon's practice of obtaining his subjects has been described as:“Audubon used what we like to call today as the barrel-of-the-shotgun method...After he killed the birds, he would use a complex system of wires and strings to position the birds. Previous artists would draw the birds in a stiff position, but Audubon was different. He drew the birds in dynamic ways, by positioning them how he would observe them in the field.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A full 8-volume, double-elephant folio version is on public display in the Audubon Room at the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]]. This, the first book purchased by the University, was bought in 1839 for $970 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|970|1839|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}), at the time an amazing sum. The entire volume of 435 plates is also available for viewing online at the University of Michigan's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.umich.edu/audubon-room/pictureit-rare-book-reader|title=PictureIt Rare Book Reader|work=umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, the [[Louisiana State University]] Libraries have hosted "Audubon Day," a semi-annual public showing of all four volumes of LSU's copy of the ''Birds of America.'' The set formerly belonged to one of the original subscribers, the [[Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]], and was purchased with a grant from the Crown Zellerbach Corporation in 1964. In recent years, the event has drawn more than 200 visitors. It was profiled in a 2011 ''[[Wall Street Journal]] ''article titled "The Joys of Slow Looking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703421204576327750299277440|title=Birds of America by John James Audubon at Hill Memorial Library at Louisiana State University-The Joys of Slow Looking|work=Wall Street Journal|author=Willard Spiegelman|date=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[University of Pittsburgh]], which owns a complete collection of ''Birds of America'' that had been recently restored and preserved by the Etherington Conservation Center, mounted a major exhibition of 62 selected plates and other materials in its [[Frick Fine Arts Building#University Art Gallery|University Art Gallery]]. Following this, the university constructed an exhibit case on the ground floor of the school's [[Hillman Library]] to continuously display a rotating selection of plates to the public.

'''''The Cat in the Hat''''' is a [[children's book]] written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel under the pen name [[Dr. Seuss]] and first published in 1957. The story centers on a tall [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] cat, who wears a red and white-striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Despite the repeated objections of the children's fish, the Cat shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process he and his companions, Thing One and Thing Two, wreck the house. The children and the fish become more and more alarmed until the Cat produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up and disappears just before the children's mother comes home.

Geisel created the book in response to a debate in the United States about literacy in [[early childhood]] and the ineffectiveness of traditional [[Primer (textbook)|primers]] such as those featuring [[Dick and Jane]]. Geisel was asked to write a more entertaining primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II and who was then director of the education division at [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]]. However, because Geisel was already under contract with [[Random House]], the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, and Random House published the trade edition, which was sold in bookstores.

Geisel gave varying accounts of how he created ''The Cat in the Hat'', but in the version he told most often he was so frustrated with the word list from which he could choose words to write his story that he decided to scan the list and create a story based on the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were ''cat'' and ''hat''. The book was met with immediate critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised it as an exciting alternative to traditional primers. Three years after its debut, the book had already sold over a million copies, and in 2001 ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' listed the book at number nine on its list of best-selling children's books of all time. The book's success led to the creation of [[Beginner Books]], a publishing house centered on producing similar books for young children learning to read. In 1983, Geisel said, "It is the book I'm proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the Dick and Jane primers." The book was adapted into [[The Cat in the Hat (TV special)|a 1971 animated television special]] and  [[The Cat in the Hat (film)|a 2003 live-action film]].

== Plot ==

The story begins as a girl named Sally and her brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly followed by the arrival of the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat should leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes increasingly trickier, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.

The Cat brings in a big red box from outside, from which he releases two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures off the wall and picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started at the beginning of the story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, "What would ''you'' do if your mother asked ''you''?"

== Background ==
[[File:Johnhersey.jpg|right|thumb|An article by [[John Hersey]] about literacy in early childhood provided inspiration for ''The Cat in the Hat''.]]
Theodor Geisel, writing as Dr. Seuss, created ''The Cat in the Hat'' partly in response to the May 24, 1954, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine article by [[John Hersey]] titled "Why Do Students Bog Down on First R? A Local Committee Sheds Light on a National Problem: Reading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Anne|title=An Educational Innovation: The Cat in the Hat|url=http://www.learningfirst.org/educational-innovation-cat-hat|publisher=Learning First Alliance|accessdate=8 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102012917/http://www.learningfirst.org/educational-innovation-cat-hat|archive-date=2 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Hersey was critical of school [[Primer (textbook)|primers]] like those featuring [[Dick and Jane]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the classroom boys and girls are confronted with books that have insipid illustrations depicting the slicked-up lives of other children... All feature abnormally courteous, unnaturally clean boys and girls.... In bookstores anyone can buy brighter, livelier books featuring strange and wonderful animals and children who behave naturally, i.e., sometimes misbehave... Given incentive from school boards, publishers could do as well with primers.&lt;ref&gt;Hersey 1954, pp. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

After detailing many issues contributing to the dilemma connected with student reading levels, Hersey asked toward the end of the article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why should [school primers] not have pictures that widen rather than narrow the associative richness the children give to the words they illustrate—drawings like those of the wonderfully imaginative geniuses among children's illustrators, [[John Tenniel|Tenniel]], [[Howard Pyle]], "Dr. Seuss", [[Walt Disney]]?&lt;ref&gt;Hersey 1954, p.&amp;nbsp;148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This article caught the attention of William Spaulding, who had met Geisel during the war and who was then the director of Houghton Mifflin's education division.&lt;ref name="Morgan1"&gt;Morgan 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;153-154&lt;/ref&gt; Spaulding had also read the best-selling 1955 book ''Why Johnny Can't Read'' by [[Rudolf Flesch]].&lt;ref&gt;Menander 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt; Flesch, like Hersey, criticized primers as boring but also criticized them for teaching reading through [[word recognition]] rather than [[phonics]].&lt;ref name="Menand 2"&gt;Menand 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Spaulding invited Geisel to dinner in Boston where he proposed that Geisel create a book "for six- and seven-year-olds who had already mastered the basic mechanics of reading".&lt;ref name="Morgan1"/&gt; He reportedly challenged, "Write me a story that first-graders can't put down!"&lt;ref name="Morgan1"/&gt;

At the back of ''Why Johnny Can't Read'', Flesch had included 72 lists of words that young children should be able to read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list.&lt;ref name="Menand 2"/&gt; Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words.&lt;ref name="Morgan1"/&gt; However, according to [[Philip Nel]], Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"/&gt; He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"&gt;Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;24-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Geisel gave varying accounts of how he conceived of ''The Cat in the Hat''. According to the story Geisel told most often, he was so frustrated with the word list that William Spaulding had given him that he finally decided to scan the list and create a story out of the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were ''cat'' and ''hat''.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"/&gt; 
Near the end of his life, Geisel told his biographers, Judith and Neil Morgan, that he conceived the beginnings of the story while he was with Spaulding, in an elevator in the Houghton Mifflin offices in Boston.&lt;ref name= "Morgan 153"&gt;Morgan 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;153&lt;/ref&gt; It was an old, shuddering elevator and was operated by a "small, stooped woman wearing 'a leather half-glove and a secret smile'".&lt;ref name= "Morgan 153"/&gt; [[Anita Silvey]], recounting a similar story, described the woman as "a very elegant, very petite African-American woman named Annie Williams".&lt;ref name="silvey"&gt;{{cite episode |title=How the Cat Got His Smile |date=March 1, 2007 |url=https://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&amp;t=1&amp;islist=false&amp;id=7651308&amp;m=7651309 |network=NPR |last=Silvey |first=Anita|series=Listen Morning Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel told Silvey that, when he sketched the Cat in the Hat, he thought of Williams and gave the character Williams' white gloves and "sly, even foxy smile".&lt;ref name="silvey"/&gt;

[[File:Everest North Face toward Base Camp Tibet Luca Galuzzi 2006.jpg|thumb|left|According to Geisel, one of the stories he pitched before ''The Cat in the Hat'' involved scaling [[Mount Everest]].]]
Geisel gave two conflicting, partly fictionalized accounts of the book's creation in two articles, "How Orlo Got His Book" in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' and "My Hassle with the First Grade Language"  in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', both published on November 17, 1957.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"/&gt; In "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", he wrote about his proposal to a "distinguished schoolbook publisher" to write a book for young children about "scaling the peaks of Everest at 60 degrees below".&lt;ref name="Nel 171"/&gt; The publisher was intrigued but informed him that, because of the word list, "you can't use the word ''scaling''. You can't use the word ''peaks''. You can't use ''Everest''. You can't use ''60''. You can't use ''degrees''. You can't..."&lt;ref name="Nel 171"&gt;"My Hassle With the First Grade Language" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;171&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel gave a similar account to Robert Cahn for an article in the July 6, 1957, edition of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"/&gt; In "My Hassle With the First Grade Language", he also told a story of the "three excruciatingly painful weeks" in which he worked on a story about a King Cat and a Queen Cat.&lt;ref&gt;"My Hassle With the First Grade Language" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;173&lt;/ref&gt; However, "queen" was not on the word list, nor did his first grade nephew, Norval, recognize it. So Geisel returned to the work but could then think only of words that started with the letter "q", which did not appear in any word on the list. He then had a similar fascination with the letter "z", which also did not appear in any word on the list. When he did finally finish the book and showed it to his nephew, Norval had already graduated from the first grade and was learning calculus. Philip Nel notes, in his dissection of the article, that Norval was Geisel's invention. Geisel's niece, Peggy Owens, did have a son, but he was only a one-year-old when the article was published.&lt;ref&gt;"My Hassle With the First Grade Language" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;170&lt;/ref&gt;

In "How Orlo Got His Book", he described Orlo, a fictional, archetypal young child who was turned off of reading by the poor selection of simple reading material.&lt;ref name="Nel 167"&gt;"How Orlo Got His Book" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;167&lt;/ref&gt; To save Orlo the frustration, Geisel decided to write a book for children like Orlo but found the task "not dissimilar to... being lost with a witch in a tunnel of love".&lt;ref name="Nel 167"/&gt; He tried to write a story called "The Queen Zebra" but found that both words did not appear on the list. In fact, like Geisel wrote in "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", the letters "q" and "z" did not appear on the list at all. He then tried to write a story about a bird, without using the word ''bird'' as it did not appear on the list. He decided to call it a "wing thing" instead but struggled as he discovered that it "couldn't have ''legs'' or a ''beak'' or a ''tail''. Neither a ''left'' foot or a ''right'' foot."&lt;ref name="Nel 169"&gt;"How Orlo Got His Book" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;169&lt;/ref&gt; On his approach to writing ''The Cat in the Hat'' he wrote, "The method I used is the same method you use when you sit down to make apple stroodle [sic] without stroodles."&lt;ref name="Nel 169"/&gt;

Geisel variously stated that the book took between nine and 18 months to create.&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;30&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Pease notes that he worked on it primarily alone, unlike with previous books, which had been more collaborative efforts between Geisel and his wife, [[Helen Palmer Geisel|Helen]].&lt;ref&gt;Pease 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;112&amp;ndash;115&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a general trend in his work and life. As [[Robert L. Bernstein]] later said of that period, "The more I saw of him, the more he liked being in that room and creating all by himself."&lt;ref name="Pease 114"&gt;Pease 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;114&lt;/ref&gt; Pease points to Helen's recovery from [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], which she was diagnosed with in 1954, as the marker for this change.&lt;ref name="Pease 114"/&gt;

== Publication history ==
[[File:Bennettcerf.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Bennett Cerf]], the head of [[Random House]], negotiated a deal that allowed both Random House and Houghton Mifflin to publish versions of ''The Cat in the Hat''.]]
Geisel agreed to write ''The Cat in the Hat'' at the request of William Spaulding of Houghton Mifflin; however, because Geisel was under contract with Random House, the head of Random House, [[Bennett Cerf]], made a deal with Houghton Mifflin. Random House retained the rights to trade sales, which encompassed copies of the book sold at book stores, while Houghton Mifflin retained the education rights, which encompassed copies sold to schools.&lt;ref name="Morgan1"/&gt;

The Houghton Mifflin edition was released in January or February 1957, and the Random House edition was released on March 1.&lt;ref name=Neary&gt;{{cite web|last=Neary|first=Lynn|title=Fifty Years of 'The Cat in the Hat'|url=https://www.npr.org/2007/03/01/7651308/fifty-years-of-the-cat-in-the-hat#7649624|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two editions featured different covers but were otherwise identical.&lt;ref name=Neary/&gt; The first edition can be identified by the "200/200" mark in the top right corner of the front dust jacket flap, signifying the $2.00 selling price. The price was reduced to $1.95 on later editions.&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Judith and Neil Morgan, the book sold well immediately. The trade edition initially sold an average of 12,000 copies a month, a figure which rose rapidly.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; [[Bullock's]] department store in Los Angeles, California, sold out of its first, 100-copy order of the book in a day and quickly reordered 250 more.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; The Morgans attribute these sales numbers to "playground word-of-mouth", asserting that children heard about the book from their friends and nagged their parents to buy it for them.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; However, Houghton Mifflin's school edition did not sell as well. As Geisel noted in Jonathan Cott's 1983 profile of him, "Houghton Mifflin... had trouble selling it to the schools; there were a lot of Dick and Jane devotees, and my book was considered too fresh and irreverent. But Bennett Cerf at Random House had asked for trade rights, and it just took off in the bookstores."&lt;ref name= "Cott 115"&gt;Cott 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;115&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel told the Morgans, "Parents understood better than school people the necessity for this kind of reader."&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt;

After three years in print, ''The Cat in the Hat'' had sold nearly one million copies. By then, the book had been translated into French, Chinese, Swedish, and Braille.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; In 2001, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' placed it at number nine on its list of the best-selling children's books of all time.&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA186995.html|title=All-Time Bestselling Children's Books|date= 17 December 2001|work=Publishers Weekly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225125934/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA186995.html|archivedate=December 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, more than 10 million copies of ''The Cat in the Hat'' have been printed, and it has been translated into more than 12 different languages, including [[Latin]], under the title ''Cattus Petasatus''.&lt;ref name=horrigan&gt;{{cite web|last=Horrigan|first=Kevin|title=The Cat at 50: Still lots of good fun that is funny|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/29362154.html|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cattus petasatus: The cat in the hat in Latin|year=2000|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci|isbn=9780865164710|pages=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVVbAAAAMAAJ|author=Dr. Seuss |author2=Jennifer Morrish Tunberg |author3=[[Terence Tunberg]]|accessdate=29 November 2013|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, on the occasion of the book's fiftieth anniversary, Random House released ''The Annotated Cat:  Under the Hats of Seuss and His Cats'', which includes both ''The Cat in the Hat'' and its sequel, with annotations and an introduction by Philip Nel.&lt;ref name=Neary/&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Ted Geisel NYWTS 2 crop.jpg|left|thumb|Geisel in 1957, holding a copy of ''The Cat in the Hat'']]
The book was published to immediate critical acclaim. Some reviewers praised the book as an exciting way to learn to read, particularly compared to the primers that it supplanted. Ellen Lewis Buell, in her review for ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', noted the book's heavy use of one-syllable words and lively illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buell|first=Ellen Lewis|title=High Jinks at Home|newspaper=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|date=17 March 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Fensch 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;124–125.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote, "Beginning readers and parents who have been helping them through the dreary activities of Dick and Jane and other primer characters are due for a happy surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buell|first=Ellen Lewis|title=High Jinks at Home|newspaper=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|date=17 March 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Adams Masten of the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' called the book Geisel's ''tour de force'' and wrote, "Parents and teachers will bless Mr. Geisel for this amusing reader with its ridiculous and lively drawings, for their children are going to have the exciting experience of learning that they ''can'' read after all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masten|first=Helen Adams|title=The Cat in the Hat|newspaper=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]|date=11 May 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polly Goodwin of the ''[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Sunday Tribune]]'' predicted that ''The Cat in the Hat'' would cause seven- and eight-year-olds to "look with distinct distaste on the drab adventures of standard primer characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodwin|first=Polly|title=Hurray for Dr. Seuss!|newspaper=Chicago Sunday Tribune|date=12 May 1957|location=Chicago IL |postscript=, as quoted in Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Helen E. Walker of ''[[Library Journal]]'' and Emily Maxwell of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' felt that the book would appeal to older children as well as to its target audience of first- and second-graders.&lt;ref name="Nel-reviews"&gt;Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer for ''The Bookmark'' concurred, writing, "Recommended enthusiastically as a picture book as well as a reader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Some Early Spring Books for Children and Young People|newspaper=The Bookmark|date=April 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Fensch 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Heloise P. Mailloux wrote in ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'', "This is a fine book for remedial purposes, but self-conscious children often refuse material if its seems meant for younger children."&lt;ref name="mailloux"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mailloux|first=Heloise P.|title=Late Spring Book List|newspaper=[[The Horn Book Magazine]]|date=June 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She felt that the book's limited vocabulary kept it from reaching "the absurd excellence of early Seuss books".&lt;ref name="mailloux"/&gt;

Based on a 2007 online poll, the [[National Education Association]] named ''The Cat in the Hat'' one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children".&lt;ref name=NEA2007&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was ranked number 36 among the "Top 100 Picture Books" in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]'' – the third of five Dr. Seuss books on the list.&lt;ref name=SLJPicture2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/06/top-100-picture-books-poll-results |title= Top 100 Picture Books Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth |publisher= ''A Fuse #8 Production''.

The book's fiftieth anniversary in 2007 prompted a reevaluation of the book from some critics. Yvonne Coppard, reviewing the fiftieth anniversary edition in ''Carousel'' magazine, wondered if the popularity of the Cat and his "delicious naughty behavior" will endure another fifty years. Coppard wrote, "The innocent ignorance of bygone days has given way to an all-embracing, almost paranoid awareness of child protection issues. And here we have the mysterious stranger who comes in, uninvited, while your mother is out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coppard|first1=Yvonne|title=''The Cat in the Hat'' Review|journal=Carousel|date=Autumn 2007|issue=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Philip Nel places the book's title character in the tradition of con artists in American art, including the title characters from [[Meredith Willson]]'s ''[[The Music Man]]'' and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref name="nel-analysis"&gt;Nel 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;118-119&lt;/ref&gt; Nel also contends that Geisel identified with the Cat, pointing to a self portrait of Geisel in which he appears as the Cat, which was published alongside a profile about him in ''The Saturday Evening Post'' on July 6, 1957.&lt;ref name="nel-analysis"/&gt; [[Michael K. Frith]], who worked as Geisel's editor, concurs, arguing that "The Cat in the Hat and Ted Geisel were inseparable and the same. I think there's no question about it. This is someone who delighted in the chaos of life, who delighted in the seeming insanity of the world around him."&lt;ref name="nel-analysis"/&gt; Ruth MacDonald asserts that the Cat's primary goal in the book is to create fun for the children. The Cat calls it "fun that is funny", which MacDonald distinguishes from the ordinary, serious fun that parents subject their children to.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;110&amp;ndash;111&lt;/ref&gt; In an article titled "Was the Cat in the Hat Black?", Philip Nel draws connections between the Cat and stereotyped depictions of African-Americans, including [[minstrel shows]], Geisel's own minstrel-inspired cartoons from early in his career, and the use of the term "cat" to refer to jazz musicians.&lt;ref name="Cat-Black"/&gt; According to Nel, "Even as [Geisel] wrote books designed to challenge prejudice, he never fully shed the cultural assumptions he grew up with, and was likely unaware of the ways in which his visual imagination replicated the racial ideologies he consciously sought to reject."&lt;ref name="Cat-Black"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nel|first1=Philip|title=Was the Cat in the Hat Black?: Exploring Dr. Seuss’s Racial Imagination|journal=Children's Literature|date=2014|volume=42|issue=1|pages=71-98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cotton Mather.jpg|thumb|right|Geisel once called the fish in ''The Cat in the Hat'' "my version of [[Cotton Mather]]".]]
Geisel once called the fish "my version of [[Cotton Mather]]", the Puritan moralist who advised the prosecutors during the [[Salem witch trials]].&lt;ref name="nel 40"&gt;Nel 2007,&amp;nbsp;40&lt;/ref&gt; Betty Mensch and Alan Freeman support this view, writing, "Drawing on old Christian symbolism (the fish was an ancient sign of Christianity) Dr. Seuss portrays the fish as a kind of ever-nagging superego, the embodiment of utterly conventionalized morality."&lt;ref name="nel 40"/&gt; Philip Nel notes that other critics have also compared the fish to the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Super-ego|superego]]. Anna Quindlen called the Cat "pure id" and marked the children, as mediators between the Cat and the fish, as the ego.&lt;ref name="nel 40"/&gt; Mensch and Freeman, however, argue that the Cat shows elements of both id and ego.&lt;ref name="nel 40"/&gt;

In her analysis of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents the voice of the children's absent mother.&lt;ref name="macdonald-fish"&gt;MacDonald 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;114&amp;ndash;115&lt;/ref&gt; Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children are hesitant to tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them "that something did go on but that silence is the better part of valor in this case".&lt;ref name="macdonald-fish"/&gt; [[Alison Lurie]] agrees, writing, "there is a strong suggestion that they might not tell her."&lt;ref name="lurie"&gt;Lurie 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;70&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that, in the Cat's destruction of the house, "the kids&amp;mdash;and not only those in the story, but those who read it&amp;mdash;have vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences."&lt;ref name="lurie"/&gt; For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, "''The Cat in the Hat'' is a revolt against authority, but it's ameliorated by the fact that the Cat cleans up everything at the end. It's revolutionary in that it goes as far as [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] and then stops. It doesn't go quite as far as [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cott 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;117&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Pease notes that ''The Cat in the Hat'' shares some structural similarities with other Dr. Seuss books. Like earlier books, ''The Cat in the Hat'' starts with "a child's feeling of discontent with his mundane circumstances" which is soon enhanced by make believe.&lt;ref name="Pease 103"&gt;Pease 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;103&amp;ndash;105&lt;/ref&gt; The book starts in a factual, realistic world, which crosses over into the world of make believe with the loud bump that heralds the arrival of the Cat.&lt;ref name="Pease 103"/&gt; However, this is the first Dr. Seuss book in which the fantasy characters, i.e. the Cat and his companions, are not products of the children's imagination.&lt;ref name="Pease 103"/&gt; It also differs from previous books in that Sally and her brother actively participate in the fantasy world; they also have a changed opinion of the Cat and his world by the story's end.&lt;ref name="Pease 103"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Ruth MacDonald asserts, "''The Cat in the Hat'' is the book that made Dr. Seuss famous. Without ''The Cat'', Seuss would have remained a minor light in the history of children's literature."&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;105&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Pease concurs, writing, "''The Cat in the Hat'' is the classic in the archive of Dr. Seuss stories for which it serves as a cornerstone and a linchpin. Before writing it Geisel was better known for the [[FLIT#"Quick, Henry, the Flit!"|'Quick, Henry, the Flit!']] ad campaign than for his nine children's books."&lt;ref name="pease-popularity"&gt;Pease 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;111&amp;ndash;112&lt;/ref&gt; The publication and popularity of the book thrust Geisel into the center of the United States literacy debate, what Pease called "the most important academic controversy" of the [[Cold War]] era.&lt;ref name="pease-popularity"/&gt; Academic [[Louis Menand]] contends that "''The Cat in the Hat'' transformed the nature of primary education and the nature of children's books. It not only stood for the idea that reading ought to be taught by phonics; it also stood for the idea that language skills—and many other subjects—ought to be taught through illustrated storybooks, rather than primers and textbooks."&lt;ref&gt;Menand 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, "It is the book I'm proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the ''Dick and Jane'' primers."&lt;ref name = "Cott 115"/&gt;

[[File:WhiteHouseTheCatintheHat2003.jpg|left|300px|thumb|A ''Cat in the Hat'' Christmas decoration in the [[White House]], 2003]]

The book led directly to the creation of [[Beginner Books]], a publishing house centered on producing books like ''The Cat in the Hat'' for beginning readers.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; According to Judith and Neil Morgan, when the book caught the attention of Phyllis Cerf, the wife of Geisel's publisher, [[Bennett Cerf]], she arranged for a meeting with Geisel, where the two agreed to create Beginner Books.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"&gt;Morgan 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;156&amp;ndash;157&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel became the president and editor, and the Cat in the Hat served as their mascot. Geisel's wife, Helen, was made third partner. Random House served as distributor&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; until 1960, when Random House purchased Beginner Books.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;167&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel wrote multiple books for the series, including ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]'' (1958), ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]'' (1960), ''[[Hop on Pop]]'' (1963), and ''[[Fox in Socks]]'' (1965).&lt;ref name="first edition"&gt;{{cite web|title=First Edition Beginner Books|url=http://1stedition.net/beginnerbooks.html|publisher=1stedition.net|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially used word lists of limited vocabularies to create these books, as he had with ''The Cat in the Hat'', but moved away from the lists as he came to believe "that a child could learn any amount of words if fed them slowly and if the books were amply illustrated".&lt;ref&gt;"Somebody's Got to Win" 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;126&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors also contributed notable books to the series, including ''A Fly Went By'' (1958), ''[[Sam and the Firefly]]'' (1958), ''[[Go, Dog. Go!]]'' (1961), and ''[[The Big Honey Hunt]]'' (1962).&lt;ref name="first edition"/&gt;

The book, or elements of it, has been mentioned multiple times in United States politics. The image of the Cat balancing many objects on his body while in turn balancing himself on a ball has been included in political cartoons and articles. Political caricaturists have portrayed both [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]] in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;48&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Mad (magazine)|''MAD'' magazine]] published "The Strange Similarities Between the Bush Administration and the World of Dr. Seuss", an article which matched quotes from White House officials to excerpts taken from Dr. Seuss books, and in which [[George W. Bush]]'s [[State of the Union]] promises were contrasted with the Cat vowing (in part), "I can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake!  I can hold up these books!  And the fish on a rake!"&lt;ref&gt;MAD Magazine #447, November 2004, Drucker/Devlin&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, during the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]], Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] compared the impasse over a bill to reform immigration with the mess created by the Cat. He read lines of the book from the Senate floor.&lt;ref name="Senate"&gt;{{cite news|title=Snubbing the White House, Without Snubbing the White House|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/07/AR2007060702206_2.html|author=Dana Milbank|date=June 8, 2007 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then carried forward his analogy hoping the impasse would be straightened out for "If you go back and read Dr. Seuss, the cat manages to clean up the mess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate tries to cool immigration bill heat|author=Stephen Dinan|work=The Washington Times|date=June 6, 2007 |url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20070606-123944-6924r.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a stamp featuring the Cat in the Hat.&lt;ref&gt;Fensch 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;176&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Cat in the Hat''{{'}}s popularity also led to increased popularity and exposure for Geisel's previous children's books. For example, 1940's ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'' had sold 5,801 copies in its opening year and 1,645 the following year. In 1958, the year after the publication of ''The Cat in the Hat'', 27,643 copies of ''Horton'' were sold, and by 1960 the book had sold a total of over 200,000 copies.&lt;ref name="pease-popularity"/&gt;

===Stage adaptation===
In 2009, the [[Royal National Theatre]] created a stage version of the book, adapted and directed by [[Katie Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Charles|title=The Cat in the Hat at the National Theatre, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/6835238/The-Cat-in-the-Hat-at-the-National-Theatre-review.html|accessdate=27 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Seussical]]'', a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the Cat in the Hat as narrator.&lt;ref name=connema&gt;{{cite web|last=Connema|first=Richard|title=Seussical is a Charming Musical|url=http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/sanfran/s808.html|publisher=Talkin Broadway|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical received weak reviews when it opened, in November 2001, but eventually became a staple in regional and school theaters.&lt;ref name=connema/&gt; 

===Attraction===
A ride at Universal Studios' [[Islands of Adventure]] park in Orlando, Florida, has a ''Cat in the Hat'' theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orlandoinformer.com/universal/cat-in-the-hat/|title=Cat in the Hat at Universal's Islands of Adventure|work=Orlando Informer|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational Software===
In 1997, The book was made into a [[Living Books]] adaption for the PC and then, there were similar differences to reflect the new media such as Conrad sings his lines at the subtitles of the story as the narrator in the rainy day.

[[File:The Hook illustration.jpg|thumb|205px|right|Ink drawing depicting ''The Hook'' legend.]]
'''The Hook''' or '''The Hookman'''{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|p=49}} is an [[urban legend]] about a killer with a [[Prosthesis#Hooks|hook for a hand]] attacking a couple in a parked car. The story is thought to date from at least the mid-1950s, and gained significant attention when it was reprinted in the advice column ''[[Dear Abby]]'' in 1960. It has since become a morality [[archetype]] in popular culture, and has been referenced in various horror films. 

==Legend==
{{unsourced section|date=August 2017}}
The basic premise involves a young couple parking at a [[lovers' lane]]. The radio plays while they’re making out. Suddenly, a news bulletin reports that a serial killer has just escaped from a nearby institution.{{Sfn|Brunvand|2004|p=15}} The killer has a hook for one of his hands. For varying reasons, they decide to leave quickly. In the end, the killer's hook is either found hanging from the door handle or embedded into the door itself. Different variations include a scraping sound on the car door. Some versions start the same way, but have the couple spotting the killer, warning others, and then narrowly escaping with the killer holding onto the car's roof.

In an alternate version, the couple drive through an unknown part of the [[rural area|country]] late at night and stop in the middle of the [[forest|woods]], because either the male has to relieve himself, or the car breaks down and the man leaves for help. While waiting for him to return, the female turns on the radio and hears the report of an escaped [[mental patient]]. She is then disturbed many times by a thumping on the roof of the car. She eventually exits and sees the escaped patient sitting on the roof, banging the male's severed head on it. Another variation has the female seeing the male's butchered body suspended upside down from a tree with his fingers scraping the roof. In other versions the man does return to the car only to see his date brutally murdered with a hook embedded in her. In other versions, the woman gets out of the car when her date doesn't come back. Only to see his mutilated body (either on the car's roof, nailed on a tree, or just a few short steps way). But as she starts to panic, she runs into the maniac and she too gets killed.

There is also another legend that is similar. In the legend, the young couple are heading back from a great date but their car breaks down (either from running out of fuel or a malfunction). The man then decides to head off on foot to find someone or somewhere to help with the problem while the woman stays behind in the car. She then falls asleep while waiting and wakes up to see a hideous person looking at her through the window. Luckily the car is locked so the person can't get inside. But to the woman's horror, the person raises both of his arms to reveal that they are holding her date's severed head in one hand and the car keys in the other. The fate of the woman is never revealed.

==Origin==
The origins of the Hook legend are not entirely known, though, according to folklorist and historian [[Jan Harold Brunvand]], the story began to circulate some time in the 1950s in the United States.{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|p=49}} According to Brunvand in ''The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings'', the story had become widespread amongst American teenagers by 1959, and continued to expand into the 1960s.{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|pages=49–50}}

The first known publication of the story occurred on November 8, 1960, when a reader letter telling the story was reprinted in ''[[Dear Abby]]'', a popular advice column:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Abby: If you are interested in teenagers, you will print this story. I don't know whether it's true or not, but it doesn't matter because it served its purpose for me: A fellow and his date pulled into their favorite "lovers lane" to listen to the radio and do a little [[kissing|necking]]. The music was interrupted by an announcer who said there was an escaped convict in the area who had served time for rape and robbery. He was described as having a hook instead of a right hand. The couple become frightened and drove away. When the boy took his girl home, he went around to open the  car door for her. Then he saw—a hook on the door handle! I will never park to make out as long as I live. I hope this does the same for other kids. —Jeanette{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|pages=48–49}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Literary scholar Christopher Pittard traces the plot dynamics of the legend to [[Victorian literature]], particularly the 1913 horror novel ''[[The Lodger (novel)|The Lodger]]'' by [[Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes]].{{Sfn|Pittard|2011|pages=188–189}} Though the two narratives have little in common, he notes that both are built upon a "threefold relationship of crime, dirt, and chance... Such a reading also implies a reconsideration of the historical trajectory of the urban legend, usually read as a product of postmodernist consumer culture."{{Sfn|Pittard|2011|p=188}}

== Interpretations ==
Folklorists have interpreted the long history of this legend in many ways. [[Alan Dundes|Alan Dundes's]] Freudian interpretation explains the hook as a phallic symbol and its amputation as a symbolic castration.{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|pages=50–51}}

Swedish folklorist [[Bengt af Klintberg]] describes the story as an example of "a conflict between representatives of normal people who follow the rules of society and those who are not normal, who deviate and threaten the normal group."{{Sfn|Brunvand|2001|pages=200–201}}

American folklorist Bill Ellis interpreted the maniac in ''The Hook'' as a moral custodian who interrupts the sexual experimentation of the young couple. He sees the Hookman's handicap as "his own lack of sexuality" and "the threat of the Hookman is not the normal sex drive of teenagers, but the abnormal drive of some adults to keep them apart."{{Sfn|Ellis|1987|pages=31–60}} 

==Influence on film==

The Hook legend has most often been depicted and referenced in [[horror film]]s.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|pages=112–114}} Its prevalence, according to film scholar [[Mark Kermode]], is most reflected in the [[slasher film]], functioning as a morality [[archetype]] on youth sexuality.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|p=113}} 

In ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' (1979), [[Bill Murray]]'s character retells the Hook legend to campers around a campfire.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|p=101}} ''[[He Knows You're Alone]]'' (1980) opens with a [[Story within a story#Film within a film|film within a film]] scene in which a young couple are attacked by a killer while in a parked car.{{Sfn|Everman|2003|p=122}} The slasher film ''[[Final Exam (film)|Final Exam]]'' opens with a scene in which a couple are attacked in a parked car, and later, a student is murdered in a university locker room with a hook.{{Sfn|Armstrong|2003|p=113}} ''[[Campfire Tales (1997 film)|Campfire Tales]]'' (1997), an anthology horror film, opens with a segment retelling the Hook legend, set in the 1950s.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|p=192}} ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997) features a killer stalking teenagers with a hook; at the beginning of the film, the central characters recount the Hook legend around a campfire.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|p=104}} "[[The Pest House]]" (1998), the fourteenth episode of season 2 of the TV series ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', opens with a murder similar to that of the urban legend.

'''''The Hussite Sermon''''' (German - ''Die Hussitenpredigt'') is a painting by the [[Düsseldorf]]-based painter [[Carl Friedrich Lessing]], showing an open-air sermon being delivered by a [[Hussite]] preacher in the 15th century. It is now in the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] in Berlin.

In 1834 [[Frederick William IV|Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia]] saw an oil sketch on the subject by Lessing in 1834 and commissioned him between 1835 and 1836 to produce a full-scale version. The mainly-Catholic Rhineland had recently been annexed to the Protestant-dominated [[Kingdom of Prussia]] by the [[Congress of Vienna]] and so the work was seen as a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda for the area's Protestant minority. In the context of the Restoration of the German princes to their thrones and the [[Vormärz]], others also saw it as a criticism of the repressiveness of the states and systems put in place by Metternich and the Congress. Middle-class audiences saw it as an expression of opposition to kingly and church authority alike. It was briefly exhibited in Germany and Paris, spreading the reputation of the [[Düsseldorf school of painting]].

'''''Vision after the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel)''''' is an oil painting by French artist [[Paul Gauguin]], completed in 1888. It is now in the [[National Gallery of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]]. It depicts a scene from the Bible in which [[Jacob wrestling with the angel|Jacob wrestles an angel]]. It depicts this indirectly, through a vision that the women depicted see after a sermon in church. It was painted in [[Pont-Aven]], [[Brittany]], France.

==Background==
Gauguin started off landscape painting in the summer ''en plein'' air but following the creation of ''Vision After the Sermon'' he focused increasingly on interpreting religious subject matter in a highly personal way.

==Composition and technique==
The use of color, shape, and line in ''Vision After the Sermon'' is appreciated for its bold manner of handling paint. Finding inspiration in Japanese woodblock prints from Hiroshige and Hokusai, which he owned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berban, III|first1=Matthew|title=The Origin of Paul Gauguin's Vision After the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel (1888)|journal=Art Bulletin|date=September 1, 1977|volume=59|issue=3|page=415|jstor=3049673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauguin developed the idea of non-naturalistic landscapes. He applies  large areas of flat color to the composition, and the red ground departs from conventional representation of earth, field, or grass. In portraying the watching figures Gaugin experiments with the distortion of shapes, exaggerating features, and use of strong contour lines rather than gradual shifts in tone that most painters practiced. The brown trunk, black garments, white hats and red field are painted with minimal color shading. Gauguin is showing it is possible to move away from naturalism towards a more abstracted, even symbolic, manner of painting. While formal elements of Gauguin's paintings reflect the influence of Japanese prints, his choice of subject matter and composition are uniquely his own.

Gauguin structures the painting by placing a tree trunk diagonally through its center. By sectioning the image this way, he creates a visual separation between the Breton women and their vision of an angel wrestling with Jacob. This compositional decision is developed to frame the main subjects of the painting. The curve of the trunk follows the line of the head of the center-most figure. The branches and leaves shoot out directly toward the upper right corner of the painting to form a second frame around the angel and Jacob. The overall perspective of this painting is purposely skewed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kumskova|first1=Marina|title=Paul Gauguin: Vision after the Sermon. 1888. Analysis|url=http://artmarinagallery.blogspot.com/2013/03/paul-gauguin-vision-after-sermon-1888.html|website=Marina's Blog|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but effectively accomplished by his clustering of people in diminished sizes along its left edge.

“Further, it was Emile Bernard who pointed out the general influence of Japanese prints on Gauguin’s work. This seems self-evident when one compares Gauguin’s ''Vision after the Sermon'' to Vincent van Gogh’s ''Trees'', a copy after Hiroshige, with its diagonally placed tree and use of red. In citing Hokusai’s Sumo wrestlers in The Manga, however, Bernard was being more specific. He designated them as the source of Gauguin’s struggling angel and Jacob”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berban, III|first1=Matthew|title=The Origin of Paul Gauguin's Vision After the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel (1888)|journal=Art Bulletin|date=September 1, 1977|volume=59|issue=3|page=415|jstor=3049673}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can see their features, in the faces, of the women that are closer to the viewer. The tale of Jacob wrestling an angel is from Genesis 32:22-31 in the Old Testament.  Gauguin is making use of Brenton themes while at the same time leaning towards abstraction. The women, one of whom clasps her hands in prayer, are wearing a variety of white hats and seem to be the ones having this vision. Several colors stand out above the rest, including the reds, black, and white, and contribute to the visual energy of the scene. The color most likely to catch the viewer's attention first in this painting would be red, which in this particular painting lends power to the struggle that is occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berban, III|first1=Matthew|title=The Origin of Paul Gauguin's Vision After the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel (1888)|journal=Art Bulletin|date=September 1, 1977|volume=59|issue=3|page=415|jstor=3049673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''White Crucifixion''''' is a painting by [[Marc Chagall]] depicting the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. It was painted in 1938 after Chagall had visited Europe, and can be viewed at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].

==Description==
The painting emphasizes the suffering of [[Jesus]] and the [[Jewish people]]. At the sides violent acts against Jews occur such as the burning of a synagogue and invaders. And in the center, Jesus is shown crucified wearing a prayer shawl as a symbol that he is Jewish.&lt;ref name="Wullschläger"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wullschläger |first=Jackie |authorlink= |title=Chagall |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=2008 |location= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXZr438two0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-307-27058-0}} ch. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is startling as the crucifixion, often seen by the Jewish people as a symbol of oppression, is instead being used to represent their suffering.&lt;ref name="Harries"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Harries |first=Richard |authorlink= |title=The Passion in Art |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2004 |location= |pages=109–111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BKM_M7iu4KUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-7546-5010-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Chagall’s paintings could be described as lively, romantic, humorous, imaginative, and filled with brilliant colors, but the ''White Crucifixion'' is largely drained of color. Chagall painted it in 1938 while living in Paris, in response to the horrifying events of [[Kristallnacht]], the "Night of Broken Glass," an anti-Jewish pogrom of official decree by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels in Nazi Germany (including Austria and Sudetenland) from the 9th until 10 November 1938.

A green figure carrying a bundle is shown crossing the foreground. This figure, who appears in several of Chagall's works, has been interpreted as being either a Jewish wanderer from Yiddish tradition or the Prophet [[Elijah]].&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

Two changes were made by Chagall to the work, a [[swastika]] on the armband of the soldier burning the synagogue was overpainted as well as the words "Ich bin Jude" on a placard around the neck of a man.&lt;ref name="Wullschläger"/&gt;

There is also a [[Lithuanian flag]] in the upper right hand of the painting, which is not unexpected due to Chagall's [[Lithuanian Jews|Litvak]] roots. Also, in the upper left hand portion of the painting there are the red flags of communism.

==Reception==
[[Pope Francis]], a well-established ally and friend of the Jewish people,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/9928921/Pope-Francis-elected-leader-of-Catholic-Church-live.html ''Pope Francis elected leader of Catholic Church: as it happened''] London Telegraph online edition 14 March 2013, access date 14-3-2013&lt;/ref&gt; considers the painting to be his favorite.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/9931413/Pope-Francis-20-things-you-didnt-know.html ''Pope Francis: Twenty Things You Didn't Know About Him''] London Telegraph online edition 14 March 2013, access date 14-3-2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/museums/ct-chicago-chagall-pope-francis-20151110-story.html Chicago's Chagall gets its audience with Pope Francis] Steve Johnson, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' 10 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''White Dawns''''' ({{lang-mk|Бели мугри}}, {{lang|mk|Beli mugri}}) is a collection of poems by the famous [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] writer [[Kočo Racin]] (Кочо Рацин), published in 1939 in [[Samobor]], near [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. This is the third collection of poems published in contemporary [[Macedonian language]], after [[Venko Markovski]]'s ''Folk Sorrows'' (''Народни бигори'') and ''The Fire'' (''Огинот''), published in 1938.

White Dawns was printed on 25 November at the printing house of Dragutin Schpuler in 4.000 copies. After the established [[Communism|communist]] practice, the title is printed in red. Since there lay a danger in discovering the author's identity, Kosta Solev published the work under the pseudonym "K. Racin" (К. Рацин). The collection quickly gained popularity all over the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and met its greatest success in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

''White Dawns'' comprises 12 poems in the following order:

*''[[Days (Racin)|Days]]'' (''Денови'')
*''[[Sorrow (Racin)|Sorrow]]'' (''Печал'')
*''[[Rural Toil]]'' (''Селска мака'')
*''[[The Tobacco Harvesters]]'' (''Тутуноберачите'')
