Researchers study abiogenesis through a combination of [[molecular biology]], [[paleontology]], [[astrobiology]], [[oceanography]], [[biophysics]], [[geochemistry]] and [[biochemistry]], and aim to determine how pre-life [[chemical reaction]]s gave rise to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voet|Voet|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of abiogenesis can be [[geophysics|geophysical]], [[Chemistry|chemical]], or [[biology|biological]],&lt;ref name="Dyson 1999"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more recent approaches attempting a synthesis of all three,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Davies, Paul |date= 1998 |title= The Fifth Miracle, Search for the origin and meaning of life |publisher= Penguin |page= | isbn= }}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as life arose under conditions that are strikingly different from those on Earth today. Life functions through the specialized chemistry of [[carbon]] and [[water]] and builds largely upon four key families of chemicals: [[lipids]] (fatty cell walls), [[carbohydrates]] (sugars, cellulose), [[amino acid]]s (protein metabolism), and [[nucleic acids]] (self-replicating DNA and RNA). Any successful theory of abiogenesis must explain the origins and interactions of these classes of molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Ward, Peter|author2= Kirschvink, Joe |date= 2015 |title= A New History of Life: the radical discoveries about the origins and evolution of life on earth |publisher= Bloomsbury Press |pages= 39–40 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many approaches to abiogenesis investigate how [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] [[molecule]]s, or their components, came into existence. Researchers generally think that current life on Earth descends from an [[RNA world]],&lt;ref name="RNA" /&gt; although [[RNA]]-based life may not have been the first life to have existed.&lt;ref name="Robertson2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cech2012" /&gt;

The classic 1952 [[Miller–Urey experiment]] and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, the chemical constituents of the [[protein]]s used in all living organisms, can be synthesized from [[inorganic compound]]s under conditions intended to replicate those of the [[History of Earth|early Earth]]. Scientists have proposed various external sources of energy that may have triggered these reactions, including [[lightning]] and [[radiation]].

{{Life timeline}}
The Hadean Earth is thought to have had a [[secondary atmosphere]], formed through [[Degasification|degassing]] of the rocks that accumulated from [[planetesimal]] [[impact event|impactors]]. At first, it was thought that the Earth's [[atmosphere]] consisted of hydrogen compounds—[[methane]], [[ammonia]] and [[Water vapor|water vapour]]—and that life began under such [[redox|reducing]] conditions, which are conducive to the formation of organic molecules. According to later models, suggested by study of ancient minerals, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of [[water vapour]], [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon dioxide]], with smaller amounts of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]], and [[sulfur]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kasting |first=James F. |authorlink=James Kasting |date=12 February 1993 |title=Earth's Early Atmosphere |url=http://wwwdca.iag.usp.br/www/material/fornaro/ACA410/Kasting%201993_EarthEarlyAtmos.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Science |volume=259 |issue=5097 |pages=920–6 |doi=10.1126/science.11536547 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11536547 |accessdate=2015-07-28 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010074651/http://wwwdca.iag.usp.br/www/material/fornaro/ACA410/Kasting%201993_EarthEarlyAtmos.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During its formation, the Earth lost a significant part of its initial mass, with a nucleus of the heavier rocky elements of the protoplanetary disk remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fesenkov|1959|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Earth lacked the [[gravity]] to hold any molecular hydrogen in its atmosphere, and rapidly lost it during the Hadean period, along with the bulk of the original inert gases. The solution of carbon dioxide in water is thought to have made the seas slightly [[acid]]ic, giving it a [[pH]] of about 5.5.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The atmosphere at the time has been characterized as a "gigantic, productive outdoor chemical laboratory."&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt; It may have been similar to the mixture of gases released today by volcanoes, which still support some abiotic chemistry.&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt;

The Hadean environment would have been highly hazardous to modern life. Frequent collisions with large objects, up to {{convert|500|km|mi}} in diameter, would have been sufficient to sterilize the planet and vaporize the ocean within a few months of impact, with hot steam mixed with rock vapour becoming high altitude clouds that would completely cover the planet. After a few months, the height of these clouds would have begun to decrease but the cloud base would still have been elevated for about the next thousand years. After that, it would have begun to rain at low altitude. For another two thousand years, rains would slowly have drawn down the height of the clouds, returning the oceans to their original depth only 3,000 years after the impact event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sleep |first=Norman H. |last2=Zahnle |first2=Kevin J. |authorlink2=Kevin J.

Studies of [[meteorite]]s suggests that [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] such as [[aluminium-26]] with a [[half-life]] of 7.17×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (717 thousand) years, and [[potassium-40]] with a half-life of 1.250×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; (1.25 billion) years, isotopes mainly produced in [[supernova]]e, were much more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2007|pp=61–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal heating as a result of [[Convection#Gravitational or buoyant convection|gravitational sorting]] between the [[Earth core|core]] and the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] would have caused a great deal of [[mantle convection]], with the probable result of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist.

The time periods between such devastating environmental events give time windows for the possible origin of life in the early environments. If the deep marine hydrothermal setting was the site for the origin of life, then abiogenesis could have happened as early as 4.0 to 4.2&amp;nbsp;Ga.

== Conceptual history ==

=== Spontaneous generation ===
{{Main|Spontaneous generation}}
Belief in spontaneous generation of certain forms of life from non-living matter goes back to [[Aristotle]] and [[ancient Greek philosophy]] and continued to have support in Western scholarship until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sheldon|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief was paired with a belief in heterogenesis, i.e., that one form of life derived from a different form (e.g., bees from flowers).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vartanian|1973|pp=307–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical notions of spontaneous generation held that certain complex, living organisms are generated by decaying organic substances. According to Aristotle, it was a readily observable truth that [[aphid]]s arise from the dew that falls on plants, [[fly|flies]] from putrid matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from rotting logs at the bottom of bodies of water, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lennox|2001|pp=229–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, people began to question such assumptions. In 1646, [[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]] published his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' (subtitled ''Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and commonly Presumed Truths''), which was an attack on false beliefs and "vulgar errors." His contemporary, [[Alexander Ross (writer)|Alexander Ross]], erroneously refuted him, stating: "To question this [spontaneous generation], is to question Reason, Sense, and Experience: If he doubts of this, let him go to ''[[Egypt|Ægypt]]'', and there he will finde the fields swarming with mice begot of the mud of ''[[Nile|Nylus]]'', to the great calamity of the Inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Balme |first=D. M. |authorlink=David Mowbray Balme |year=1962 |title=Development of Biology in Aristotle and Theophrastus: Theory of Spontaneous Generation |journal=[[Phronesis (journal)|Phronesis]] |volume=7 |issue=1–2 |pages=91–104 |doi=10.1163/156852862X00052 |issn=0031-8868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1665, [[Robert Hooke]] published the first drawings of a [[microorganism]]. Hooke was followed in 1676 by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], who drew and described microorganisms that are now thought to have been [[protozoa]] and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobell|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many felt the existence of microorganisms was evidence in support of spontaneous generation, since microorganisms seemed too simplistic for [[sexual reproduction]], and [[asexual reproduction]] through [[mitosis|cell division]] had not yet been observed. Van Leeuwenhoek took issue with the ideas common at the time that fleas and lice could spontaneously result from [[putrefaction]], and that frogs could likewise arise from slime. Using a broad range of experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study of insect reproduction he became, by the 1680s, convinced that spontaneous generation was incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bondeson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first experimental evidence against spontaneous generation came in 1668 when [[Francesco Redi]] showed that no [[maggot]]s appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. It was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false. The alternative seemed to be [[biogenesis]]: that every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing (''omne vivum ex ovo'', Latin for "every living thing from an egg").

In 1768, [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] demonstrated that [[microorganism|microbes]] were present in the air, and could be killed by boiling. In 1861, [[Louis Pasteur]] performed a series of experiments that demonstrated that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not spontaneously appear in sterile, nutrient-rich media, but could only appear by invasion from without.

The belief that self-ordering by spontaneous generation was impossible begged for an alternative. By the middle of the 19th century, the theory of biogenesis had accumulated so much evidential support, due to the work of Pasteur and others, that the alternative theory of spontaneous generation had been effectively disproven. [[John Desmond Bernal]], a pioneer in [[X-ray crystallography]], suggested that earlier theories such as spontaneous generation were based upon an explanation that life was continuously created as a result of chance events.&lt;ref name="Bernal 1967"&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
{{Main|Biogenesis}}
The term ''biogenesis'' is usually credited to either [[Henry Charlton Bastian]] or to [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].&lt;ref name=eohtBiogenesis&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Hmolpedia |title=Biogenesis |url=http://www.eoht.info/page/Biogenesis |accessdate=2014-05-19 |publisher=WikiFoundry, Inc. |location=Ancaster, Ontario, Canada |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520001148/http://www.eoht.info/page/Biogenesis |archivedate=20 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastian used the term around 1869 in an unpublished exchange with [[John Tyndall]] to mean "life-origination or commencement". In 1870, Huxley, as new president of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], delivered an address entitled ''Biogenesis and Abiogenesis''.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1968"&gt;{{harvnb|Huxley|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he introduced the term ''biogenesis'' (with an opposite meaning to Bastian's) as well as ''abiogenesis'':

:And thus the hypothesis that living matter always arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter, took definite shape; and had, henceforward, a right to be considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of living matter in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of ''Biogenesis''; and I shall term the contrary doctrine–that living matter may be produced by not living matter–the hypothesis of ''Abiogenesis''.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1968" /&gt;

Subsequently, in the preface to Bastian's 1871 book, ''The Modes of Origin of Lowest Organisms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bastian|1871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastian referred to the possible confusion with Huxley's usage and explicitly renounced his own meaning:

:A word of explanation seems necessary with regard to the introduction of the new term ''Archebiosis''. I had originally, in unpublished writings, adopted the word ''Biogenesis'' to express the same meaning—viz., life-origination or commencement. But in the mean time the word ''Biogenesis'' has been made use of, quite independently, by a distinguished biologist [Huxley], who wished to make it bear a totally different meaning. He also introduced the word ''Abiogenesis''. I have been informed, however, on the best authority, that neither of these words can—with any regard to the language from which they are derived—be supposed to bear the meanings which have of late been publicly assigned to them. Wishing to avoid all needless confusion, I therefore renounced the use of the word ''Biogenesis'', and being, for the reason just given, unable to adopt the other term, I was compelled to introduce a new word, in order to designate the process by which living matter is supposed to come into being, independently of pre-existing living matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bastian|1871|p=[https://ia902701.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/23/items/modesoforiginofl00bast/modesoforiginofl00bast_jp2.zip&amp;file=modesoforiginofl00bast_jp2/modesoforiginofl00bast_0015.jp2&amp;scale=4&amp;rotate=0 xi–xii]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Louis Pasteur and Charles Darwin ===
[[File:Darwin restored2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Head and shoulders portrait, increasingly bald with rather uneven bushy white eyebrows and beard, his wrinkled forehead suggesting a puzzled frown|[[Charles Darwin]] in 1879]]
[[Louis Pasteur]] remarked, about a finding of his in 1864 which he considered definitive, "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oparin|1953|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyndall Fragments2"&gt;{{harvnb|Tyndall|1905|loc=IV, XII (1876), XIII (1878)}}&lt;/ref&gt; One alternative was that life's origins on Earth had come from somewhere else in the universe. Periodically resurrected (see Panspermia, above) Bernal said that this approach "is equivalent in the last resort to asserting the operation of metaphysical, spiritual entities... it turns on the argument of creation by design by a creator or demiurge."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1967|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a theory, Bernal said, was unscientific. A theory popular around the same time was that life was the result of an inner "[[Vitalism|life force]]", which in the late 19th century was championed by [[Henri Bergson]].

The idea of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] put an end to these metaphysical theologies. In a letter to [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] on 1 February 1871,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/darwin/textonly/polar_essay1.jsp |title=Origin and Evolution of Life on a Frozen Earth |last=Priscu |first=John C |authorlink=John Charles Priscu |publisher=[[National Science Foundation]] |location=Arlington County, VA |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218070241/http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/darwin/textonly/polar_essay1.jsp |archivedate=18 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin discussed the suggestion that the original spark of life may have begun in a "warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, {{sic|hide=y|&amp;c.}}, present, that a {{sic|hide=y|[[protein]]e}} compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes." He went on to explain that "at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed." He had written to Hooker in 1863 stating that, "It is mere rubbish, thinking at present of the origin of life; one might as well think of the origin of matter." In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', he had referred to life having been "created", by which he "really meant 'appeared' by some wholly unknown process", but had soon regretted using the Old Testament term "creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=30 18]}}: "It is often said that all the conditions for the first production of a living organism are now present, which could ever have been present. But if (and oh! what a big if!) we could conceive in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, {{sic|hide=y|&amp;c.}}, present, that a {{sic|hide=y|[[protein]]e}} compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed." — [[Charles Darwin]], 1 February 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Primordial soup" hypothesis ===
{{anchor | Haldane and Oparin: The Primordial Soup Theory}}&lt;!--This section is linked from [[The Selfish Gene]]--&gt;
{{Main|Primordial soup}}
{{further|Miller–Urey experiment}}
[[File:Aleksandr Oparin and Andrei Kursanov in enzymology laboratory 1938.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexander Oparin]] (right) in his laboratory, 1938]]
No new notable research or hypothesis on the subject appeared until 1924, when [[Alexander Oparin]] reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevents the synthesis of certain organic compounds that are necessary building blocks for the evolution of life. In his book ''The Origin of Life'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1967|loc=[http://www.valencia.edu/~orilife/textos/The%20Origin%20of%20Life.pdf ''The Origin of Life'' (A. I. Oparin, 1924), pp. 199–234]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oparin|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oparin proposed that the "spontaneous generation of life" that had been attacked by Louis Pasteur did in fact occur once, but was now impossible because the conditions found on the early Earth had changed, and preexisting organisms would immediately consume any spontaneously generated organism. Oparin argued that a "primeval soup" of organic molecules could be created in an oxygenless atmosphere through the action of [[sunlight]]. These would combine in ever more complex ways until they formed [[coacervate]] droplets. These droplets would "[[cell growth|grow]]" by fusion with other droplets, and "[[reproduction|reproduce]]" through fission into daughter droplets, and so have a primitive [[metabolism]] in which factors that promote "cell integrity" survive, and those that do not become extinct. Many modern theories of the origin of life still take Oparin's ideas as a starting point.

[[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] has summarized the "primordial soup" theory of Oparin and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in its "mature form" as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|1987|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The early Earth had a chemically [[reducing atmosphere]].
# This atmosphere, exposed to [[energy]] in various forms, produced simple organic compounds ("[[monomer]]s").
# These compounds accumulated in a "soup" that may have concentrated at various locations (shorelines, [[Hydrothermal vent|oceanic vents]] etc.).
# By further transformation, more complex organic [[polymer]]s – and ultimately life – developed in the soup.

About this time, Haldane suggested that the Earth's prebiotic oceans (quite different from their modern counterparts) would have formed a "hot dilute soup" in which organic compounds could have formed. Bernal called this idea ''biopoiesis'' or ''biopoesis'', the process of living matter evolving from self-replicating but non-living molecules,&lt;ref name="Bernal 1967" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryson|2004|pp=300–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed that biopoiesis passes through a number of intermediate stages.

One of the most important pieces of experimental support for the "soup" theory came in 1952. [[Stanley Miller|Stanley L. Miller]] and [[Harold Urey|Harold C. Urey]] performed an experiment that demonstrated how organic molecules could have spontaneously formed from inorganic precursors under conditions like those posited by the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. The now-famous [[Miller–Urey experiment]] used a highly reducing mixture of gases – [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[hydrogen gas|hydrogen]], as well as [[water vapor|water vapour]] – to form simple organic monomers such as amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Stanley L. |authorlink=Stanley Miller |date=15 May 1953 |title=A Production of Amino Acids Under Possible Primitive Earth Conditions |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=117 |issue=3046 |pages=528–529 |bibcode=1953Sci...117..528M |doi=10.1126/science.117.3046.528 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=13056598}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of gases was cycled through an apparatus that delivered electrical sparks to the mixture. After one week, it was found that about 10% to 15% of the carbon in the system was then in the form of a [[racemic mixture]] of organic compounds, including amino acids, which are the building blocks of [[protein]]s. This provided direct experimental support for the second point of the "soup" theory, and it is around the remaining two points of the theory that much of the debate now centres.

Bernal showed that based upon this and subsequent work there is no difficulty in principle in forming most of the molecules we recognize as the necessary molecules for life from their inorganic precursors. The underlying hypothesis held by Oparin, Haldane, Bernal, Miller and Urey, for instance, was that multiple conditions on the primeval Earth favoured chemical reactions that synthesized the same set of complex organic compounds from such simple precursors. A 2011 reanalysis of the saved vials containing the original extracts that resulted from the Miller and Urey experiments, using current and more advanced analytical equipment and technology, has uncovered more biochemicals than originally discovered in the 1950s. One of the more important findings was 23 amino acids, far more than the five originally found.&lt;ref name="pmid21422282"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Eric T. |last2=Cleaves |first2=Henderson J. |last3=Dworkin |first3=Jason P. |last4=Glavin |first4=Daniel P. |last5=Callahan |first5=Michael |last6=Aubrey |first6=Andrew |last7=Lazcano |first7=Antonio |last8=Bada |first8=Jeffrey L. |display-authors=3 |date=5 April 2011 |title=Primordial synthesis of amines and amino acids in a 1958 Miller H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-rich spark discharge experiment |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/14/5526.full.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Proc.

More recent studies, in October 2017, support the notion that life may have begun right after the Earth was formed as RNA molecules emerging from "warm little ponds".&lt;ref name="IND-20171002"&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnston |first=Ian |title=Life first emerged in 'warm little ponds' almost as old as the Earth itself - Charles Darwin's famous idea backed by new scientific study |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/origins-life-ponds-organisms-earth-age-study-a7978906.html |date=2 October 2017 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003003027/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/origins-life-ponds-organisms-earth-age-study-a7978906.html |archivedate=3 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proteinoid microspheres ===
{{Main|Proteinoid}}
In trying to uncover the intermediate stages of abiogenesis mentioned by Bernal, [[Sidney W. Fox]] in the 1950s and 1960s studied the spontaneous formation of [[peptide]] structures (small chains of amino acids) under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earth's history. In one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, dry spot in prebiotic conditions. He found that, as they dried, the amino acids formed long, often cross-linked, thread-like, submicroscopic [[Peptide|polypeptide]] molecules now named "[[Proteinoid|proteinoid microspheres]]".&lt;ref name="foxexp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/courses/EEB105/lectures/Origins_of_Life/origins.html |title=Part 4: Experimental studies of the origins of life |last=Walsh |first=J.

In another experiment to set suitable conditions for life to form, Fox collected volcanic material from a [[cinder cone]] in [[Hawaii]]. He discovered that the temperature was over {{convert|100|C}} just {{convert|4|in}} beneath the surface of the cinder cone, and suggested that this might have been the environment in which life was created—molecules could have formed and then been washed through the loose volcanic ash into the sea. He placed lumps of lava over amino acids derived from methane, ammonia and water, sterilized all materials, and baked the lava over the amino acids for a few hours in a glass oven. A brown, sticky substance formed over the surface, and when the lava was drenched in sterilized water, a thick, brown liquid leached out. The amino acids had combined to form [[proteinoid]]s, and the proteinoids had combined to form small globules that Fox called "microspheres". His proteinoids were not cells, although they formed clumps and chains reminiscent of [[cyanobacteria]], but they contained no functional [[nucleic acid]]s or any encoded information. Based upon such experiments, [[Colin Pittendrigh|Colin S. Pittendrigh]] stated in December 1967 that "laboratories will be creating a living cell within ten years," a remark that reflected the typical contemporary naivety about the complexity of cell structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|1969|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=wPNPAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Colin+S.+Pittendrigh%22,+%22laboratories+will+be+creating+a+living+cell+within+ten+years%22&amp;dq=%22Colin+S.+Pittendrigh%22,+%22laboratories+will+be+creating+a+living+cell+within+ten+years%22 287]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current models ==
There is no single, generally accepted model for the origin of life. Scientists have proposed several plausible hypotheses, which share some common elements. While differing in the details, these hypotheses are based on the framework laid out by Alexander Oparin (in 1924) and by J. B. S. Haldane (in 1925), who postulated the molecular or chemical evolution theory of life.&lt;ref name="bah2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bahadur |first=Krishna |year=1973 |title=Photochemical Formation of Self–sustaining Coacervates |url=http://www.dli.gov.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b73_455.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy |volume=39B |issue=4 |pages=455–467 |issn=0370-0046 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019172800/http://www.dli.gov.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b73_455.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df= }}

According to later models, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and sulfur compounds;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|1993|p=922}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it did lack molecular oxygen and ozone,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|1993|p=920}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not as chemically reducing as Oparin and Haldane supposed. In the atmosphere proposed by Oparin and Haldane, electrical activity can produce certain small molecules (monomers) of life, such as amino acids. The [[Miller–Urey experiment]] reported in 1953 demonstrated this.

Bernal coined the term ''biopoiesis'' in 1949 to refer to the origin of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he suggested that it occurred in three "stages":

# the origin of biological monomers
# the origin of biological polymers
# the evolution from molecules to cells

Bernal suggested that evolution commenced between stages 1 and 2. Bernal regarded the third stage – discovering methods by which biological reactions were incorporated behind a cell's boundary – as the most difficult. Modern work on the way that [[cell membrane]]s self-assemble, and the work on micropores in various substrates may be a halfway house towards the development of independent free-living cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Martin |first= William F. |authorlink= William F.

Estimates of the production of organics from these sources suggest that the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] before 3.5&amp;nbsp;Ga within the early atmosphere made available quantities of organics comparable to those produced by terrestrial sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chyba |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Chyba |last2=Sagan |first2=Carl |authorlink2=Carl Sagan |date=9 January 1992 |title=Endogenous production, exogenous delivery and impact-shock synthesis of organic molecules: an inventory for the origins of life |journal=Nature |volume=355 |issue=6356 |pages=125–132 |bibcode=1992Natur.355..125C |doi=10.1038/355125a0 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=11538392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furukawa |first1=Yoshihiro |last2=Sekine |first2=Toshimori |last3=Oba |first3=Masahiro |last4=Kakegawa |first4=Takeshi |last5=Nakazawa |first5=Hiromoto |display-authors=3 |date=January 2009 |title=Biomolecule formation by oceanic impacts on early Earth |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=62–66 |bibcode=2009NatGe...2...62F |doi=10.1038/NGEO383 |issn=1752-0894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that the Late Heavy Bombardment may also have effectively sterilized the Earth's surface to a depth of tens of metres. If life evolved deeper than this, it would have also been shielded from the early high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the T Tauri stage of the Sun's evolution. Simulations of geothermically heated oceanic crust yield far more organics than those found in the Miller-Urey experiments (see below). In the deep [[hydrothermal vent]]s, Everett Shock has found "there is an enormous thermodynamic drive to form organic compounds, as [[seawater]] and hydrothermal fluids, which are far from equilibrium, mix and move towards a more stable state."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shock has found that the available energy is maximized at around 100 – 150 degrees Celsius, precisely the temperatures at which the [[Hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]] bacteria and [[Thermoacidophile|thermoacidophilic]] [[archaea]] have been found, at the base of the [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogenetic tree of life]] closest to the [[Last universal ancestor|Last Universal Common Ancestor]] (LUCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bock|Goode|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accumulation and concentration of organic molecules on a planetary surface is also considered an essential early step for the origin of life.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt; Identifying and understanding the mechanisms that led to the production of prebiotic
molecules in various environments is critical for establishing the inventory of ingredients from which life originated on Earth, assuming that the abiotic production of molecules ultimately influenced the selection of molecules from which life emerged.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt;

=== Chemical synthesis ===
While features of [[self-organization]] and [[self-replication]] are often considered the hallmark of living systems, there are many instances of abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper conditions. Stan Palasek suggested based on a theoretical model that self-assembly of [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) molecules can occur spontaneously due to physical factors in hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Palasek |first=Stan |eprint=1305.5581v1 |title=Primordial RNA Replication and Applications in PCR Technology |class=q-bio.BM |date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virus]] self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life,&lt;ref name="pmid16984643"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koonin |first1=Eugene V. |authorlink=Eugene Koonin |last2=Senkevich |first2=Tatiana G. |last3=Dolja |first3=Valerian V. |date=19 September 2006 |title=The ancient Virus World and evolution of cells |journal=[[Biology Direct]] |volume=1 |page=29 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-1-29 |issn=1745-6150 |pmc=1594570 |pmid=16984643}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.&lt;ref name="pmid16044244"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vlassov |first1=Alexander V. |last2=Kazakov |first2=Sergei A. |last3=Johnston |first3=Brian H. |last4=Landweber |first4=Laura F. |display-authors=3 |date=August 2005 |title=The RNA World on Ice: A New Scenario for the Emergence of RNA Information |journal=[[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=264–273 |doi=10.1007/s00239-004-0362-7 |issn=0022-2844 |pmid=16044244|bibcode=2005JMolE..61..264V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nussinov |first1=Mark D. |last2=Otroshchenko |first2=Vladimir A. |last3=Santoli |first3=Salvatore |year=1997 |title=The emergence of the non-cellular phase of life on the fine-grained clayish particles of the early Earth's regolith |journal=[[BioSystems]] |volume=42 |issue=2–3 |pages=111–118 |doi=10.1016/S0303-2647(96)01699-1 |issn=0303-2647 |pmid=9184757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple sources of energy were available for chemical reactions on the early Earth. For example, heat (such as from [[geothermal energy|geothermal]] processes) is a standard energy source for chemistry. Other examples include sunlight and electrical discharges (lightning), among others.&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt; Computer simulations also suggest that [[cavitation]] in primordial water reservoirs such as breaking sea waves, streams and oceans can potentially lead to the synthesis of biogenic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00325 Cavitation-Induced Synthesis of Biogenic Molecules on Primordial Earth].

Sci., September 11, 2017, 3 (9), pp 1041–1049. {{doi|10.1021/acscentsci.7b00325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfavourable reactions can also be driven by highly favourable ones, as in the case of iron-sulfur chemistry. For example, this was probably important for [[carbon fixation]] (the conversion of carbon from its inorganic form to an organic one).&lt;ref group=note&gt;The reactions are:
:FeS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:FeS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCOOH&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon fixation via iron-sulfur chemistry is highly favourable, and occurs at neutral pH and {{convert|100|C}}. Iron-sulfur surfaces, which are abundant near hydrothermal vents, are also capable of producing small amounts of amino acids and other biological metabolites.&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt;

As early as the 1860s, experiments have demonstrated that biologically relevant molecules can be produced from interaction of simple carbon sources with abundant inorganic catalysts.  In particular, experiments by [[Alexander Butlerov|Butlerov]] (the [[formose reaction]]) showed that tetroses, pentoses, and hexoses are produced when formaldehyde is heated under basic conditions with divalent metal ions like calcium.  The reaction was scrutinized and subsequently proposed to be autocatalytic by Breslow in 1959.  Similar experiments (see below) demonstrate that nucleobases like guanine and adenine could be synthesized from simple carbon and nitrogen sources like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia.

[[Formamide]] produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals. Formamide is ubiquitous in the Universe, produced by the reaction of water and [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN). It has several advantages as a biotic precursor, including the ability to easily become concentrated through the evaporation of water.&lt;ref name="Saladino2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saladino |first1=Raffaele |last2=Crestini |first2=Claudia |last3=Pino |first3=Samanta |last4=Costanzo |first4=Giovanna |last5=Di Mauro |first5=Ernesto |display-authors=3 |date=March 2012 |title=Formamide and the origin of life. |journal=[[Physics of Life Reviews]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=84–104 |bibcode=2012PhLRv...9...84S |doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2011.12.002 |issn=1571-0645 |pmid=22196896|hdl=2108/85168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saladino2012b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saladino |first1=Raffaele |last2=Botta |first2=Giorgia |last3=Pino |first3=Samanta |last4=Costanzo |first4=Giovanna |last5=Di Mauro |first5=Ernesto |display-authors=3 |date=July 2012 |title=From the one-carbon amide formamide to RNA all the steps are prebiotically possible |journal=[[Biochimie]] |volume=94 |issue=7 |pages=1451–1456 |doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2012.02.018 |issn=0300-9084 |pmid=22738728}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although HCN is poisonous, it only affects [[aerobic organism]]s ([[eukaryote]]s and aerobic bacteria), which did not yet exist.

=== Autocatalysis ===
{{Main|Autocatalysis}}
[[Autocatalysis|Autocatalysts]] are substances that catalyze the production of themselves and therefore are "molecular replicators." The simplest self-replicating chemical systems are autocatalytic, and typically contain three components: a product molecule and two precursor molecules. The product molecule joins together the precursor molecules, which in turn produce more product molecules from more precursor molecules. The product molecule catalyzes the reaction by providing a complementary template that binds to the precursors, thus bringing them together. Such systems have been demonstrated both in biological [[macromolecule]]s and in small organic molecules.&lt;ref name="Paul2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paul |first1=Natasha |last2=Joyce |first2=Gerald F. |date=December 2004 |title=Minimal self-replicating systems |journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=634–639 |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.09.005 |issn=1367-5931 |pmid=15556408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bissette2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bissette |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Fletcher |first2=Stephen P. |date=2 December 2013 |title=Mechanisms of Autocatalysis |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=52 |issue=49 |pages=12800–12826 |doi=10.1002/anie.201303822 |issn=1433-7851 |pmid=24127341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems that do not proceed by template mechanisms, such as the self-reproduction of [[micelle]]s and [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]], have also been observed.&lt;ref name="Bissette2013" /&gt;

In the early 1970s, Manfred Eigen and [[Peter Schuster]] examined the transient stages between the molecular chaos and a self-replicating [[Hypercycle (chemistry)|hypercycle]] in a prebiotic soup.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eigen|Schuster|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hypercycle, the [[information]] storing system (possibly RNA) produces an [[enzyme]], which catalyzes the formation of another information system, in sequence until the product of the last aids in the formation of the first information system. Mathematically treated, hypercycles could create [[Quasispecies model|quasispecies]], which through natural selection entered into a form of Darwinian evolution. A boost to hypercycle theory was the discovery of [[ribozyme]]s capable of catalyzing their own chemical reactions. The hypercycle theory requires the existence of complex biochemicals, such as nucleotides, which do not form under the conditions proposed by the Miller–Urey experiment.

[[Geoffrey W. Hoffmann]] has shown that an early error-prone translation machinery can be stable against an error catastrophe of the type that had been envisaged as problematical for the origin of life, and was known as "Orgel's paradox".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffmann |first=Geoffrey W. |authorlink=Geoffrey W.

Hoffmann has furthermore argued that a complex nucleation event as the origin of life involving both polypeptides and nucleic acid is compatible with the time and space available in the primitive oceans of Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Geoffrey William|title=A network theory of the origin of life|date=24 December 2016|biorxiv=096701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffmann suggests that volcanic ash may provide the many random shapes needed in the postulated complex nucleation event. This aspect of the theory can be tested experimentally.

=== Homochirality ===
{{Main|Homochirality}}
Homochirality refers to a geometric uniformity of some materials composed of [[chirality|chiral]] units. Chiral refers to nonsuperimposable 3D forms that are mirror images of one another, as are left and right hands. Living organisms use molecules that have the same chirality ("handedness"): with almost no exceptions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaichian|Rojas|Tureanu|2014|pp=353–364}}&lt;/ref&gt; amino acids are left-handed while nucleotides and [[Carbohydrate|sugars]] are right-handed. Chiral molecules can be synthesized, but in the absence of a chiral source or a chiral [[Catalysis|catalyst]], they are formed in a 50/50 mixture of both [[enantiomer]]s (called a racemic mixture). Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystals]], or the Earth's rotation, [[statistical fluctuations]] during racemic synthesis,&lt;ref name="Plasson2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |issn=0899-0042 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]].&lt;ref name="jafarpour2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|pmid=28415353 |bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jafarpour2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=115 |issue=15 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|pmid=26550754 |arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frank1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=11 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-assembled [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] are essential components of primitive cells.&lt;ref name="Chen 2010" /&gt; The [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires that the universe move in a direction in which [[entropy]] increases, yet life is distinguished by its great degree of organization.

Chen and Jack W.

Such cooperative interactions between the membrane and its encapsulated contents could greatly simplify the transition from simple replicating molecules to true cells.&lt;ref name="Chen 2006" /&gt; Furthermore, competition for membrane molecules would favour stabilized membranes, suggesting a selective advantage for the evolution of cross-linked fatty acids and even the [[phospholipid]]s of today.&lt;ref name="Chen 2006" /&gt; Such [[micro-encapsulation]] would allow for metabolism within the membrane, the exchange of small molecules but the prevention of passage of large substances across it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chang|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantages of encapsulation include the increased [[solubility]] of the contained cargo within the capsule and the storage of energy in the form of a [[electrochemical gradient]].

Possible precursors for the evolution of protein synthesis include a mechanism to synthesize short peptide cofactors or form a mechanism for the duplication of RNA. It is likely that the ancestral ribosome was composed entirely of RNA, although some roles have since been taken over by proteins. Major remaining questions on this topic include identifying the selective force for the evolution of the ribosome and determining how the [[genetic code]] arose.&lt;ref name="Noller2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noller |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F.

[[Eugene Koonin]] said, "Despite considerable experimental and theoretical effort, no compelling scenarios currently exist for the origin of replication and translation, the key processes that together comprise the core of biological systems and the apparent pre-requisite of biological evolution. The RNA World concept might offer the best chance for the resolution of this conundrum but so far cannot adequately account for the emergence of an efficient RNA replicase or the translation system. The MWO ["many worlds in one"] version of the cosmological model of [[eternal inflation]] could suggest a way out of this conundrum because, in an infinite [[multiverse]] with a finite number of distinct macroscopic histories (each repeated an infinite number of times), emergence of even highly complex systems by chance is not just possible but inevitable."&lt;ref name="pmc1892545"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koonin |first=Eugene V. |date=31 May 2007 |title=The cosmological model of eternal inflation and the transition from chance to biological evolution in the history of life |journal=Biology Direct |volume=2 |page=15 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-2-15 |issn=1745-6150 |pmc=1892545 |pmid=17540027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RNA synthesis and replication ===
A number of hypotheses of formation of RNA have been put forward. {{As of|1994}}, there were difficulties in the explanation of the abiotic synthesis of the nucleotides cytosine and uracil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orgel |first=Leslie E. |date=October 1994 |title=The origin of life on Earth|journal=Scientific American |volume=271 |issue=4 |pages=76–83 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1094-76 |issn=0036-8733 |pmid=7524147|bibcode=1994SciAm.271d..76O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has shown possible routes of synthesis; for example, formamide produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals.&lt;ref name="Saladino2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saladino2012b" /&gt; Early cell membranes could have formed spontaneously from proteinoids, which are protein-like molecules produced when amino acid solutions are heated while in the correct concentration of aqueous solution. These are seen to form micro-spheres which are observed to behave similarly to membrane-enclosed compartments. Other possible means of producing more complicated organic molecules include chemical reactions that take place on [[clay]] substrates or on the surface of the mineral [[pyrite]].

Factors supporting an important role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store information and to catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression of and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least the components of the RNA molecule under the conditions that approximated the early Earth. Relatively short RNA molecules have been synthesized, capable of replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnston |first1=Wendy K. |last2=Unrau |first2=Peter J. |last3=Lawrence |first3=Michael S. |last4=Glasner |first4=Margaret E. |last5=Bartel |first5=David P. |authorlink5=David Bartel |display-authors=3 |date=18 May 2001 |title=RNA-Catalyzed RNA Polymerization: Accurate and General RNA-Templated Primer Extension |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5520 |pages=1319–1325 |bibcode=2001Sci...292.1319J |doi=10.1126/science.1060786 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11358999|citeseerx=10.1.1.70.5439 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such replicase RNA, which functions as both code and catalyst provides its own template upon which copying can occur.

Depending on the definition, life started when RNA chains began to self-replicate, initiating the three mechanisms of Darwinian selection: [[heritability]], variation of type, and differential reproductive output. The fitness of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely be a function of its intrinsic adaptive capacities, determined by its nucleotide sequence, and the availability of resources.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Byerly |first2=Henry C. |last3=Hopf |first3=Frederick A. |last4=Michod |first4=Richard A. |last5=Vemulapalli |first5=G.

Pyrimidine ribonucleosides and their respective nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries.

One of the earliest incarnations of this idea was put forward in 1924 with Oparin's notion of primitive self-replicating vesicles which predated the discovery of the structure of DNA. Variants in the 1980s and 1990s include Wächtershäuser's iron–sulfur world theory and models introduced by [[Christian de Duve]] based on the chemistry of [[thioester]]s. More abstract and theoretical arguments for the plausibility of the emergence of metabolism without the presence of genes include a mathematical model introduced by [[Freeman Dyson]] in the early 1980s and [[Stuart Kauffman]]'s notion of collectively autocatalytic sets, discussed later that decade.

Orgel summarized his analysis by stating, "There is at present no reason to expect that multistep cycles such as the reductive citric acid cycle will self-organize on the surface of FeS/FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or some other mineral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orgel |first=Leslie E. |date=7 November 2000 |title=Self-organizing biochemical cycles |journal=Proc.

For example, instead of the reductive citric acid cycle, the "open" [[acetyl-CoA]] pathway (another one of the five recognized ways of carbon dioxide fixation in nature today) would be compatible with the idea of self-organization on a metal sulfide surface. The key enzyme of this pathway, [[carbon monoxide dehydrogenase]]/[[CO-methylating acetyl-CoA synthase|acetyl-CoA synthase]], harbours mixed nickel-iron-sulfur clusters in its reaction centres and catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA (similar to acetyl-thiol) in a single step.

Oceanic vent systems and other hydrothermal systems have a zonal structure reflected in ancient [[Volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit|volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits]] (VMS) of hydrothermal origin. They reach many kilometres in diameter and date back to the [[Archean]] Eon. Most abundant are pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chalcopyrite]] (CuFeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), with additions of [[galena]] (PbS) and [[alabandite]] (MnS). ZnS and MnS have a unique ability to store radiation energy, e.g. from UV light. During the relevant time window of the origins of replicating molecules, the primordial atmospheric pressure was high enough (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;bar, about 100 atmospheres) to precipitate near the Earth's surface, and UV irradiation was 10 to 100 times more intense than now; hence the unique photosynthetic properties mediated by ZnS provided just the right energy conditions to energize the synthesis of informational and metabolic molecules and the selection of photostable nucleobases.

The Zn-world theory has been further filled out with experimental and theoretical evidence for the ionic constitution of the interior of the first proto-cells before archaea, bacteria and [[Origin of eukaryotes|proto-eukaryotes]] evolved. [[Archibald Macallum]] noted the resemblance of body fluids such as blood and lymph to seawater;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Macallum |first=A.

The authors conclude that ubiquitous, and by inference primordial, proteins and functional systems show affinity to and functional requirement for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and phosphate. Geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in what we today call marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapour-dominated zones of what we today call inland geothermal systems. Under the oxygen depleted, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of water condensates and exhalations near geothermal fields would resemble the internal milieu of modern cells. Therefore, the precellular stages of evolution may have taken place in shallow "Darwin ponds" lined with porous [[silicate minerals]] mixed with metal sulfides and enriched in K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and phosphorus compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mulkidjanian |first1=Armen Y. |last2=Bychkov |first2=Andrew Yu. |last3=Dibrova |first3=Daria V. |last4=Galperin |first4=Michael Y. |last5=Koonin |first5=Eugene V. |display-authors=3 |date=3 April 2012 |title=Origin of first cells at terrestrial, anoxic geothermal fields |journal=Proc.

The vents form a sustained chemical energy source derived from redox reactions, in which electron donors (molecular hydrogen) react with electron acceptors (carbon dioxide); see [[Iron–sulfur world theory]]. These are highly [[exothermic reaction]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The reactions are:&lt;br /&gt;
'''Reaction 1''': Fayalite + water → magnetite + aqueous silica + hydrogen''
:3Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
'''Reaction 2''': ''Forsterite + aqueous silica → serpentine''
:3Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
'''Reaction 3''': ''Forsterite + water → serpentine + brucite''
:2Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Reaction 3 describes the hydration of olivine with water only to yield [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] and Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[brucite]]). Serpentine is stable at high pH in the presence of brucite like calcium silicate hydrate, ([[calcium silicate hydrate|C-S-H]]) phases formed along with [[portlandite]] (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in hardened [[Portland cement]] paste after the hydration of [[belite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the artificial calcium equivalent of forsterite.

Analogy of reaction 3 with belite hydration in ordinary Portland cement: ''Belite + water → C-S-H phase + portlandite''
:2 Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 3 CaO · 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Russell demonstrated that alkaline vents created an abiogenic [[Proton electromotive force|proton motive force]] (PMF) [[Chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] gradient,&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt; in which conditions are ideal for an abiogenic hatchery for life. Their microscopic compartments "provide a natural means of concentrating organic molecules," composed of iron-sulfur minerals such as [[mackinawite]], endowed these mineral cells with the catalytic properties envisaged by Wächtershäuser.&lt;ref name="Lane 2009" /&gt; This movement of ions across the membrane depends on a combination of two factors:
# [[Diffusion]] force caused by concentration gradient—all particles including ions tend to diffuse from higher concentration to lower.
# Electrostatic force caused by electrical potential gradient—[[cations]] like [[proton]]s H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tend to diffuse down the electrical potential, [[anions]] in the opposite direction.
These two gradients taken together can be expressed as an [[electrochemical gradient]], providing energy for abiogenic synthesis. The proton motive force can be described as the measure of the potential energy stored as a combination of proton and voltage gradients across a membrane (differences in proton concentration and electrical potential).

Jack W. Szostak suggested that geothermal activity provides greater opportunities for the origination of life in open lakes where there is a buildup of minerals. In 2010, based on spectral analysis of sea and hot mineral water, Ignat Ignatov and Oleg Mosin demonstrated that life may have predominantly originated in hot mineral water. The hot mineral water that contains [[bicarbonate]] and [[calcium]] ions has the most optimal range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ignatov |first=Ignat |last2=Mosin |first2=Oleg V. |year=2013 |title=Possible Processes for Origin of Life and Living Matter with modeling of Physiological Processes of Bacterium ''Bacillus Subtilis'' in Heavy Water as Model System |journal=Journal of Natural Sciences Research |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=65–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case is similar to the origin of life in hydrothermal vents, but with bicarbonate and calcium ions in hot water. This water has a pH of 9–11 and is possible to have the reactions in seawater. According to [[Melvin Calvin]], certain reactions of condensation-dehydration of amino acids and nucleotides in individual blocks of peptides and nucleic acids can take place in the primary hydrosphere with pH 9-11 at a later evolutionary stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Calvin|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these compounds like [[Hydrogen cyanide|hydrocyanic acid]] (HCN) have been proven in the experiments of Miller. This is the environment in which the [[stromatolite]]s have been created.

Experimental research and computer modelling suggest that the surfaces of mineral particles inside hydrothermal vents have catalytic properties similar to those of enzymes and are able to create simple organic molecules, such as [[methanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH) and [[Formic acid|formic]], [[Acetic acid|acetic]] and [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvic]] acid out of the dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the water.&lt;ref name="organics"&gt;{{cite press release |last=Usher |first=Oli |date=27 April 2015 |title=Chemistry of seabed's hot vents could explain emergence of life |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/silva/mathematical-physical-sciences/maps-news-publication/maps1526 |publisher=[[University College London]] |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roldan |first1=Alberto |last2=Hollingsworth |first2=Nathan |last3=Roffey |first3=Anna |last4=Islam |first4=Husn-Ubayda |last5=Goodall |first5=Josephine B.

=== Thermosynthesis ===
Today's bioenergetic process of [[fermentation]] is carried out by either the aforementioned citric acid cycle or the Acetyl-CoA pathway, both of which have been connected to the primordial Iron–sulfur world. In a different approach, the thermosynthesis hypothesis considers the bioenergetic process of [[chemiosmosis]], which plays an essential role in [[cellular respiration]] and photosynthesis, more basal than fermentation: the [[ATP synthase]] enzyme, which sustains chemiosmosis, is proposed as the currently extant enzyme most closely related to the first metabolic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Anthonie W. J. |date=7 August 1985 |pages=429–453 |title=Thermosynthesis by biomembranes: Energy gain from cyclic temperature changes |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=115 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(85)80202-2 |issn=0022-5193 |pmid=3162066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Anthonie W.

First, life needed an energy source to bring about the condensation reaction that yielded the peptide bonds of proteins and the [[phosphodiester bond]]s of RNA. In a generalization and thermal variation of the [[ATP synthase#Binding-change model|binding change mechanism]] of today's ATP synthase, the "first protein" would have bound substrates (peptides, phosphate, nucleosides, RNA 'monomers') and condensed them to a reaction product that remained bound until after a temperature change it was released by thermal unfolding.

The energy source under the thermosynthesis hypothesis was thermal cycling, the result of suspension of protocells in a [[convection]] current, as is plausible in a volcanic hot spring; the convection accounts for the self-organization and [[Dissipative system|dissipative structure]] required in any origin of life model. The still ubiquitous role of thermal cycling in germination and cell division is considered a relic of primordial thermosynthesis.

By [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylating]] cell membrane lipids, this "first protein" gave a selective advantage to the lipid protocell that contained the protein. This protein also synthesized a library of many proteins, of which only a minute fraction had thermosynthesis capabilities. As proposed by Dyson,&lt;ref name="Dyson 1999" /&gt; it propagated functionally: it made daughters with similar capabilities, but it did not copy itself. Functioning daughters consisted of different amino acid sequences.

Whereas the Iron–sulfur world identifies a circular pathway as the most simple, the thermosynthesis hypothesis does not even invoke a pathway: [[ATP synthase#Binding-change model|ATP synthase's binding change mechanism]] resembles a physical adsorption process that yields free energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muller |first1=Anthonie W.

It has been claimed that the emergence of cyclic systems of protein catalysts is implausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Orgel|1987|pp=9–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clay hypothesis ===
[[Montmorillonite]], an abundant [[clay]], is a catalyst for the polymerization of RNA and for the formation of membranes from lipids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Perry |first=Caroline |date=7 February 2011 |title=Clay-armored bubbles may have formed first protocells |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-02/hu-cbm020411.php |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |agency=EurekAlert! |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714101638/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-02/hu-cbm020411.php |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A model for the origin of life using clay was forwarded by [[Graham Cairns-Smith|Alexander Graham Cairns-Smith]] in 1985 and explored as a plausible mechanism by several scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|1996|pp=148–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clay hypothesis postulates that complex organic molecules arose gradually on pre-existing, non-organic replication surfaces of silicate crystals in solution.

At the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], James P. Ferris' studies have also confirmed that clay minerals of [[montmorillonite]] catalyze the formation of RNA in aqueous solution, by joining nucleotides to form longer chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wenhua Huang |last2=Ferris |first2=James P. |date=12 July 2006 |title=One-Step, Regioselective Synthesis of up to 50-mers of RNA Oligomers by Montmorillonite Catalysis |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=128 |issue=27 |pages=8914–8919 |doi=10.1021/ja061782k |issn=0002-7863 |pmid=16819887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Bart Kahr from the [[University of Washington]] and colleagues reported their experiments that tested the idea that crystals can act as a source of transferable information, using crystals of [[potassium hydrogen phthalate]]. "Mother" crystals with imperfections were cleaved and used as seeds to grow "daughter" crystals from solution. They then examined the distribution of imperfections in the new crystals and found that the imperfections in the mother crystals were reproduced in the daughters, but the daughter crystals also had many additional imperfections. For gene-like behaviour to be observed, the quantity of inheritance of these imperfections should have exceeded that of the mutations in the successive generations, but it did not. Thus Kahr concluded that the crystals "were not faithful enough to store and transfer information from one generation to the next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=Caroline |date=16 July 2007 |title=Crystals as genes? |url=http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2007/08/Crystals_as_genes.asp |journal=Highlights in Chemical Science |issn=2041-5818 |accessdate=2015-06-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714094855/http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2007/08/Crystals_as_genes.asp |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}

=== Gold's "deep-hot biosphere" model ===
In the 1970s, [[Thomas Gold]] proposed the theory that life first developed not on the surface of the Earth, but several kilometres below the surface. It is claimed that discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our Solar System would lend significant credence to this theory. Thomas Gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that the flow of such food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms [[Microbial metabolism#Hydrogen oxidation|subsist on hydrogen]] released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.

The panspermia hypothesis does not attempt to explain how life first originated, but merely shifts it to another planet or a comet. The advantage of an extraterrestrial origin of primitive life is that life is not required to have formed on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a single location, and then spread about the [[galaxy]] to other star systems via cometary and/or meteorite impact.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth’s Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=12 September 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=12 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912225220/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |archivedate=12 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence to support the hypothesis is scant, but it finds support in studies of [[Martian meteorite]]s found in [[Antarctica]] and in studies of [[extremophile]] microbes' survival in outer space tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Stuart |date=25 September 2002 |title=Tough Earth bug may be from Mars |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2844 |journal=New Scientist |issn=0262-4079 |accessdate=2015-06-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202003401/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2844 |archivedate=2 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerda Horneck"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horneck |first1=Gerda |last2=Klaus |first2=David M. |last3=Mancinelli |first3=Rocco L. |date=March 2010 |title=Space Microbiology |journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=121–156 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00016-09 |issn=1092-2172 |pmc=2832349 |pmid=20197502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabbow"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rabbow |first1=Elke |last2=Horneck |first2=Gerda |last3=Rettberg |first3=Petra |last4=Schott |first4=Jobst-Ulrich |last5=Panitz |first5=Corinna |last6=L'Afflitto |first6=Andrea |last7=von Heise-Rotenburg |first7=Ralf |last8=Willnecker |first8=Reiner |last9=Baglioni |first9=Pietro |last10=Hatton |first10=Jason |last11=Dettmann |first11=Jan |last12=Demets |first12=René |last13=Reitz |first13=Günther |display-authors=3 |date=December 2009 |title=EXPOSE, an Astrobiological Exposure Facility on the International Space Station – from Proposal to Flight |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=581–598 |bibcode=2009OLEB...39..581R |doi=10.1007/s11084-009-9173-6 |issn=0169-6149 |pmid=19629743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Onofri |first1=Silvano |last2=de la Torre |first2=Rosa |last3=de Vera |first3=Jean-Pierre |last4=Ott |first4=Sieglinde |last5=Zucconi |first5=Laura |last6=Selbmann |first6=Laura |last7=Scalzi |first7=Giuliano |last8=Venkateswaran |first8=Kasthuri J. |last9=Rabbow |first9=Elke |last10=Sánchez Iñigo |first10=Francisco J. |last11=Horneck |first11=Gerda |display-authors=3 |date=May 2012 |title=Survival of Rock-Colonizing Organisms After 1.5 Years in Outer Space |journal=Astrobiology |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=508–516 |bibcode=2012AsBio..12..508O |doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0736 |issn=1531-1074 |pmid=22680696}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[List of microorganisms tested in outer space]].)

These molecules were not present on early Earth, but other [[Amphiphile|amphiphilic]] long-chain molecules also form membranes. Furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves the same size and composition of lipids in the two [[Offspring|progenies]]. The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage, and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favourably. Studies on vesicles from potentially prebiotic amphiphiles have so far been limited to systems containing one or two types of amphiphiles. This in contrast to the output of simulated prebiotic chemical reactions, which typically produce very heterogeneous mixtures of compounds.&lt;ref name="Chen 2010" /&gt;
Within the hypothesis of a lipid bilayer membrane composed of a mixture of various distinct amphiphilic compounds there is the opportunity of a huge number of theoretically possible combinations in the arrangements of these amphiphiles in the membrane. Among all these potential combinations, a specific local arrangement of the membrane would have favoured the constitution of a hypercycle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eigen |first1=Manfred |authorlink1=Manfred Eigen |last2=Schuster |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Schuster |date=November 1977 |title=The Hypercycle.

=== Polyphosphates ===
A problem in most scenarios of abiogenesis is that the thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is in the direction of separate amino acids. What has been missing is some force that drives polymerization. The resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of [[polyphosphate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Michael R.

Several mechanisms of organic molecule synthesis have been investigated. Polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides. They are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). A key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble [[calcium phosphate]] ([[apatite]]), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate. There has been much work on this topic over the years, but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pasek |first=Matthew A. |date=22 January 2008 |title=Rethinking early Earth phosphorus geochemistry |journal=Proc.

=== Radioactive beach hypothesis ===
Zachary Adam claims that tidal processes that occurred during a time when the Moon was much closer may have concentrated grains of [[uranium]] and other radioactive elements at the high-water mark on primordial beaches, where they may have been responsible for generating life's building blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dartnell |first=Lewis |date=12 January 2008 |title=Did life begin on a radioactive beach? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726384.000-did-life-begin-on-a-radioactive-beach.html |journal=New Scientist |issue=2638 |page=8 |issn=0262-4079 |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627101858/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726384.000-did-life-begin-on-a-radioactive-beach.html |archivedate=27 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to computer models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adam |first=Zachary |year=2007 |title=Actinides and Life's Origins |journal=Astrobiology |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=852–872 |bibcode=2007AsBio...7..852A |doi=10.1089/ast.2006.0066 |issn=1531-1074 |pmid=18163867}}&lt;/ref&gt; a deposit of such radioactive materials could show the same [[Natural nuclear fission reactor|self-sustaining nuclear reaction]] as that found in the [[Oklo]] uranium ore seam in [[Gabon]]. Such radioactive beach sand might have provided sufficient energy to generate organic molecules, such as amino acids and sugars from [[acetonitrile]] in water. Radioactive [[monazite]] material also has released soluble phosphate into the regions between sand-grains, making it biologically "accessible." Thus amino acids, sugars, and soluble phosphates might have been produced simultaneously, according to Adam. Radioactive [[actinide]]s, left behind in some concentration by the reaction, might have formed part of [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic complexes]]. These complexes could have been important early catalysts to living processes.

John Parnell has suggested that such a process could provide part of the "crucible of life" in the early stages of any early wet rocky planet, so long as the planet is large enough to have generated a system of plate tectonics which brings radioactive minerals to the surface. As the early Earth is thought to have had many smaller plates, it might have provided a suitable environment for such processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parnell |first=John |date=December 2004 |title=Mineral Radioactivity in Sands as a Mechanism for Fixation of Organic Carbon on the Early Earth |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=533–547 |bibcode=2004OLEB...34..533P |doi=10.1023/B:ORIG.0000043132.23966.a1 |issn=0169-6149 |pmid=15570707|citeseerx=10.1.1.456.8955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermodynamic dissipation ===
The 19th-century Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] first recognized that the struggle for existence of living organisms was neither over raw material nor [[energy]], but instead had to do with [[entropy production]] derived from the conversion of the solar [[spectrum]] into [[heat]] by these systems.&lt;ref&gt;Boltzmann, L. (1886) The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in: Ludwig Boltzmann: Theoretical physics and Selected writings, edited by: McGinness, B., D. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Boltzmann thus realized that living systems, like all [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible processes]], were dependent on the [[dissipation]] of a generalized chemical potential for their existence. In his book "What is Life", the 20th-century Austrian physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]]&lt;ref&gt;Schrödinger, Erwin (1944) What is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the importance of Boltzmann’s deep insight into the irreversible thermodynamic nature of living systems, suggesting that this was the physics and chemistry behind the origin and evolution of life. However, irreversible processes, and much less living systems, could not be conveniently analyzed under this perspective until [[Lars Onsager]],&lt;ref&gt;Onsager, L. (1931) Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes I and II, ''Phys. Rev.'' 37, 405; 38, 2265 (1931)&lt;/ref&gt; and later Ilya [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine]],&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I. (1967) An Introduction to the Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, Wiley, New York&lt;/ref&gt; developed an elegant mathematical formalism for treating the "self-organization" of material under a generalized chemical potential. This formalism became known as Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics and Prigogine was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1977 "for his contributions to [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]], particularly the theory of [[Dissipative system|dissipative structures]]". The analysis of Prigogine showed that if a [[system]] were left to evolve under an imposed external potential, material could spontaneously organize (lower its [[entropy]]) forming what he called "dissipative structures" which would increase the dissipation of the externally imposed potential (augment the global entropy production). Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has since been successfully applied to the analysis of living systems, from the biochemical production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dewar | first1 = R | last2 = Juretić | first2 = D. | last3 = Županović | first3 = P. | year = 2006 | title = The functional design of the rotary enzyme ATP synthase is consistent with maximum entropy production | url = | journal = Chem.

Michaelian has shown using the formalism of non-linear irreversible thermodynamics that there would have existed during the [[Archean]] a thermodynamic imperative to the abiogenic UV-C [[Photochemistry|photochemical]] synthesis and proliferation of these pigments over the entire Earth surface if they acted as [[Catalysis|catalysts]] to augment the dissipation of the solar photons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/475/1/012010 |title=A non-linear irreversible thermodynamic perspective on organic pigment proliferation and biological evolution |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=475 |issue=1 |pages=012010 |year=2013 |last1=Michaelian |first1=K |bibcode=2013JPhCS.475a2010M |arxiv=1307.5924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Archean, with life-induced [[ozone]] dissipating UV-C light in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, it would have become ever more improbable for a completely new life to emerge that didn’t rely on the complex metabolic pathways already existing since now the free energy in the photons arriving at Earth’s surface would have been insufficient for direct breaking and remaking of [[covalent bond]]s. It has been suggested, however, that such changes in the surface flux of ultraviolet radiation due to geophysical events affecting the atmosphere could have been what promoted the development of complexity in life based on existing metabolic pathways, for example during the [[Cambrian explosion]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Doglioni | first1 = C. | last2 = Pignatti | first2 = J. | last3 = Coleman | first3 = M. | year = 2016 | title = Why did life develop on the surface of the Earth in the Cambrian? | url = | journal = Geoscience Frontiers | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 865–873 | doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many salient characteristics of the fundamental molecules of life (those found in all three domains) all point directly to the involvement of UV-C light in the dissipative structuring of incipient life.&lt;ref name="Michaelian, K. 2016"/&gt; Some of the most difficult problems concerning the origin of life, such as enzyme-less [[DNA replication|replication]] of RNA and DNA, [[homochirality]] of the fundamental molecules, and the origin of [[Genetic code|information encoding]] in RNA and DNA, also find an explanation within the same dissipative thermodynamic framework by considering the probable existence of a relation between primordial replication and UV-C photon dissipation. Michaelian suggests that it is erroneous to expect to describe the emergence, proliferation, or even evolution, of life without overwhelming reference to entropy production through the dissipation of a generalized chemical potential, in particular, the prevailing solar photon flux.

=== Multiple genesis ===
Different forms of life with variable origin processes may have appeared quasi-simultaneously in the early [[history of Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davies |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Davies |date=December 2007 |title=Are Aliens Among Us? |url=http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/kalthoff/bio301c/readings/07Davies.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Scientific American |volume=297 |issue=6 |pages=62–69 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1207-62 |issn=0036-8733 |accessdate=2015-07-16 |quote=...if life does emerge readily under terrestrial conditions, then perhaps it formed many times on our home planet. To pursue this possibility, deserts, lakes and other extreme or isolated environments have been searched for evidence of "alien" life-forms—organisms that would differ fundamentally from known organisms because they arose independently. |bibcode=2007SciAm.297f..62D |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185832/http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/kalthoff/bio301c/readings/07Davies.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other forms may be extinct (having left distinctive fossils through their different biochemistry—e.g., [[hypothetical types of biochemistry]]). It has been proposed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first organisms were self-replicating iron-rich clays which fixed carbon dioxide into oxalic and other [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. This system of replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then evolved into the sulfide rich region of the hotspring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen. Finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. If biosynthesis recapitulates biopoiesis, then the synthesis of amino acids preceded the synthesis of the purine and pyrimidine bases. Furthermore the polymerization of the amino acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization of amino acid esters by polynucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hartman |first=Hyman |date=October 1998 |title=Photosynthesis and the Origin of Life |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=28 |issue=4–6 |pages=515–521 |bibcode=1998OLEB...28..515H |doi=10.1023/A:1006548904157 |issn=0169-6149 |pmid=11536891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Fluctuating hydrothermal pools on volcanic islands or proto-continents ===
[[Armid Mulkidjanian]] and co-authors think that the marine environments did not provide the [[ionic balance]] and composition universally found in cells, as well as of ions required by essential proteins and ribozymes found in virtually all living organisms, especially with respect to K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratio, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and phosphate concentrations. The only known environments that mimic the needed conditions on Earth are found in [[terrestrial hydrothermal pool]]s fed by steam vents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, mineral deposits in these environments under an anoxic atmosphere would have suitable pH (as opposed to current pools in an oxygenated atmosphere), contain precipitates of sulfide minerals that block harmful UV radiation, have wetting/drying cycles that concentrate substrate solutions to concentrations amenable to spontaneous formation of polymers of nucleic acids, polyesters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chandru |first1=Kuhan |last2=Guttenberg |first2=Nicholas |last3=Giri |first3=Chaitanya |last4=Hongo |first4=Yayoi |last5=Butch |first5=Christopher |last6=Mamajanov |first6=Irena |last7=Cleaves |first7=H.

[[Bruce Damer]] and [[David Deamer]] have come to the conclusion that [[cell membrane]]s cannot be formed in salty [[seawater]], and must therefore have originated in freshwater. Before the continents formed, the only dry land on Earth would be volcanic islands, where rainwater would form ponds where lipids could form the first stages towards cell membranes. These predecessors of true cells are assumed to have behaved more like a [[superorganism]] rather than individual structures, where the porous membranes would house molecules which would leak out and enter other protocells. Only when true cells had evolved would they gradually adapt to saltier environments and enter the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Damer |first1=Bruce |last2=Deamer |first2=David |date=13 March 2015 |title=Coupled Phases and Combinatorial Selection in Fluctuating Hydrothermal Pools: A Scenario to Guide Experimental Approaches to the Origin of Cellular Life |journal=Life |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=872–887 |doi=10.3390/life5010872 |issn=2075-1729 |pmc=4390883 |pmid=25780958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colín-García ''et al.'' (2016) discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hydrothermal vents as primitive environments.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; They mention the exergonic reactions in such systems could have been a source of free energy that promoted chemical reactions, additional to their high mineralogical diversity which implies the induction of important chemical gradients, thus favoring the interaction between electron donors and acceptors. Colín-García ''et al.'' (2016) also summarize a set of experiments proposed to test the role of hydrothermal vents in prebiotic synthesis.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

=== Information theory ===
A theory that speaks to the origin of life on Earth and other rocky planets posits life as an [[Information theory|information system]] in which information content grows because of selection. Life must start with minimum possible information, or minimum possible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, and it requires thermodynamically free energy accessible by means of its information content. The most benign circumstances, minimum [[entropy]] variations with abundant free energy, suggest the [[Characterisation of pore space in soil|pore space]] in the first few kilometres of the surface. Free energy is derived from the condensed products of the chemical reactions taking place in the cooling nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Colgate| first=S.

'''Autowaves''' &lt;!-- ({{lang-ru|Автоволны}}&lt;ref group = "note" name="P002"/&gt;) --&gt; are self-supporting &lt;!-- [[Нелинейная волна|нелинейные волны]] --&gt; non-linear waves in [[Active medium|active media]] (i.e. those that provide distributed energy sources). The term is generally used in processes where the waves carry relatively low energy, which is necessary for synchronization or switching the active medium.

== Introduction ==

=== Relevance and significance ===

{{centered pull quote|Autowaves (AW) are distributed analogues of the [[self-oscillation]] observed in pointwise systems. Examples of them are the combustion waves, nerve impulses, waves of distribution tunnel transition (in semiconductors), etc. '''Autowave processes''' (AWP) underlie the majority of processes of management and information transfer in biological systems. (...) An interesting feature of the active media is that '''[[Dissipative structures|autowave structures]]''' (AWS) can occur in them. (...) The importance of this work is as follows &lt;br&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Both AW and AWS can occur in systems of any physical nature, the [[System dynamics|dynamics]] of which is described by [[Parabolic partial differential equation|equations (1)]].&lt;br&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;This is a new type of [[Dynamical system|dynamic processes]] that give a rise to the macroscopic linear scale through local interactions, each of which does not have a linear scale &lt;br&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;AWS give the basis of [[morphogenesis]] in living organisms (i.e. in biological systems). &lt;br&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;An appearing of AWS is a new mechanism of [[turbulence]] in active environments.

In 1980, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet scientists]] G.R. Ivanitsky, V.I. Krinsky, A.N. Zaikin, [[Anatoly Zhabotinsky|A.M. Zhabotinsky]],&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Zaikin-1970"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Zhabotinsky-1973"/&gt;&lt;ref group = "B:" name="b-Zhabotinsky-1974"/&gt; [[Boris Pavlovich Belousov|B.P. Belousov]] became winners of the highest state award of the [[USSR]], [[:ru:Лауреаты Ленинской премии|Lenin Prize]] "''for the discovery of a new class of autowave processes and the study of them in disturbance of stability of the distributed excitable systems''."

=== A brief history of autowave researches ===

The first who studied actively the [[Self-exciting oscillation|self-oscillations]] was Academician [[Aleksandr Andronov|AA Andronov]], and the term "''auto-oscillations''" in Russian terminology was introduced by AA Andronov in 1928. His followers&lt;ref group = "note" name="P003"/&gt; from [[N. I. Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod|Lobachevsky University]] further contributed greatly to the development of ''autowave theory''.

The simplest autowave equations describing combustion processes have been studied by [[Andrey Kolmogorov|A.N. Kolmogorov]],&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kolmogorov-1937"/&gt; I.E. Petrovsky, [[:ru:Пискунов, Николай Семёнович|N.S. Piskunov]] in 1937., as well as by [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|Ya.B. Zel'dovich]] и [[David A. Frank-Kamenetskii|D.A. Frank-Kamenetsky]]&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Zeldovich-1938"/&gt; in 1938.

The classical axiomatic model with autowaves in myocardium was published in 1946 by [[Norbert Wiener]] and [[Arturo Rosenblueth]].&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Wiener-1946"/&gt;

During 1970-80, major efforts to study autowaves were concentrated in the [[Institute of Biological Physics in Pushchino|Institute of Biological Physics]] of [[Russian Academy of Sciences|the USSR Academy of Sciences]], located in the suburban town [[Pushchino]], near Moscow. It was here, under the guidance of V.I.Krinsky,  such world-famous now experts in the field of the autowave researches as A.V.Panfilov, I.R.Efimov, R.R.Aliev, K.I. Agladze, O.A.Mornev, M.A.Tsyganov were educated and trained. V.V.Biktashev, Yu.E. Elkin, A.V. Moskalenko gained their experience with the autowave theory also in Pushchino, in the neighboring [[Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology]], under the guidance of E.E.Shnoll.

{{centered pull quote|The term "autowave processes" for all these (and other) phenomena was coined by the USSR physicist R.V. Khokhlov. There are definite and important relations between these autowaves and ideas from synergetics and self-organisation. |author= V. A. Vasiliev etc. (1987)|source=&lt;ref group="B:" name=" b-Yakhno-1987en"/&gt;}}

The term "''autowaves''" was proposed, probably, on the analogy of previously "''auto-oscillations''".

Almost immediately after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]], many of these Russian scientists left their native country for working in foreign institutions, where they still continue their studies of autowaves. In particular,  E.R.Efimov is developing the ''theory of virtual electrode'',&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Efimov-2004"/&gt; which describes some effects occurring during [[defibrillation]].

Among other notable scientists, who are engaged in these investigation, there are A.N. Zaikin and E.E.Shnoll (autowaves and [[bifurcation memory]] in the blood coagulation system);&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2002ufn"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2007ufn"/&gt; A.Yu.

A huge role in the study of autowave models of cardiac tissue belongs to [[Denis Noble]] and members of his team from the [[University of Oxford]].

=== The basic definitions ===

One of the first definitions of autowaves was as follows: {{centered pull quote|It is accepted now to consider an autowave as some self-sustaining wave process in a non-equilibrium environment that remain unchanged for sufficiently small changes in both the initial and boundary conditions. (...) Mathematical apparatus for describing autowaves often are [[Reaction-diffusion|the equations of the diffusion type with an active nonlinearity]].

Под автоволнами принято сейчас понимать самоподдерживающийся волновой процесс в неравновесной среде, остающийся неизменным при достаточно малых изменениях как начальных, так и граничных условий. (...) Математическим аппаратом для описания автоволн чаще всего служат уравнения диффузионного типа с активной нелинейностью.  {{hidden end}}

Unlike linear waves — such as sound waves, electromagnetic waves and other, which are inherent in [[conservative system]]s and mathematically described by linear second order [[Hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic equations]] ([[wave equation]]s), — dynamics of an ''autowave'' in terms of [[differential equations]] can be described by [[Parabolic partial differential equation|parabolic equation]] ''with nonlinear free member of a special form''.

The concrete form of the free member &lt;math&gt;\vec{f}(\vec{u})&lt;/math&gt; is extremely important, because: {{centered pull quote|
...all wave processes generated by the nonlinear dynamics of a point system &lt;math&gt;\dot{\vec{u}}  = \vec{f}(\vec{u})&lt;/math&gt;, which is a self-oscillating or potentially self-oscillating.

Commonly, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; have the form of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-shaped dependence on &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;.{{clarify|reason=A picture or math definition would be helpful. Is u a scalar in this case? Is the Allen-Cahn_equation (see Wikipedia article) an example of N-shaped dependence?|date=April 2015}} In this sense, the system of equations, known as the Aliev–Panfilov model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Aliev-1996"/&gt; is a very exotic example, because &lt;math&gt;f(u)&lt;/math&gt; has in it a very complex form of two intersecting parabolas, besides more crossed with two straight lines, resulting in a more pronounced nonlinear properties of this model.

''Autowaves'' is an example of a self-sustaining wave process in extensive nonlinear systems containing distributed energy sources. It is correct for simple autowaves, that period, wavelength, propagation speed, amplitude, and some other characteristics of an autowave are determined solely by local properties of the medium. However, in the 21st century, researchers began to discover a growing number of examples of self-wave solutions when the "classical" principle is violated.

(See also general information in literature, for example, in&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Krinsky-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Yakhno-1987en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-SE_v01-1988"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Loskutov-1995"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2006"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2002ufn"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Fazli-2007ufn"/&gt;).

=== The simplest examples ===

[[File:Travelling wave for Fisher equation.svg|thumb|right|A switching wave front solution for Fisher's equation (See [[Reaction-diffusion]] for details).]]
The simplest model of autowave is a rank of dominoes that are falling one after another, if you drop an outermost one (so called "[[domino effect]]"). This is an example of a ''switching wave''.

As another example of autowaves, imagine that you stand on a field and set fire to the grass. While the temperature is below the threshold, the grass will not take fire. Upon reaching the ''threshold'' temperature ([[autoignition temperature]]) the [[combustion]] process begins, with the release of heat sufficient to ignite the nearest areas. The result is that the combustion front has been shaped, which spreads through the field. It can be said in such cases that autowave arose, which is one of the results of [[self-organization]] in non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. After some time new grass replaces the burnt grass, and the field acquires again the ability for igniting. This is an example of an ''excitation wave''.

There are a great deal of other natural objects that are also considered among autowave processes: oscillatory [[chemical reaction]]s in active media (e.g., [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]]), the spread of excitation pulses along nerve fibres, wave chemical signalling in the colonies of certain microorganisms, autowaves in [[ferroelectric]] and [[semiconductor]] films, population waves, spread of [[epidemics]] and of [[genes]], and many other [[phenomena]].

Nerve impulses, which serve as a typical example of autowaves in an active medium with recovery, were studied as far back as 1850 by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]. The properties of nerve impulses that are typical for the simplest self-wave solutions (universal shape and amplitude, independent of the initial conditions, and annihilation under collisions) were ascertained in the 1920s and 1930s.

[[File:Action potential.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic of an [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] recording of an action potential showing the various phases that occur as the wave passes a point on a cell [[biological membrane|membrane]].]]
Let's consider a 2D active medium consisting of elements, each of which can be found in three different states: rest, excitation and [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractoriness]]. In the absence of external influence, elements are at rest. As a result of an influence upon it, when the concentration of the activator reaches the threshold, the element will switch to an excited state, acquiring the ability to excite the neighbouring elements. Some time after the excitation the element switches to a refractory state, in which it cannot be excited. Then the element return to its initial state of rest, gaining again the ability to transform into an excited state.

Any "classical" excitation wave moves in an excitable medium without attenuation, maintaining its shape and amplitude constant. As it passes, the energy loss ([[dissipation]]) is completely offset by the energy input from the elements of the active medium. The leading front of an autowave (the transition from rest to a state of excitation) is usually very small: for example, the ratio of the leading front duration to the entire duration of the pulse for a myocardium sample is about 1:330.

Unique opportunities to study the autowave processes in two- and three-dimensional active media with very different kinetics are provided with methods of mathematical modelling using computers. For computer simulation of autowaves, one uses a generalized Wiener–Rosenblueth model, as well as a large number of other models, among which a special place is occupied by The [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]]  (the simplest model of an active medium, and its various versions) and The [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] (nerve impulse). There are also many autowave myocardial models: The [[Beeler–Reuter model]], several Noble models (developed by [[Denis Noble]]), The [[Aliev–Panfilov model]], The [[Fenton-Karma model]], etc.

=== Basic properties of autowaves ===

It was also proven&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kokoz-1973"/&gt; that the simplest autowave regimes should be common to every system of differential equations of any complexity that describe a particular active media, because such a system can be simplified to two differential equations.

== Main known autowave objects ==

First of all, we should notice, that the elements of the active media can be, at least, of three very different types; these are ''[[Self-exciting oscillation|self-exciting]]'', ''[[Excitable medium|excitable]]'' and ''[[wikt:trigger|trigger]]'' (or ''bistable'') regimes. Accordingly, there are three types of homogeneous active media composed of these elements.

A bistable element has two stable stationary states, transitions between which occur when external influence exceeds a certain threshold. In media of such elements, ''switching waves'' arise, which switch the medium from one of its states to the other. For instance, a classic case of such a switching autowave — perhaps, the simplest autowave phenomena — is falling dominoes (the example already given). Another simple example of a bistable medium is burning paper: the switching wave propagates in the form of a flame, switching paper from the normal state to its ashes.

An excitable element has only one stable stationary state. External influence over a threshold level can bring such an element out of its stationary state and perform an evolution before the element will return again to its stationary state. During such evolution, the active element can affect the adjacent elements and, in turn, lead them out of the stationary state too. As a result,  the ''excitation wave'' propagates in this medium. This is the most common form of autowaves in biological media, such as nervous tissue, or the myocardium.

[[File:Typical phase portraits of autowaves.gif|thumb|300px|right|Phase portraits (left column) and the corresponding behaviour (right column) of an element of an active medium:  '''A''' (upper row) — excitable, '''B''' — bistable, '''C''' (lower row) — self-oscillating element types.]]
A self-oscillating element has no stationary states and continually performs stable oscillations of some fixed form, amplitude and frequency. External influence can disturb these oscillations. After some relaxation time, all their characteristics except for the phase back to its stable value, but the phase can be changed. As a result, the ''phase waves'' spread in the medium of such elements. Such phase waves can be observed in electro-garlands or in certain chemical media. An example of a self-oscillating medium is the SA node in the heart, in which excitation pulses arise spontaneously.

It can be clearly seen on the phase portrait of the basic system of equations describing the active medium (see Fig.) that a significant difference between these three types of behaviour of an active medium is caused by the quantity and the position of its singular points. The shape of autowaves observed in reality can be very similar to each other, and therefore it can be difficult to assess the type of element only by the form of the excitation pulse.

Besides, autowave phenomena, which can be observed and investigated, depend greatly on geometrical and topological peculiarities of an active medium.

=== One-dimensional autowaves ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

One-dimensional cases include autowave spread in cable and its spread in the ring, with the latter mode considering as a limiting case of a rotating wave in two-dimensional active medium, while the first case is considered as spread of the autowave in the ring with zero curvature (i.e., with an infinite radius).

=== Two-dimensional autowaves ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

[[File:reaction diffusion spiral.gif|thumb|265px|left|Autowave reverberator found in the above two-component [[Reaction-diffusion|reaction-diffusion system]] of [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model|Fitzhugh-Nagumo]] type.]]
A number of autowave sources is known in the two-dimensional active media. In such a way, it is distinguished at least five type of re-entry,&lt;ref group="note" name="P001"/&gt; which are ''running around the ring'', ''spiral wave'', ''reverberator'' (i.e., ''two-dimensional autowave vortex'') and ''fibrillation''. The literature identifies two types of sources of ''concentric autowaves'' in 2D active media; these are ''pacemakers'' and ''leading centres''. Both the ''leading centres'' and ''reverberators'' are interesting, because they are not tied to the structure of the medium and can appear and disappear in its different parts. Areas of increased automation may also be an example of a sources of autowaves. Three different types of increased automation are known now:&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt;
# ''induced automatism''
# ''trigger automatism with the mechanism of early postdepolarisation''
# ''trigger automatism with the mechanism of late postdepolarisation''.

=== The population autowaves ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

{{centered pull quote|Collective amoebae [[Dictyostelium discoideum]] with a sufficient supply live as [[unicellular organism]]s. However, during starvation they crawl together with forming a [[multicellular organism]], which later gives [[spores]] that can survive under adverse conditions. It was found that the movement of amoebae is controlled by distribution of some substance, [[morphogen]] [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]],  in the environment. Such amoeba cells synthesize and accumulate the molecules of cAMP and then they are able to "release" this reserve into the environment, if the concentration of cAMP in it increased. The released quantity of cAMP diffuses through the environment and makes the following cell amoebas "snap into action" by throwing their portion of the morphogen out. As a result, an autowave of high concentration of cAMP spreads through the environment. After the passage of the wave, the "discharged" cells begin to accumulate a new portion of cAMP again, due to the synthesis, and after a while they are able to "snap into action" again.Thus, the population of the ''collective amoebae'' is a typical example of the [[active medium]].

Коллективные амёбы [[Dictyostelium discoideum]] при наличие достаточного питания живут в виде [[:ru:Одноклеточный организм|одноклеточных организмов]]. Однако при голодании они сползаются и образуют [[:ru:Многоклеточный организм]], который впоследствии даёт [[:ru:споры]], способные пережить неблагоприятные условия. Установлено, что движение амёб управляется распределением по среде некоторого вещества — ''морфогена'' [[:ru:Циклический аденозинмонофосфат|цАМФ]]. Клетки амёб синтезируют и накапливают в себе молекулы цАМФ и способны «высвободить» его запас в окружающую среду, если концентрация цАМФ в ней повысилась. Освободившееся количество цАМФ распространяется за счёт диффузии по среде и заставляет следующие клетки амёб «сработать», выбросив свою порцию морфогена. В результате по среде распространяется автоволна — повышенная концентрация цАМФ. После прохождения волны «разрядившиеся» клетки начинают вновь накапливать за счёт синтеза определённую порцию цАМФ и по прошествии некоторого времени способны «срабатывать» вновь. Таким образом, популяция ''коллективных амёб'' служит типичным примером активной среды. {{hidden end}}

&lt;ref name="P001"&gt;Now the sad role of re-entry as the causes of various cardiac arrhythmias is well recognized. The basic scheme re-entry was proposed as long ago as 1914, with being obtained in studies of isolated cardiac tissue rings (GR Mines — Trans.R.Soc.Can., 1914, 8, 43).  T.Lewis etc. demonstrated in 1921 that atrial flutter may be conditioned by the circulation of the excitation wave down the right and up the left atrium (Heart, 1921, 8, 361). This fact was again confirmed experimentally in the middle of 20th century by C.E.Cabrera and D.Soli-Pollares (Arch. Inst. Cardiol. Mex., 1947, 17,850). The essential role of re-entry as a pathogenetic mechanism of supraventricular tachycardia was suggested in 1928 by F.O.Schmidt and J.Erlanger (Am. J. Physiol. 1928-1929, 87, 326). It is also responsible for many types of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baroque''' ({{IPAc-en|US|b|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|b|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|k}}) is a highly ornate and often extravagant [[Style (visual arts)|style]] of architecture, art and music that flourished in Europe from the early 17th until the mid-18th century.  It followed the [[Renaissance style]] and preceded the [[Rococo]] (in the past often referred to as "late Baroque") and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] styles. It was encouraged by the [[Catholic Church]] as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of [[Protestant]] architecture, art and music, though [[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]] developed in parts of Europe as well.&lt;ref name="Heal2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=1 December 2011|title=‘Better Papist than Calvinist’: Art and Identity in Later Lutheran Germany|journal=German History|publisher=German History Society|volume=29|issue=4|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baroque style used contrast, movement,  exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur and surprise to achieve a sense of awe.  The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome,  then spread rapidly to France, northern Italy, Spain and Portugal, then to Austria and southern Germany. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called ''[[rocaille]]'' or ''[[Rococo]]'', which appeared in France and central Europe until the mid to late 18th century.

==Origin of word==
The word ''baroque'' was a Portuguese term for a pearl (barocco) with an irregular shape. Cognates for the term in other Romance languages include: ''barroco'' in Portuguese, ''barrueco''&lt;!--Antes de corregir esto al "barroco", por favor, verifique la fuente citada, y tenga en cuenta que esta palabra es un sustantivo que significa "perla barroca".--&gt; in Spanish, and ''barocco'' in Italian.&lt;ref&gt; Oxford English Dictionary on-line definition of Baroque&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in French to describe pearls in a 1531 inventory of [[Charles V of France|Charles V's]] treasures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=CMdwCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR28&amp;lpg=PR28&amp;dq=baroque+1531+Oxford+English+Dictionary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zptCm4Wxki&amp;sig=45xkAmnoROBehwvsaY3xADkg_jc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE1rnTsNDYAhULtRQKHZrrBXQQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=baroque%201531%20Oxford%20English%20Dictionary&amp;f=false Michael Meere, ''French Renaissance and Baroque Drama: Text, Performance, Theory''], Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015, {{ISBN|1611495490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the term was usually used to describe music.  In an anonymous satirical review of the première of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'' in October 1733, which was printed in the ''[[Mercure de France]]'' in May 1734, the critic wrote that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque", complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was unsparing with dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.&lt;ref&gt;Claude V. Palisca, "Baroque". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who was a musician and composer as well as philosopher,  wrote in 1768 in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'':   "Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word 'baroco' used by logicians."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedie"&gt;''Encyclopedie''; ''Lettre sur la Musique Francaise'' under the direction of [[Denis Diderot]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was first used to describe the period of art that followed the [[Renaissance]] in 1855 by the Swiss art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] in an article in the journal ''[[Cicerone|Le Cicerone]]''. He used the term to attack the movement for subverting the values of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Owen, "Les Styles en Architecture'', (2014), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "style baroque" did not enter into the [[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française|dictionary]] of the [[Académie française]] until 1878, when it lost its original negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Panofsky |first=Erwin |chapter=What is Baroque? |title=Three Essays on Style |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1995 |page=19 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1888, the art historian [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] published the first serious academic work on the style, ''Renaissance und Barock'', which described the differences between the painting, sculpture, and architecture of the Renaissance and the Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Owen, ''Les Styles en Architecture'' (2014), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture: origins and characteristics==
{{Main|Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Triumph of the Name of Jesus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''Quadratura'' or [[trompe-l'œil]]  ceiling of the Church of the Jesu, Rome, by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]] (1669–1683)]]
The Baroque style of architecture was a result of doctrines adopted by the [[Catholic Church]] at the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545–63, in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The first phase of the [[Counter-Reformation]] had imposed a severe, academic style on religious architecture, which had appealed to intellectuals but not the mass of churchgoers.  The Council of Trent decided instead to appeal to a more popular audience, and declared that the arts should communicate religious themes with direct and emotional involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, J. Quentin (1953). [http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.01(1952-55)/MH.1(1953)2/orig05.pdf The Influence of Italian Mannerism Upon Maltese Architecture]. ''Melitensiawath''. Retrieved 8 July 2016. pp. 104–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'' (Belmont, CA: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2005), p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]] developed as a confessional marker of identity, in response to the [[Iconoclastic Fury|Great Iconoclasm]] of [[Calvinist]]s.&lt;ref name="2018Heal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/reformation-lutheran-baroque/|title=The Reformation and Lutheran baroque|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=20 February 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|accessdate=1 May 2018|quote=However, the writings of theologians can go only so far towards explaining the evolution of confessional consciousness and the shaping of religious identity. Lutheran attachment to religious images was a result not only of Luther’s own cautious endorsement of their use, but also of the particular religious and political context in which his Reformation unfolded. After the reformer’s death in 1546, the image question was fiercely contested once again. But as Calvinism, with its iconoclastic tendencies, spread, Germany’s Lutherans responded by reaffirming their commitment to the proper use of religious images. In 1615, Berlin’s Lutheran citizens even rioted when their Calvinist rulers removed images from the city’s Cathedral.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque churches were designed with a large central space, where the worshippers could be close to the altar, with a dome or cupola high overhead, allowing light to illuminate the church below. The dome was one of the central symbolic features of baroque architecture illustrating the union between the heavens and the earth, The inside of the cupola was lavishly decorated with paintings of angels and saints, and with stucco statuettes of angels, giving the impression to those below of looking up at heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
Another feature of baroque churches are the ''quadratura''; [[trompe-l'œil]] paintings on the ceiling in stucco frames, either real or painted, crowded with paintings of saints and angels and connected by architectural details with the balustrades and consoles. ''Quadratura'' paintings of [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlantes]] below the cornices appear to be supporting the ceiling of the church.  Unlike the painted ceilings of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, which combined different scenes, each with its own perspective,  to be looked at one at a time, the Baroque ceiling paintings were carefully created so the viewer on the floor of the church would see the entire ceiling in correct perspective, as if the figures were real.

The interiors of baroque churches became more and more ornate in the High Baroque,  and focused around the altar, usually placed under the dome.  The most celebrated baroque decorative works of the High Baroque are the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] (1647–53) and the [[St. Peter's Baldachin|Baldachino of St. Peter]] (1623–34), both by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. The Baldequin of St. Peter is an example of the balance of opposites in Baroque art; the gigantic proportions of the piece, with the apparent lightness of the canopy; and the contrast between the solid twisted columns, bronze, gold and marble of the piece with the flowing draperies of the angels on the canopy.&lt;ref name="Ducher pages 106-107"&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] serves as a prominent example of Lutheran Baroque art, which was completed in 1743 after being commissioned by the Lutheran city council of Dresden and was "compared by eighteenth-century observers to St Peter’s in Rome".&lt;ref name="Heal2011"/&gt;

The twisted column in the interior of churches is one of the signature features of the Baroque. It gives both a sense of motion and also a dramatic new way of reflecting light.
The [[cartouche (design)|cartouche]] was another characteristic feature of baroque decoration.  These were large plaques of carved of marble or stone, usually oval and with a rounded surface, which carried images or text in gilded letters, and were placed as interior decoration or above the doorways of buildings, delivering messages to those below. They showed a wide variety of invention, and were found in all types of buildings, from cathedrals and palaces to small chapels.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque architects sometimes used forced perspective to create illusions.  For the [[Palazzo Spada]] in Rome, Borromini used columns of diminishing size, a narrowing floor and a miniature statue in the garden beyond to create the illusion that a passageway was thirty meters long, when it was actually only seven meters long. A statue at the end of the passage appears to be life-size, though it is only sixty centimeters high. Borromini designed the illusion with the assistance of a mathematician.

===Italian Baroque architecture===
[[File:Basilica di San Pietro in Vaticano September 2015-1a.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Facade of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (early 17th century)]]
[[File:Santa Maria della Salute in Venice 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Santa Maria della Salute]], Venice (1631–1687)]]
The first building in Rome to have a Baroque facade was the [[Church of the Gesù]] in 1584; it was plain by later Baroque standards, but marked a break with the traditional Renaissance facades that preceded it. The interior of this church remained very austere until the high Baroque, when it was lavishly ornamented.

In Rome in 1605, [[Paul V]] became the first of series of [[popes]] who commissioned basilicas and church buildings designed to inspire emotion and awe through a proliferation of forms, and a richness of colors and dramatic effects.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) page 12&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most influential monuments of the Early Baroque were the facade of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1606–1619), and the new nave and loggia which connected the facade to Michelangelo's dome in the earlier church. The new design created a dramatic contrast between the soaring dome and the disproportionately wide facade, and the contrast on the facade itself between the Doric columns and the great mass of the portico.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 17th century the style reached its peak, later termed the High Baroque. Many monumental works were commissioned by Popes [[Urban VIII]] and [[Alexander VII]]. The sculptor and architect [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] designed a new quadruple colonnade around St. Peter's Square (1656 to 1667). The three galleries of columns in a giant ellipse balance the oversize dome and give the Church and square a unity and the feeling of a giant theater.&lt;ref name="Ducher page 104"&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major innovator of the Italian High Baroque was [[Francesco Borromini]], whose major work was the Church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] or Saint Charles of the Four Fountains (1634–46).  The sense of movement is given not by the decoration, but by the walls themselves, which undulate and by concave and convex elements, including an oval tower and balcony inserted into a concave traverse. The interior was equally revolutionary; the main space of the church was oval, beneath an oval dome.&lt;ref name="Ducher page 104"/&gt;

Painted ceilings, crowded with angels and saints and [[trompe-l'œil]] architectural effects, were an important feature of the Italian High Baroque. Major works included ''The Entry of Saint Ignace into Paradise'' by [[Andrea Pozzo]] (1685–1695) in the [[Sant'Ignazio Church, Rome|Church of Saint Ignatius]] in Rome, and ''The triumph of the name of Jesus'' by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]] in the [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome (1669–1683), which featured figures spilling out of the picture frame and dramatic oblique lighting and light-dark contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) page 15&lt;/ref&gt;
The style spread quickly from Rome to other regions of Italy:  It appeared in Venice in the church of [[Santa Maria della Salute]] (1631–1687) by [[Baldassare Longhena]], a highly original octagonal form crowned with an enormous cupola.  It appeared also in Turin, notably in the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]]  (1668–1694) by [[Guarino Guarini]]. The style also began to be used in palaces;  Guarini designed the [[Palazzo Carignano]] in Turin, while Longhena designed the [[Ca' Rezzonico]] on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]], (1657), finished by [[Giorgio Massari]] with decorated with paintings by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pages 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  A series of massive earthquakes in [[Sicily]] required the rebuilding of most of the, and several were built in the exuberant late Baroque or Rococo style.

===Spanish Baroque architecture===
{{Main|Spanish Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Basílica de Santiago 02.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The towers of the Cathedral of [[Santiago de Compostela]] by [[Fernando de Casas Novoa]] (1680 (center tower) and 1738–50)]]
[[File:Palacio San Telmo facade Seville Spain.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Palace of San Telmo]], [[Seville]] (1682)]]
The Catholic Church in Spain, and particularly the Jesuits, were the driving force of Spanish Baroque architecture.  The first major work in the style was the San Isidro Chapel in [[Madrid]], begun in 1643 by [[Pedro de la Torre]].  It contrasted an extreme richness of ornament on the exterior with simplicity in the interior, divided into multiple spaces and using effects of light to create a sense of mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) page 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cathedral in [[Santiago de Compostela]] was modernized with a series of Baroque additions beginning at the end of the 17th century, starting with a highly-ornate bell tower (1680), then flanked by two even taller and more ornate towers, called the ''Obradorio'', added between 1738 and 1750 by [[Fernando de Casas Novoa]]. Another landmark of the Spanish Baroque is the chapel tower of the [[Palace of San Telmo]] in [[Seville]] by [[Leonardo de Figueroa]].&lt;ref name="Cabanne pages 48-51"&gt;Cabanne (1988) pgs. 48–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Granada]] had only been liberated from the Moors in the 15th century, and had its own distinct variety of Baroque.  The painter, sculptor and architect [[Alonso Cano]] designed the Baroque interior of [[Granada Cathedral]] between 1652 and his death in 1657.  It features dramatic contrasts of the massive white columns and gold decor.

Some of the most and ornamental and lavishly decorated architecture of the period was designed by the brothers [[Churriguera]], who worked primarily in [[Salamanca]] and Madrid. The [[Church of San Esteban (Salamanca)|Church of San Esteban]] in Salamanca (1693) is one of the most ornate baroque churches anywhere. Their other works include the buildings on the city's main square, the [[Plaza Mayor, Salamanca|Plaza Mayor of Salamanca]] (1729).&lt;ref name="Cabanne pages 48-51"/&gt;

Other notable Spanish baroque architects of the late Baroque include [[Pedro de Ribera]], a pupil of Churriguera, who designed the Royal Hospice of San Fernando in Madrid, and [[Narciso Tomé]], who designed the celebrated [[El Transparente]] altarpiece at [[Toledo Cathedral]] (1729–32) which gives the illusion, in certain light, of floating upwards.&lt;ref name="Cabanne pages 48-51"/&gt;

The architects of the Spanish Baroque had an effect far beyond Spain;  their work was highly influential in the churches built in the Spanish colonies in Latin America and the Philippines. The Church built by the Jesuits for a college in [[Tepotzotlán]], with its ornate Baroque facade and tower, is a good example.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Europe and ''Rococo'' (1740s–1770s)===
{{Main|Rococo}}
[[File:Chram sv Mikulase interier oltar od vchodu.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9| [[St. Nicholas Church (Malá Strana)]] Prague (1704–1755)]]
[[File:Austria - Vienna (28492836465).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Karlskirche]], Vienna, by [[Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach]] (1732–1737)]]
[[File:Wies altar.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Wiesekirche in Bavaria by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] (1745–1754)]]
From 1680 to 1750,  many highly ornate cathedrals, abbeys, and pilgrimage churches were built in central Europe, in Bavaria, Austria, and what is now the Czech Republic.  Some were in [[Rococo]] style,  a distinct, more flamboyant and asymmetric style which emerged out of the Baroque, then replaced it in Central Europe in the first half of the 18th century, until it was replaced in turn by classicism.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''La Caractéristique des Styles'' (2014), page 92&lt;/ref&gt; 

The princes of the multitude of states in that region also chose Baroque or Rococo for their palaces and residences, and often used Italian-trained architects to construct them.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pp. 89–94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable architects included Johann Fischer von Erlach, [[Lukas von Hildebrandt]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] in Bavaria, [[Balthasar Neumann]] in [[Brühl (Rhineland)|Bruhl]], and [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]] in Dresden. In Prussia, [[Frederic II of Prussia]] was inspired the [[Grand Trianon]] of the [[Palace of Versailles]], and used it as the model for his summer residence, [[Sanssouci]], in [[Potsdam]], designed for him by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]] (1745–1747). Another work of baroque palace architecture is the [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] in [[Potsdam]], the former orangerie of the palace of the Dukes of [[Saxony]] in the 18th century.

One of the best examples of a rococo church is the Basilika Vierzehnheiligen, or [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]], a pilgrimage church located near the town of [[Bad Staffelstein]] near Bamberg, in [[Bavaria]], southern Germany. The Basilica was designed by [[Balthasar Neumann]] and was constructed between 1743 and 1772, its plan a series of interlocking circles around a central oval with the altar placed in the exact center of the church. The interior of this church illustrates the summit of Rococo decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable example of the style is the Pilgrimage Church of Wies ({{lang-de|Wieskirche}}). It was designed by the brothers [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann|J. B.]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann]]. It is located in the foothills of the [[Alps]], in the municipality of [[Steingaden]] in the [[Weilheim-Schongau]] district, [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the [[Wessobrunner School]]. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

Another notable example is the [[St. Nicholas Church (Malá Strana)]] in Prague (1704–55), built by [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]] and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]]. Decoration covers all of walls of interior of the church. The altar is placed in the nave beneath the central dome, and surrounded by chapels,  Light comes down from the dome above and from the surrounding chapels. The altar is entirely surrounded by arches, columns, curved balustrades and pilasters of colored stone, which are richly decorated with statuary, creating a deliberate confusion between the real architecture and the decoration.  The architecture is transformed into a theater of light, color and movement.&lt;ref name="Ducher pages 106-107"/&gt;

===French Baroque or ''Classicism''===
{{main|French Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Château de Balleroy 25.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chateau de Balleroy]] by [[François Mansart]] (1626–1636)]]
[[File:Château de Versailles 04 2016 5737.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palace of Versailles]] (begun by [[Louis Le Vau]] in 1661)]]
France largely resisted the ornate baroque style of Italy, Spain, Vienna and the rest of Europe. The French Baroque style (often termed ''Grand Classicism'' or simply ''Classicism''  in France) is closely associated with the works built for [[Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV]]; it features more geometric order and measure than baroque, and less elaborate decoration on the facades and in the interiors.  Louis XIV invited the master of baroque, Bernini, to submit a design for the new wing of the Louvre, but rejected it in favor of a more classical design by [[Claude Perrault]] and [[Louis Le Vau]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) pages 25–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal architects of the style included [[François Mansart]] ([[Chateau de Balleroy]], 1626–1636), [[Pierre Le Muet]] (Church of [[Val-de-Grace]], 1645–1665), [[Louis Le Vau]] ([[Vaux-le-Vicomte]], 1657–1661) and especially [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] and [[Robert de Cotte]], whose work included the [[Galerie des Glaces]] and the [[Grand Trianon]] at Versailles (1687–1688). Mansart was also responsible for the Baroque-classicism of the [[Place Vendôme]] (1686–1699).&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pgs. 25–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major work of the period was the [[Palace of Versailles]], begun in 1661 by Le Vau with decoration by the painter [[Charles Le Brun]]. The gardens were designed by [[André Le Nôtre]] specifically to complement and amplify the architecture. The Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors), the centerpiece of the château, with paintings by Le Brun, was constructed between 1678 and 1686. Mansart completed the Grand Trianon in 1687. The chapel, designed by de Cotte, was finished in 1710. Following the death of Louis XIV, Louis XV added the more intimate [[Petit Trianon]] and the highly ornate theater. The fountains in the gardens were designed to be seen from the interior, and to add to the dramatic effect. The palace was admired and copied by other monarchs of Europe, particularly [[Peter the Great]] of Russia, who visited Versailles early in the reign of Louis XV, and built his own version at [[Peterhof Palace]] near Saint Petersburg, between 1705 and 1725.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pgs. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Baroque===
[[File:Catherine Palace in Tsarskoe Selo 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The [[Catherine Palace]] by [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] (1752-)]]
[[File:The Great Church of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, iconostasis.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Great Church of the [[Winter Palace]] in St. Petersburg, by Rastrelli (1753–1759)]]
The debut of Russian Baroque, or [[Petrine Baroque]], followed a long visit of [[Peter the Great]] to western Europe in 1697–98,  where he visited the Chateaux of Fontainebleu and Versailles and other architectural monuments.  He decided, on his return to Russia, to construct similar monuments in St. Petersburg, when he moved the Russian capital there in 1712. Early major monuments in the Petrine baroque include the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] and [[Menshikov Palace]].
During the reign of [[Empress Anna]] and [[Elizaveta Petrovna]], Russian architecture was dominated by the luxurious baroque style of [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]; called [[Elizabethan Baroque]]. Rastrelli's signature buildings include the [[Winter Palace]], the [[Catherine Palace]] and the [[Smolny Cathedral]]. Other distinctive monuments of the Elizabethan Baroque are the bell tower of the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] and the [[Red Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;* William Craft Brumfield.

Baroque painters worked deliberately to set themselves apart from the painters of the Renaissance and the Mannerism period after it.  In their palette, they used intense and warm colors, and particularly made use of the [[primary colors]] red, blue and yellow, frequently putting all three in close proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt;   In their lighting, they avoided the even lighting of Renaissance painting and used strong contrasts of light and darkness on certain parts of the picture to direct attention to the central actions or figures.  In their composition, they avoided the tranquil scenes of Renaissance paintings, and chose the moments of the greatest movement and drama.  Unlike the tranquil faces of Renaissance paintings, the faces in Baroque paintings clearly expressed their emotions.  They often used asymmetry, with action occurring away from the center of the picture, and created axes that were neither vertical or horizontal, but slanting to the left or right, giving a sense of instability and movement.  They enhanced this impression of movement by having the costumes of the personages blown by the wind, or moved by their own gestures. The overall impressions were movement, emotion and drama.&lt;ref&gt;Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pgs. 3–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Another essential element of baroque painting was allegory; every painting told a story and had a message, often encrypted in symbols and allegorical characters, which an educated viewer was expected to know and read.&lt;ref&gt;Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Baroque painters were the Italians the Caracci brothers, [[Annibale Caracci| Annibale]] and [[Agostino Caracci|Agostino]], in the last score of the 16th century, and [[Caravaggio]] in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio's realistic approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.    Other major painters associated closely with the Baroque style include [[Guido Reni]], [[Domenichino]], [[Andrea Pozzo]], and [[Paolo de Matteis]] in Italy; [[Francisco de Zurbarán]] in Spain; [[Adam Elsheimer]] in Germany; and [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Georges de La Tour]] in France (though Poussin spent most of his working life in Italy).  Poussin and La Tour adopted a "classical" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the line of the figures in the painting than colour.  

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] was the most important painter of the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] style.  Rubens' highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, color, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Rubens specialized in making altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and [[history painting]]s of mythological and allegorical subjects.

One important domain of Baroque painting was ''Quadratura'', or paintings in ''[[trompe-l'oeil]]'', which literally "fooled the eye".  These were usually painted on the stucco of ceilings or upper walls and balustrades, and gave the impression to those on the ground looking up were that they were seeing the heavens populated with crowds of angels saints, and other heavenly figures, set against painted skies and imaginary architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''La Caractéistique des Styles'' (2014), pg. 92 &lt;/ref&gt;  

In Italy, artists often collaborated with architects on interior decoration; [[Pietro da Cortona]] was one of the painters of the 17th century who employed this illusionist way of painting. Among his most important commissions were the frescoes he painted for the [[Palazzo Barberini|Palace of the Barberini family]] (1633–39), to glorify the reign of [[Pope Urban VIII]].  Pietro da Cortona’s compositions were the largest decorative frescoes executed in Rome since the work of Michelangelo at the [[Sistine Chapel]]. .&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pages 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Boucher]] was an important figure in the more delicate French Rococo style, which appeared during the late Baroque period.  He designed tapestries, carpets and theater decoration as well as painting.  His work was extremely popular with [[Madame Pompadour]], the Mistress of King [[Louis XV]]. His paintings featured mythological romantic, and mildly erotic themes.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) pp. 102–104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LouisXIV-Bernini.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Bust of [[Louis XIV]] by Bernini, Versailles (1665)]]
The dominant figure in baroque sculpture was [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].  Under the patronage of [[Pope Urban VIII]], he made a remarkable series of monumental statues of saints and figures whose faces and gestures vividly expressed their emotions, as well as portrait busts of exceptional realism, and highly decorative works for the Vatican, including the imposing [[Chair of St. Peter]] beneath the dome in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]  In addition, he designed fountains with monumental groups of sculpture to decorate the major squares of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, ''La Sculpture baroque italienne'' (1999), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque sculpture was particularly inspired by ancient Roman statuary, particularly by the famous statue of [[Laocoön]] from the First Century A.D., which was on display in the gallery of the Vatican.  When he visited Paris in 1665, Bernini addressed the students at the Academy of painting and sculpture, he advised the students to work from classical models, rather than from nature.  He told the students, "When I had trouble with my first statue, i consulted the ''Antinous'' like an oracle."&lt;ref&gt;Boucher (1999) page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable late French baroque sculptors included [[Étienne Maurice Falconet]] and [[Jean Baptiste Pigalle]].  Pigalle was commissioned by [[Frederick the Great]] to make statues for Frederick's own version of Versailles at [[Sanssouci]] in [[Potsdam]], Germany. Falconet also received an important foreign commission, creating the famous statue of [[Peter the Great]] on horseback found in St. Petersburg.

In Spain, the sculptor [[Francisco Salzillo]] worked exclusively on religious themes, using polychromed wood. Some of the finest baroque sculptural craftsmanship was found in the gilded stucco altars of churches of the Spanish colonies of the New World, made by local craftsmen; examples include the Rosary Chapel of the Church of Santo Domingo in Oaxaca, Mexico (1724–31).

==Music and ballet==

[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Antonio Vivaldi]], (1678–1741)]]
The term ''Baroque'' is also used to designate the style of music composed during a period that overlaps with that of Baroque art. The first uses of the term 'baroque' for music were criticisms.  In an anonymous, satirical review of the première in October 1733 of Rameau's ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]],'' printed in the ''Mercure de France'' in May 1734, the critic implied that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque," complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.{{sfn|Palisca|2001}} [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who was a musician and noted composer as well as philosopher, made a very similar observation in 1768 in the famous ''Encylopedié'' of [[Denis Diderot]]:   "Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word 'baroco' used by logicians."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedie"/&gt;

Common use of the term for the music of the period began only in 1919, by [[Curt Sachs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sachs |first1=Curt |authorlink1=Curt Sachs |title=Barockmusik |trans-title=Baroque Music |series=Jahrbuch der Musikbibliothek Peters |volume=26 |year=1919 |publisher=Edition Peters |location=Leipzig |language=German|pages=7–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not until 1940 that it was first used in English in an article published by [[Manfred Bukofzer]].{{sfn|Palisca|2001}}

The baroque was a period of musical experimentation and innovation. New forms were invented, including the [[concerto]] and [[sinfonia]]. [[Opera]] was born in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with [[Jacopo Peri]]'s mostly lost ''[[Dafne]]'', produced in [[Florence]] in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe:   Louis XIV created the first Royal Academy of Music,  In 1669, the poet [[Pierre Perrin]] opened an academy of opera in Paris, the first opera theater in France open to the public, and premiered ''[[Pomone (opera)|Pomone]]'', the first grand opera in French, with music by [[Robert Cambert]], with five acts, elaborate stage machinery, and a ballet.&lt;ref name="Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde"&gt;Bély, Lucien, ''Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde'' (2005), pp. 152–54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Schütz]] in Germany, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in France, and [[Henry Purcell]] in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century.

The classical ballet also originated in the Baroque era. The style of court dance was brought to France by [[Marie de Medici]], and in the beginning the members of the court themselves were the dancers. [[Louis XIV]] himself performed in public in several ballets. In March 1662, the [[Académie Royale de Danse]], was founded by the King.  It was the first professional dance school and company,  and set the standards and vocabulary for ballet throughout Europe during the period.&lt;ref name="Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde"/&gt;

Several new instruments, including the [[piano]], were introduced during this period. The invention of the piano is credited to [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] (1655–1731) of [[Padua]], Italy, who was employed by [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany]], as the Keeper of the Instruments. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA; Revised edition|year=1990|isbn=0-19-816171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm |title=The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2003 | author=Powers, Wendy |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cristofori named the instrument ''un cimbalo di cipresso di piano e forte'' ("a keyboard of [[cypress]] with soft and loud"), abbreviated over time as ''pianoforte'', ''fortepiano'', and later, simply, piano.&lt;ref&gt;Isacoff (2012, 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
[[File:Set design Act5 of Andromède by P Corneille 1650 - Gallica.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Set design for ''Andromedé'' by [[Pierre Corneille]], (1650)]]

The Baroque period was a golden age for theater in France and Spain;  playwrights included [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Moliere]] in France; and [[Lope de Vega]] and [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] Spain.

During the Baroque period, the art and style of the theater evolved rapidly, alongside the development of opera and of ballet.  The design of newer and larger theaters, the invention the use of more elaborate machinery, the wider use of the [[proscenium arch]], which framed the stage and hid the machinery from the audience, encouraged more scenic effects and spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica on-line, ''Baroque Theater''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baroque had a Catholic and conservative character in Spain, following an Italian literary models during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco, Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The Hispanic Baroque theatre aimed for a public content with an ideal reality that manifested fundamental three sentiments: Catholic religion, monarchist and national pride and honour originating from the chivalric, knightly world.&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco, Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two periods are known in the Baroque Spanish theatre, with the division occurring in 1630. The first period is represented chiefly by [[Lope de Vega]], but also by [[Tirso de Molina]], [[Gaspar Aguilar]], [[Guillén de Castro]], [[Antonio Mira de Amescua]], [[Luis Vélez de Guevara]], [[Juan Ruiz de Alarcón]], [[Diego Jiménez de Enciso]], [[Luis Belmonte Bermúdez]], [[Felipe Godínez]], [[Luis Quiñones de Benavente]] or [[Juan Pérez de Montalbán]]. The second period is represented by [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] and fellow dramatists [[Antonio Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Álvaro Cubillo de Aragón]], [[Jerónimo de Cáncer]], [[Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla]], [[Juan de Matos Fragoso]], [[Antonio Coello y Ochoa]], [[Agustín Moreto]], and [[Francisco Bances Candamo]].&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). ''Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco'', Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; These classifications are loose because each author had his own way and could occasionally adhere himself to the formula established by Lope. It may even be that the "manner" of Lope was more liberal and structured than Calderón's.&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). ''Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco'', Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Lope de Vega introduced through his ''Arte nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo'' (1609) the ''new comedy''. He established a new dramatic formula that broke the three [[Aristotle]] unities of the Italian school of poetry (action, time and place) and a fourth unity of Aristotle which is about style, mixing of tragic and comic elements showing different types of verses and stanzas upon what is represented.&lt;ref&gt;Lope de Vega, 2010, Comedias: El Remedio en la Desdicha. El Mejor Alcalde El Rey, pp.&amp;nbsp;446–447&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lope has a great knowledge of the plastic arts, he did not use it during the major part of his career nor in theatre or scenography. The Lope's comedy granted a second role to the visual aspects of the theatrical representation.&lt;ref&gt;Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Tirso de Molina, Lope de Vega, and Calderón were the most important play writers in Golden Era Spain. Their works, known for their subtle intelligence and profound comprehension of a person's humanity, could be considered a bridge between Lope's primitive comedy and the more elaborate comedy of Calderón. Tirso de Molina is best known for two works, ''The Convicted Suspicions'' and ''[[The Trickster of Seville]]'', one of the first versions of the [[Don Juan]] myth.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward M.; Moir, Duncan (1992). ''Historia de la literatura española: Siglo De Oro: Teatro'' (1492–1700). Editorial Ariel, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–158&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival to Madrid, [[Cosimo Lotti]] brought to the Spanish court the most advanced theatrical techniques of Europe. His techniques and mechanic knowledge were applied in palace exhibitions called "Fiestas" and in lavish exhibitions of rivers or artificial fountains called "Naumaquias". He was in charge of styling the Gardens of [[Buen Retiro]], of [[Palace of Zarzuela|Zarzuela]] and of [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez|Aranjuez]] and the construction of the theatrical building of Coliseo del Buen Retiro.&lt;ref&gt;Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Lope's formulas begins with a verse that it unbefitting of the palace theatre foundation and the birth of new concepts that begun the careers of some play writers like Calderón de la Barca. Marking the principal innovations of the New Lopesian Comedy, Calderón's style marked many differences, with a great deal of constructive care and attention to his internal structure. Calderón's work is in formal perfection and a very lyric and symbolic language. Liberty, vitality and openness of Lope gave a step to Calderón's intellectual reflection and formal precision. In his comedy it reflected his ideological and doctrine intentions in above the passion and the action, the work of [[Autos sacramentales]] achieved high ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Molina Jiménez,  María Belén (2008). El teatro musical de Calderón de la Barca: Análisis textual. EDITUM, p. 56
&lt;/ref&gt; The genre of Comedia is political, multi-artistic and in a sense hybrid. The poetic text interweaved with Medias and resources originating from architecture, music and painting freeing the deception that is in the Lopesian comedy was made up from the lack of scenery and engaging the dialogue of action.&lt;ref&gt;Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known German playwright was [[Andreas Gryphius]], who used the [[Jesuit]] model of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pierre Corneille]]. There was also [[Johannes Velten]] who combined the traditions of the English comedians and the [[commedia del'arte]]  with the classic theatre of Corneille and [[Molière]]. His touring company was perhaps the most significant and important of the 17th century.

==End of the style, condemnation and academic rediscovery==
Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV, probably without intending it, contributed to the decline of the baroque and rococo style.  In 1750 she sent her nephew, [[Abel-François Poisson|Abel-François Poisson de Vandières]], on a two-year mission to study artistic and archeological developments in Italy.  He was accompanied by several artists, including the engraver [[Nicolas Cochin]] and the architect [[Soufflot]].  They returned to Paris with a passion for classical art. Vandiéres became the Marquis of Marigny, and was named Royal Director of buildings in 1754. He turned official French architecture toward the neoclassical. Cochin became an important art critic;  he denounced the ''petit style'' of Boucher, and called for a grand style with a new emphasis on antiquity and nobility in the academies of painting of architecture. {{sfn|Cabanne|1988|pg. 106}} 

The pioneer German art historian and archeologist [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] also condemned the baroque style, and praised the superior values of classical art and architecture.  By the 19th century, Baroque was a target for ridicule and criticism.  The neoclassical critic Francesco Milizia wrote: "Borrominini in architecture, Bernini in sculpture, Pierre de Cortone in painting...are a plague on good taste, which infected a large number of artists."&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, Bruce, ''La Sculpture baroque italienne'', Thames and Hudson, (1997), page 9&lt;/ref&gt;    In the 19th century, criticism went even further; the British critic [[John Ruskin]] declared that baroque sculpture was not only bad, but also morally corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher (1998) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss-born art historian Heinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945) started the rehabilitation of the word Baroque in his Renaissance und Barock (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as "movement imported into mass", an art antithetic to Renaissance art. He did not make the distinctions between Mannerism and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Baroque art and architecture became fashionable between the two World Wars, and has largely remained in critical favor.  The term "Baroque" may still be used, usually pejoratively, describing works of art, craft, or design that are thought to have excessive ornamentation or complexity of line.

'''COPI''' is a [[coatomer]], a protein complex&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Coat+Protein+Complex+I}}&lt;/ref&gt; that coats [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s transporting proteins from the ''cis'' end of the [[Golgi complex]] back to the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER), where they were originally [[Translation (genetics)|synthesized]], and between Golgi compartments.  This type of transport is termed as ''retrograde transport'', in contrast to the ''anterograde transport'' associated with the [[COPII]] protein. The name "COPI" refers to the specific '''co'''at '''p'''rotein complex that initiates the budding process on the ''cis''-Golgi membrane. The coat consists of large protein subcomplexes that are made of seven different protein subunits, namely α, β, β', γ, [[Archain|δ]], ε and [[COPZ1|ζ]].

COPI consists of seven subunits which compose the heteroheptameric protein complex.

The primary function of adaptors is the selection of cargo proteins for their incorporation into nascent carriers.  Cargo containing the sorting motifs KKXX and KXKXX interact with COPI to form carriers which are transported from the cis-Golgi to the ER.&lt;ref name="pmid8001155"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90011-6| vauthors=Letourneur F, Gaynor EC, Hennecke S, Démollière C, Duden R, Emr SD| title=Coatomer is essential for retrieval of dilysine-tagged proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. | journal=Cell | year= 1994 | volume= 79 | issue= 7 | pages= 1199–207 | pmid=8001155 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8947548"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1083/jcb.135.5.1239| vauthors=Sohn K, Orci L, Ravazzola M, Amherdt M, Bremser M, Lottspeich F| title=A major transmembrane protein of Golgi-derived COPI-coated vesicles involved in coatomer binding | journal=J Cell Biol | year= 1996 | volume= 135 | issue= 5 | pages= 1239–48 | pmid=8947548 | pmc=2121093 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8830771"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1083/jcb.134.6.1411| vauthors=Sönnichsen B, Watson R, Clausen H, Misteli T, Warren G| title=Sorting by COP I-coated vesicles under interphase and mitotic conditions | journal=J Cell Biol | year= 1996 | volume= 134 | issue= 6 | pages= 1411–25 | pmid=8830771 | pmc=2120996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9244307"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80341-4| vauthors=Orci L, Stamnes M, Ravazzola M, Amherdt M, Perrelet A, Söllner TH| title=Bidirectional transport by distinct populations of COPI-coated vesicles | journal=Cell | year= 1997 | volume= 90 | issue= 2 | pages= 335–49 | pmid=9244307 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma 926–937"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Wenfu|last2=Goldberg|first2=Jonathan|date=2013-04-03|title=Rules for the recognition of dilysine retrieval motifs by coatomer|journal=The EMBO Journal|volume=32|issue=7|pages=926–937|doi=10.1038/emboj.2013.41|issn=1460-2075|pmc=3616288|pmid=23481256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current views suggest that ARFs are also involved in the selection of cargo for incorporation into carriers.

==Budding process==
ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) is a GTPase involved in membrane traffic.  There are 6 mammalian ARFs which are regulated by over 30 GEFs and GAPs. ARF is post-translationally modified at the N-terminus by the addition of the fatty acid myristate.

ARF cycles between GTP and GDP-bound conformations.  In the GTP-bound form, ARF conformation changes such that the myristate and hydrophobic N-terminal become more exposed and associate with the membrane. The interconversion between GTP and GDP bound states is mediated by ARF [[guanine nucleotide exchange factors]] (GEFs) and ARF [[GTPase activating proteins]] (GAPs). At the membrane, ARF-GTP is hydrolyzed to ARF-GDP by ARF GAPs. Once in the GDP-bound conformation, ARF converts to a less hydrophobic conformation and dissociates from the membrane.  Soluble ARF-GDP is converted back to ARF-GTP by GEFs.

:1. Luminal proteins: Proteins found in the lumen of the Golgi complex that need to be transported to the lumen of the ER contain the [[signal peptide]] [[KDEL (amino acid sequence)|KDEL]].&lt;ref name="KDEL and KKXX retrieval"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Mariano Stornaiuolo| author2=Lavinia V. Lotti| author3=Nica Borgese| author4=Maria-Rosaria Torrisi| author5=Giovanna Mottola| author6=Gianluca Martire| author7=Stefano Bonatti| last-author-amp=yes|date=March 2003| title=KDEL and KKXX Retrieval Signals Appended to the Same Reporter Protein Determine Different Trafficking between Endoplasmic Reticulum, Intermediate Compartment, and Golgi Complex| journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell| volume=14|issue=3| pages=889–902| doi=10.1091/mbc.E02-08-0468| pmid=12631711| pmc=151567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This sequence is recognized by a membrane-bound KDEL receptor.  In yeast, this is [[Erd2p]] and in mammals it is [[KDELR]].  This receptor then binds to an ARF-GEF, a class of guanine nucleotide exchange factors.  This protein in turn binds to the ARF.  This interaction causes ARF to exchange its bound [[Guanosine diphosphate|GDP]] for [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]].  Once this exchange is made ARF binds to the cytosolic side of the cis-Golgi membrane and inserts the myristoylated N-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix into the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=J.|date=1998-10-16|title=Structural basis for activation of ARF GTPase: mechanisms of guanine nucleotide exchange and GTP-myristoyl switching|journal=Cell|volume=95|issue=2|pages=237–248|issn=0092-8674|pmid=9790530|doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81754-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2. Membrane proteins: Transmembrane proteins which reside in the ER contain sorting signals in their cytosolic tails which direct the protein to exit the Golgi and return to the ER.  These sorting signals, or motifs, typically contain the amino acid sequence [[KKXX (amino acid sequence)|KKXX]] or KXKXX, which interact with COPI subunits α-COP and β'-COP.&lt;ref name="KDEL and KKXX retrieval"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma 926–937"/&gt; The order in which adaptor proteins associate with cargo, or adaptor proteins associate with ARFs is unclear, however, in order to form a mature transport carrier coat protein, adaptor, cargo, and ARF must all associate.

Membrane deformation and carrier budding occurs following the collection of interactions described above. The carrier then buds off of the donor membrane, in the case of COPI this membrane is the cis-Golgi, and the carrier moves to the ER where it fuses with the acceptor membrane and its content is expelled.

On the surface of a vesicle COPI molecules form symmetric trimers ("triads"). The curved triad structure positions the Arf1 molecules and cargo binding sites proximal to the membrane.  The β′- and α-COP subunits form an arch over the γζβδ-COP subcomplex, orienting their N-terminal domains such that the K(X)KXX cargo-motif binding sites are optimally positioned against the membrane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2946">'''Cell Synchronization''' is a process by which cells at different stages of the cell cycle in a culture are brought to the same phase. "Cell synchrony" is required to study the progression of cells through the cell cycle. The types of synchronizations are broadly categorized into two groups: "Physical Fractionation" and "Chemical Blockade."

==Cell separation by physical means==
Physical fractionation or cell separation techniques, based on the following characteristics are in use.
*Cell density
*Cell size
*Affinity of [[antibodies]] on cell surface [[epitope]]s.
*Light scatter or [[fluorescent]] emission by labeled cells.
The two commonly used techniques are:

===Centrifugal separation===
The physical characteristics — cell size and sedimentation velocity — are operative in the technique of centrifugal [[elutriation]]. Centrifugal elutriator (from Beckman) is an advanced device for increasing the sedimentation rate so that the yield and resolution of cells is better. The cell separation is carried out in a specially designed centrifuge and rotor.

===Fluorescence-activated cell sorting===
[[Fluorescence-activated cell sorting]] (FACS) is a technique for sorting out the cells based on the differences that can be detected by light scatter (e.g. cell size) or fluorescence emission (by penetrated DNA, RNA, proteins, antigens).
The procedure involves passing of a single stream of cells through a [[laser]] beam so that the scattered light from the cells can be detected and recorded. There are two instruments in use based on its principle:

:a) [[Flow cytometer]] 
:b) Fluorescence-activated cell sorter

==Cell separation by chemical blockade==
The cells can be separated by blocking metabolic reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=BioTechniques |title=Biological methods for cell-cycle synchronization of mammalian cells |year=2001 |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=1322–1331 |pmid=11414226 |vauthors=Davis PK, Ho A, Dowdy SF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two types of metabolic blockades are in use:

===Inhibition of DNA synthesis===
During the [[S phase]] of cell cycle, DNA synthesis can be inhibited by using inhibitors such as [[thymidine]], [[aminopterin]], [[hydroxyurea]] and [[cytosine arabinoside]]. The effects of these inhibitors are variable for this. The cell cycle is predominantly blocked in S phase that results in viable cells.

===Nutritional deprivation===
Elimination of [[Blood plasma|serum]] from the [[culture medium]] for about 24 hours results in the accumulation of cells at [[G1 phase]]{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}. This effect of nutritional deprivation can be restored by their addition by which time the cell synchrony occurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2138">'''Codex Hierosolymitanus''' (also called the '''Bryennios manuscript''' or the '''Jerusalem Codex''', often designated simply "'''H'''" in scholarly discourse) is an 11th-century Greek manuscript, written by an otherwise unknown scribe named Leo, who dated it 1056. Its designation of "Jerusalem" recalls its resting place in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]], at the library of the monastery of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].

The [[codex]] contains the ''[[Didache]]'', the ''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]'', the [[First Epistle of Clement]] and the [[Second Epistle of Clement]], the long version of the [[letters of Ignatius of Antioch]] and a [[Biblical canon|list of books of the Bible]] following the order of [[John Chrysostom]]. It was discovered in 1873 by [[Philotheos Bryennios]], the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Nicomedia]], at [[Constantinople]]. He published the texts of the two familiar [[Epistles of Clement]] in 1875, overlooking the ''Didache'', which he found when he returned to the manuscript.

[[Adolf Hilgenfeld]] used ''Codex Hierosolymitanus'' for his first printed edition of the previously all-but-unknown ''Didache'' in 1877.

A '''conjectural portrait''' is a [[portrait]] made of a historical figure for whom no authentic contemporary portrait is available.  The depiction, then, may be variously informed by [[primary source|written accounts]] of [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]], conjecture based on the subject's culture and background, and/or the artist's conception of the subject's [[Moral character|inner essence]].

==Iconic portraits==
Certain conjectural portraits have become [[iconography|iconic]] of their subjects, and are widely recognizable as such, with few being aware that they are not authentic portraits.  For example, portraits of [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Joan of Arc]] are widely recognized.

'''Coptology''' is the science of [[Copt]]ic studies, the study of Coptic language and literature.&lt;ref name="We"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/704/he1.htm Alahram weekly] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917024209/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/704/he1.htm |date=September 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The European interest in Coptology may have started as early as the 15th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Copts and the West, 1439-1822: The European Discovery of the Egyptian Church|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ho-IXrFvyq8C&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=history+of+coptology&amp;source=web&amp;ots=u_afXTuU5Q&amp;sig=qG1qijWJuplcAVA7gZrf4_9OSGA|publisher = OUP Oxford|date = 2006-07-27|isbn = 9780199288779|language = en|first = Alastair|last = Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used in 1976 when the First International Congress of Coptology was held in [[Cairo]] under the title "Colloquium on the Future of Coptic Studies" (11-17 December). This was followed by the establishment of the "[[International Association for Coptic Studies]]".&lt;ref name="Int"&gt; [http://rmcisadu.let.uniroma1.it/~iacs/  International Association for Coptic Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201011732/http://rmcisadu.let.uniroma1.it/~iacs/ |date=2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the founders of the Colloquium and the Association was [[Pahor Labib]], director of the [[Coptic Museum]] in [[Cairo]] during 1951-65. The words 'Coptology' and 'Coptologist' were introduced into the English language by [[Aziz Suryal Atiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amazon.com: Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs &amp; more|url = https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/PN1YR1HMUGAQ|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide institutions==
There are now institutions that give more or less regular courses of Coptology in 47 countries around the world, including Australia, Great Britain, Canada, Germany, Israel, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. A rotating chair of Coptic studies was opened at the [[American University in Cairo]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="We"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5716">'''C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t analysis''', a technique based on the principles of '''DNA reassociation kinetics''', is a biochemical technique that measures how much [[repetitive DNA]] is in a  DNA sample such as a [[genome]].&lt;ref name=Britten1966&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waring M, Britten RJ |title=Nucleotide sequence repetition: a rapidly reassociating fraction of mouse DNA |journal=Science |volume=154 |issue=3750 |pages=791–4 |year=1966 |pmid=5919450 |doi=10.1126/science.154.3750.791}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to study [[genome]] structure and organization and has also been used to simplify the sequencing of genomes that contain large amounts of repetitive sequence.&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peterson DG, Wessler SR, Paterson AH |title=Efficient capture of unique sequences from eukaryotic genomes |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=547–50 |year=2002 |pmid=12414178 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02764-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
The procedure involves heating a sample of genomic DNA until it [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denatures]] into the single stranded-form, and then slowly cooling it, so the strands can pair back together. While the sample is cooling, measurements are taken of how much of the DNA is [[base pair]]ed at each temperature.  

The amount of single and double-stranded DNA is measured by rapidly diluting the sample, which slows reassociation, and then binding the DNA to a [[hydroxylapatite]] column. The column is first washed with a low concentration of [[sodium phosphate]] buffer, which elutes the single-stranded DNA, and then with high concentrations of phosphate, which elutes the double stranded DNA. The amount of DNA in these two solutions is then measured using a [[spectrophotometer]].

[[File:CoT analysis.png|thumb|right|250px|Repetitive DNA sequences renature at lower C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t values than single-copy sequences.]]

==Analysis==

Since a sequence of single-stranded DNA needs to find its [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] strand to reform a double helix, common sequences renature more rapidly than rare sequences. Indeed, the rate at which a sequence will reassociate is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the number of copies of that sequence in the DNA sample. A sample with a highly-repetitive sequence will renature rapidly, while complex sequences will renature slowly.  

However, instead of simply measuring the percentage of double-stranded DNA versus time, the amount of renaturation is measured relative to a C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t value. The C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t value is the product of C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the initial concentration of DNA), t (time in seconds), and a constant that depends on the concentration of [[cation]]s in the buffer. Repetitive DNA will renature at low C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t values, while complex and unique DNA sequences will renature at high C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t values. The fast renaturation of the repetitive DNA is because of the availability of numerous complementary sequences.

==Application to genome sequencing==
{{Main|Cot filtration | l1 = C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t filtration}}
C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t filtration is a technique that uses the principles of DNA renaturation kinetics to separate the [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive DNA]] [[sequence]]s that dominate many [[eukaryotic]] [[genomes]] from "gene-rich" single/low-copy sequences.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt; This allows DNA sequencing to concentrate on the parts of the genome that are most informative and interesting, which will speed up the discovery of new genes and make the process more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;L{{cite journal |vauthors=Lamoureux D, Peterson DG, Li W, Fellers JP, Gill BS |title=The efficacy of Cot-based gene enrichment in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) |journal=Genome |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=1120–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16391681 |url=http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?issn=0831-2796&amp;volume=48&amp;issue=6&amp;startPage=1120 |doi=10.1139/g05-080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yuan&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yuan Y, SanMiguel PJ, Bennetzen JL |title=High-Cot sequence analysis of the maize genome |journal=Plant J. |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=249–55 |year=2003 |pmid=12694599 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-313X.2003.01716.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was first developed and utilized by [[Roy Britten]] and his colleagues at the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson EH, Britten RJ (1973) Organization, transcription, and regulation in the animal genome.

In fact, their experiments demonstrated that the majority of eukaryotic genomic DNA is composed of repetitive, non-coding elements.&lt;ref name=Britten1966/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9988">The '''Creative Energy Homes'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/creative-energy-homes/index.aspx|publisher=The University of Nottingham|title=Creative Energy Homes project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (CEH) project is a showcase of innovative state-of-the-art energy-efficient homes of the future. Seven homes constructed on the [[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park Campus]] of the [[University of Nottingham]] are being designed and constructed to various degrees of innovation and flexibility to allow the testing of different aspects of modern methods of construction including layout and form, cladding materials, roof structures, foundations, glazing materials, thermal performance, building services systems, sustainable/[[renewable energy]] technologies, lighting systems, acoustics and water supply. The project aims to stimulate sustainable design ideas and promote new ways of providing affordable, environmentally sustainable housing that are innovative in their design. The homes are fully instrumented and occupied in order to provide comprehensive post occupancy evaluation data.

== The David Wilson House ==
[[File:CEH DavidWilsonHouse.jpg|thumb|left|The David Wilson Ecohouse]] Construction of the CEH project began in 1999 with the David Wilson Ecohouse.
This is a 4-bedroom detached property which uses brick and block construction. Its main purpose was to support research into domestic-sized renewable energy systems such as micro-CHP ([[Combined heat and power]]), [[solar thermal]], micro-wind, [[Light tube|sun pipes]], and natural ventilation devices.

The house is currently used as office space for University of Nottingham staff and continues to be used as a test bed for University research projects.

== The BASF House ==
The [http://www.house.basf.co.uk/ BASF house] was the 3rd house to be constructed and was completed in January 2008 taking only 25 weeks to build. The house was designed by Derek Trowell Architects [http://derektrowellarchitects.co.uk/basf-house/] to demonstrate that it is possible to build an affordable low energy house whilst still adherering to the [[Passivhaus]] ideology. It meets the level 4 standard of the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]].

The house has a compact floor area and relies as much as possible on passive solar design to keep costs down. The north, east and west walls are highly insulated, with the minimum number of openings compatible with acceptable day lighting standards. The southern elevation consists of a fully glazed two-layer adjustable sunspace with glazed screens that can be opened or closed to facilitate heating or cooling.

A [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger|ground-air heat exchanger]], supplied by [http://www.rehau.co.uk/ Rehau], lies to the front of the house and this consists of a network of horizontal pipes buried approximately 2m underground. At this depth the soil temperature only varies between 8-12°C throughout the year. Therefore in winter cold air can be pre-heated before being drawn into the house and in the summer the air can be cooled.

A [[rainwater harvesting]] system has also been installed, which consists of a 3500 litres tank buried under the car parking space. It collects the run-off water from the roof. This water can be used for washing clothes, watering the garden, flushing the toilet and general cleaning. Water efficiency is also an important factor of the code for sustainable homes and using a rainwater harvesting system drastically reduces the amount of mains water used per person per day.

The [[Passive solar building design|sun space]], at the front of the house captures the solar gain from the sun, heating the air for use in the rest of the house. The south facing elevation is almost 100% glazed and the north facing elevation 30% glazed, providing improved quality of life in the home by maximising the use of natural daylight and reducing the energy required to light the home.

On the roof of the house are 3 solar thermal panels used for hot water heating. This is a larger system than is typical for this size of house, which allows storage of hot water for as long as 3 days and helps compensate for extended periods of overcast conditions.

== The E.ON 2016 House ==
The [http://www.eon-uk.com/about/2016house.aspx E.ON House] is a replica 1930s UK semi-detached house built primarily to research the impact of various retrofitting solutions on the existing housing stock.

According to the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]] (CfSH) all the new houses built from 2016 are required to meet Level 6 requirements of the CfSH, or be carbon zero. However, it is estimated that by the year 2050, 25 million existing UK homes will still account for between 70 and 90 percent of the housing stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Existing Housing and Climate Change|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmcomloc/432/432i.pdf|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 25% of UK CO2 emissions derive from the domestic housing stock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Firth|first=Steven|title=Investigating CO2 emissions reduction in existing urban housing using a community domestic energy model|url=http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_2098_2105.pdf|work=Proceedings of the Eleventh International IBPSA Conference|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; so clearly there is a large opportunity to reduce UK carbon emissions by increasing the efficiency of existing homes.

The house is built to 1930s building regulations and the project developers had to receive special planning permission in order to construct the house. It has no roof or wall cavity insulation and uses single glazed windows. Hot water is provided by an outdated, inefficient non-condensing gas boiler and immersion heater. The plan is to bring this 1930s house to a top of the range home meeting Level 6 CfSH. It is hoped that the lessons learnt from this detailed research will help point the way to retrofitting homes to create more sustainable properties. The project consists of three phases:

# During the first phase the house was monitored in its original state. There are over 100 sensors positioned around the house monitoring temperature, relative humidity, electricity consumption of individual appliances, gas consumption, water consumption, total electricity consumption and occupancy.
# The second phase was carried out from August 2010 to June 2011. The building was upgraded with additional insulation, an improved heating system, double glazing, more efficient lighting and drought proofing. Research was carried out as to the impact of these improvements.
# In the third phase, due to begin in late 2011, further improvements will be made incorporating the installation of a conservatory-style extension creating a buffer zone between the property and the outside elements and a sun space to maximise solar gain. Renewable energy technologies, such as [[Photovoltaic panels|Solar panel]]  and solar hot water system will also be installed in order to supply the house with electricity and hot water.

== The Tarmac Homes ==
Tarmac have sponsored the construction of two semi-detached eco-homes called [http://www.tarmachomesproject.co.uk/ Tarmac House]. These are designed by [http://www.zedfactory.com/ ZEDfactory], the company responsible for the [[BEDZED]] project in south London. One home is built to Level 4 CfSH  and the other to Level 6 CfSH.

These houses demonstrate that it is possible to build a sustainable home using currently available materials and traditional methods of construction. Sustainability features of the properties include:

* Extremely well insulated walls with 250&amp;nbsp;mm of [[cavity wall insulation]].
* A [[Biomass heating system]] situated in front of the houses.
* A [[Solar water heating]] system with roof-mounted solar panels.
* [http://solarcentury.com/ Solar century] sun slates on the level 6 house helping to meet electricity demands.

== The Nottingham H.O.U.S.E (Home Optimising the Use of Solar Energy) ==
[http://www.nottinghamhouse.co.uk/ Nottingham H.O.U.S.E] is a small family "starter" home, which was built as a part of a [[Solar Decathlon Europe]] 2010 event by the students of the [http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/Departments/abe/index.aspx Department of Architecture and Built Environment]. The house delivers a zero carbon sustainable design solution that is compliant with level 6 of UK's Code for Sustainable Homes. It is a prefabricated two storey house with a courtyard garden that can be used in terrace or semi-detached form.

The House was presented at the [http://www.ecobuild.co.uk/ Ecobuild] 2010 event and awarded with the prize for the best use of timber. The models of the house were also presented at the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai Expo 2010]]. The prefabricated house is due to be moved on to the University Park campus of the University of Nottingham in the near future.

== The Mark Group House ==
The Mark Group house is currently under construction.  It is a 4-bedroom property constructed using a steel framing system with insulation cladding. Construction of the basement uses an [[Insulating concrete form|Insulating Concrete Form]] (ICF) which incorporates [[Ground granulated blast furnace slag|Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag]] (GGBS) into the [[Portland cement]].

Manufacturing Portland cement produces around 1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of concrete whereas GGBS, as a by-product of the iron industry, produces only 0.1 tonnes of CO2 per tonne{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. GGBS can be mixed with Portland cement 70%-30% to decrease its carbon footprint by around 40%{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

'''David P. Philipp''' is an [[Americans|American]]-born biologist known for his work on [[conservation genetics]], reproductive ecology, and the effects of [[angling]] on [[fish]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific American.

== Research ==

Philipp's research examines genetics, [[reproduction]], and [[spatial ecology]] of fishes, and the effects of [[fisheries]] interactions on these dynamics in [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. His early research examined [[centrarchid]] population genetics, gene expression, reproductive physiology,  and strategies,  heritability of fish behaviour, and life history strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, M.

Philipp's research revealed that populations of largemouth bass, ''Micropterus salmoides'', in most of North America composite a separate species from the Florida bass, ''M. floridanus'', in Florida, and that stocking programs introducing Florida bass outside their native range have detrimental genetic effects on largemouth bass populations.&lt;ref name="Philipp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philipp, D. P. Genetic implications of introducing Florida largemouth bass. Can. J. Fish Aq. Sci. 48, 58–65 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Another research program showed that angling targets individual largemouth bass with certain behavioural and physiological characteristics, and in the process can cause evolutionary change in populations including reduced parental care and reproductive success, as well as reduced angling success rates.&lt;ref name="Cooke" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philipp, D.

'''Decellularization''' (also spelt '''decellularisation''' in British English) is the process used in biomedical engineering to isolate the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) of a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] from its inhabiting cells, leaving an ECM [[Tissue scaffold|scaffold]] of the original tissue, which can be used in [[artificial organ]] and tissue regeneration. [[Organ (anatomy)|Organ]] and tissue transplantation treat a variety of medical problems, ranging from end organ failure to cosmetic surgery.  One of the greatest limitations to organ transplantation derives from organ rejection caused by [[antibodies]] of the transplant recipient reacting to [[donor]] [[antigens]] on cell surfaces within the donor organ.&lt;ref&gt;Colaco, M., &amp; Atala, A. (2014). The Future of Transplant Biology and Surgery. Interdisciplinary Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of unfavorable [[Immune system|immune]] responses, transplant patients suffer a lifetime taking immunosuppressing medication. Stephen F. Badylak pioneered the process of decellularization at the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Thomas W.|last2=Sellaro|first2=Tiffany L.|last3=Badylak|first3=Stephen F.|title=Decellularization of tissues and organs|journal=Biomaterials|date=14 February 2006|volume=27|pages=3675–3683|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.02.014}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This process creates a natural [[biomaterial]] to act as a scaffold for cell growth, [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] and tissue development. By recellularizing an ECM scaffold with a patient’s own cells, the adverse immune response is eliminated. Nowadays, commercially available ECM scaffolds are available for a wide variety of [[tissue engineering]].  Using peracetic acid to decellularize ECM scaffolds have been found to be false and only disinfects the tissue.

With a wide variety of decellularization-inducing treatments available, combinations of physical, [[chemical]], and enzymatic treatments are carefully monitored to ensure that the ECM scaffold maintains the structural and chemical integrity of the original tissue.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt; Scientists can use the acquired ECM scaffold to reproduce a functional organ by introducing [[progenitor cell]]s, or [[adult stem cell]]s (ASCs), and allowing them to differentiate within the scaffold to develop into the desired tissue. The produced organ or tissue can be transplanted into a patient. In contrast to cell surface antibodies, the [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] components of the ECM are conserved between hosts, so the risk of a hostile immune response is minimized.&lt;ref name="Conserving ECM 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Exposito|first1=J.Y.|last2=D'Alessio|first2=M.|last3=Solursh|first3=M.|last4=Ramirez|first4=F.|title=Sea urchin collagen evolutionary homoogous to vertebrate pro-alpha|journal=J Biol Chem|date=1992|volume=267|pages=15559–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conserving ECM 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Constantinou|first1=C|title=Use of polymerase chain reaction and partially degenerate oligonucleotide for generation of novel cDNA clones.|journal=Matrix|date=1991|volume=11|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/s0934-8832(11)80221-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper conservation of ECM fibers, growth factors, and other proteins is imperative to the progenitor cells differentiating into the proper adult cells. The success of decellularization varies based on the components and density of the applied tissue and its origin.&lt;ref name=Crapo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crapo|first1=Peter M.|last2=Gilbert|first2=Thomas W.|last3=Badylak|first3=Stephen F.|title=An overview of tissue and whole organ decellularization processes|journal=Biomaterials|date=15 January 2011|volume=32|pages=3233–3243|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.057|pmid=21296410|pmc=3084613}}&lt;/ref&gt; The applications to the decellularizing method of producing a [[biomaterial]] scaffold for tissue regeneration are present in [[cardiac]], [[dermal]], [[Lung|pulmonary]], [[renal]], and other types of tissues.

== Process overview ==
Researchers are able to take the tissue from a donor or [[cadaver]], [[Lysis|lyse]] and kill the cells within the tissue without damaging the extracellular components, and finish with a product that is the natural ECM scaffold that has the same physical and biochemical functions of the natural tissue.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;  After acquiring the ECM scaffold, scientists can recellularize the tissue with [[Cell potency|potent stem]] or progenitor cells that will differentiate into the original type of tissue.  By removing the cells from a donor tissue, the immunogenic antibodies from the donor will be removed.  The progenitor cells can be taken from the host, therefore they will not have an adverse response to the tissue.  This process of decellularizing tissues and organs is still being developed, but the exact process of taking a tissue from a donor and removing all the cellular components is considered to be the decellularization process. The steps to go from a decellularized ECM scaffold to a functional organ is under the umbrella of recellularization.  Because of the diverse applications of tissue in the human body, decellularization techniques have to be tailored to the specific tissue being exercised on. The researched methods of decellularization include physical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments.  Though some methods are more commonly used, the exact combination of treatments is variable based on the tissue’s origin and what it is needed for.&lt;ref name=Crapo /&gt;

As far as introducing the different liquidized chemicals and [[enzyme]]s to an organ or tissue, [[perfusion]] and immersion decellularization techniques have been used. Perfusion decellularization is applicable when an extensive vasculature system is present in the organ or tissue. It is crucial for the ECM scaffold to be decellularized at all levels, and evenly throughout the structure.&lt;ref name="Perfusion 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ott|first1=H.C|title=Perfusion-decellularized matrix: using nature's platform to engineer a bioartificial heart.|journal=Nature Medicine|date=2008|volume=14|pages=213–221|doi=10.1038/nm1684|pmid=18193059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guyette|first1=Jacques P|last2=Gilpin|first2=Sarah E|last3=Charest|first3=Jonathan M|last4=Tapias|first4=Luis F|last5=Ren|first5=Xi|last6=Ott|first6=Harald C|title=Perfusion decellularization of whole organs|journal=Nature Protocols|date=29 May 2014|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1451–1468|doi=10.1038/nprot.2014.097|url=http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v9/n6/abs/nprot.2014.097.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this requirement, vascularized tissues can have chemicals and enzymes perfused through the present arteries, veins, and capillaries. Under this mechanism and proper physiological conditions, treatments can diffuse equally to all of the cells within the organ. The treatments can be removed through the veins at the end of the process. Cardiac and pulmonary decellularization often uses this process of decellularization to introduce the treatments because of their heavily vascularized networks. Immersion decellularization is accomplished through the submersion of a tissue in chemical and enzymatic treatments. This process is more easily accomplished than [[perfusion]], but is limited to thin tissues with a limited vascular system.

== Physical treatments ==
The most common physical methods used to lyse, kill, and remove cells from the matrix of a tissue through the use of temperature, force and pressure, and electrical disruption. Temperature methods are often used in a rapid freeze-thaw mechanism. By quickly freezing a tissue, microscopic ice crystals form around the plasma membrane and the cell is lysed.&lt;ref name="Freeze-Thaw 1 Flynn 50"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=L.E.|title=The use of decellularized adipose tissue to provide an inductive microenvironment for the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells.|journal=Biomaterials|date=2010|volume=31|pages=4715–4724|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.02.046|pmid=20304481}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After lysing the cells, the tissue can be further exposed to liquidized chemicals that degrade and wash out the undesirable components. Temperature methods conserve the physical structure of the ECM scaffold, but are best handled by thick, strong tissues.

Direct force of pressure to a tissue will guarantee disruption of the ECM structure, so pressure is commonly used. Pressure decellularization involves the controlled use of [[hydrostatic pressure]] applied to a tissue or organ.  This is done best at high temperatures to avoid unmonitored ice crystal formation that could damage the scaffold. Electrical disruption of the plasma membrane is another option to lyse the cells housed in a tissue or organ.  By exposing a tissue to electrical pulses, micropores are formed at the plasma membrane. The cells eventually turn to death after their homeostatic electrical balance is ruined through the applied stimulus. This electrical process is documented as Non-thermal irreversible [[electroporation]] (NTIRE) and is limited to small tissues and the limited possibilities of inducing an electric current ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;

== Chemical treatments ==
The proper combination of chemicals is selected for decellularization depending on the thickness, extracellular matrix composition, and intended use of the tissue or organ.  For example, enzymes would not be used on a collagenous tissue because they disrupt the connective tissue fibers. However, when [[collagen]] is not present in a high concentration or needed in the tissue, enzymes can be a viable option for decellularization. The chemicals used to kill and remove the cells include acids, alkaline treatments, [[Ionic bonding|ionic]] [[detergent]]s, non-ionic detergents, and [[zwitterion]]ic detergents.

The ionic detergent, [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS), is commonly used because of its high efficacy for lysing cells without significant damage to the ECM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ott|first=Harald C.|last2=Matthiesen|first2=Thomas S.|last3=Goh|first3=Saik-Kia|last4=Black|first4=Lauren D.|last5=Kren|first5=Stefan M.|last6=Netoff|first6=Theoden I.|last7=Taylor|first7=Doris A.|date=February 2008|title=Perfusion-decellularized matrix: using nature's platform to engineer a bioartificial heart|journal=Nature Medicine|volume=14|issue=2|pages=213–221|doi=10.1038/nm1684|issn=1546-170X|pmid=18193059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guyette|first=Jacques P.|last2=Gilpin|first2=Sarah E.|last3=Charest|first3=Jonathan M.|last4=Tapias|first4=Luis F.|last5=Ren|first5=Xi|last6=Ott|first6=Harald C.|date=2014|title=Perfusion decellularization of whole organs|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1451–1468|doi=10.1038/nprot.2014.097|issn=1750-2799|pmid=24874812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilpin|first=Sarah Elizabeth|last2=Guyette|first2=Jacques P.|last3=Gonzalez|first3=Gabriel|last4=Ren|first4=Xi|last5=Asara|first5=John M.|last6=Mathisen|first6=Douglas J.|last7=Vacanti|first7=Joseph P.|last8=Ott|first8=Harald C.|date=March 2014|title=Perfusion decellularization of human and porcine lungs: bringing the matrix to clinical scale|journal=The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation: The Official Publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation|volume=33|issue=3|pages=298–308|doi=10.1016/j.healun.2013.10.030|issn=1557-3117|pmid=24365767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detergents act effectively to lyse the cell membrane and expose the contents to further degradation. After SDS lyses the cell membrane, [[endonucleases]] and [[exonucleases]] degrade the genetic contents, while other components of the cell is solubilized and washed out of the matrix. SDS is commonly used even though it has a tendency to slightly disrupt the ECM structure. Akaline and acid treatments can be effective companions with an SDS treatment due to their ability to degrade [[nucleic acid]]s and solubilize [[cytoplasmic inclusion]]s.&lt;ref name=Crapo /&gt;

The most well known non-ionic detergent is [[Triton X-100]], which is popular because of its ability to disrupt the interactions between lipids and between [[lipid]]s and proteins. [[Triton X-100]] does not disrupt protein-protein interactions, which is beneficial to keeping the ECM intact. [[EDTA]] is a chelating agent that binds [[calcium]], which is a necessary component for proteins to interact with one another. By making calcium unavailable, [[EDTA]] prevents the integral proteins between cells from binding to one another.  EDTA is often used with trypsin, an enzyme that acts as a protease to cleave the already existing bonds between integral proteins of neighboring cells within a tissue.  Together, the EDTA-Trypsin combination make a good team for decellularizing tissues.

== Enzymatic treatments ==
Enzymes used in decellularization treatments are used to break the bonds and interactions between nucleic acids, interacting cells through neighboring proteins, and other cellular components. [[Lipase]]s, [[thermolysin]], [[galactosidase]], [[nucleases]], and [[trypsin]] have all been used in the removal of cells.  After a cell is lysed with a detergent, acid, physical pressure, etc., endonucleases and exonucleases can begin the degradation of the genetic material.  Endonucleases cleave DNA and RNA in the middle of sequences.  Benzoase, an endonuclease, produces multiple small nuclear fragments that can be further degraded and removed from the ECM scaffold.&lt;ref name=Benzoase&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petersen|first1=T.H.|last2=Calle|first2=E.A.|last3=Zhao|first3=L.|last4=Lee|first4=E.J.|last5=Gui|first5=L.|last6=Raredon|first6=M.B.|title=Tissue-engineered lungs for in vivo implantation|journal=Science|date=2010|volume=329|issue=5991|pages=538–541|doi=10.1126/science.1189345|pmc=3640463}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exonucleases act at the end of DNA sequences to cleave the phosphodiester bonds and further degrade the nucleic acid sequences.

Enzymes such as trypsin act as proteases that cleave the interactions between proteins. Although trypsin can have adverse effects of collagen and elastin fibers of the ECM, using it in a time-sensitive manner controls any potential damage it could cause on the extracellular fibers. Dispase is used to prevent undesired aggregation of cells, which is beneficial in promoting their separating from the ECM scaffold.  Experimentation has shown dispase to be most effective on the surface of a thin tissue, such as a lung in pulmonary tissue regeneration.  To successfully remove deep cells of a tissue with dispase, mechanical agitation is often included in the process.

[[Collagenase]] is only used when the ECM scaffold product does not require an intact collagen structure. Lipases are commonly used when decellularized skin grafts are needed.  Lipase acids function in decellularizing dermal tissues through delipidation and cleaving the interactions between heavily lipidized cells. The enzyme, α-galactosidase is a relevant treatment when removing the Gal epitope antigen from cell surfaces.&lt;ref name=Crapo /&gt;

A natural ECM scaffold provides the necessary physical and biochemical environment to facilitate the growth and specialization of potent progenitor and stem cells.  Acellular matrices have been isolated ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' in a number of different tissues and organs.&lt;ref name="Engineering Paper" /&gt; The most applicable success from decellularized tissues has come from symmetrical tissues that have less specialization, such as bone and dermal grafts; however, research and success is ongoing at the organ level.

Acellular dermal matrices have been successful in a number of different applications. For example, skin grafts are used in cosmetic surgery and burn care.  The decellularized skin graft provides mechanical support to the damaged area while supporting the development of host-derived connective tissue. Cardiac tissue has clinical success in developing human valves from natural ECM matrices.&lt;ref name="Myocardial tissue"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimmermann|first1=W.H.|title=Engineered heart tissue grafts improve systolic and diastolic function in infarcted rat hearts|journal=Nature Medicine|date=2004|volume=12|issue=4|pages=452–458|doi= 10.1038/nm1394|pmid=16582915}}&lt;/ref&gt; A technique known as the Ross procedure uses an acellular heart valve to replace a defective valve, allowing native cells to repopulate a newly functioning valve. Decellularized [[allografts]] have been critical in bone grafts that function in bone reconstruction and replacing of deformed bones in patients.

The limits to myocardial tissue engineering come from the ability to immediately perfuse and seed and implemented heart into a patient. Though the ECM scaffold maintains the [[protein]] and [[growth factor]]s of the natural tissue, the molecular level specialization has not yet been harnessed by researchers using decellularized heart scaffolds. Better success at using a whole organ from decellularization techniques has been found in pulmonary research. Scientists have been able to regenerate whole lungs ''in vitro'' from rat lungs using perfusion-decellularization. By seeding the matrix with [[Fetus|fetal]] rat lung cells, a functioning lung was produced.  The ''in vitro''-produced lung was successfully implemented into a rat, which attests to the possibilities of translating an ''in vitro'' produced organ into a patient.

Other success for decellularization has been found in small intestinal submucosa (SIS), renal, hepatic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mazza|first1=Giuseppe|last2=Rombouts|first2=Krista|last3=Rennie Hall|first3=Andrew|last4=Urbani|first4=Luca|last5=Vinh Luong|first5=Tu|last6=Al-Akkad|first6=Walid|last7=Longato|first7=Lisa|last8=Brown|first8=David|last9=Maghsoudlou|first9=Panagiotis|last10=Dhillon|first10=Amar P.|last11=Fuller|first11=Barry|last12=Davidson|first12=Brian|last13=Moore|first13=Kevin|last14=Dhar|first14=Dipok|last15=De Coppi|first15=Paolo|last16=Malago|first16=Massimo|last17=Pinzani|first17=Massimo|title=Decellularized human liver as a natural 3D-scaffold for liver bioengineering and transplantation|journal=Scientific Reports|date=7 August 2015|volume=5|pages=13079|doi=10.1038/srep13079|pmid=26248878|pmc=4528226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pancreatic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goh|first1=Saik-Kia|last2=Bertera|first2=Suzanne|last3=Olsen|first3=Phillip|last4=Candiello|first4=Joseph E.|last5=Halfter|first5=Willi|last6=Uechi|first6=Guy|last7=Balasubramani|first7=Manimalha|last8=Johnson|first8=Scott A.|last9=Sicari|first9=Brian M.|last10=Kollar|first10=Elizabeth|last11=Badylak|first11=Stephen F.|last12=Banerjee|first12=Ipsita|title=Perfusion-decellularized pancreas as a natural 3D scaffold for pancreatic tissue and whole organ engineering|journal=Biomaterials|date=September 2013|volume=34|issue=28|pages=6760–6772|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.066|pmid=23787110|pmc=3748589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is a thin material, the SIS matrix can be decellularized through immersing the tissue in chemical and enzymatic treatments.

Pancreatic engineering is a testament to the molecular specificity of organs. Scientists have not yet been able to produce an entirely functioning [[pancreas]], but they have had success in producing an organ that functions at specific segments. For example, diabetes in rats was shown to decrease by seeding a pancreatic matrix at specific sites.&lt;ref name="Engineering Paper" /&gt; The future applications of decellularized tissue matrix is still being discovered and is considered one of the most hopeful areas in regenerative research.

'''Ergodic literature''' is a term [[neologism|coined]] by [[Espen J. Aarseth]] in his book ''Cybertext&amp;mdash;Perspectives on Ergodic Literature'', and is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''ergon'', meaning "work", and ''hodos'', meaning "path". Aarseth's book contains the most commonly cited definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text. If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be nonergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the text is trivial, with no [[wikt:extranoematic|extranoematic]] responsibilities placed on the reader except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages.&lt;ref name=Cybertext&gt;{{cite book|title=Cybertext&amp;mdash;Perspectives on Ergodic Literature|isbn=978-0801855795|first=Espen J.|last=Aarseth|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Cybertext]] is a subcategory of ergodic literature that Aarseth defines as "texts that involve calculation in their production of scriptons".&lt;ref name=Cybertext/&gt;{{rp|75}} The process of reading printed matter, in contrast, involves "trivial" extranoematic effort, that is, merely moving one's eyes along lines of text and turning pages.  Thus, [[hypertext fiction]] of the simple node and link variety is ergodic literature but not cybertext. A non-trivial effort is required for the reader to traverse the text, as the reader must constantly select which link to follow, but a link, when clicked, will always lead to the same node. A chat bot such as [[ELIZA]] is a cybertext because when the reader types in a sentence, the text-machine actually performs calculations on the fly that generate a textual response. The [[I Ching]] is likewise cited as an example of cybertext because it contains the rules for its own reading. The reader carries out the calculation but the rules are clearly embedded in the text itself. 

It has been argued that these distinctions are not entirely clear and scholars still debate the fine points of the definitions.&lt;ref name=Clarifying&gt;{{cite web|url=https://grandtextauto.soe.ucsc.edu/2005/08/12/clarifying-ergodic-and-cybertext/|title=Clarifying Ergodic and Cybertext|first=Noah|last=Wardrip-Fruin|work=Grand Text Auto|date=August 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the definition above, ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', and ''[[Being and Time]]'' are considered nonergodic literature as they require only "trivial...effort to traverse the text[s]". A stack of stained and mouldering newspapers, on the other hand, is ergodic literature.

One of the major innovations of the concept of ergodic literature is that it is not medium-specific. [[New media]] researchers have tended to focus on the medium of the text, stressing that it is for instance paper-based or electronic. Aarseth broke with this basic assumption that the medium was the most important distinction, and argued that the mechanics of texts need not be medium-specific. Ergodic literature is not defined by medium, but by the way in which the text functions. Thus, both paper-based and electronic texts can be ergodic: "The ergodic work of [[art]] is one that in a material sense includes the rules for its own use, a work that has certain requirements built in that automatically distinguishes between successful and unsuccessful users."&lt;ref name=Cybertext/&gt;{{rp|179}}

==Examples==

Examples given by Aarseth include a diverse group of texts: wall inscriptions of the temples in ancient [[Egypt]] that are connected two-dimensionally (on one wall) or three dimensionally (from wall to wall or room to room); the ''[[I Ching]]''; [[Apollinaire]]'s ''[[Calligrammes]]'' in which the words of the poem "are spread out in several directions to form a picture on the page, with no clear sequence in which to be read"; [[Marc Saporta]]'s ''Composition No. 1, Roman'', a novel with shuffleable pages; [[Raymond Queneau]]'s ''[[Hundred Thousand Billion Poems|One Hundred Thousand Billion Poems]]''; [[B. S. Johnson]]'s ''[[The Unfortunates]]''; [[Milorad Pavić (writer)|Milorad Pavić]]'s ''[[Dictionary of the Khazars]]'' and ''Landscape Painted with Tea''; [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]''; [[Joseph Weizenbaum]]'s ''[[ELIZA]]''; William Chamberlain and Thomas Etter's ''[[Racter]]''; [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]'s ''[[Afternoon, a story|Afternoon: a story]]''; Roy Trubshaw and [[Richard Bartle]]'s ''Multi-User Dungeon'' (aka ''[[Multi-User Dungeon#MUD the game|MUD1]]''); and James Aspnes's ''[[TinyMUD]]''. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Some other contemporary examples of this type of literature are [[Nick Bantock]]'s ''[[The Griffin and Sabine Trilogy]]'', ''[[S. (Dorst novel)|S.]]'' by [[J. J. Abrams]] and [[Doug Dorst]], ''[[Night Film: A Novel|Night Film]]'' by Marisha Pessl, and ''[[House of Leaves]]'' by [[Mark Z. Danielewski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://logger.believermag.com/post/2014/03/10/the-case-of-s-or-the-metatextual-pleasure-of | title=The Case of S., or, the Metatextual Pleasure of Ergodic Works | work=The Believer Logger | date=March 10, 2014 | accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these examples require non-trivial effort from the reader, who must participate actively in the construction of the text.&lt;ref name=Clarifying/&gt;

The concepts of cybertext and ergodic literature were of seminal importance to new media studies, in particular literary approaches to digital texts and to game studies.

[[Image:Yagan's grave surface radar.png|thumbnail|right|[[Ground penetrating radar]] provided no information about the location of Yagan's head]]

The '''exhumation of Yagan's head''' was the result of a [[Archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]] and [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig at a grave site in the [[Everton Cemetery]], [[Liverpool]] in 1997.

==Background==
{{main|Yagan}}
[[Yagan]] was an [[indigenous Australians|indigenous Australian]] warrior of the [[Noongar]] nation who played a key part in early indigenous resistance to European settlement and rule around the area of [[Perth, Western Australia]].  He was shot dead by a young settler, James Keates in 1833. Yagan's head was removed, preserved by smoking, and taken to England by Robert Dale, who gave it to the Liverpool Institute for display in a museum.&lt;ref name="Turnbull"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Turnbull, Paul|year=1998|title="Outlawed Subjects": The Procurement and Scientific Uses of Australian Aboriginal Heads, ca. 1803&amp;ndash;1835|journal=Eighteenth-Century Life|volume=22|issue=1|pages=156&amp;ndash;171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1964, Yagan's head was badly decomposed, and the decision was made to dispose of it.  The head was placed in a [[plywood]] box, along with a [[Peru]]vian [[mummy]] and a [[Mokomokai|Māori head]], and buried in Everton Cemetery's General Section 16, grave number 296. In later years, a number of burials were made around the grave, and in 1968 a local hospital buried 20 stillborn babies and two babies who had lived less than twenty-four hours, directly over the museum box.&lt;ref name="Fforde"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fforde, Cressida|year=2002|chapter=Chapter 18: Yagan|title=The Dead and Their Possessions: Repatriation in Principle, Policy, and Practice|editor1=Fforde, Cressida |editor2=Hubert, Jane |editor3=Turnbull, Paul |location=London | publisher=Routledge|pages=229&amp;ndash;241|isbn=0-415-23385-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yagan's grave surface EM data.png|thumbnail|right|A horizontal colour contour map of ground conductivity of Yagan's grave site.]]
For many years, members of Perth's Noongar community sought to have Yagan's head returned and buried according to tribal custom.  An application for exhumation of the head was made in 1994, but it was refused because [[next of kin]] permission to disturb the remains of the twenty-two babies could not be obtained.&lt;ref name="Fforde"/&gt;

==The geophysical survey==
[[Image:Yagan's grave excavation pit.png|thumbnail|right|The excavation pit used for the exhumation of Yagan's head.]]
[[Image:Yagan's grave vertical EM data.png|thumbnail|right|A vertical colour contour map of ground conductivity of Yagan's grave site.]]
In 1997, two brothers, Dr Martin Bates of the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]] and Dr Richard Bates of the [[University of St Andrews]], were commissioned by the [[Home Office]] to conduct a [[Archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]] of the grave site, with a view to exhuming the remains via an adjacent plot without disturbing any other remains.&lt;ref name="Fforde"/&gt;

The pair conducted surface surveys using [[ground penetrating radar]] and ground conductivity techniques.  The ground penetrating radar yielded no information about the location of Yagan's head, as the highly disturbed graveyard soil contained many reflecting sources.  However, the ground conductivity measurements showed an anomaly in the electromagnetic signature that it was thought might be caused by metal artifacts buried with the head.  The apparent location of the remains confirmed the feasibility of accessing them via an adjacent plot.&lt;ref name="St Andrews"&gt;{{cite web | title=Archaeological Geophysics: Yagan's Head | url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~crb/web/arch/yagan.htm | accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;Bates, C. R. (2005) ''pers. comm.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A pit was then dug in an adjacent plot, to a depth of around six feet, and a vertical ground conductivity test was conducted from within the pit.  This test failed to detect the anomaly recorded in the surface test, however the conductivity plot did show an anomaly at the centre of the grave, indicating that the grave was dug to its full depth of nine feet only at its centre.  This suggested the burial of a small box, confirming the memory of the grave digger who claimed to have constructed a small box to house the buried remains.&lt;ref name="St Andrews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates" /&gt;

==The exhumation==
After gathering evidence on the position and depth of Yagan's head, Bates reported the survey results to the Home Office, which eventually granted permission to proceed with the exhumation.  Yagan's head was exhumed by tunnelling horizontally into the grave from the adjacent pit.  The tunneling operation was "delicate and risky", as the tunnel passed underneath the remains of the babies, such that any collapse could potentially disturb them.  According to Richard Bates, "the first shovel of dirt from the grave showed signs of the decayed box and the Peruvian mummy came next followed by the Māori head and finally Yagan's head".&lt;ref name="St Andrews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates" /&gt;

The following day, a [[forensics|forensic]] [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] from the [[University of Bradford]] positively identified the skull as Yagan's, by correlating the fractures with those described in an 1834 report by [[Thomas Pettigrew]].&lt;ref name="Fforde"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Later that year, Yagan's head was handed over to a delegation of Noongars, who took it back to Australia.  Reburial of the head was delayed, however, due to uncertainty of the whereabouts of the rest of his body and disagreement by elders about the importance of burying the head with the body.&lt;ref name="Fforde"/&gt; They finally buried it in July 2010, in a traditional Noongar ceremony in the [[Swan Valley (Western Australia)|Swan Valley]] in Western Australia, 177 years after Yagan's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/warrior-reburied-170-years-after-death.htm/ Warrior reburied 170 years after death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623230023/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/warrior-reburied-170-years-after-death.htm |date=2013-06-23 }}, Australian Geographic, 12 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7609">'''Fiction Theory''' is a discipline that applies [[possible world]] theory to literature. Fiction theory scholars and critics have articulated various theses rooted in [[Saul Kripke]]’s application of [[modal logic]] to [[semantics]]. Drawing on concepts found in possible world theory, theorists of fiction study the relationships between textual worlds and the world outside the text.  The overarching idea in fiction theory is that the relationships between the imaginary worlds of fiction and the actual world in which we live are complicated, and that one ought not dismiss fiction as simply stories that are not “true.” Theorists of fiction pose challenging questions about, and offer constructive ways of exploring, the often complex relations between the worlds of fiction and the “real” world in which we live. 

== Fundamentals of fiction theory ==
In order to understand fiction theory, one must pose questions about fundamental terms such as text, narrative, literature, fiction, etc.  Literature may be understood as a text that is self-consciously artistic, rather than as a text that is used as a medium through which to convey information, for example a newspaper article. [[Roman Jakobson]], a Russian formalist and linguist, was one of the first individuals to discuss art as a way of communication that is intentionally aesthetic, and applied linguistics to analyses of literary texts. In his well-known communication model, Jakobson breaks apart a communicative act between an addressor and addressee into a message, code, context, and contact, with each part having its own function.  According to Jakobson’s model, art is created when the message itself (which carries the poetic function) is stressed. 

The French scholar [[Roland Barthes]] designed a system of [[five major codes]] that function as tools to analyze narrative texts in ways that move beyond examinations of plot and structure, thereby bringing to the surface the subtle ways a text becomes a literary narrative. 

Jakobson’s model and Barthes’s codes offer critics a way to begin to explore the nature of a literary text through application of [[semiotics]] to [[narrative]].

== The Actual versus the Fictive ==
While Jakobson and Barthes emphasize the intention of the speaker/writer, the philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] examines the broader question of how we create imaginary worlds and categorizes our “Ways of Worldmaking” (the title of his book on this topic) into composition/decomposition, weighting, ordering, deletion/supplementation, and reformations. The scholar [[Marie-Laure Ryan]] is also concerned less with intention and more with the various ways that fictional worlds are related to the actual world outside the text. Ryan conceptualizes these relations in a framework of accessibility and has developed a typology of accessibility relations that establishes the extent to which fictional worlds are similar to or different from the actual world in which we live. The fictional world that most resembles the actual world is based on the “principle of minimal departure.” This idea was first articulated by [[John Searle]] and refers to the fundamental property of an imaginary world that is minimally different from the familiar world in which we live. Lubomir Dolezel has developed a similar typology based on [[modal operator]]s that determine the narrative world.

[[Frank Kermode]], in his seminal text ''[[The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction]]'', argues that ultimate meaning is derived from the end; successive events are predicated on previously established meaning.  He articulates a concept of fiction based on this view of humans’ constant yearning for an ultimate end that will imbue with meaning everything that preceded it. In this discussion, Kermode distinguishes between fiction and myth.  Fiction consists of stories all individuals create about their lives in order to keep on living in a world that makes few guarantees and is full of inexplicable phenomena. Kermode defines myth as a dangerous fiction used for exploitative purposes.  The philosopher [[Hans Vaihinger]] has articulated similar ideas, putting forth the biological argument that human beings use fictions to help survive in a hostile environment, and that these fictions are so useful that it becomes most difficult, if not impossible, for us to stop ourselves from creating fictions.  In Vaihinger’s language, fiction is something we treat “as if” it is true even when we know that it is not true, whereas myth is something we treat as true because we do not know it is false. 

Literary critic [[Thomas Pavel]] argues that the fictional world deserves to be examined on its own terms rather than merely through the lens of [[mimesis]].  His thesis serves as a critique of [[Structuralism]] by its insistence on the idea that narrativity, as a fundamental aspect of fiction, removes the possibility of pure imitation of the actual world.  Pavel’s theory thus departs from the main ideas of other fiction theorists because he separates literature from its referential relationship to the actual world. Following in the footsteps of the Austrian philosopher [[Alexius Meinong]], Pavel asserts that fictional worlds demand tremendous respect for their ability to serve as powerful tools of knowledge rather than for their likeness to the actual world.

A '''flat grave''' is a [[burial]] in a simple oval or rectangular pit. The pit is filled with earth, but the grave is not marked above the surface by any means such as a [[tumulus]] or upstanding earthwork.&lt;ref name=darv /&gt; Both intact human bodies (skeletal grave) and cremated remains (urn grave) were buried in the graves.

==History==
This simple method of burial was used often by [[prehistory|prehistoric]] peoples. It was used during the [[Funnelbeaker culture]] and [[Corded Ware culture]]. It was characteristic of the [[Urnfield culture]] which stored cremated remains in [[urn]]s and buried them in flat graves.

Burial customs did not always follow a pattern of continuously increasing sophistication in history. During the early [[La Tène culture]] the deceased were optionally cremated and then interred in tumulus tombs, but this changed during the later period. At that time tumulus tombs became rare and the interment of cremated remains in flat graves was the dominant method of burial again.&lt;ref name=hube /&gt;

[[Image:Retinoblastoma rosette.jpg|thumb|'''Flexner–Wintersteiner rosettes''' in [[Retinoblastoma]].]]
'''Flexner–Wintersteiner rosette''' is a spoke and wheel shaped [[cell (biology)|cell]] formation seen in [[retinoblastoma]] and certain other [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] [[tumor]]s.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Flexner-Wintersteiner+rosette Definition of 'rosette'], from The Free Dictionary. Retrieved 6 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''rosette'' is a structure or formation resembling a rose, such as the clusters of [[polymorphonuclear leukocytes]] around a globule of lipid nuclear material, as observed in the test for disseminated [[lupus erythematosus]].&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
The tumor cells that form the Flexner–Wintersteiner rosette surround a central lumen containing small cytoplasmic extensions of the encircling cells. Unlike the center of the [[Homer-Wright rosette|Homer Wright rosette]], the central lumen is devoid of fiber-rich neuropil. Like the Homer Wright rosette, the Flexner–Wintersteiner rosette represents a specific form of tumor differentiation.&lt;ref name="McLean"&gt;McLean IW, Burnier MN, Zimmerman LE, et al.

In: Spencer WH, ed. Ophthalmic pathology: an atlas and textbook. Philadelphia: WB Saunders; 1985:1292–351&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that Flexner–Wintersteiner rosettes represent a specific form of retinal differentiation. In addition to being a characteristic finding in retinoblastomas, Flexner–Wintersteiner rosettes may also be found in [[pinealoblastoma]]s and [[medulloepithelioma]]s.&lt;ref name="McLean"/&gt;
==History==
Flexner–Wintersteiner rosettes were first described by [[Simon Flexner]] (1863–1946), a physician, scientist, administrator, and professor of experimental [[pathology]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1899–1903). Flexner noted characteristic clusters of cells in an infantile [[Ocular oncology|eye tumor]] which he called retinoepithelioma.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner S. A peculiar glioma (neuroepithelioma?) of the retina. Johns Hopkins Hosp Bull 1891;2:115–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schatski SC. Simon Flexner.

Die zellen der geschwulst. In: Das neuroepithelioma retinae: Eine anatomische und klinishe studie. Leipzig: Franz Deuticke; 1897:12–16&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristic rosette formations were subsequently recognized as important features of retinoblastomas.

The '''fragment molecular orbital method''' ('''FMO''') is a computational method that can compute very large molecular systems with thousands of atoms using ab initio quantum-chemical wave functions.

== History of FMO and related methods ==
[[File:Ahelix-FMO-Facio.jpg|thumb|320px|An alpha-helix fragmented for FMO using Facio.]]
The fragment molecular orbital method (FMO) was developed by K. Kitaura and coworkers in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fragment molecular orbital method: an approximate computational method for large molecules|year=1999|journal=Chem. Phys. Lett.|volume=313|pages=701–706|author1=K. Kitaura |author2=E. Ikeo |author3=T. Asada |author4=T. Nakano |author5=M.  Uebayasi |doi=10.1016/S0009-2614(99)00874-X|issue=3–4|bibcode=1999CPL...313..701K}}&lt;/ref&gt; FMO is deeply interconnected with the energy decomposition analysis (EDA) by Kitaura and Morokuma, developed in 1976. The main use of FMO is to compute very large molecular systems by dividing them into fragments and performing ab initio or density functional quantum-mechanical calculations of fragments and their dimers, whereby the Coulomb field from the whole system is included. The latter feature allows fragment calculations without using caps.

The mutually consistent field (MCF) method &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Investigation of the interaction between molecules at medium distances: I. SCF LCAO MO supermolecule, perturbational and mutually consistent calculations for two interacting HF and CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules|year=1975|journal=Chem. Phys.|volume=8|pages=192–200|author1=P. Otto |author2=J. Ladik |doi = 10.1016/0301-0104(75)80107-8|issue=1-2|bibcode=1975CP......8..192O}}&lt;/ref&gt; had introduced the idea of self-consistent fragment calculations in their embedding potential, which was later used with some modifications in various methods including FMO. There had been other methods related to FMO including the incremental correlation method by H. Stoll (1992).&lt;ref&gt;H. Stoll (1992), Phys. Rev. B 46, 6700&lt;/ref&gt; Also FMO bears some similarity to the method by J. Gao (1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Toward a Molecular Orbital Derived Empirical Potential for Liquid Simulations|year=1997|journal=J. Phys. Chem. B|volume=101|pages=657–663|author=J. Gao|doi = 10.1021/jp962833a|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the applicability of which for condensed phase systems was subsequently demonstrated by carrying out a statistical mechanical Monte Carlo simulation of liquid water in 1998;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gao, (1998), "A molecular-orbital derived polarization potential for liquid water." J. Chem. Phys. 109, 2346-2354.&lt;/ref&gt; this method was later renamed as the explicit polarization (X-Pol) theory. The incremental method uses formally the same many-body expansion of properties as FMO, although the exact meaning of terms is different.  The difference between X-Pol and FMO is in the approximation for estimating the pair interactions between fragments. X-Pol is closely related to the one-body expansion used in FMO (FMO1) in terms of the electrostatics, but other interactions are treated differently.

Later, other methods closely related to FMO were proposed including the kernel energy method of L. Huang&lt;ref&gt;L. Huang, L. Massa, J. Karle, (2005), "Kernel energy method illustrated with peptides", Int. J. Quant. Chem 103, 808-817&lt;/ref&gt; and the electrostatically embedded many-body expansion by E. Dahlke,&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Dahlke, D. G. Truhlar (2007) "Electrostatically Embedded Many-Body Expansion for Large Systems, with Applications to Water Clusters", J. Chem. Theory Comput. 3, 46–53&lt;/ref&gt;
S. Hirata&lt;ref&gt;S. Hirata, M. Valiev, M. Dupuis, S. S. Xantheas, S. Sugiki, H. Sekino, (2005) Mol. Phys.  103, 2255&lt;/ref&gt; and later M. Kamiya&lt;ref&gt;M. Kamiya, S. Hirata, M.
Valiev, (2008), J. Chem. Phys. 128, 074103&lt;/ref&gt; suggested approaches also very closely related to FMO. Effective fragment molecular orbital (EFMO) method combines some features of the effective fragment potentials (EFP) and FMO. A detailed perspective on the fragment-based method development can be found in a recent review.&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Gordon, D. G. Fedorov, S. R. Pruitt, L. V. Slipchenko, (2012)
"Fragmentation Methods: A Route to Accurate Calculations on Large Systems.", Chem. Rev. 112, 632-672.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction to FMO ==

In addition to the calculation of the total properties, such as the energy,
energy gradient, dipole moment etc., the pair interaction is obtained for
each pair of fragments. This pair interaction energy can be further
decomposed into electrostatic, exchange, charge transfer and dispersion
contributions. This analysis is known as the pair interaction energy
decomposition analysis (PIEDA) and it can be thought of as FMO-based EDA.
Alternatively, configuration analysis for fragment interaction (CAFI) and fragment interaction analysis based on local MP2 (FILM) were suggested within the FMO framework.

In FMO, various wave functions can be used for ab initio calculations of fragments and their dimers, such as [[Hartree–Fock]], [[Density functional theory]] (DFT), [[Multi-configurational self-consistent field]] (MCSCF), time-dependent DFT ([[TDDFT]]), [[configuration interaction]] (CI), second order [[Møller–Plesset perturbation theory]] (MP2), and [[coupled cluster]] (CC). The solvent effects can be treated with the [[Polarizable continuum model]] (PCM). The FMO code is very efficiently parallelized utilising the generalized distributed data interface (GDDI) and hundreds of CPUs can be used with nearly perfect scaling.

In the FMO book published in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;''The Fragment Molecular Orbital Method: Practical Applications to Large Molecular Systems'', edited by D. G. Fedorov, K. Kitaura, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-4200-7848-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; one can find 10 illustrated chapters written by the experts in the FMO development and applications, as well as a CDROM with
annotated samples of input and output files, Facio modelling software and video tutorials (AppliGuide movies, showing mouse clicks) for treating difficult PDB files with Facio. In addition to this book, there are several chapters published in other books.&lt;ref&gt;"(a) D. G. Fedorov, K. Kitaura, ''Theoretical development of the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method'' and (b) T. Nakano, Y. Mochizuki, K. Fukuzawa, S. Amari, S.

In 2013-2014, a Japanese journal, CICSJ Bulletin, published a series of FMO papers in Japanese (about 100 pages in total), which give a representative summary of the recent FMO development and applications done in Japan, including papers on the GAMESS/FMO interface in Facio and developing an OpenMP version of GAMESS/FMO on the K computer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/cicsj/31/3/_contents/-char/ja/&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest system size computed with FMO so far is a slab of fullerite surface, containing 1,030,440 atoms, whose geometry was fully optimized using FMO-DFTB recently implemented in GAMESS.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Nishimoto, D. G. Fedorov, S. Irle (2014) Density-functional tight-binding combined with the fragment molecular orbital method. J. Chem. Theor. Comput. DOI: 10.1021/ct500489d&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of FMO ==

There are two main application fields of FMO: biochemistry and molecular dynamics of chemical reactions in solution. In addition, there is an emerging field of inorganic applications. 
 
In 2005, an application of FMO to the calculation of the ground electronic state of photosynthetic protein with more than 20,000 atoms was distinguished with the best technical paper award at Supercomputing 2005.
A number of applications of FMO to biochemical problems has been published, for instance, to [[Drug design]] , quantitative structure-activity relationship ([[QSAR]]) as well as the studies of excited states and chemical reactions of biological systems. In the recent development (2008), the adaptive frozen orbital (AFO) treatment of the detached bonds was suggested for FMO, making it possible to study solids, surfaces and nano systems, such as silicon nanowrires. FMO-TDDFT was also applied to the excited states of molecular crystals (quinacridone).

Among inorganic systems, silica-related materials (zeolites, mesoporous nanoparticles and silica surfaces) were studied with FMO,
as well as ionic liquids and boron nitride ribbons.&lt;ref&gt;http://staff.aist.go.jp/d.g.fedorov/fmo/fmoref.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software for FMO ==
The FMO method is implemented in [[GAMESS (US)]], ABINIT-MP and PAICS software packages, distributed free of charge.

In the earlier stage, the preparation of the GAMESS input files was facilitated with the '''FMOutil''' software.&lt;ref&gt;http://staff.aist.go.jp/d.g.fedorov/fmo/fmoutil.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later, various parts of FMOutil were
incorporated in the new graphical user interface called '''fu'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/fusuite/&lt;/ref&gt; 
'''Fu''' is a general open-source GUI not limited to FMO or GAMESS. It is written mainly in Python and some critical modules
are in FORTRAN. '''Fu''' is distributed under BSD license so anybody can modify it and redistributed freely.  
In addition, another graphical user interface '''Facio'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.bbiq.jp/zzzfelis/Facio.html&lt;/ref&gt; developed by M. Suenaga has a very convenient specialised support of FMO (in addition to other features), with which an automatic fragmentation of molecular clusters, proteins, nucleotides, saccharides and any combination thereof (e.g., DNA and protein complexes in explicit solvent) can be done in a few minutes, and a manual fragmentation of solids and surfaces can be accomplished by clicking the bonds to be detached. Facio can also visualise results of FMO calculations, such as the pair interactions.

There is a convenient Web-based interface to FMO, FMOtools, available from the FMO portal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmo-portal.info&lt;/ref&gt; FMOtools can generate FMO input files, visualise results of FMO calculations and  short test calculations can be executed from the Web interface. FragIt &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fragit.org/&lt;/ref&gt; is a Web interface, as well as a standalone program, which can generate (E)FMO input files for GAMESS. It features a unique system of chemical patterns, which allows an automatic fragmentation of in principle an arbitrary molecular system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="945">The '''gastroileal reflex''' is one of the three extrinsic reflexes of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], the other two being the [[gastrocolic reflex]] and the [[enterogastric reflex]]. The gastroileal reflex is stimulated by the presence of food in the stomach and gastric peristalsis. Initiation of the reflex causes peristalsis in the ileum and the opening of the ileocecal valve (which allows the emptying of the ileal contents into the large intestine, or colon).&lt;ref name=textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed&gt;{{cite book |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |last=Guyton |first=Arthur C. |year=1991|edition=8th|publisher=W.B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4675">In [[astronomy]], the '''geometric albedo''' of a [[celestial body]] is the ratio of its actual brightness as seen from the light source (i.e. at zero [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]]) to that of an ''idealized'' flat, fully reflecting, [[diffuse reflection|diffusively scattering]] ([[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian]]) disk with the same cross-section. (This phase angle refers to the direction of the light paths and is not a phase angle in its normal meaning in [[Phase (waves)|optics]] or [[Phasor (electronics)|electronics]].)

[[Diffuse reflection|Diffuse scattering]] implies that radiation is reflected isotropically with no memory of the location of the incident light source. Zero phase angle corresponds to looking along the direction of illumination. For Earth-bound observers this occurs when the body in question is at [[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] and on the [[ecliptic]].

The '''visual geometric albedo''' refers to the geometric albedo quantity when accounting for only [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]].

== Airless bodies ==

The surface materials ([[regolith]]s) of airless bodies (in fact, the majority of bodies in the [[Solar System]]) are strongly non-Lambertian and exhibit the [[opposition effect]], which is a strong tendency to reflect light straight back to its source, rather than scattering light diffusely.

The geometric albedo of these bodies can be difficult to determine because of this, as their [[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function|reflectance]] is strongly peaked for a small range of phase angles near zero.&lt;ref name=medkeff&gt;See for example [http://jeff.medkeff.com/astro/lunar/obs_tech/albedo.htm this discussion of Lunar albedo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413042346/http://jeff.medkeff.com/astro/lunar/obs_tech/albedo.htm |date=April 13, 2009 }} by Jeff Medkeff.&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of this peak differs markedly between bodies, and can only be found by making measurements at small enough phase angles. Such measurements are usually difficult due to the necessary precise placement of the observer very close to the incident light. For example, the Moon is never seen from the Earth at exactly zero phase angle, because then it is being eclipsed. Other Solar System bodies are not in general seen at exactly zero phase angle even at [[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]], unless they are also simultaneously located at the [[Ascending node#Node distinction|ascending or descending node]] of their orbit, and hence lie on the [[ecliptic]]. In practice, measurements at small nonzero phase angles are used to derive the parameters which characterize the directional reflectance properties for the body ([[Hapke parameters]]). The reflectance function described by these can then be extrapolated to zero phase angle to obtain an estimate of the geometric albedo.

For very bright, solid, airless objects such as [[Saturn]]'s moons [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] and [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], whose total reflectance ([[Bond albedo]]) is close to one, a strong [[opposition effect]] combines with the high Bond albedo to give them a geometric albedo above unity (1.4 in the case of Enceladus). Light is preferentially reflected straight back to its source even at low [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] such as on the limb or from a slope, whereas a Lambertian surface would scatter the radiation much more broadly. A geometric albedo above unity means that the intensity of light scattered back per unit solid angle towards the source is higher than is possible for any Lambertian surface.

== Equivalent definitions ==

For the hypothetical case of a plane surface, the geometric albedo is the [[albedo]] of the surface when the illumination is provided by a beam of radiation that comes in [[perpendicular]] to the surface.

== Examples ==

The geometric albedo may be greater or smaller than the Bond albedo, depending on surface and atmospheric properties of the body in question. Some examples:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/albedo.html Albedo of the Earth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Germinal''''' is the thirteenth novel in [[Émile Zola]]'s twenty-volume series ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]''. Often considered Zola's masterpiece and one of the most significant novels in the French tradition, the novel&amp;nbsp;– an uncompromisingly harsh and realistic story of a coalminers' strike in northern France in the 1860s&amp;nbsp;– has been published and translated in over one hundred countries and has additionally inspired five film adaptations and two television productions.

''Germinal'' was written between April 1884 and January 1885. It was first serialized between November 1884 and February 1885 in the periodical ''[[Gil Blas (periodical)|Gil Blas]]'', then in March 1885 published as a book.

The title ({{IPA-fr|ʒɛʁminal|pron}}) refers to [[Germinal (French Republican Calendar)|the name of a month]] of the [[French Republican Calendar#Months|French Republican Calendar]], a spring month. ''Germen'' is a [[Latin]] word which means "seed"; the novel describes the hope for a better future that seeds amongst the [[miner]]s. As the final lines of the novel read:
{{Quote|''Des hommes poussaient, une armée noire, vengeresse, qui germait lentement dans les sillons, grandissant pour les récoltes du siècle futur, et dont la germination allait faire bientôt éclater la terre.''&lt;br /&gt;Men were springing forth, a black avenging army, germinating slowly in the furrows, growing towards the harvests of the next century, and their germination would soon overturn the earth.|1885 translation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/eldritch/ez/g76.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Plot summary==
[[File:First page GERMINAL.jpg|thumb|left|The title page of the 1885 [[French language|French]] edition]]

The novel's central character is Étienne Lantier, previously seen in ''[[L'Assommoir]]'' (1877), and originally to have been the central character in Zola's "murder on the trains" thriller ''[[La Bête humaine]]'' (1890) before the overwhelmingly positive reaction to ''Germinal'' persuaded him otherwise. The young migrant worker arrives at the forbidding coal mining town of Montsou in the bleak area of the far north of France to earn a living as a miner. Sacked from his previous job on the railways for assaulting a superior, Étienne befriends the veteran miner Maheu, who finds him somewhere to stay and gets him a job pushing the carts down the pit.

Étienne is portrayed as a hard-working idealist but also a naïve youth; Zola's genetic theories come into play as Étienne is presumed to have inherited his Macquart ancestors' traits of hotheaded impulsiveness and an [[addictive personality]] capable of exploding into rage under the influence of drink or strong passions. Zola keeps his theorizing in the background and Étienne's motivations are much more natural as a result. He embraces socialist principles, reading large amounts of working class movement literature and fraternizing with Souvarine, a Russian anarchist and political émigré who has also come to Montsou to seek a living in the pits. Étienne's simplistic understanding of socialist politics and their rousing effect on him are very reminiscent of the rebel Silvère in the first novel in the cycle, ''[[La Fortune des Rougon]]'' (1871).

While this is going on, Étienne also falls for Maheu's daughter Catherine, also employed pushing carts in the mines, and he is drawn into the relationship between her and her brutish lover Chaval, a prototype for the character of Buteau in Zola's later novel ''[[La Terre]]'' (1887). The complex tangle of the miners' lives is played out against a backdrop of severe poverty and oppression, as their working and living conditions continue to worsen throughout the novel; eventually, pushed to breaking point, the miners decide to strike and Étienne, now a respected member of the community and recognized as a political idealist, becomes the leader of the movement. While the anarchist Souvarine preaches violent action, the miners and their families hold back, their poverty becoming ever more disastrous, until they are sparked into a ferocious riot, the violence of which is described in explicit terms by Zola, as well as providing some of the novelist's best and most evocative crowd scenes. The rioters are eventually confronted by police and the army that repress the revolt in a violent and unforgettable episode. Disillusioned, the miners go back to work, blaming Étienne for the failure of the strike; then, Souvarine sabotages the entrance shaft of one of the Montsou pits, trapping Étienne, Catherine and Chaval at the bottom. The ensuing drama and the long wait for rescue are among some of Zola's best scenes, and the novel draws to a dramatic close. Étienne is eventually rescued and fired but he goes on to live in Paris with Pluchart&lt;!-- Such man or woman has not been introduced in this article yet. --&gt;.

==Historical context==
[[File:Angiolillo died bravely.png|thumb|[[Michele Angiolillo]] uttered clearly the word '''Germinal''' before he died.]]

The title, ''Germinal'', is drawn from the springtime seventh month of the [[French Revolutionary Calendar]] and is meant to evoke imagery of germination, new growth and fertility. Accordingly, Zola ends the novel on a note of hope and one that has provided inspiration to socialist and reformist causes of all kinds throughout the years since its first publication:

"Beneath the blazing of the sun, in that morning of new growth, the countryside rang with song, as its belly swelled with a black and avenging army of men, germinating slowly in its furrows, growing upwards in readiness for harvests to come, until one day soon their ripening would burst open the earth itself."

By the time of his death, the novel had come to be recognized as his undisputed masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XA3ct_HebxsC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=Germinal+Zola+influence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUs6GBrLvKAhULcz4KHRehB84Q6AEIVDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Germinal%20Zola%20influence&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; At his funeral crowds of workers gathered, cheering the cortège with shouts of "Germinal! Germinal!". Since then the book has come to symbolize working class causes and to this day retains a special place in French mining-town folklore.

Zola was always very proud of ''Germinal'' and was always keen to defend its accuracy against accusations of hyperbole and exaggeration (from the conservatives) or of slander against the working classes (from the socialists). His research had been typically thorough, especially the parts involving lengthy observational visits to northern French mining towns in 1884, such as witnessing the after-effects of a crippling miners' strike first-hand at [[Anzin]] or actually going down a working coal pit at [[Denain]]. The mine scenes are especially vivid and haunting as a result.

A sensation upon original publication, it is now by far the best-selling of Zola's novels, both in France and internationally. A number of modern translations are currently in print and widely available.

==Adaptations==
The novel has been filmed a number of times, including:
* ''[[Germinal (1913 film)|Germinal]]'' (1913), directed by [[Albert Capellani]], starring [[Henry Krauss]]
* ''[[Germinal (1963 film)|Germinal]]'' (1963), directed by [[Yves Allégret]], starring [[Jean Sorel]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Berthe Granval|fr}}, [[Claude Brasseur]] and [[Bernard Blier]].
* ''Germinal'' (1970), a BBC five-part serial with [[Mark Jones (actor)|Mark Jones]] and  [[Rosemary Leach]]
* ''[[Germinal (1993 film)|Germinal]]'' (1993), a large-scale production directed by [[Claude Berri]] and starring [[Gérard Depardieu]] and [[Miou-Miou]], at that time the most expensive feature film ever made in France. Much of Berri's film was shot on location in the [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] and [[Valenciennes]] regions of northern France, and the extensive unemployment and poverty the cast and crew still witnessed there led to the formation of a society, "Germinal l'association", headed by Depardieu, to alleviate the suffering caused by crippling unemployment in the ''[[Departments of France|départements]]'' comprising the region of [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13998">'''Girl studies''', also known as '''girlhood studies''', is an interdisciplinary academic field of study that is focused on [[girl]]hood and girls' culture that combines advocacy and the direct perspectives and thoughts of girls themselves.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kirk, Jackie, Claudia Mitchell, Jacqueline Reid-Walsh. “Welcome to this inaugural issue of Girlhood Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal (GHS).” ''Girlhood Studies'', vol. 1, no. 1, 2008.

== History and development ==
Girl studies officially became a field in the 1990s, after the increase in conversation about getting more girls into science, math, and technology fields in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Girlhood and the Politics of Place|last=Mitchell|first=Claudia|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Mitchell|editor-first=Claudia|location=|pages=|chapter=Charting Girlhood Studies|editor-last2=Rentschler|editor-first2=Carrie|editor-link2=Carrie Rentschler}}&lt;/ref&gt; though scholars and researchers were studying girls prior to this decade. In the 1970s, some feminist scholars brought to attention the unbalanced focus of boyhood in comparison to girlhood in youth research. Angela McRobbie, Meda Chesney-Lind, and Christine Griffin were some of the few scholars studying and critiquing the lack of study on girlhood and girl culture in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In the early 1990s, the [[Harvard]] Project on Women's Psychology and Girls' Development conducted a study on the social development of relationships of girls. This study found that when they approach adolescence, girls begin to hide their honest feelings and desires from those they are in close relationships with, making it hard for them to express their feelings later in life. In 1992, the [[American Association of University Women]] (AAUW) published ''How Schools Shortchange Girls,'' "the first national survey to assert a link between girls' psychosocial experience and schooling".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Benjamin, Beth Cooper and Ward, Janie Victoria. “Women, Girls, and the Unfinished Work of Connection: A Critical Review of American Girls’ Studies.” ''All about the Girl: Culture, Power, and Identity'', edited by Anita Harris, Psychology Press, 2004, pp. 15-27.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Girl studies emerged in the 1990s, a time when there was an increased interest from the media and fashion and beauty industries in young women. Advertisers and retailers marketed towards girls by "promising female youth agency and social value" from purchasing the products.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the academy, there was an increase in feminist and gender studies scholars focusing on intersectionality and subsequently on girls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2008, scholars Claudia Mitchell, Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, and [[Jackie Kirk]] established and launched ''[[Girlhood Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal]]'' after recognizing the emerging interest in the field at the 2001 "A New Girl Order: Young Women and the Future of Feminist Inquiry" conference at [[King's College London]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As girl studies develops, "there has been significant movement away from studying girls as future women and toward analyzing girls as members of a unique demographic group", especially in psychology, history, and sociology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is also a movement towards focusing more on [[intersectionality]] and the experiences of girls across the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a 2016 article, Claudia Mitchell acknowledges the presence of girlhood studies in Africa, referencing a South African video project called ''Vikea Abantwana (Protect The Children: A Story about Incest)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt14jxn16.10|title=Girlhood and the Politics of Place|date=2016|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9780857456021|pages=87–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video chronicles the life of Philendelini, a young girl who was raped by her father. Mitchell mentions this film to highlight the necessity of girlhood studies; in the film, Philendelini confides in several adult women about her assault and is ignored or turned down in each instance.

On the topic of insuring an intersectional and transnational approach in girl studies, scholar Oneka LaBennett commented “Black schoolgirls and college students have engaged in protests across the globe. Girls themselves have drawn attention to the negative impact of things like white beauty standards, the intersections of racial and gender violence, the problems with police brutality and the school-to-prison pipeline."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Meet-the-Scholars-Building-a/239716|title=Meet the Scholars Building a Network Around Black Girlhood|date=2017-04-06|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Black Girlhood Studies ==
Black Girlhood Studies has developed in recent years to combat the white washed field of Girls' studies. Black girlhood studies is understood as a site of Black feminist inquiry with aims of centering the coming into knowing Black girls’ experience and representations of Black girlhood. In ''Black Girlhood Celebration: Toward a Hip-hop Feminist'' Ruth Nicole Brown states that Black girlhood are, “the representations, memories, and lived experiences of being and becoming in a body marked as youthful, Black, and female.”&lt;ref name="Brown, Ruth Nicole 2008"&gt;Brown, Ruth Nicole. Black Girlhood Celebration: Toward a Hip-Hop Feminist Pedagogy. First printing edition. New York: Peter Lang Inc., International Academic Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Brown, Black girlhood is a powerful concept that enables Black girls to create sacred spaces for themselves and each other even while structural forces work “to posit [Black girls] as the very “risky” problem, an aberration of normal.”&lt;ref name="Brown, Ruth Nicole 2008"/&gt;  Brown’s sentiments were echoed again during the 2016 “Black Girl Movement: A National Conference”, a three-day conference at Columbia University in New York City that focused on Black girls, cis, queer, and trans girls, in the United States. The purpose of the conference was to recognize that while Black girls are “among the most significant cultural producers, community connectors, and trendsetters”, Black girls still remain highly invisible and “are in crisis.”&lt;ref&gt;“Black Girl Movement Conference | IRAAS Institute for Research in African-American Studies.” Accessed December 7, 2017. http://iraas.columbia.edu/Event/black-girl-movement-conference.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars  have used this moment to theorize liberating projects for Black girls and Black girlhood, a site of both theoretical and practical analysis. Founded by LaKisha Simmons, Renee Sentilles, and Corinne Field, [https://historyofblackgirlhood.org/ History of Black Girlhood: An Academic Network] provides a forum for scholars centering Black girlhood to share work and collaborate. While many of the work in Black Girlhood Studies is contemporary, there are Black feminist canonical texts that hone in on the ways in which Black girlhood has always already been present in the work of Black women ([[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]] by Toni Morrison, [[For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf|For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow is Enuf]] by Ntozake Shange, [[The Bluest Eye]] by Toni Morrison, [[Bone Black|Bone Black: Memories of Girlhood]] by bell hooks, among many others). These materials span literature, film, poetry, policy, magazine articles, and so on.

Many of the texts foundational to the contemporary field of Black girlhood studies fall within an ethnographic tradition. These works include Elizabeth Chin’s ''Purchasing Power: Black Kids and American Consumer Culture'' (2001), Ruth Nicole Brown’s ''Black Girlhood Celebration: Toward a Hip-hop Feminist Pedagogy'' (2009) Oneka LaBennett’s S''he’s Mad Real: Popular Culture and West Indian Girls in Brooklyn'' (2011), and Aimee Meredith Cox’s ''Shapeshifters: Black Girls and the Choreography of Citizenship'' (2015). These texts examine Black girls’ complex racialized, gendered, and age-based cultural realities as they navigate and resist multiple forms of violences. These [[Ethnography|ethnographies]] are rooted in a Black feminist epistemological emphasis on centering lived experiences.

Historians Abosede George ''Making Modern Girls: A history of girlhood, labor, and social development in 20th century colonial Lagos'' (2015), Marcia Chatelain ''South Side Girls: Growing Up in the Great Migration'' (2015), LaKisha Simmons ''Crescent City Girls: The Lives of Young Black Women in Segregated New Orleans'' (2015) extends beyond the ethnographic work of the field in which the three scholars mentioned focus on place and social history to tell the stories of Black girls. This regional approach emphasizes the necessary local specifies of Black girlhood. Nazera Sadiq Wright's ''Black Girlhood in the Nineteenth Century'' (2016) traces a long literary tradition to discover the origins of Black girlhood as we have come to understand the category today.

== Criticism ==
As an emerging field, girl studies has faced some criticisms from other scholars. Janie Victoria Wald and Beth Cooper Benjamin have found that connections between "girls' psychosocial development and persistent issues in adult women's lives" are not as present in recent scholarship as they were during the advent of the field and believe they should be in order to explore intergenerational relationships.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These two scholars also criticize the increased specialization of focus in the field and subsequent disconnect between the subfields.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Mary Celeste Kearney, a scholar who does work in girl studies, notices that though there is a focus on intersectionality within the field, "non-white, non-Western girls remain vastly understudied as result of such research being conducted primarily in Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Northern Europe, and the United States."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some critics identify problems that they see with the field as a whole, claiming that it is neither a new nor exciting field, as the ''[[Girlhood Studies]]'' journal states, but rather one that is established and in crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Mendes Kaitlynn, Kumarini Silva, Linda Duits, Liesbet van Zoonen, Sharon Lamb, Shakuntala Banaji, and Natalie Edwards (2009) Commentary and criticism, Feminist Media Studies, 9:1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future of Girlhood ==

When girls are growing up, they are learning from the women around them, what is right and what is wrong. Women of the older ages are set up as role models for those who are under the age of 18. The future of girlhood is in the hands of those who chose to set a good example forward for these young people to grasp onto. Marnina et al., explained in their book that we are past the after-girl power stage (2009). After passing this stage these groups of writers are posing another question as to if there is something that comes after this stage. Girls have seen violence from all sorts of stages causing them to fear their growing up ways. As mentioned in the text ''History and Popular Culture at Work in the Subjectivity of a Tween,'' the authors daughter was scared to become an adult because of the concerns of others. Other people in her class were bring articles and other pieces of writing that scared Elisabeth into thinking that growing up was not something that she wanted to do (2005). With girls having these types of ideas rushing through their minds as they get older – we are not helping them grow in a safe space. Instead, we are raising them to fear the outside world and not want to be a part of it. This can change if we focus on what comes next once we pass the after-girl power.

}}The term '''''choice theory''''' is the work of [[William Glasser]], [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], author of the book so named, and is the culmination of some 50 years of theory and practice in [[psychology]] and [[counselling]].

==Characteristics==
Choice theory posits behaviours we choose are central to our existence. Our behaviour ([[choice]]s) are driven by five genetically driven needs, survival, love and belonging, freedom, fun, and power.
Survival needs include
* food
* clothing
* shelter
* breathing
* personal safety
* security and sex, having children
and four fundamental psychological needs:
* Belonging/connecting/[[love]]
* [[Power (sociology)|Power]]/significance/competence
* [[Liberty|Freedom]]/autonomy
* Fun/learning

Choice theory suggests the existence of a "Quality World". Glasser's idea of a "Quality World" restates the [[Jungian archetypes|Jungian idea of archetypes]] but Glasser never acknowledged this. Nonetheless, Glasser's "Quality World" and what [[Carl Jung|Jung]] would call healthy archetypes are indistinguishable.

Our "Quality World" images are our role models of an individual's "perfect" world of parents, relations, possessions, beliefs, etc. How each person's "Quality World" is somewhat unusual, even in the same family of origin, is taken for granted.

Starting from birth and continuing throughout our lives, each person places significant role models, significant possessions and significant systems of belief (religion, cultural values, and [[icon]]s, etc.) into a mostly unconscious framework Glasser called our "Quality World". Glasser mostly ignores the issues of negative role models and stereotypes in choice theory.

Glasser also posits a "Comparing Place" where we compare-contrast our perception of people, places, and things immediately in front of us against our ideal images (archetypes) of these in our Quality World framework. Our subconscious pushes us towards calibrating—as best we can—our real world experience with our Quality World (archetypes).

Behavior ("Total Behavior" in Glasser's terms) is made up of these four components:  [[acting]], [[thinking]], [[feeling]], and [[physiology]]. Glasser suggests we have considerable control or choice over the first two of these; yet, little ability to directly choose the latter two as they are more deeply sub- and unconscious. These four components remain closely intertwined, the choices we make in our thinking and acting greatly affect our feeling and physiology.

A big conclusion for Glasser, one he repeats often, is the source of much personal unhappiness is failing or failed [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] with people important to us: spouses, parents, [[children]], friends and [[colleague]]s.

The symptoms of unhappiness are widely variable and are often seen as [[mental illness]]. Glasser believed that "pleasure" and "happiness" are related but are far from synonymous. [[Sex]], for example, is a "pleasure" but may well be divorced from a "satisfactory relationship" which is a precondition for lasting "[[happiness]]" in [[life]]. Hence the intense focus on the improvement of relationships in counseling with choice theory—the "new reality therapy". Those familiar with both are likely to prefer choice theory, the more modern formulation.

Choice theory posits most mental illness is, in fact, an expression of unhappiness. Glasser champions how we are able to learn and choose alternate behaviors resulting in greater personal satisfaction. [[Reality therapy]] is the choice theory-based counseling process focused on helping clients to learn to make those self-optimizing choices.

==The ten axioms==

# The only person whose behavior we can control is our own.&lt;br /&gt;
# All we can give another person is information.&lt;br /&gt;
# All long-lasting psychological problems are relationship problems.&lt;br /&gt;
# The problem relationship is always part of our present life.&lt;br /&gt;
# What happened in the past has everything to do with what we are today, but we can only satisfy our basic needs right now and plan to continue satisfying them in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
# We can only satisfy our needs by satisfying the pictures in our Quality World.&lt;br /&gt;
# All we do is behave.&lt;br /&gt;
# All behavior is Total Behavior and is made up of four components: acting, thinking, feeling and physiology&lt;br /&gt;
# All Total Behavior is chosen, but we only have direct control over the acting and thinking components. We can only control our feeling and physiology indirectly through how we choose to act and think.&lt;br /&gt;
# All Total Behavior is designated by verbs and named by the part that is the most recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.choicetheory.com | title=Choice Theory Psychology, Reality Therapy, Lead Management, &amp; Quality Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In classroom management ==
William Glasser's choice theory begins:  behavior is not separate from choice; we all choose how to behave at any time. Second, we cannot control anyone's behavior but our own. Glasser also believed in the vitality of classroom meetings for the purpose of improving communication and solving real classroom problems. In the classroom, it is important for teachers to "help students envision a quality existence in school and plan the choices that lead to it".&lt;ref name="Charles, C.M. 2008"&gt;Charles, C.M. (2008). ''Building Classroom Discipline.'' (9th ed.). Boston: Pearson Education.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Johnny Waits is an 18-year-old high school senior and plans on attending college to become a computer programmer. Glasser suggests Johnny could be learning as much as he can about computers instead of reading Plato. This concept is called quality curriculum, which connects students with practical real world topics, chosen by the student according to their leanings. Topics with actual career potential are most encouraged. Under Glasser's strategy, teachers hold discussions with students when introducing new topics asking them to identify what they would like to explore in depth. As part of the process, students need to explain why the material is valuable in life.&lt;ref name="Charles, C.M. 2008"/&gt;

==Education==

Glasser was no supporter of [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]]. Most Quality Schools he supervised had very conventional curriculum topics. The main innovation was a deeper, humanistic approach to group process between teacher, student and learning.

A typical example of choice theory and education are [[Sudbury school|Sudbury Model schools]], where students decide for themselves how to spend their days. In these schools, students of all ages determine what they will do, as well as when, how, and where they will do it. This freedom is at the heart of the school and it belongs to the students as their right, not to be violated. The fundamental premises of the school are: that all people are curious by nature; that the most efficient, long-lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; that age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group; and that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility. In practice this means that students initiate all their own activities and create their own environments. The physical plant, the staff, and the equipment are there for the students to use as the need arises. The school provides a setting in which students are independent, are trusted, and are treated as responsible people; and a community in which students are exposed to the complexities of life in the framework of a participatory democracy.

Sudbury schools are based on the premise that students are personally responsible for their acts, in opposition to virtually all schools today that deny it. The denial is threefold: schools do not permit students to choose their course of action fully; they do not permit students to embark on the course, once chosen; and they do not permit students to suffer the consequences of the course, once taken. Freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action—these are the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. Thus, members of these schools learn democracy by experience, and enjoy the rights of individuals.

Sudbury schools do not perform and do not offer evaluations, assessments, or recommendations, asserting that they do not rate people, and that school is not a judge; comparing students to each other, or to some standard that has been set is for them a violation of the student's right to privacy and to self-determination. Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real lifelong learning and the proper educational evaluation for the 21st Century, they adduce.

== Critiques ==

Glasser's theories and teachings have not gone without criticism. In a book review,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v07n02/v07n0208.pdf Review of ''Warning: Psychiatry Can Be Hazardous to Your Mental Health''], Jackson, W. Clay.  2005. The Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, Vol. 7, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; W. Clay Jackson writes, "Dr. Glasser postulates that everything contained in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-IV-TR .282000.29|DSM-IV-TR]] is a result of an individual's brain creatively expressing its unhappiness. ... Dr. Glasser demonizes the entire profession as charlatans who have been brainwashed by their predecessors or who simply misrepresent many of the psychiatric illnesses to patients as having a biological basis. ... Despite claiming to have an appendix full of references demonstrating there is no evidence medications have a role in curing mental illness, the book simply relies on a core group of anti-establishment authors. ... However, what is noticeably absent from the book is a set of randomized clinical trials demonstrating the success of his teachings."

'''Habitat conservation''' is a management practice that seeks to [[Conservation (ethic)|conserve]], protect and restore [[habitat]] areas for wild [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, especially [[conservation reliant species]], and prevent their [[extinction]], [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] or reduction in [[Range (biology)|range]].&lt;ref name="CDFG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/habcon/|title=Habitat Conservation|last=Habitat Conservation Planning Branch|publisher=California Department of Fish &amp; Game|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a priority of many groups that cannot be easily characterized in terms of any one [[ideology]].

==History of the conservation movement==

For much of human history, ''nature'' had been seen as a [[natural resource|resource]], one that could be controlled by the government and used for personal and [[profit (economics)|economic gain]]. The idea was that plants only existed to feed animals and animals only existed to feed humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Keith|title=Man and the Natural World: A History of the Modern Sensibility|year=1983|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=17–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The land itself had limited value only extending to the resources it could provide such as [[mining|minerals]] and [[mineral oil|oil]].

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries social views started to change and scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the [[forest]]s of [[British India]]. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[Civic engagement|civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting Pbnjbthis ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale [[deforestation]] and [[desiccation]], and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of [[forest conservation]] activities in British India through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDYlNljAP5AC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|author=Greg Barton|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=Nov 5, 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

Rather than focusing on the economic or material benefits associated with nature, humans began to appreciate the value of nature itself and the need to protect pristine wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BC Spaces|url=http://spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 20th century countries such as the United States, Canada, and Britain understood this appreciation and instigated laws and legislation in order to ensure that the most fragile and beautiful environments would be protected for generations to come. 
Today with the help of NGO’s, [[not-for profit]] organizations and governments worldwide there is a stronger [[environmental movement|movement]] taking place, with a deeper understanding of habitat conservation with the aim of protecting delicate habitats and preserving [[biodiversity]] on a global scale.  The commitment and actions of small volunteering association in villages and towns, that endeavour to emulate the work done by well known Conservation Organisations, is paramount in ensuring generations that follow understand the importance of conserving natural resources.  A village conservation group with the mission statement "We are committed to protecting and enhancing the natural environment in and around the adjoining villages of [[Ouston, County Durham|Ouston]] and Urpeth." may one day inspire a child who becomes the employee of a worldwide conservation organisation.

== Values of natural habitat ==
{{See also|Environmental Economics}}

The [[natural environment]] is a source for a wide range of resources that can be exploited for [[economic]] profit, for example timber is harvested from forests and clean water is obtained from natural streams. However, [[land development]] from anthropogenic economic growth often causes a decline in the ecological integrity of nearby natural habitat. For instance, this was an issue in the northern rocky mountains of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prato|first=T|title=Evaluating Tradeoffs Between Economic Value and Wildlife Habitat Suitability in Buffer Zones for Protected Areas in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA|journal=Mountain Research and Development|year=2009|volume=29|issue=1|pages=44–58|doi=10.1659/mrd.992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is also economic value in conserving natural habitats. Financial profit can be made from tourist revenue, for example in the tropics where species diversity is high, or in recreational sports which take place in natural environments such as [[hiking]] and [[mountain biking]]. The cost of repairing damaged ecosystems is considered to be much higher than the cost of conserving natural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noidoo|first=R|author2=Adamowicz|title=Economic benefits of biodiversity exceed costs of conservation at an African rainforest reserve|journal=PNAS|year=2005|volume=102|issue=46|pages=16712–16716|bibcode = 2005PNAS..10216712N |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0508036102|pmid=16267131|pmc=1283836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring the worth of conserving different habitat areas is often criticized as being too utilitarian from a philosophical point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=P J|author2=Abivardi|title=The value of biodiversity: where ecology and economy blend|journal=Biological Conservation|year=1998|volume=83|issue=3|pages=239–246|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(97)00141-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity ==
Habitat conservation is important in maintaining [[biodiversity]], an essential part of global food security. There is evidence to support a trend of accelerating erosion of the genetic resources of agricultural plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on Biological Diversity|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/sbstta/sbstta-14/information/sbstta-14-inf-34-en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in genetic similarity of agricultural plants and animals means an increased risk of food loss from major epidemics. Wild species of agricultural plants have been found to be more resistant to disease, for example the wild corn species Teosinte is resistant to 4 corn diseases that affect human grown crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why should we care about biodiversity?|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/bsp/bcn/why/biodvr2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of seed banking and habitat conservation has been proposed to maintain plant diversity for food security purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Seed Bank Partnership|url=http://www.seedpartnership.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classifying environmental values ==
Pearce and Moran outlined the following method for classifying environmental uses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=David|title=The economic value of biodiversity|year=1994|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:PQ5mPZssFVsJ:citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi%3D10.1.1.22.2066%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf+pearce+moran+economics+biodiversity&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=au&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESix7X9nKfRp-D9TYQecQSHQtQMnMJuslfDbAGoOmSAzf-E8yOWUn46b3o02guIUpP1fVGVn9i7VyiIAndu5URorZ_Gox05eOs_JO2p6UMiWumHIarvabB47HvFBU9jMlrZZFD71&amp;sig=AHIEtbRS7HHK6rvUQecNYPJumgtdCmDstQ&amp;pli=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Direct extractive uses: e.g. timber from forests, food from plants and animals
* Indirect uses: e.g. ecosystem services like flood control, pest control, erosion protection
* Optional uses: future possibilities e.g. unknown but potential use of plants in chemistry/medicine
* Non-use values:
**[[Bequest value]] (benefit of an individual who knows that others may benefit from it in future)
**Passive use value (sympathy for natural environment, enjoyment of the mere existence of a particular species)

== Impacts ==

=== Natural causes ===
[[Habitat loss]] and destruction can occur both naturally and through anthropogenic causes. Events leading to natural habitat loss include climate change, catastrophic events such as volcanic explosions and through the interactions of invasive and non-invasive species. Natural climate change, events have previously been the cause of many widespread and large scale losses in habitat. For example, some of the mass extinction events generally referred to as the "Big Five" have coincided with large scale such as the Earth entering an ice age, or alternate warming events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilf|first=P|title=Correlated terrestrial and marine evidence for global climate changes before mass extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary|journal=PNAS|year=2003|volume=100|issue=2|pages=599–604|doi=10.1073/pnas.0234701100|bibcode = 2003PNAS..100..599W|pmid=12524455|pmc=141042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other events in the big five also have their roots in natural causes, such as volcanic explosions and meteor collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hut|first=P|title=Comet showers as a cause of mass extinction|journal=Nature|year=1987|volume=329|issue=10|pages=118–126|doi=10.1038/329118a0|bibcode = 1987Natur.329..118H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=G|title=Chicxulub impact pre-dates the K-T boundary mass extinction|journal=PNAS|year=2004|volume=101|issue=11|pages=3753–3758|pmid=15004276|doi=10.1073/pnas.0400396101|pmc=374316|bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.3753K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]] impact is one such example, which has previously caused widespread losses in habitat as the Earth either received less sunlight or grew colder, causing certain fauna and flora to flourish whilst others perished.  Previously known warm areas in the tropics, the most sensitive habitats on Earth, grew colder, and areas such as Australia developed radically different flora and fauna to those seen today. The big five mass extinction events have also been linked to sea level changes, indicating that large scale marine species loss was strongly influenced by loss in marine habitats, particularly shelf habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hallam|first=A|authorlink= Anthony Hallam|title=Mass extinctions and sea-level changes|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|year=1999|volume=48|pages=217–250|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(99)00055-0|bibcode=1999ESRv...48..217H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methane-driven oceanic eruptions have also been shown to have caused smaller mass extinction events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryskin|first=G|title=Methane-driven oceanic eruptions and mass extinctions|journal=Geology|year=2003|volume=31|issue=9|pages=741–744|doi=10.1130/G19518.1|bibcode = 2003Geo....31..741R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human impacts ===
Humans have been the cause of many species’ extinction. Due to humans’ changing and modifying their environment, the habitat of other species often become altered or destroyed as a result of human actions. Even before the modern industrial era, humans were having widespread, and major effects on the environment. A good example of this is found in Aboriginal Australians and [[Australian megafauna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=G|title=Ecosystem Collapse in Pleistocene Australia and a Human Role in Megafaunal Extinction|journal=Science|year=2005|volume=309|pages=287–290|doi=10.1126/science.1111288|pmid=16002615|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..287M|issue=5732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal hunting practices, which included burning large sections of forest at a time, eventually altered and changed Australia’s vegetation so much that many herbivorous megafauna species were left with no habitat and were driven into extinction. Once herbivorous megafauna species became extinct, carnivorous megafauna species soon followed.
In the recent past, humans have been responsible for causing more extinctions within a given period of time than ever before. [[Deforestation]], [[pollution]], anthropogenic [[climate change]] and human settlements have all been driving forces in altering or destroying habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnosky|first=A|title=Has the Earth’s sixth mass extinction already arrived?|journal=Nature|year=2011|volume=471|pages=51–57|bibcode = 2011Natur.471...51B |doi = 10.1038/nature09678|pmid=21368823}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of ecosystems such as rainforests has resulted in countless habitats being destroyed. These [[biodiversity hotspots]] are home to millions of habitat specialists, which do not exist beyond a tiny area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=N|title=Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities|journal=Nature|year=2000|volume=403|pages=853–858|doi=10.1038/35002501|pmid=10706275|bibcode = 2000Natur.403..853M|issue=6772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once their habitat is destroyed, they cease to exist.This destruction has a follow-on effect, as species which coexist or depend upon the existence of other species also become extinct, eventually resulting in the collapse of an entire ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=T|title=Habitat Loss and Extinction in the Hotspots of Biodiversity|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2002|volume=16|issue=4|pages=909–923|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00530.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=R|title=The sixth mass coextinction: are most endangered species parasites and mutualists?|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|year=2009|volume=276|issue=1670|pages=3037–3045|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0413|pmid=19474041|pmc=2817118}}&lt;/ref&gt; These time-delayed extinctions are referred to as the extinction debt, which is the result of destroying and fragmenting habitats.
As a result of anthropogenic modification of the environment, the extinction rate has climbed to the point where the Earth is now within a sixth mass extinction event, as commonly agreed by biologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCallum|first=M|title=Amphibian Decline or Extinction? Current Declines Dwarf Background Extinction Rate|journal=Journal of Herpetology|year=2007|volume=41|issue=3|pages=483–491|doi=10.1670/0022-1511(2007)41[483:ADOECD]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly evident, for example, in the rapid decline in the number of [[amphibian]] species worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wake|first=D|title=A view from the world of amphibians|journal=PNAS|year=2008|volume=105|pages=11466–11473|bibcode = 2008PNAS..10511466W |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0801921105|pmid=18695221|pmc=2556420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches and methods of habitat conservation ==
Determining the size, type and location of habitat to conserve is a complex area of conservation biology. Although difficult to measure and predict, the conservation value of a habitat is often a reflection of the quality (e.g. species abundance and diversity), endangerment of encompassing ecosystems, and spatial distribution of that habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hierfl|first=L. A.|title=Assessing and Prioritizing Ecological Communities for Monitoring in a Regional Habitat Conservation Plan|journal=Environmental Management|year=2008|volume=42|pages=165–179|bibcode = 2008EnMan..42..165H |doi = 10.1007/s00267-008-9109-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifying priority habitats for conservation ==
Habitat conservation is vital for protecting species and ecological processes. It is important to conserve and protect the space/ area in which that species occupies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shwartz|first=M. W.|title=Choosing the appropriate scale of reserves for conservation|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|year=1999|volume=30|pages=83–108|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.30.1.83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, areas classified as ‘biodiversity hotspots’, or those in which a flagship, umbrella, or endangered species inhabits are often the habitats that are given precedence over others. Species that possess an elevated risk of extinction are given the highest priority and as a result of conserving their habitat, other species in that community are protected thus serving as an element of gap analysis. In the United States of America, a [[Habitat Conservation Plan]] (HCP) is often developed to conserve the environment in which a specific species inhabits. Under the U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) the habitat that requires protection in an HCP is referred to as the ‘critical habitat’. Multiple-species HCPs are becoming more favourable than single-species HCPs as they can potentially protect an array of species before they warrant listing under the ESA, as well as being able to conserve broad ecosystem components and processes . As of January 2007, 484 HCPs were permitted across the United States, 40 of which covered 10 or more species.The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP) encompasses 85 species in a total area of 26,000-km2. Its aim is to protect the habitats of multiple species and overall biodiversity by minimizing development in sensitive areas. Hi

HCPs require clearly defined goals and objectives, efficient monitoring programs, as well as successful communication and collaboration with stakeholders and land owners in the area. Reserve design is also important and requires a high level of planning and management in order to achieve the goals of the HCP. Successful reserve design often takes the form of a hierarchical system with the most valued habitats requiring high protection being surrounded by buffer habitats that have a lower protection status. Like HCPs, hierarchical reserve design is a method most often used to protect a single species, and as a result habitat corridors are maintained, edge effects are reduced and a broader suite of species are protected.

== How much habitat is needed ==
A range of methods and models currently exist that can be used to determine how much habitat is to be conserved in order to sustain a [[viable population]], including [[Resource Selection Function]] and Step Selection models. Modelling tools often rely on the spatial scale of the area as an indicator of conservation value. There has been an increase in emphasis on conserving few large areas of habitat as opposed to many small areas. This idea is often referred to as the "single large or several small", [[SLOSS debate]], and is a highly controversial area among [[conservation biologist]]s and [[ecologist]]s. The reasons behind the argument that "larger is better" include the reduction in the negative impacts of patch edge effects, the general idea that species richness increases with [[habitat area]] and the ability of larger habitats to support greater populations with lower extinction probabilities. Noss &amp; Cooperrider support the "larger is better" claim and developed a model that implies areas of habitat less than 1000ha are "tiny" and of low conservation value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noss|first=R. F.|title=Saving Nature's Legacy, Protecting and Restoring Biodiveristy|year=1994|publisher=Washington, DC|pages=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shwartz suggests that although "larger is better", this does not imply that "small is bad". Shwartz argues that human induced habitat loss leaves no alternative to conserving small areas. Furthermore, he suggests many endangered species which are of high conservation value, may only be restricted to small [[habitat fragmentation|isolated patches]] of habitat, and thus would be overlooked if larger areas were given a higher priority. The shift to conserving larger areas is somewhat justified in society by placing more value on larger vertebrate species, which naturally have larger habitat requirements.

== Examples of current conservation organizations ==

=== The Nature Conservancy ===
Since its formation in 1951 [[The Nature Conservancy]] has slowly developed into one of the world’s largest conservation organizations. Currently operating in over 30 countries, across 5 continents worldwide, The Nature Conservancy aims to protect nature and its assets for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nature Conservancy|url=http://www.nature.org/aboutus/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization purchases land or accepts land donations with the intension of conserving its natural resources.  In 1955 The Nature Conservancy purchased its first 60-acre plot near the New York/Connecticut border in the United States of America. Today the Conservancy has expanded to protect over 119 million acres of land, 5,000 river miles as well as participating in over 1000 marine protection programs across the globe .
Since its beginnings The Nature Conservancy has understood the benefit in taking a scientific approach towards habitat conservation. For the last decade the organization has been using a collaborative, scientific method known as ‘Conservation by Design’. By collecting and analyzing scientific data The Conservancy is able to holistically approach the protection of various ecosystems. This process determines the habitats that need protection, specific elements that should be conserved as well as monitoring progress so more efficient practices can be developed for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nature Conservancy |url=http://www.nature.org/ourscience/conservationbydesign/index.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916210409/http://www.nature.org/ourscience/conservationbydesign/index.htm |archivedate=2011-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nature Conservancy currently has a large number of diverse projects in operation. They work with countries around the world to protect forests, river systems, oceans, deserts and grasslands.  In all cases the aim is to provide a sustainable environment for both the plant and animal life forms that depend on them as well as all future generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nature Conservancy|url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/habitats/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; turtles

=== World Wildlife Fund (WWF) ===
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) was first formed in after a group of passionate conservationists signed what is now referred to as the Morges Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Wildlife Fund|url=http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWF is currently operating in over 100 countries across 5 continents with a current listing of over 5 million supporters. 
One of the first projects of WWF was assisting in the creation of the Charles Darwin Research Foundation which aided in the protection of diverse range of unique species existing on the Galápagos’ Islands, Ecuador.  It was also a WWF grant that helped with the formation of the College of African Wildlife Management in Tanzania which today focuses on teaching a wide range of protected area management skills in areas such as ecology, range management and law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Wildlife Fund|url=http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/history/50_years_of_achievements/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The WWF has since gone on to aid in the protection of land in Spain, creating the [[Coto Doñana National Park]] in order to conserve migratory birds and The [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], home to the world’s largest protected wetlands. The WWF also initiated a debt-for-nature concept which allows the country to put funds normally allocated to paying off national debt, into conservation programs that protect its natural landscapes. Countries currently participating include [[Madagascar]], the first country to participate which since 1989 has generated over $US50 million towards preservation, [[Bolivia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ecuador]], [[Gabon]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Zambia]].

=== Rare Conservation ===
Rare has been in operation since 1973 with current global partners in over 50 countries and offices in the United States of America, Mexico, the Philippines, China and Indonesia. Rare focuses on the human activity that threatens biodiversity and habitats such as overfishing and unsustainable agriculture.  By engaging local communities and changing behaviour Rare has been able to launch campaigns to protect areas in most need of conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Conservation|url=http://rareconservation.org/about}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The key aspect of Rare’s methodology is their "Pride Campaign’s".  For example, in the Andes in South America, Rare has incentives to develop watershed protection practices.  In the Southeast Asia’s "coral triangle" Rare is training fishers in local communities to better manage the areas around the coral reefs in order to lessen human impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Conservation|url=http://rareconservation.org/empowering-local-communities-solve-global-conservation-challenges}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such programs last for three years with the aim of changing community attitudes so as to conserve fragile habitats and provide ecological protection for years to come.

=== WWF Netherlands ===
WWF Netherlands, along with ARK Nature, Wild Wonders of Europe and Conservation Capital have started the Rewilding Europe project. This project intents to rewild several areas in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rewildingeurope.com/ Rewilding Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Star formation}}
In [[astronomy]], the '''interstellar medium''' ('''ISM''') is the [[matter]] and radiation that exists in the [[outer space|space]] between the [[star system]]s in a [[galaxy]]. This matter includes [[gas]] in [[ion]]ic, [[atom]]ic, and [[molecular]] form, as well as [[cosmic dust|dust]] and [[cosmic ray]]s. It fills [[interstellar space]] and blends smoothly into the surrounding [[Outer space#Intergalactic space|intergalactic space]]. The [[energy]] that occupies the same volume, in the form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], is the '''interstellar radiation field'''.

The interstellar medium is composed of multiple phases, distinguished by whether matter is ionic, atomic, or molecular, and the temperature and density of the matter. The interstellar medium is composed primarily of [[hydrogen]] followed by [[helium]] with trace amounts of [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]] comparatively to hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herbst|first=Eric|date=1995|title=Chemistry in The Interstellar Medium|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.pc.46.100195.000331|journal=Annual Review of Physical Chemistry|pages=|bibcode=1995ARPC...46...27H|doi=10.1146/annurev.pc.46.100195.000331|pmid=|accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thermal [[pressures]] of these phases are in rough equilibrium with one another. [[Magnetic field]]s and [[turbulent]] motions also provide pressure in the ISM, and are typically more important [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamically]] than the thermal pressure is.

In all phases, the interstellar medium is extremely tenuous by terrestrial standards. In cool, dense regions of the ISM, matter is primarily in molecular form, and reaches number [[density|densities]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1 million molecules per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). In hot, diffuse regions of the ISM, matter is primarily ionized, and the density may be as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; ions per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Compare this with a number density of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for air at sea level, and 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (10 billion molecules per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for a laboratory high-vacuum chamber. By [[mass]], 99% of the ISM is gas in any form, and 1% is dust.&lt;ref name=Boulanger&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Boulanger, F. |author2=Cox, P. |author3=Jones, A.

By mass this amounts to 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements. The hydrogen and helium are primarily a result of [[primordial nucleosynthesis]], while the heavier elements in the ISM are mostly a result of enrichment in the process of [[stellar evolution]].

The ISM plays a crucial role in [[astrophysics]] precisely because of its intermediate role between stellar and galactic scales. Stars form within the densest regions of the ISM, which ultimately contributes to [[molecular cloud]]s and replenishes the ISM with matter and energy through [[planetary nebula]]e, [[solar wind|stellar winds]], and [[supernova]]e. This interplay between stars and the ISM helps determine the rate at which a galaxy depletes its gaseous content, and therefore its lifespan of active star formation.

''[[Voyager 1]]'' reached the ISM on August 25, 2012, making it the first artificial object from Earth to do so. Interstellar plasma and dust will be studied until the mission's end in 2025.

===The three-phase model===

{{harvtxt|Field|Goldsmith|Habing|1969}} put forward the static two ''phase'' equilibrium model to explain the observed properties of the ISM. Their modeled ISM consisted of a cold dense phase (''T''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]), consisting of clouds of neutral and molecular hydrogen, and a warm intercloud phase (''T''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]), consisting of rarefied neutral and ionized gas. {{harvtxt|McKee|Ostriker|1977}} added a dynamic third phase that represented the very hot (''T''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) gas which had been shock heated by [[supernova]]e and constituted most of the volume of the ISM.
These phases are the temperatures where heating and cooling can reach a stable equilibrium. Their paper formed the basis for further study over the past three decades. However, the relative proportions of the phases and their subdivisions are still not well known.&lt;ref name=Ferriere2001 /&gt;

===The atomic hydrogen model===
This model takes into account only atomic hydrogen : Temperature larger than 3000 K breaks molecules, lower than 50 000 K leaves atoms in their ground state. It is assumed that influence of other atoms (He ...) is negligible.  Pressure is assumed very low, so that durations of free paths of atoms are larger than ~ 1 nanosecond duration of light pulses which make ordinary, temporally incoherent light .

In this collisionless gas, Einstein’s theory of coherent light-matter interactions applies, all gas-light interactions are spatially coherent. 
Suppose that a monochromatic light is pulsed, then scattered by molecules having a quadrupole (Raman) resonance frequency. If “length of light pulses is shorter than all involved time constants” (Lamb (1971)), an “impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) ” (Yan, Gamble &amp; Nelson (1985)) works: While light generated by incoherent Raman at a shifted frequency has a phase independent on phase of exciting light, thus generates a new spectral line, coherence between incident and scattered light allows their interference into a single frequency, thus shifts incident frequency.
Assume that a star radiates a continuous light spectrum up to X rays. Lyman frequencies are absorbed in this light and pump atoms mainly to first excited state. In this state, hyperfine periods are longer than 1 ns, so that an ISRS “may” redshift light frequency, populating high hyperfine levels. An other ISRS “may” transfer energy from hyperfine levels to thermal electromagnetic waves, so that redshift is permanent. Temperature of a light beam is defined from frequency and spectral radiance by Planck’s formula. As entropy must increase, “may” becomes “does”. 
However, where a previously absorbed line (first Lyman beta, ...) reaches Lyman alpha frequency, redshifting process stops and all hydrogen lines are strongly absorbed. But the stop is not perfect if there is energy at frequency shifted to Lyman beta frequency, which produces a slow redshift. Successive redshifts separated by Lyman absorptions generate many absorption lines, frequencies of which, deduced from absorption process, obey a law more dependable than Karlsson’s formula.

The previous process excites more and more atoms because a de-excitation obeys Einstein’s law of coherent interactions: Variation dI of radiance I of a light beam along a path dx is dI=BIdx,  where B is Einstein amplification coefficient which depends on medium.  I is the modulus of Poynting vector of field, absorption occurs for an opposed vector, which corresponds to a change of sign of B. Factor I in this formula shows that intense rays are more amplified than weak ones (competition of modes). Emission of a flare requires a sufficient radiance I provided by random zero point field. After emission of a flare, weak B increases by pumping while I remains close to zero: De-excitation by a coherent emission involves stochastic parameters of zero point field, as observed close to quasars (and in polar auroras).

===Structures===
[[File:Three-dim-pillars-creation.jpg|thumb|Three-dimensional structure in [[Pillars of Creation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pillars of Creation Revealed in 3D|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1518/|accessdate=14 June 2015 |publisher=European Southern Observatory |date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The ISM is [[turbulence|turbulent]] and therefore full of structure on all spatial scales. [[Star formation|Stars are born]] deep inside large complexes of [[molecular clouds]], typically a few [[parsec]]s in size. During their lives and deaths, [[star]]s interact physically with the ISM.

[[Stellar wind]]s from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant [[HII region]]s surrounding them) and [[shock wave]]s created by [[supernova]]e inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures – of varying sizes – can be observed, such as [[stellar wind bubble]]s and [[superbubble]]s of hot gas, seen by X-ray satellite telescopes or turbulent flows observed in [[radio telescope]] maps.

The [[Sun]] is currently traveling through the [[Local Interstellar Cloud]], a denser region in the low-density [[Local Bubble]].

===Interaction with interplanetary medium===
[[File:Short, narrated video about IBEX's interstellar matter observations.ogv|thumb|left|350px|Short, narrated video about [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer|IBEX's]] interstellar matter observations.]]
The interstellar medium begins where the [[interplanetary medium]] of the [[Solar System]] ends. The [[solar wind]] slows to [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] velocities at the [[termination shock]], 90—100 [[astronomical unit]]s from the [[Sun]]. In the region beyond the termination shock, called the [[heliosheath]], interstellar matter interacts with the solar wind. [[Voyager 1]], the farthest human-made object from the Earth (after 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/fastfacts.html |title=Voyager: Fast Facts |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;), crossed the termination shock December 16, 2004 and later entered interstellar space when it crossed the [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] on August 25, 2012, providing the first direct probe of conditions in the ISM {{harvard citation|Stone|Cummings|McDonald|Heikkila|2005}}.

===Interstellar extinction===

The ISM is also responsible for [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] and [[interstellar reddening|reddening]], the decreasing [[Radiance|light intensity]] and shift in the dominant observable [[wavelength]]s of light from a star. These effects are caused by scattering and absorption of [[photon]]s and allow the ISM to be observed with the naked eye in a dark sky. The apparent rifts that can be seen in the band of the [[Milky Way]] – a uniform disk of stars – are caused by absorption of background starlight by molecular clouds within a few thousand light years from Earth.

[[Far ultraviolet|Far ultraviolet light]] is absorbed effectively by the neutral components of the ISM. For example, a typical absorption wavelength of atomic [[hydrogen]] lies at about 121.5 nanometers, the [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]] transition. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to see light emitted at that wavelength from a star farther than a few hundred light years from Earth, because most of it is absorbed during the trip to Earth by intervening neutral hydrogen.

== Heating and cooling ==

The ISM is usually far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Collisions establish a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] of velocities, and the 'temperature' normally used to describe interstellar gas is the 'kinetic temperature', which describes the temperature at which the particles would have the observed Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, the interstellar radiation field is typically much weaker than a medium in thermodynamic equilibrium; it is most often roughly that of an [[Stellar classification#Class A|A star]] (surface temperature of ~10,000 [[Kelvin|K]]) highly diluted. Therefore, [[energy level|bound levels]] within an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] in the ISM are rarely populated according to the Boltzmann formula {{harv|Spitzer|1978|loc=&amp;sect; 2.4}}.

Depending on the temperature, density, and ionization state of a portion of the ISM, different heating and cooling mechanisms determine the temperature of the [[gas]].

=== Heating mechanisms ===

; Heating by low-energy [[cosmic ray]]s: The first mechanism proposed for heating the ISM was heating by low-energy [[cosmic rays]]. [[Cosmic ray]]s are an efficient heating source able to penetrate in the depths of molecular clouds. [[Cosmic ray]]s transfer energy to [[gas]] through both ionization and excitation and to free [[electron]]s through [[Coulomb]] interactions. Low-energy [[cosmic ray]]s (a few [[MeV]]) are more important because they are far more numerous than high-energy [[cosmic ray]]s.

; Photoelectric heating by grains: The [[ultraviolet]] radiation emitted by hot [[star]]s can remove [[electron]]s from dust grains. The [[photon]] is absorbed by the dust grain, and some of its energy is used to overcome the potential energy barrier and remove the [[electron]] from the grain. This potential barrier is due to the binding energy of the electron (the [[work function]]) and the charge of the grain. The remainder of the photon's energy gives the ejected [[electron]] [[kinetic energy]] which heats the gas through collisions with other particles. A typical size distribution of dust grains is ''n''(''r'')&amp;nbsp;∝&amp;nbsp;''r''{{sup|−3.5}}, where ''r'' is the radius of the dust particle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Mathis, J.S. | author2=Rumpl, W. | author3=Nordsieck, K.H. | title=The size distribution of interstellar grains|journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=217 | pages=425 | bibcode=1977ApJ...217..425M | doi=10.1086/155591}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Assuming this, the projected grain surface area distribution is ''πr''{{sup|2}}''n''(''r'')&amp;nbsp;∝&amp;nbsp;''r''{{sup|−1.5}}. This indicates that the smallest dust grains dominate this method of heating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Weingartner, J.C. | author2=Draine, B.T. | title=Photoelectric Emission from Interstellar Dust: Grain Charging and Gas Heating | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume=134 | pages=263 | bibcode=2001ApJS..134..263W | doi=10.1086/320852| arxiv=astro-ph/9907251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

; Photoionization: When an [[electron]] is freed from an [[atom]] (typically from absorption of a UV [[photon]]) it carries kinetic energy away of the order ''E''{{sub|photon}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''E''{{sub|ionization}}. This heating mechanism dominates in H&amp;nbsp;II regions, but is negligible in the diffuse ISM due to the relative lack of neutral [[carbon]] [[atom]]s.

; [[X-ray]] heating: [[X-ray]]s remove [[electron]]s from [[atom]]s and [[ion]]s, and those photoelectrons can provoke secondary ionizations. As the intensity is often low, this heating is only efficient in warm, less dense atomic medium (as the column density is small). For example, in molecular clouds only hard [[x-ray]]s can penetrate and [[x-ray]] heating can be ignored. This is assuming the region is not near an [[x-ray]] source such as a [[supernova remnant]].

; Chemical heating: Molecular [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be formed on the surface of dust grains when two [[Hydrogen|H]] atoms (which can travel over the grain) meet. This process yields 4.48&amp;nbsp;eV of energy distributed over the rotational and vibrational modes, kinetic energy of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, as well as heating the dust grain. This kinetic energy, as well as the energy transferred from de-excitation of the hydrogen molecule through collisions, heats the gas.

; Grain-gas heating: Collisions at high densities between gas atoms and molecules with dust grains can transfer thermal energy. This is not important in HII regions because UV radiation is more important. It is also not important in diffuse ionized medium due to the low density. In the neutral diffuse medium grains are always colder, but do not effectively cool the gas due to the low densities.

Grain heating by thermal exchange is very important in supernova remnants where densities and temperatures are very high.

Gas heating via grain-gas collisions is dominant deep in giant molecular clouds (especially at high densities). Far [[infrared]] radiation penetrates deeply due to the low optical depth. Dust grains are heated via this radiation and can transfer thermal energy during collisions with the gas. A measure of efficiency in the heating is given by the accommodation coefficient:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{T_2 - T}{T_d - T}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''T'' is the gas temperature, ''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' the dust temperature, and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the post-collision temperature of the gas atom or molecule. This coefficient was measured by {{harvard citation|Burke|Hollenbach|1983}} as ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.35.

; Other heating mechanisms: A variety of macroscopic heating mechanisms are present including:
:* [[Gravitational collapse]] of a cloud
:* [[Supernova]] explosions
:* [[Stellar wind]]s
:* Expansion of [[H II region|H&amp;nbsp;II regions]]
:* [[Magnetohydrodynamic]] waves created by supernova remnants

=== Cooling mechanisms ===

; Fine structure cooling: The process of fine structure cooling is dominant in most regions of the Interstellar Medium, except regions of hot [[gas]] and regions deep in molecular clouds. It occurs most efficiently with abundant [[atom]]s having fine structure levels close to the fundamental level such as: C&amp;nbsp;II and O&amp;nbsp;I in the neutral medium and O&amp;nbsp;II, O&amp;nbsp;III, N&amp;nbsp;II, N&amp;nbsp;III, Ne&amp;nbsp;II and Ne&amp;nbsp;III in H&amp;nbsp;II regions. Collisions will excite these atoms to higher levels, and they will eventually de-excite through photon emission, which will carry the energy out of the region.

; Cooling by permitted lines: At lower temperatures, more levels than fine structure levels can be populated via collisions. For example, collisional excitation of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 level of [[hydrogen]] will release a Ly-α photon upon de-excitation. In molecular clouds, excitation of rotational lines of [[carbon monoxide|CO]] is important. Once a [[molecule]] is excited, it eventually returns to a lower energy state, emitting a photon which can leave the region, cooling the cloud.

== Radiowave propagation ==
[[File:Micrwavattrp.png|thumb|400px|Atmospheric attenuation in [[decibel|dB]]/km as a function of frequency over the EHF band. Peaks in absorption at specific frequencies are a problem, due to atmosphere constituents such as water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).]]

Radio waves from ≈10&amp;nbsp;kHz ([[very low frequency]]) to ≈300&amp;nbsp;GHz ([[extremely high frequency]]) propagate differently in interstellar space than on the Earth's surface. There are many sources of interference and signal distortion that do not exist on Earth. A great deal of [[radio astronomy]] depends on compensating for the different propagation effects to uncover the desired signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvKDoQVevAI | title= Interstellar Medium Interference (video) | author=Samantha Blair | work=SETI Talks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkb0o-oUbso | title=Voyager 1 Experiences Three Tsunami Waves in Interstellar Space (video) | work=JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of knowledge of interstellar space==
[[File:Herbig-Haro object HH 110.jpeg|thumb|[[Herbig–Haro 110]] object ejects gas through interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A geyser of hot gas flowing from a star|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1210/|accessdate=3 July 2012|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The nature of the interstellar medium has received the attention of astronomers and scientists over the centuries, and [[Timeline of knowledge about the interstellar and intergalactic medium|understanding of the ISM has developed]]. However, they first had to acknowledge the basic concept of "interstellar" space. The term appears to have been first used in print by {{harvtxt|Bacon|1626|loc=&amp;sect; 354–5}}: "The Interstellar Skie.. hath .. so much Affinity with the Starre, that there is a Rotation of that, as well as of the Starre." Later, [[natural philosopher]] {{harvard citations|first=Robert | last=Boyle | year=1674 | txt=yes | authorlink=Robert Boyle}} discussed "The inter-stellar part of heaven, which several of the modern [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] would have to be empty."

Before modern [[electromagnetic theory]], early [[physicist]]s postulated that an invisible [[luminiferous aether]] existed as a medium to carry lightwaves. It was assumed that this aether extended into interstellar space, as {{harvtxt|Patterson|1862}} wrote, "this efflux occasions a thrill, or vibratory motion, in the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]] which fills the interstellar spaces."

The advent of deep photographic imaging allowed [[Edward Emerson Barnard|Edward Barnard]] to produce the first images of [[dark nebula]]e silhouetted against the background star field of the galaxy, while the first actual detection of cold diffuse matter in interstellar space was made by [[Johannes Franz Hartmann|Johannes Hartmann]] in 1904&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|authorlink=Isaac Asimov|first=Isaac|last=Asimov|title=[[Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology]]|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the use of [[absorption spectrum|absorption line spectroscopy]]. In his historic study of the spectrum and orbit of [[Delta Orionis]], Hartmann observed the light coming from this star and realized that some of this light was being absorbed before it reached the Earth. Hartmann reported that absorption from the "K" line of [[calcium]] appeared "extraordinarily weak, but almost perfectly sharp" and also reported the "quite surprising result that the calcium line at 393.4&amp;nbsp;nanometres does not share in the periodic displacements of the lines caused by the orbital motion of the [[spectroscopic binary]] star". The stationary nature of the line led Hartmann to conclude that the gas responsible for the absorption was not present in the atmosphere of Delta Orionis, but was instead located within an isolated cloud of matter residing somewhere along the line-of-sight to this star. This discovery launched the study of the Interstellar Medium.

In the series of investigations, [[Viktor Ambartsumian]] introduced the now commonly accepted notion that interstellar matter occurs in the form of clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= To Victor Ambartsumian on his 80th birthday | author=S. Chandrasekhar | author-link=Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar | journal= Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy | volume=18 | pages=3 | doi=10.1007/BF01005852|bibcode = 1988Ap.....29..408C | year= 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Hartmann's identification of interstellar calcium absorption, interstellar [[sodium]] was detected by {{harvtxt|Heger|1919}} through the observation of stationary absorption from the atom's "D" lines at 589.0 and 589.6 nanometres towards Delta Orionis and [[Beta Scorpii]].

Subsequent observations of the "H" and "K" lines of calcium by {{harvtxt|Beals|1936}} revealed double and asymmetric profiles in the spectra of [[Epsilon Orionis|Epsilon]] and [[Zeta Orionis]]. These were the first steps in the study of the very complex interstellar sightline towards [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Asymmetric absorption line profiles are the result of the superposition of multiple absorption lines, each corresponding to the same atomic transition (for example the "K" line of calcium), but occurring in interstellar clouds with different [[Radial velocity|radial velocities]]. Because each cloud has a different velocity (either towards or away from the observer/Earth) the absorption lines occurring within each cloud are either [[Blueshift|Blue-shifted]] or [[Red shift|Red-shifted]] (respectively) from the lines' rest wavelength, through the [[Doppler Effect]]. These observations confirming that matter is not distributed homogeneously were the first evidence of multiple discrete clouds within the ISM.

[[File:Hubble sees a cosmic caterpillar.jpg|thumb|This light-year-long knot of interstellar gas and dust resembles a [[caterpillar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubble sees a cosmic caterpillar|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1335a/|work=Image Archive|publisher=ESA/Hubble|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The growing evidence for interstellar material led {{harvtxt|Pickering|1912}} to comment that "While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, yet the character of its selective absorption, as indicated by [[Jacobus Kapteyn|Kapteyn]], is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous [[molecule]]s are certainly there, since they are probably constantly being expelled by the [[Sun]] and [[star]]s."

The same year [[Victor Francis Hess|Victor Hess]]'s discovery of [[cosmic rays]], highly energetic charged particles that rain onto the Earth from space, led others to speculate whether they also pervaded interstellar space. The following year the Norwegian explorer and physicist [[Kristian Birkeland]] wrote: "It seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric [[ion]]s of all kinds. We have assumed that each stellar system in evolutions throws off electric corpuscles into space. It does not seem unreasonable therefore to think that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found, not in the solar systems or [[nebula]]e, but in 'empty' space" {{harv|Birkeland|1913}}.

{{harvtxt|Thorndike|1930}} noted that "it could scarcely have been believed that the enormous gaps between the stars are completely void. Terrestrial aurorae are not improbably excited by charged particles emitted by the [[Sun]].&lt;!--transcription: one of these phrases may be duplicative--&gt; If the millions of other [[star]]s are also ejecting [[ion]]s, as is undoubtedly true, no absolute vacuum can exist within the galaxy."

In September 2012, [[NASA|NASA scientists]] reported that [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons|polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]], subjected to ''interstellar medium (ISM)'' conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[Oxygenate|oxygenation]] and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[Organic compound|organics]] – "a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotides]], the raw materials of [[proteins]] and [[DNA]], respectively".&lt;ref name="Space-20120920"&gt;{{Citation|author=Staff |title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins|url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html|date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Gudipati |first1=Murthy S. |last2=Yang |first2=Rui|title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |date=September 1, 2012 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |volume=756 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24|accessdate=September 22, 2012 |bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G |issue=1 |pages=L24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[Cosmic dust#Dust grain formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]]."&lt;ref name="Space-20120920" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901" /&gt;

In February 2014, [[NASA]] announced a [http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/ greatly upgraded database] for tracking [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the [[carbon]] in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible [[PAH world hypothesis|starting materials]] for the [[Abiogenesis#PAH world hypothesis|formation]] of [[Life#Extraterrestrial life|life]]. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the [[Big Bang]], are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with [[Star formation|new stars]] and [[exoplanets]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140221"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoover |first=Rachel |title=Need to Track Organic Nano-Particles Across the Universe?

'''Jewish ceremonial art''', also known as '''Judaica''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|uː|ˈ|d|eɪ|.|ɪ|k|ə}}), refers to an array of objects used by [[Jews]] for ritual purposes. Because enhancing a [[mitzvah]] by performing it with an especially beautiful object is considered a praiseworthy way of honoring God's commandments, Judaism has a long tradition of commissioning ritual objects from craftsmen and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Kanof, Abram (1982). ''Jewish Ceremonial Art and Religious Observance''. New York: Abrams. {{ISBN|9780810921993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Textual origin ==
Judaism has a set of classical early rabbinic commentaries on the [[Hebrew Bible]]; these commentary collections are known as the [[midrash]] literature (Heb: midrashim).  Midrash Mechilta has this teaching on a biblical verse:
:"This is my God and I will glorify Him" (Exodus 15:2)
:Is it possible for a human being to add glory to his Creator? What this really means is: I shall glorify God in the way that I perform commandments. I shall prepare a beautiful lulav, beautiful sukkah, beautiful fringes ([[tzitzit]]), and beautiful [[tefilin]]." 
Other Midrash teachings (e.g. Song of Songs Rabbah 1.15) offer the same idea. This idea is expanded upon in the Babylonian [[Talmud]] (e.g. Tractate Bava Kama 9b). This teaching was understood by succeeding generations as a duty, when possible, to make beautiful items used in Jewish life and worship, both physical and textual.

== Items used on Shabbat ==

The following items are used during Shabbat:

*Kiddush cup: Kiddush, literally, "sanctification," is a blessing recited over [[wine]] or [[grape juice]] to sanctify the [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday]]s. Kiddush cups are highly decorated, and are generally made of china, porcelain, silver, pewter and nickel.
*Shabbat candlestick holders
*Hand washing cup ("netilat yediam")
*Challah cutting board and cover
*Havdalah candle and candle holder
*Havdalah spice box

[[File:HavdalahSet.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Havdalah candle holder and spice box]]
The close of the Jewish [[Shabbat]] is marked by the brief prayer ceremony of [[Havdalah]], which usually takes place in the home. Part of the ceremony requires sniffing a sweet-smelling spice or plant. In Jewish communities around the Mediterranean, a sprig of a sweet-smelling shrub was customarily used, in Northern Europe by the twelfth century there are literary references of the use of a specially designed spice box or container. The oldest surviving spice boxes for Havdalah date to the mid-sixteenth century. The [[Jewish Museum (New York)]] has a German example c. 1550 thought to originate in [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://thejewishmuseum.org/collection/17819-spice-container Spice Container]". The Jewish Museum. thejewishmuseum.org. Retrieved 2016-12-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hanukkah items ===
[[File:Македонска ханукија - מקדוני חנוכייה - Macedonian Hanukkah menorah.jpg|thumb|150px|Silver [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Hanukkah Menorah]]]]
The [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] (or hanukkiah) used on the Jewish holiday of [[Hanukkah]] is perhaps the most widely produced article of Jewish ceremonial art.&lt;ref&gt;Luminous Art: Hanukkah Menorahs of The Jewish Museum, Susan L. Braunstein, Jewish Museum, New York, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lighting the Way to Freedom: Treasured Hanukkah Menorahs of Early Israel, Aaron Ha'tell, Yaniv Ben Or, Devora Publishing (November 29, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Nancy M. (2016). ''The Art of Hanukkah''. Universe Publishing. {{ISBN|9780789332516}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lindo lamp]] is a particularly fine example by an 18th-century silversmith. Contemporary artists often design menorahs, such as the gold-plated brass menorah with 35 moveable branches designed by [[Yaacov Agam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herndonfineart.com/Subpages/Agam/agam_menorah_miller.htm|title=Agam Brass Menorah|website=www.herndonfineart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A silver menorah by [[Ze'ev Raban]] from the 1930s is in the Judaica Collection of the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="ncartmuseum1"&gt;[http://www.ncartmuseum.org/collections/highlights/judaic.shtml Mending Wounds in the Judaic Collection – North Carolina Museum of Art | Untitled] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515184717/http://www.ncartmuseum.org/collections/highlights/judaic.shtml |date=2009-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Chanukah menorah 
* Driedels 
* gelt holder 
* Chanukah candels or Oil

== Sukkot items ==
Etrog Box [[File:EtrogC.jpg|thumb|200px|Silver etrog box]]
To protect the [[etrog]] during the [[Sukkot]] holiday, it is traditionally wrapped in silky flax fibers and stored in a special box, often made from silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/tubshvat/tubshvatinterests/Lchaim_to_the_Trees.asp|title=Redirecting...|website=www.aish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the etrog is also commonly wrapped in synthetic netting, and placed in cardboard boxes. Wooden boxes are increasingly popular as well.

=== Passover haggadah ===
The tradition of artistically embellished [[Haggadah of Pesach|haggadahs]], the Jewish text that sets forth the order of the [[Passover Seder]], dates back to the Middle Ages. The [[Sarajevo Haggadah]] of 1350 is a celebrated example. Major contemporary artists have produced notable haggadahs, such as the [[Szyk Hagaddah]]. See also the facsimile edition of the even earlier [http://www.facsimile-editions.com/en/bh Barcelona Haggadah] of 1340.

==Notable Judaica collections==
Museums with notable collections of Jewish ceremonial art include the [[British Library]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/barcelona.html|website=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Israel Museum]], the [[Jewish Museum (London)]], the [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme]] in [[Paris]], the [[Jewish Museum in Prague]], the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]],&lt;ref name="ncartmuseum1"/&gt; the [[Jewish Museum (New York)]], the [[Musée Lorrain]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]],&lt;ref&gt;''Les Juifs et la Lorraine, un millénaire d’histoire partagée, ''Musée Lorrain, Nancy ; Somogy – Éditions d’Art, 2009, {{p.|164}} ; this collection is temporarily not on public display in 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Musée alsacien (Strasbourg)|Musée alsacien]] in [[Strasbourg]] and the [[Contemporary Jewish Museum]] of [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecjm.org/|title=The CJM - The Contemporary Jewish Museum|website=www.thecjm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museum of Jewish Heritage]] in Battery City Park, New York City also holds a sizable collection. Another way to see Judaica is through the art marketplace, including auction houses. Sotheby's, Bonhams-New York, Skinner's and Kestenbaums routinely hold regular auctions each year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38897">The '''Joint Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS)''', which was previously known as the '''Joint Army-Navy Nomenclature System''' (AN System. JAN) and the '''Joint Communications-Electronics Nomenclature System''', is a method developed by the [[U.S. War Department]] during [[World War II]] for assigning an [[Classified information in the United States|unclassified]] designator to electronic equipment. In 1957, the JETDS was formalized in '''MIL-STD-196'''.

Computer software and commercial unmodified electronics for which the manufacturer maintains design control are not covered.

==Usage==
Electronic materiel, from a military point of view, generally includes those electronic devices employed in data processing, detection and tracking (underwater, sea, land-based, air and space), recognition and identification, communications, aids to navigation, weapons control and evaluation, flight control, and electronics countermeasures. Nomenclature is assigned to:
* Electronic materiel of military design
* Commercial electronic materiel that has been modified for military use and requires military identification and design control
* Electronic materiel which is intended for use by other Federal agencies or other governments that participate in the nomenclature system.

===Systems===

In the JETDS system, complete equipment sets or systems are designated with a sequence of letters and digits prefixed by '''AN/''', then three letters, a hyphen, a number, and (occasionally) some optional letters (AN/AAA-nnn suffixed by (Vn){hardware/software version} or (T){training equipment} . The three letters tell where the equipment is used, what it does and its purpose. For example, the [[AN/PRC-77]] is a '''P'''ortable '''R'''adio used for two way '''C'''ommunications. The model numbers for any given type of equipment are assigned sequentially, thus higher numbers indicate more modern systems.

The three letter codes have the following meanings:

==== First letter: installation ====
* A - Piloted Aircraft
* B - Underwater Mobile (submarine)
* C - Cryptographic Equipment ([[National Security Agency|NSA]] use only) (was Air Transportable)
* D - Pilotless Carrier (drone, [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]])
* F - Fixed Ground
* G - General Ground Use
* K - Amphibious
* M - Mobile (ground) 
* P - Portable 
* S - Water (surface ship)
* T - Transportable (ground)
* U - General Utility (multi use)
* V - Vehicular (ground)
* W - Water Surface and Underwater combined
* Z - Piloted-Pilotless Airborne Vehicles combined

==== Second letter: type of equipment ====
* A - Invisible Light, Heat Radiation (e.g., infrared)
* B - [[Communications Security|COMSEC]] (NSA use only)  (was [[Homing pigeon|Pigeon]])
* C - Carrier (electronic wave or signal)
* D - Radiac (Radioactivity Detection, Identification, and Computation)
* E - Laser  (was NUPAC, Nuclear Protection &amp; Control)
* F - Fiber Optics (was Photographic)
* G - Telegraph or Teletype
* I - Interphone and Public Address
* J - Electromechanical or Inertial Wire Covered
* K - Telemetering
* L - Countermeasures
* M - Meteorological
* N - Sound in Air
* P - Radar
* Q - Sonar and Underwater Sound
* R - Radio
* S - Special or Combination
* T - Telephone (Wire)
* V - Visual, Visible Light
* W - Armament (not otherwise covered)
* X - Facsimile or Television
* Y - Data Processing or Computer
* Z - Communications (NSA use only)

==== Third letter: purpose ====
* A - Auxiliary Assembly
* B - Bombing
* C - Communications (Receiving/Transmitting, two way)
* D - Direction Finder, Reconnaissance and Surveillance
* E - Ejection and/or Release
* G - Fire Control or Search Light Directing
* H - Recording and/or Reproducing
* K - Computing
* L - no longer used (was Searchlight Control, now covered by "G")
* M - Maintenance or Test Assemblies
* N - Navigational Aids
* P - no longer used (was Reproducing, now covered by "H")
* Q - Special or Combination
* R - Receiving or Passive Detecting
* S - Detecting or Range and Bearing, Search
* T - Transmitting
* W - Automatic Flight or Remote Control
* X - Identification and Recognition
* Y - Surveillance (search, detect, and multiple target tracking) and Control (both fire control and/or air control)
* Z - Secure (NSA use only)

====Model number====
Following the three-letter designation, after a dash, is a number, uniquely identifying the equipment. Different variants of the same equipment may be given an additional letter and other suffixes (for example, [[AN/SPY-1]]A, AN/SPY-1B, etc.), while entirely new equipment within the same category is given a new number (for example, [[AN/SPY-3]]).

====Variants and training equipment====

A suffix "(V)", parenthetical V, indicates variable components.  A number may follow the parenthetical V to identify a specific configuration.  Or the number will identify the precise quantity of equipment required for a specific configuration.

A suffix of "(P)", parenthetical P, indicates a plug in module or component of a system which changes the function, frequency, or characteristics.

A suffix of "(C)", parenthetical C, indicates NSA-controlled cryptographic/classified item.

A suffix of "-T", dash T, indicates equipment designed to provide training in the operation of a specific set.

For example:

AN/ABC-1(V)4 would be the 4th variable of the AN/ABC-1 equipment.
OT-1957(V)1/ABC-1(V) would be one OT-1957 required for the particular configuration. 
AN/ABC-1(C) would be an NSA-controlled cryptographic/classified item.
R00(P)/ABC-1 would be a plug in module for the AN/ABC-1 equipment.  
AN/ABC-1-T1 would be the first training set for the AN/ABC-1 equipment.  

===Subsystems===

Subsystems ("groups") are designated by a two letter code (without the AN/ prefix), followed by a number, followed by slash and one, two or three letters from the three letter codes for systems. For example, BA-1234/PRC would be a battery for portable radio sets. Some subsystems will have the designation for the system they belong to. For example, RT-859/APX-72 and C-6820/APX-72, the /APX-72 indicates both are part of the AN/APX-72 system.

== History ==
JETDS was adopted 16 February 1943 by the Joint Communications Board for all new [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] airborne, radio, and radar equipment. Over time it was extended to cover the Marine Corps and the Navy's ship, submarine, amphibious, and ground electronic equipment.  When the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] was established as a separate department, it continued the use of the system for electronic equipment. JETDS was adopted by the [[United States Coast Guard]] in 1950, [[Canada]] in 1951 and the [[NSA]] in 1959 (though the NSA continued to use its own TSEC telecommunications security nomenclature&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/miscsystems.html#_TSEC Telecommunications Security (TSEC) Nomenclature System]&lt;/ref&gt;).  In 1957 the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] approved a [[United States Military Standard|military standard]] for the nomenclature, MIL-STD-196. The system has been modified over time, with some types (e.g. [[carrier pigeon]] '''-B-''') dropped and others (e.g. computers and cryptographic equipment) added. The latest version, MIL-STD-196F, was issued in 2013.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==
===Lexicostatistics===
The proposed measures used for linguisitic distance reflect varying understandings of the term itself. One approach is based on [[mutual intelligibility]], i.e. the ability of speakers of one language to understand the other language. With this, the higher the linguistic distance, the lower is the level of mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"&gt;{{Citation | title=Receptive multilingualism: linguistic analyses, language policies, and didactic concepts |author1=Jan D. ten Thije |author2=Ludger Zeevaert | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2007 | isbn=978-90-272-1926-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gIEN068J3gC | quote=''... Assuming that intelligibility is inversely related to linguistic distance ... the content words the percentage of cognates (related directly or via a synonym) ... lexical relatedness ... grammatical relatedness ...''|date=2007-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[cognate|cognate words]] play an important role in mutual intelligibility between languages, these figure prominently in such analyses. The higher the percentage of cognate (as opposed to non-cognate) words in the two languages with respect to one another, the lower is their linguistic distance. Also, the greater the degree of grammatical relatedness (i.e. the cognates mean roughly similar things) and lexical relatedness (i.e. the cognates are easily discernible as related words), the lower is the linguistic distance.&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"/&gt; As an example of this, the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''pānch'' is grammatically identical and [[lexical similarity|lexically similar]] (but non-identical) to its cognate [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''panj'' as well as to the lexically dissimilar but still grammatically identical [[Greek language|Greek]] ''pent-''&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Greek and Latin roots in English#P]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[English language|English]] ''five''. As another example, the English ''dish'' and [[German language|German]] ''tisch'' 'table' are lexically (phonologically) similar but grammatically (semantically) dissimilar. Cognates in related languages can even be identical in form, but semantically distinct, such as ''caldo'' and ''largo'', which mean respectively  'hot' and 'wide' in Italian but 'broth, soup' and 'long' in Spanish. Using a statistical approach (called [[lexicostatistics]]) by comparing each language's mass of words, distances can be calculated between them. In technical terms, what is calculated is the [[Levenshtein distance]].&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"/&gt; Based on this, one study compared both [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] with [[Dutch language|Dutch]] to see which was closer to Dutch. It determined that the Dutch and Afrikaans (mutual distance of 20.9%) were considerably closer than Dutch and West Frisian (mutual distance of 34.2%).&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"/&gt;

However, lexicostatistical methods, which are based on retentions from a common proto-language – and not innovations – are problematic due to a number of reasons, so some linguists argue they cannot be relied upon during the tracing of a phylogenetic tree (for example, highest retention rates can sometimes be found in the opposite, peripheral ends of a language family).&lt;ref name="phyloproblems"&gt;http://www.elisanet.fi/alkupera/Problems_of_phylogenetics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual innovativeness or conservativeness of a language can distort linguistic distance and the assumed separation date, examples being [[Romani language]] and [[East Baltic languages]] respectively.&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt; On the one hand, continued [[Language contact|adjacency]] of closely related languages after their separation can make some loanwords 'invisible' (indistinguishable from cognates, see [[etymological nativization]]), therefore,  from lexicostatistical point of view these languages appear less distant then they actually are (examples being [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] and [[Saami languages]]).&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt; On the other hand, strong foreign influence of languages spreading far from their homeland can make them share less inherited words than they should do (examples being [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Samoyedic languages]] in the East Uralic branch).&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt;

===Other internal aspects===
Besides cognates, other aspects that are often measured are similarities of [[syntax]] and written forms.&lt;ref name="chiswick2004hsk"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chiswick | first1 = B. R. | last2 = Miller | first2 = P. W. | doi = 10.1080/14790710508668395 | title = Linguistic Distance: A Quantitative Measure of the Distance Between English and Other Languages | journal = Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development | volume = 26 | pages = 1–11 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = | hdl = 10419/20510 }} ''... vocabulary, grammar, written form, syntax and myriad other statistics ... this scalar measure of "linguisitic distance" is demonstrated through an analysis of the determinants of English language proficiency among immigrants ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

To overcome the aforementioned problems of the lexicostatistical methods, [[Donald Ringe]], [[Tandy Warnow]] and [[Luay Nakhleh]] developed a complex phylogenetical method relying on phonological and morphological innovations in 2000s.&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt;

===Language learning===
A 2004 paper by economists Barry Chiswick and Paul Miller attempted to put forth a metric for linguistic distances that was based on empirical observations of how rapidly speakers of a given language gained proficiency in another one when immersed in a society that overwhelmingly communicated in the latter language. In this study, the speed of English language acquisition was studied for immigrants of various linguistic backgrounds in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].{{Vague|date=January 2014}}&lt;ref name="chiswick2004hsk"/&gt;

''jätinkirkko''), which are large, from c. {{convert|20|m|ft}} to over {{convert|70|m|ft}} long rectangular or oval stone enclosures built in the Neolithic (c. 3000-1800 BC), have axis and doorway orientations towards the sunrises and sunsets of the solstices and other calendrically significant days. For example, the Kastelli of Raahe, which is one of the largest Giants' Churches, had its five "gates", i.e. wall openings, oriented towards the midsummer sunset, the winter solstice sunrise, winter solstice sunset, the sunrises of the mid-quarter days of early May (Walpurgis, Beltaine) and August (Lammas), as well as the sunrise 11 days before the vernal equinox in 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Okkonen, J. &amp; Ridderstad, M. 2009: Jätinkirkkojen aurinkosuuntauksia; in ''Ei kiveäkään kääntämättä, Juhlakirja Pentti Koivuselle'', pp. 129-136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tähdet ja Avaruus, Ursa astronomical assosiacion's magazine 4 / 2009 p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Some archaeologists believe that the circles have been constructed in relation to the rising of the sun at the solstice, or to record the movements of the sun and moon acting as observatories for particular lunar, solar or stellar events. Three of the stone rows point to the sunrise at the time of the solstice and another is aligned towards moonrise at the same period.

'''Media &amp; Citizenship''' Transnational Television Cultures Reshaping Political Identities in the [[European Union]] is a three year (2008–2011) [[research project]] funded by the [[Seventh Framework Programme]] of the [[European Commission]].

This project studies the ways [[transnational media]], in particular [[Arabic language]] television, reshape the political landscapes of [[citizenship]] in the European Union. It provides the first European wide [[empirical research]] on the use of Arabic-language television and its influence on integration in multicultural societies. After collecting data across 7 EU nations ([[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]), focus group studies explore how Arabic speakers themselves construct citizenship in the light of their media use, and their adopted national cultures.

The Media &amp; Citizenship consortium is coordinated by the [[Utrecht University]] and consists of the [[University of Bielefeld]], the [[London School of Economics]], [[Örebro University]] and the [[Paris-Sorbonne University]] (Paris IV).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3720">'''Military terminology''' refers to the [[terminology|terms]] and language of [[military]] organizations and [[personnel]] as belonging to a discrete category, as distinguishable by their usage in [[military doctrine]], as they serve to depoliticise, dehumanise, or otherwise abstract discussion about its operations from an actual description thereof.

==Common understanding==
The operational pressure for uniform understanding has developed since the early 20th century with the importance of [[joint operations]] between different services (army, navy, air force) of the same country. International alliances and operations, including [[peacekeeping]],&lt;ref&gt;Colonel Andrei Demurenko and Professor Alexander Nikitin, ''Basic Terminology and Concepts in International Peacekeeping Operations: An Analytical Review'' (translated Robert R. Love) in Low Intensity Conflict &amp; Law Enforcement,

For example, the [[NATO]] alliance now maintains a large [[dictionary]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/natoterm_index.html DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms] accessed on Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), US  website, July 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; of common terms for use by member countries. Development work is also taking place&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bell, ''Ballistic Missile Threats:A NATO-Russia Strategic Challenge'' in Krasnaya Zvezda, Feb 23, 2003 accessed at NATO on-line Library [http://www.nato.int/docu/articles/2003/a030227a.htm] July 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; between NATO and Russia on common terminology for extended air defence, in English, French and Russian.

==Criticism==
Some claim military terms serve to depoliticise, dehumanize, or otherwise abstract discussion about operations from an actual description thereof. 
Similar to "[[legalese|legal terminology]]" and related to "political terminology", military terms are known for an oblique tendency to incorporate [[technical language]]. In many cases, it reflects a need to be precise. It can also reflect a perceived need for [[operational security]], giving away no more information than needed. It can also serve to disguise or distort meaning as with [[doublespeak]]. "Kinetic activity" as a [[buzzword]] for [[combat]], in use since the inception of the [[War on Terror]], has been criticized as a [[Don't ask, don't tell|don’t-ask-don’t-tell]] policy for murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3669">The '''Morphs collaboration''' was a coordinated study to determine the morphologies of galaxies in distant clusters and to investigate the evolution of galaxies as a function of environment and epoch. Eleven clusters were examined and a detailed ground-based and space-based study was carried out.

It was a collaboration of [[Alan Dressler]] and Augustus Oemler, Jr., at [[Carnegie Institution for Science#Observatories of the CIW|Observatory of the Carnegie Institute of Washington]], [[Warrick Couch|Warrick J. Couch]] at the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Richard Ellis (astronomer)|Richard Ellis]] at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], Bianca M. Poggianti at the [[University of Padua]], [[Amy Barger]] at the [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawaii's]] [[Institute for Astronomy]], [[Harvey Raymond Butcher|Harvey Butcher]] at [[ASTRON]], and Ray M. Sharples and Ian Smail at [[Durham University]]. Results were published through 2000.

The collaboration sought answers to the differences in the origins of the various galaxy types — [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical]], [[Lenticular galaxy|lenticular]], and [[Spiral galaxy|spiral]]. The studies found that elliptical galaxies were the oldest and formed from the violent merger of other galaxies about two to three billion years after the [[Big Bang]]. Star formation in elliptical galaxies ceased about that time. On the other hand, new stars are still forming in the spiral arms of spiral galaxies. Lenticular galaxies (SO) are intermediate between the first two.  They contain structures similar to spiral arms, but devoid of the gas and new stars of the spiral galaxies. Lenticular galaxies are the prevalent form in rich galaxy clusters, which suggests that spirals may be transformed into lenticular galaxies as time progresses.  The exact process may be related to high galactic density, or to the total mass in a rich cluster’s central core. The Morphs collaboration found that one of the principal mechanisms of this transformation involves the interaction among spiral galaxies, as they fall toward the core of the cluster.

The Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) Cluster Building Survey is the follow-on project to the Morphs collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obs.carnegiescience.edu/research/adressler/ "Alan Dressler"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925110325/http://obs.carnegiescience.edu/research/adressler/ |date=2011-09-25 }} Carnegie Institution for Science&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NAMM Oral History Program''' was created and is funded by [[NAMM]], the International Association of Music Products. The program was approved by the NAMM board of directors in the years before the association, which is known for its yearly trade shows, was ready to celebrate the 100 anniversary of the organization. The first NAMM Oral History was conducted in April 2000 with former [[Gibson Guitar]] president [[Ted McCarty]]. McCarty signed [[Les Paul]] on to Gibson in the 1950s to lend his name to the now famous [[Gibson Les Paul]] Guitar. Paul was interviewed as part of the NAMM Oral History program back in 2008.

== History ==

Over the years the collection sought to capture, archive and share the stories of those who have inspired people to make music!  As a result, instrument creators such as [[Hartley Peavey]] and [[Remo]] Belli have been included as well as music retailers, music publishers and those who can fill in the history of the companies, products and people who shaped the industry such as musicians, composers, method book authors, factory workers and salesman of musical products.

Music industry pioneers that have been interviewed for the NAMM Oral History program include [[Bob Moog]], [[Don Buchla]], Henry Z. [[Steinway]], [[Bob Taylor (luthier)]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]].

The collection also includes music retailers and the history of such store chains as [[Sam Ash]] and [[Guitar Center]] as well as independent music stores around the world such as West Music and Newton Piano.

Among the musicians linked to the music industry and thus interviewed for this collection are those who designed an instrument, endorsed a product or wrote a method book that has inspired others to make music.  These include [[B. B. King]], [[Roy Clark]], [[Joe Morello]] and [[Herbie Hancock]].

The first interview to be donated to the collection was conducted in 1996 with jazzman [[Jonah Jones]].  Jones spoke of his relationship with [[King Musical Instruments]] as a product tester and endorser.  He later played an [[F. E. Olds]] trumpet, which was featured on many recordings during his long career.

In the Spring of 2011 NAMM announced the completion of its 1,500th interview.  Later that year Mr. and Mrs. Tom Lee of [[Tom Lee Music]] in Hong Kong were interviewed together, which was an important addition to the collection.  During the NAMM Summer Show in Nashville in July 2011, music store owner George Gruhn was awarded the first NAMM Oral History Service Award for support that included arranging interviews and providing historic background.  The second NAMM Oral History Service Award was presented to Hal Leonard Publishing CEO Keith Mardak for his decade long support to the program.  With Mardak's help, interviews were completed with music publishers, songwriters, composers and music method book authors.

== Neurogenesis in mammals ==

===Developmental neurogenesis===
During embryonic development, the [[mammal]]ian [[central nervous system]] (CNS; [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]) is derived from the [[neural tube]], which contains NSCs that will later generate [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott F.|last2=College|first2=Swarthmore|last3=Helsinki|first3=the University of|title=Developmental biology|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0878939787|edition=Tenth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf4RA6l3keoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neurogenesis doesn't begin until a sufficient population of NSCs has been achieved. These early stem cells are called neuroepithelial cells (NEC)s, but soon take on a highly elongated radial morphology and are then known as radial glial cells (RGC)s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott F.|last2=College|first2=Swarthmore|last3=Helsinki|first3=the University of|title=Developmental biology|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0878939787|edition=Tenth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf4RA6l3keoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; RGCs are the primary stem cells of the mammalian CNS, and reside in the embryonic [[ventricular zone]], which lies adjacent to the central fluid-filled cavity ([[ventricular system]]) of the [[neural tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rakic|first1=P|title=Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|date=October 2009|volume=10|issue=10|pages=724–35|pmid=19763105|doi=10.1038/nrn2719|pmc=2913577|url=http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2913577?pdf=render|format=Accepted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lui|first1=JH|last2=Hansen|first2=DV|last3=Kriegstein|first3=AR|title=Development and evolution of the human neocortex|journal=Cell|date=8 July 2011|volume=146|issue=1|pages=18–36|pmid=21729779|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.06.030|pmc=3610574}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following RGC proliferation, neurogenesis involves a final cell division of the parent RGC, which produces one of two possible outcomes. First, this may generate a subclass of neuronal progenitors called intermediate neuronal precursors (INP)s, which will divide one or more additional times to produce neurons. Alternatively, daughter neurons may be produced directly. Neurons do not immediately form neural circuits through the growth of axons and dendrites. Instead, newborn neurons must first [[Neuronal migration|migrate]] long distances to their final destinations, maturing and finally generating neural circuitry. For example, neurons born in the [[ventricular zone]] migrate radially to the [[cortical plate]], which is where neurons accumulate to form the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rakic|first1=P|title=Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology|journal=Nature Reviews.

The rate of neurogenesis and the type of neuron generated (broadly, excitatory or inhibitory) are principally determined by molecular and genetic factors. These factors notably include the [[Notch signaling pathway]], and many [[gene]]s have been linked to Notch pathway [[regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kageyama|first1=R|last2=Ohtsuka|first2=T|last3=Shimojo|first3=H|last4=Imayoshi|first4=I|title=Dynamic Notch signaling in neural progenitor cells and a revised view of lateral inhibition|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=November 2008|volume=11|issue=11|pages=1247–51|pmid=18956012|doi=10.1038/nn.2208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rash|first1=BG|last2=Lim|first2=HD|last3=Breunig|first3=JJ|last4=Vaccarino|first4=FM|title=FGF signaling expands embryonic cortical surface area by regulating Notch-dependent neurogenesis|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=26 October 2011|volume=31|issue=43|pages=15604–17|pmid=22031906|doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4439-11.2011|pmc=3235689}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genes and mechanisms involved in regulating neurogenesis are the subject of intensive research in academic, [[pharmaceutical]], and government settings worldwide.

The amount of time required to generate all the neurons of the CNS varies widely across mammals, and brain neurogenesis is not always complete by the time of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott F.|last2=College|first2=Swarthmore|last3=Helsinki|first3=the University of|title=Developmental biology|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0878939787|edition=Tenth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf4RA6l3keoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, mice undergo cortical neurogenesis from about embryonic day (post-conceptional day) (E)11 to E17, and are born at about E19.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbott|first1=David M.

===Adult neurogenesis===

[[Adult neurogenesis]] has been shown to occur at low levels compared with development, and in only two regions of the brain: the adult [[subventricular zone]] (SVZ) of the [[striatum]], and the [[dentate gyrus]] of the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=A|last2=Alkass|first2=K|last3=Bernard|first3=S|last4=Salehpour|first4=M|last5=Perl|first5=S|last6=Tisdale|first6=J|last7=Possnert|first7=G|last8=Druid|first8=H|last9=Frisén|first9=J|title=Neurogenesis in the striatum of the adult human brain|journal=Cell|date=27 February 2014|volume=156|issue=5|pages=1072–83|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.044|pmid=24561062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lim|first1=DA|last2=Alvarez-Buylla|first2=A|title=The Adult Ventricular-Subventricular Zone (V-SVZ) and Olfactory Bulb (OB) Neurogenesis|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|date=2 May 2016|volume=8|issue=5|pages=a018820|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a018820|pmid=27048191|pmc=4852803}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alvarez-Buylla|first1=A|last2=Lim|first2=DA|title=For the long run: maintaining germinal niches in the adult brain|journal=Neuron|date=4 March 2004|volume=41|issue=5|pages=683–6|pmid=15003168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subventricular zone====

In many mammals, including for example rodents, the [[olfactory bulb]] is a brain region containing [[Olfactory receptor neuron|cells that detect smell]], featuring integration of adult-born neurons, which migrate from the SVZ of the [[striatum]] to the olfactory bulb through the [[rostral migratory stream]] (RMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=A|last2=Alkass|first2=K|last3=Bernard|first3=S|last4=Salehpour|first4=M|last5=Perl|first5=S|last6=Tisdale|first6=J|last7=Possnert|first7=G|last8=Druid|first8=H|last9=Frisén|first9=J|title=Neurogenesis in the striatum of the adult human brain|journal=Cell|date=27 February 2014|volume=156|issue=5|pages=1072–83|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.044|pmid=24561062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ming 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ming|first=GL|author2=Song, H |title=Adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain: significant answers and significant questions|journal=Neuron|date=May 26, 2011|volume=70|issue=4|pages=687–702|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2011.05.001|pmid=21609825|pmc=3106107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The migrating neuroblasts in the olfactory bulb become [[interneuron]]s that help the brain communicate with these sensory cells. The majority of those interneurons are inhibitory [[granule cell]]s, but a small number are [[periglomerular cell]]s. In the adult SVZ, the primary neural stem cells are SVZ astrocytes rather than RGCs. Most of these adult neural stem cells lie dormant in the adult, but in response to certain signals, these dormant cells, or B cells, go through a series of stages, first producing proliferating cells, or C cells. The C cells then produce [[neuroblast]]s, or A cells, that will become neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lim|first1=DA|last2=Alvarez-Buylla|first2=A|title=The Adult Ventricular-Subventricular Zone (V-SVZ) and Olfactory Bulb (OB) Neurogenesis|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|date=2 May 2016|volume=8|issue=5|pages=a018820|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a018820|pmid=27048191|pmc=4852803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hippocampus====

Significant neurogenesis also occurs during adulthood in the [[hippocampus]] of many mammals, from [[rodent]]s to some [[primate]]s, although its existence in adult humans is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorrells|first1=SF|last2=Paredes|first2=MF|last3=Cebrian-Silla|first3=A|last4=Sandoval|first4=K|last5=Qi|first5=D|last6=Kelley|first6=KW|last7=James|first7=D|last8=Mayer|first8=S|last9=Chang|first9=J|last10=Auguste|first10=KI|last11=Chang|first11=EF|last12=Gutierrez|first12=AJ|last13=Kriegstein|first13=AR|last14=Mathern|first14=GW|last15=Oldham|first15=MC|last16=Huang|first16=EJ|last17=Garcia-Verdugo|first17=JM|last18=Yang|first18=Z|last19=Alvarez-Buylla|first19=A|title=Human hippocampal neurogenesis drops sharply in children to undetectable levels in adults|journal=Nature|date=15 March 2018|volume=555|issue=7696|pages=377–381|doi=10.1038/nature25975|pmid=29513649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boldrini|first1=M|last2=Fulmore|first2=CA|last3=Tartt|first3=AN|last4=Simeon|first4=LR|last5=Pavlova|first5=I|last6=Poposka|first6=V|last7=Rosoklija|first7=GB|last8=Stankov|first8=A|last9=Arango|first9=V|last10=Dwork|first10=AJ|last11=Hen|first11=R|last12=Mann|first12=JJ|title=Human Hippocampal Neurogenesis Persists throughout Aging|journal=Cell Stem Cell|date=5 April 2018|volume=22|issue=4|pages=589–599.e5|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2018.03.015|pmid=29625071|pmc=5957089}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hippocampus plays a crucial role in the formation of new declarative memories, and it has been theorized that the reason human infants cannot form declarative memories is because they are still undergoing extensive neurogenesis in the hippocampus and their memory-generating circuits are immature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Josselyn|first=Sheena A.|last2=Frankland|first2=Paul W.|date=2012-09-01|title=Infantile amnesia: A neurogenic hypothesis|url=http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/19/9/423|journal=Learning &amp; Memory|language=en|volume=19|issue=9|pages=423–433|doi=10.1101/lm.021311.110|issn=1072-0502|pmid=22904373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many environmental factors, such as exercise, stress, and antidepressants have been reported to change the rate of neurogenesis within the hippocampus of rodents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Nicola D.|last2=Owens|first2=Michael J.|last3=Nemeroff|first3=Charles B.|date=2011-12-01|title=Depression, Antidepressants, and Neurogenesis: A Critical Reappraisal|url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v36/n13/abs/npp2011220a.html|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|language=en|volume=36|issue=13|pages=2589–2602|doi=10.1038/npp.2011.220|issn=0893-133X|pmc=3230505|pmid=21937982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santarelli|first=Luca|last2=Saxe|first2=Michael|last3=Gross|first3=Cornelius|last4=Surget|first4=Alexandre|last5=Battaglia|first5=Fortunato|last6=Dulawa|first6=Stephanie|last7=Weisstaub|first7=Noelia|last8=Lee|first8=James|last9=Duman|first9=Ronald|date=2003-08-08|title=Requirement of Hippocampal Neurogenesis for the Behavioral Effects of Antidepressants|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/301/5634/805|journal=Science|language=en|volume=301|issue=5634|pages=805–809|doi=10.1126/science.1083328|issn=0036-8075|pmid=12907793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence indicates postnatal neurogenesis in the human hippocampus decreases sharply in newborns for the first year or two after birth, dropping to "undetectable levels in adults."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorrells|first1=SF|last2=Paredes|first2=MF|last3=Cebrian-Silla|first3=A|last4=Sandoval|first4=K|last5=Qi|first5=D|last6=Kelley|first6=KW|last7=James|first7=D|last8=Mayer|first8=S|last9=Chang|first9=J|last10=Auguste|first10=KI|last11=Chang|first11=EF|last12=Gutierrez|first12=AJ|last13=Kriegstein|first13=AR|last14=Mathern|first14=GW|last15=Oldham|first15=MC|last16=Huang|first16=EJ|last17=Garcia-Verdugo|first17=JM|last18=Yang|first18=Z|last19=Alvarez-Buylla|first19=A|title=Human hippocampal neurogenesis drops sharply in children to undetectable levels in adults|journal=Nature|date=15 March 2018|volume=555|issue=7696|pages=377–381|doi=10.1038/nature25975|pmid=29513649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Institut Pasteur de Nha Trang'', [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''Viện Pasteur Nha Trang'') is one of two [[Institut Pasteur]] in [[Vietnam]]. Located in [[Nha Trang]], it was established during the [[French Indochina|French colonization of Vietnam]]. It operates directly under the authority of the [[Ministry of Health (Vietnam)|Vietnamese Ministry of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://research.pasteur.fr/en/network/institut-pasteur-in-nha-trang-vietnam/ |title= Institut Pasteur in Nha Trang |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Institut Pasteur |publisher= |access-date=November 6, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Established by [[Alexandre Yersin]] in 1895, it specialized in the study of animal disease, their prophylaxis and treatment. Yersin bought a 500 hectare property in Suoi Giao (about 20&amp;nbsp;km outside Nha Trang) on which to raise 600 goats, sheep, cattle and water buffalo, all needed for research at the institute. The property was cleared by Yersin and his [[coolies]], and they built stables for the research animals. Yersin hung a bell around the neck of each animal to keep local tigers from attacking them. Within a few years, veterinarians joined the researchers at the institute and developed an anti-plague serum for human use and several serum for use in cattle.&lt;ref name=perrot&gt;{{cite book|language=French |last1=Perrot |first1=Annick |last2= Schwartz|first2=Maxime |date=2013 |title= Pasteur et ses lieutenants: Roux, Yersin et les autres |url= https://books.google.com/?id=HbZWHiEfOAAC&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=Institut%20Pasteur%20de%20Nha%20Trang&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q=Institut%20Pasteur%20de%20Nha%20Trang&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= Odile Jacob|page= |isbn= 9782738177810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first few years, Yersin and his team studied most of the local diseases commonly found in animals in [[Indochina]], developing treatments and making them available to the local populace.

The research was expensive; despite government subsidies and donations, he would have to find a local source of financing. Yersin introduced rubber trees ([[Hevea brasiliensis]]) to the property. The first crop planted in 1898 gave a latex harvest in 1904 (this was sold to the local [[Michelin]] producer). The rubber crop helped support the institute’s activities.&lt;ref name=perrot/&gt; (This property was bequeathed to the Nha Trang Institute after his death.)

Ten years after the introduction of the rubber plants, Yersin introduced [[Cinchona]] plants for the production of [[quinine]]. His effort would take 20 years to give favourable results. After his death, Yersin was buried on the Suoi Giao property.&lt;ref name=express&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualite-economique/l-institut-pasteur-de-nha-trang_1370900.html |title= L'institut Pasteur de Nha Trang|last1= Bronnec|first1= Thomas |last2= Fechner |first2= Benoist |date= 01/09/2004|website=l’express L’Expansion |publisher= |access-date=November 6, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An epidemic of [[plague (disease)|plague]] came to Nha Trang in 1898 and was one of the first diseases studied at the institute. The Nha Trang facilities were placed under the supervision of the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1904 and Yersin assumed the leadership of the facility that same year.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

==Later history==
After the reunification of Vietnam in 1975, the Nha Trang facility was made into a provincial hygiene institute by the government.

In 1990, Nha Trang rejoined the family of worldwide Pasteur Institutes. In 1992, scientists from Nha Trang traveled to Paris to study at the Pasteur Institute. In 1997, a museum dedicated to Alexandre Yersin was opened in Nha Trang, attracting many tourists.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

The institute is still conducting medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buchy |first=P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13114">The '''Perger-Verzeichnis''' ("Perger Catalogue") is a thematic-chronological catalogue of instrumental compositions by [[Michael Haydn]], compiled by Lothar Perger in 1907. Like Ludwig von Köchel's catalog of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s compositions (the [[Köchel-Verzeichnis]]), Perger's catalog uses a single range of numbers, from 1 to 136, but like Hoboken's catalog of Joseph Haydn's music, groups the pieces first into categories (symphonies, concertos, etc.) and then sorts them chronologically.

Perger's attempt at figuring out the chronology is, however, so full of mistakes (including the attribution to Haydn of music by others) that later musicologists, instead of trying to amend the catalog (as they have with Köchel's) have created new ones from scratch. The most credible is the one by Charles Sherman and T. Donley Thomas, a chronological catalog of 838 pieces in which each piece is assigned an MH number in that range according to their best guesses at chronology.

Even so, Perger's catalog is still widely used by libraries, music publishing houses and some record companies.

For a more complete listing of Michael Haydn's instrumental and vocal music, see [[list of compositions by Michael Haydn]]. The following list only includes those pieces with a Perger number, even when they're not by Haydn. See also [[Klafsky-Verzeichnis]].
&lt;!-- If I've done this correctly, the Perger numbers run from 1 to 136 in order and the MH numbers run according to second column in the table on page 385 of Sherman &amp; Thomas (1993) --&gt;

== Symphonies ==

Perger numbered the symphonies from 1 to 52, but he included suites from incidental music by Haydn compiled into symphonies by someone else, as well as three symphonies altogether written by others. However, Perger overlooked a divertimento in G major that is sometimes called a symphony.

* Suite from ''Die Wahrheit der Natur'', MH 118, Perger 46 (1769?), sometimes called a symphony in F major&lt;ref&gt;Sherman (1982): lvii. "Although this work (Perger 45 [46 is meant here]) is derived from a separate larger composition, as are the six symphonies described above [No.s 8, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20], its form and its proportions call its authenticity into question. The Seitenstetten symphony opens with a substantial movement in sonata style followed by three short numbers. Two of these are minuets with trio&amp;mdash;a combination of movements that occurs in no other symphony by Haydn. So curious a sequence of movements appears all the more dubious in as much as ''Die Wahrheit der Natur'' contains a true finale, which most likely Haydn would have maintained for its character and its length had he himself compiled this symphony. The Seitenstetten work, therefore, is omitted from the list of authentic symphonies."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Suite from ''Rebekka als Braut'', MH 76, Perger 47 (1766)
* A symphony by someone else, Perger 48
* A symphony by someone else, Perger 49

* [[Symphony No. 14 (Michael Haydn)|Symphony No. 14 in B flat major]], MH 133, Perger 52 (1771)

== Concertos ==

Perger overlooked a violin concerto in G major, MH 52, while the horn concerto he placed in a miscellaneous category at the end.

* Violin Concerto in B-flat major, MH 36, Perger 53
* Flute Concerto No. 1 in D major, MH 81, Perger 54
* Concerto in C major for Organ and Viola, MH 41, Perger 55

== Minuets ==

For the most part these are collections of minuets that can be played on their own. Because Haydn wrote a minuet to symphony No. 33 long after the rest of the symphony, Perger mixed this minuet up with the free-standing pieces.

* 6 Menuetti, Perger 69, MH 333
* 6 Menuetti, Perger 70, MH 354
* 6 Menuetti, Perger 71, MH 414

* Divertimento in D major, Perger 95, MH 418
* Divertimento in G major, Perger 96, MH 518

* String Quartet in B flat major, Perger 125, MH 316

==Sonatas==

[[Hieronymus Graf von Colloredo]] commissioned Haydn to write six duos for violin and viola. Haydn fell ill after completing the fourth, so he asked Mozart to write the other two (K. 423 and K. 424). The set of six was presented as all Haydn's, and Colloredo was unable to "detect in them Mozart's obvious workmanship."&lt;ref&gt;John N. Burk, ''Mozart and His Music''. New York: Random House (1959): 140&lt;/ref&gt; With these Perger lumped a sonata for two violins and organ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11850">'''Politics of memory''' is the organisation of [[collective memory]] by [[politics|political agents]]; the political means by which events are remembered and recorded, or discarded. Eventually, politics of memory may determine the way history is written and passed on. Memories are also influenced by [[culture|cultural]] forces, e.g. [[popular culture]], as well as [[social norms]]. It has also been connected with the construction of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref&gt;The Politics of Memory by Laura Nasrallah. ''Harvard Divinity Bulletin'' Autumn 2005 (Vol. 33, No. 2).{{cite web |url=http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news-events/harvard-divinity-bulletin/articles/the-politics-of-memory |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922191952/http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news-events/harvard-divinity-bulletin/articles/the-politics-of-memory |archivedate=2012-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyprus==
The two sides in the [[Cyprus dispute|conflict in Cyprus]] maintain widely divergent and contrasting [[memory|memories]] of the events that split the island. The term [[selective memory]] is applied by psychologists to people suffering from head injuries who retain some memories, but have [[amnesia]] about others. Societal trauma, such as war, seems to have a similar effect. Recollections that are shaped out of a phenomenon common to many countries traumatized by war and repression, may be remembered in radically different ways by people who experienced similar events.

The selectivity may also serve a political purpose, for example to justify the claims of one group over a competing group. Cyprus is a poignant case for this phenomenon. The longstanding conflict on the island reflects deep roots in the "[[motherland]]s" of the [[Greek Cypriot]] and [[Turkish Cypriot]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/papadakis.diss.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724222818/http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/papadakis.diss.htm |archivedate=2008-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Croatia==
Lauren A. Rivera (Harvard University) studies how states "manage reputation-damaging" events "on a global stage". Rivera decided to conduct a study on the state of Croatia in order to determine how the government represented its country to international audiences following the wars of Yugoslavian secession. She hypothesized that the main catalyst for this change in international opinion was due to cultural reframing. This empirical study included textual analyses of travel brochures printed by the Croatian government (study 1), interviews with 34 tourism professionals from the Croatian government (study 2), and observations of popular attractions during the peak of Croatia's tourism season (study 3). Study 1 and study 3 came to the conclusion that the nation's new cultural identity draws parallels with western societies while creating "strong symbolic boundaries between Croatia and its Eastern neighbors" (Rivera). Tourism professionals explain this shift in culture as an attempt to make the country of Croatia seem like a more stable place for Western investment and travel (study 2).&lt;ref&gt;[Rivera, L.A. (2008). Managing "Spoiled" National Identity: War, Tourism, and Memory in Croatia. American Sociological Review 73(4), 613-634]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
In Germany, Politics of memory (''Geschichtspolitik'') is most often associated with how to memorise the [[Nazi Germany|national socialist era]] and [[World War II]]. Often different events of this era have been measured against one another and, in this way, evaluated, e.g. the [[Holocaust]], the war against [[Eastern Europe]] with its [[ethnic cleansing]] programs, but also the [[Air warfare of World War II|bombings of city's by German and Allied forces alike]] or the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe]]. 

Speeches by politicians often deal with issues of how to memorise the past. [[Richard von Weizsäcker]] as [[President of Germany|Bundespräsident]] identified two modes of memorising the unconditional [[surrender of Nazi Germany]] in 1945 in his famous 1985 speech: this date can be seen as defeat or liberation. Weizsäcker backed the [[Richard von Weizsäcker#Political career|latter Interpretation]]. In this regard, such moments as the first official "Day of Commemoration for Victims of National Socialism", on January 20, 1996, led to [[President of Germany|Bundespräsident]] [[Roman Herzog]] remarking in his address to the German Parliament that "Remembrance gives us strength, since it helps to keep us from going astray."&lt;ref name="highbeam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20088049.html|title=Divided Memory: The Nazi Past in the Two Germanys. - The Nation &amp;#124; HighBeam Research|publisher=highbeam.com|accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In similar, but somewhat opposing measure, [[Gerhard Schröder]] sought to move beyond this in saying the generation that committed such deeds has passed, and a new generation does not have the same fault because they simply weren't there to be responsible.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} 

Good examples for politics of memory could be seen in national monuments and the discourses surrounding their construction. The construction of a [[holocaust memorial]] in memory of the murdered Jews of Europe at a central location in Berlin was met with protests but also with strong support. Likewise the [[Neue Wache|National Memorial to the Victims of War and Tyranny]] was deemed inappropriate by some onlookers and a discussion revolved around the question whether the lack of a differentiation between victims and perpetrators is adequate or not.&lt;ref name="utexas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/arens/301history/memorial.html|title=Berlin Memorial Bibliography|publisher=utexas.edu|accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question if and how to memorise Germans expelled from Poland in the aftermath of World War II has been constantly debated in both West Germany and Poland. Such questions are so difficult because it requires a moral judgement of these events. These judgements differ remarkably. For instance, the [[Federation of Expellees|Federation of German Expellees]] called on [[Poland]] to pay compensation for lost property to Germans from what after 1945 became Polish territory, a claim that is consistently declined by Poland.&lt;ref name="eurozine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2006-08-21-ther-en.html|title=Eurozine - The burden of history and the trap of memory - Philipp Ther|publisher=eurozine.com|accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similarly there have been debates in Germany whether the legacy of World War II implies that Germany's military should be confined to purely defensive measure like peacekeeping or, contrary to this, this legacy can be a justification of an active enforcement of human rights which also might involve [[Preemptive war|preemptive]] strikes.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Present Pasts: Urban Palimpsests and the Politics of Memory|author=Huyssen, A.|date=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804745611|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8jtTGB8VtUC|page=73|accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet bloc: politics of history==
Although this has not received considerably coverage, there have been studies to saying that the Soviet Bloc's repressions and the consequent "traumatic repercussions" deserve the same mention as that of post-World War II, which has been insititutionalized.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruc.dk/upload/application/pdf/f51d6748/Malksoo.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
{{Expand section|date=April 2012}}
Memorials keep alive the memories of conflict, as with the removals of memorials, often for political purposes, such as in Lithuania's removal of Soviet era statue from the city centre of the capital to a cemetery that evoked an adverse reaction from Russia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Similarly, the commemorations of wars are held in places like Bosnia, which hosted a concert on the 20th anniversary of the [[Bosnian war]].&lt;ref name="aljazeera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/04/2012458577395275.html|title=Sarajevo hosts a concert 20 years after siege - Al Jazeera English|author=Edin Krehic, Selma Milovanovic|publisher=aljazeera.com|accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy and moral relativity==
While the German example's [[moral relativism]] has led to a lesser political [[fascism]], others have questioned whether politics of memory is a good thing. Is it that "[[George Santayana|Those who cannot remember the past, are doomed to repeat it]]?" A large body of Literature has been written with the view that it is so.

Looking at truth commissions and at efforts by ravaged societies to "come to terms" with the past has caused various writers, [[human rights]] activists, lawyers, political theorists, psychoanalysts, journalists, historians, and philosophers to argue that "forgetfulness equals impunity, [while] impunity is both morally outrageous and politically dangerous." It was also argued that forgetfulness is bad, however, it is still different from proving that memory is good. It was said that memory, like everything else, could be clumsily or unintelligently used, or even used for false purposes or in bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;http://bostonreview.net/BR28.3/linfield.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. G. Sebald]] sees the opposite end of the conventional determination in showing that German amnesia surrounding the Allied [[carpet bombing]]s of 131 German cities and towns turned many German cities into vast [[necropolis]]es, and resulted in an estimated 600,000 primarily civilian deaths, with millions of internal refugees. It was also said,{{by whom|date=February 2012}} however, that the politics of memory could contribute to the formation of strategies for achieving reconciliation in post-conflict situations. It can be used by activists, equity workers, policy analysts and academics to address existing paradigms in order to achieve some semblance of justice and reconciliation in the aftermath of deep internal conflict.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

A '''sieve analysis''' (or '''gradation test''') is a practice or procedure used (commonly used in [[civil engineering]]) to assess the [[particle size distribution]] (also called ''gradation'') of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass.

The size distribution is often of critical importance to the way the material performs in use.  A sieve analysis can be performed on any type of non-organic or organic granular materials including sands, crushed rock, clays, granite, feldspars, coal, soil, a wide range of manufactured powders, grain and seeds, down to a minimum size depending on the exact method. Being such a simple technique of particle sizing, it is probably the most common.&lt;ref&gt;p231 in "Characterisation of bulk solids" by Donald Mcglinchey, CRC Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
[[Image:Laboratory sieves BMK.jpg|thumb|Sieves used for gradation test.]]
[[File:Laborsiebmaschine BMK.jpg|thumb|A mechanical shaker used for sieve analysis.]]
A gradation test is performed on a sample of [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]] in a laboratory. A typical sieve analysis involves a nested column of [[sieve]]s with wire mesh cloth (screen).  See the separate [[Mesh (scale)]] page for details of sieve sizing.

A representative weighed sample is poured into the top sieve which has the largest screen openings.  Each lower sieve in the column has smaller openings than the one above. At the base is a round pan, called the receiver.

The column is typically placed in a mechanical shaker.   The shaker shakes the column, usually for some fixed amount of time.  After the shaking is complete the material on each sieve is weighed.  The weight of the sample of each sieve is then divided by the total weight to give a percentage retained on each sieve.
The size of the average particle on each sieve is then analysed to get a cut-off point  or specific size range, which is then captured on a screen.

The results of this test are used to describe the properties of the aggregate and to see if it is appropriate for various civil engineering purposes such as selecting the appropriate aggregate for concrete mixes and asphalt mixes as well as sizing of water production well screens.

The results of this test are provided in graphical form to identify the type of gradation of the aggregate.  The complete procedure for this test is outlined in the American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM]]) C 136&lt;ref&gt;ASTM International - Standards Worldwide. (2006). ''ASTM C136-06''. http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/DATABASE.CART/REDLINE_PAGES/C136.htm?E+mystore&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Association and State Highway and Transportation Officials ([[AASHTO]]) T 27&lt;ref&gt;AASHTO The Voice of Transportation. ''T0 27''. (2006). http://bookstore.transportation.org/item_details.aspx?ID=659&lt;/ref&gt;

A suitable sieve size for the aggregate underneath the nest of sieves to collect the aggregate that passes through the smallest.  The entire nest is then agitated, and the material whose diameter is smaller than the mesh opening pass through the sieves.  After the aggregate reaches the pan, the amount of material retained in each sieve is then weighed.&lt;ref name="Pavement Interactive" /&gt;

===Preparation===
In order to perform the test, a sufficient sample of the aggregate must be obtained from the source.  To prepare the sample, the aggregate should be mixed thoroughly and be reduced to a suitable size for testing.  The total weight of the sample is also required.&lt;ref name="Pavement Interactive"&gt;Pavement Interactive. ''Gradation Test''. (2007). http://pavementinteractive.org/index.php?title=Gradation_Test&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
[[File:Grain-size-distribution.svg|align=left|thumb|Graphs of cumulative percent passing versus the logarithmic sieve size.]]
The results are presented in a graph of percent passing versus the sieve size. On the graph the sieve size scale is logarithmic.  To find the percent of aggregate passing through each sieve, first find the percent retained in each sieve.  To do so, the following equation is used,

%Retained = &lt;math&gt;\frac{W_{Sieve}}{W_{Total}}&lt;/math&gt;×100%

where W&lt;sub&gt;Sieve&lt;/sub&gt; is the weight of aggregate in the sieve and W&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt; is the total weight of the aggregate.  The next step is to find the cumulative percent of aggregate retained in each sieve.  To do so, add up the total amount of aggregate that is retained in each sieve and the amount in the previous sieves.  The cumulative percent passing of the aggregate is found by subtracting the percent retained from 100%.

%Cumulative Passing = 100% - %Cumulative Retained.

The values are then plotted on a graph with cumulative percent passing on the y axis and logarithmic sieve size on the x axis.&lt;ref name="Pavement Interactive" /&gt;

There are two versions of the %Passing equations. the .45 power formula is presented on .45 power gradation chart, whereas the more simple %Passing is presented on a semi-log gradation chart. version of the percent passing graph is shown on .45 power chart and by using the .45 passing formula.

;.45 power percent passing formula:

% Passing = P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{Sieve_{Largest}}{Aggregate_{max-size}}&lt;/math&gt;x100%

Where:

Sieve&lt;sub&gt;Largest&lt;/sub&gt; - Largest diameter sieve used in (mm).&lt;br /&gt;
Aggregate&lt;sub&gt;max_size&lt;/sub&gt; - Largest piece of aggregate in the sample in (mm).

;Percent passing formula:

%Passing = &lt;math&gt;\frac{W_{Below}}{W_{Total}}&lt;/math&gt;x100%

Where:

W&lt;sub&gt;Below&lt;/sub&gt; - The total mass of the aggregate within the sieves below the current sieve, not including the current sieve's aggregate.

W&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt; - The total mass of all of the aggregate in the sample.

==Methods==
There are different methods for carrying out sieve analyses, depending on the material to be measured.

===Throw-action===
Here a throwing motion acts on the sample. The vertical throwing motion is overlaid with a slight circular motion which results in distribution of the sample amount over the whole sieving surface. The particles are accelerated in the vertical direction (are thrown upwards). In the air they carry out free rotations and interact with the openings in the mesh of the sieve when they fall back. If the particles are smaller than the openings, they pass through the sieve. If they are larger, they are thrown upwards again. The rotating motion while suspended increases the probability that the particles present a different orientation to the mesh when they fall back again, and thus might eventually pass through the mesh.&lt;ref name = TexasDOT&gt;

Modern sieve shakers work with an electro-magnetic drive which moves a spring-mass system and transfers the resulting oscillation to the sieve stack. Amplitude and sieving time are set digitally and are continuously observed by an integrated control-unit. Therefore, sieving results are reproducible and precise (an important precondition for a significant analysis). Adjustment of parameters like amplitude and sieving time serves to optimize the sieving for different types of material. This method is the most common in the laboratory sector.&lt;ref name = TexasDOT/&gt;

===Horizontal===
{{unreferenced section|date = May 2018}}
In a horizontal sieve shaker the sieve stack moves in horizontal circles in a plane. Horizontal sieve shakers are preferably used for needle-shaped, flat, long or fibrous samples, as their horizontal orientation means that only a few disoriented particles enter the mesh and the sieve is not blocked so quickly. The large sieving area enables the sieving of large amounts of sample, for example as encountered in the particle-size analysis of construction materials and aggregates.{{clear}}

===Tapping===
{{unreferenced section|date = May 2018}}
[[Image:tapping.jpg|thumb|Tapping sieving]]
A horizontal circular motion overlies a vertical motion which is created by a tapping impulse. These motional processes are characteristic of hand sieving and produce a higher degree of sieving for denser particles (e.g. abrasives) than throw-action sieve shakers.{{clear}}

===Wet===
{{unreferenced section|date = May 2018}}
Most sieve analyses are carried out dry. But there are some applications which can only be carried out by wet sieving. This is the case when the sample which has to be analysed is e.g. a suspension which must not be dried; or when the sample is a very fine powder which tends to agglomerate (mostly &lt; 45&amp;nbsp;µm) – in a dry sieving process this tendency would lead to a clogging of the sieve meshes and this would make a further sieving process impossible. A wet sieving process is set up like a dry process: the sieve stack is clamped onto the sieve shaker and the sample is placed on the top sieve. Above the top sieve a water-spray nozzle is placed which supports the sieving process additionally to the sieving motion. The rinsing is carried out until the liquid which is discharged through the receiver is clear. Sample residues on the sieves have to be dried and weighed. When it comes to wet sieving it is very important not to change the sample in its volume (no swelling, dissolving or reaction with the liquid).

===Air Circular Jet===
{{unreferenced section|date = May 2018}}
Air jet sieving machines are ideally suited for very fine powders which tend to agglomerate and cannot be separated by vibrational sieving.
The reason for the effectiveness of this sieving method is based on two components:
A rotating slotted nozzle inside the sieving chamber and a powerful industrial vacuum cleaner which is connected to the chamber. The vacuum cleaner generates a vacuum inside the sieving chamber and sucks in fresh air through the slotted nozzle. When passing the narrow slit of the nozzle the air stream is accelerated and blown against the sieve mesh, dispersing the particles. Above the mesh, the air jet is distributed over the complete sieve surface and is sucked in with low speed through the sieve mesh. Thus the finer particles are transported through the mesh openings into the vacuum cleaner.

==Types of gradation==

;A Dense gradation
:A dense gradation refers to a sample that is approximately of equal amounts of various sizes of aggregate.  By having a dense gradation, most of the air voids between the material are filled with particles.  A dense gradation will result in an even curve on the gradation graph.&lt;ref name="Materials for..."&gt;M.S. Mamlouk and J.P. Zaniewski, ''Materials for Civil and Construction Engineers'', Addison-Wesley, Menlo Park CA, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
;Narrow gradation
:Also known as uniform gradation, a narrow gradation is a sample that has aggregate of approximately the same size.  The curve on the gradation graph is very steep, and occupies a small range of the aggregate.&lt;ref name="Pavement Interactive" /&gt;
;Gap gradation
:A gap gradation refers to a sample with very little aggregate in the medium size range.  This results in only coarse and fine aggregate.  The curve is horizontal in the medium size range on the gradation graph.&lt;ref name="Pavement Interactive" /&gt;
;Open gradation
:An open gradation refers an aggregate sample with very little fine aggregate particles.  This results in many air voids, because there are no fine particles to fill them.  On the gradation graph, it appears as a curve that is horizontal in the small size range.&lt;ref name="Pavement Interactive" /&gt;
;Rich gradation
:A rich gradation refers to a sample of aggregate with a high proportion of particles of small sizes.&lt;ref name="Materials for..." /&gt;

==Types of sieves==
;Woven wire mesh sieves
Woven wire mesh sieves are according to technical requirements of ISO 3310-1.&lt;ref&gt;

==Limitations of sieve analysis==
{{unreferenced section|date = May 2018}}
Sieve analysis has, in general, been used for decades to monitor material quality based on particle size.  For coarse material, sizes that range down to #100 mesh (150μm), a sieve analysis and particle size distribution is accurate and consistent.

However, for material that is finer than 100 mesh, dry sieving can be significantly less accurate.  This is because the mechanical energy required to make particles pass through an opening and the surface attraction effects between the particles themselves and between particles and the screen increase as the particle size decreases.  Wet sieve analysis can be utilized where the material analyzed is not affected by the liquid - except to disperse it.  Suspending the particles in a suitable liquid transports fine material through the sieve much more efficiently than shaking the dry material.

Sieve analysis assumes that all particle will be round (spherical) or nearly so and will pass through the square openings when the particle diameter is less than the size of the square opening in the screen. For elongated and flat particles a sieve analysis will not yield reliable mass-based results, as the particle size reported will assume that the particles are spherical, where in fact an elongated particle might pass through the screen end-on, but would be prevented from doing so if it presented itself side-on.

==Properties==
Gradation affects many properties of an aggregate.  It affects bulk density, physical stability and permeability.  With careful selection of the gradation, it is possible to achieve high bulk density, high physical stability, and low permeability.  This is important because in pavement design, a workable, stable mix with resistance to water is important.  With an open gradation, the bulk density is relatively low, due to the lack of fine particles, the physical stability is moderate, and the permeability is quite high.  With a rich gradation, the bulk density will also be low, the physical stability is low, and the permeability is also low.  The gradation can be affected to achieve the desired properties for the particular engineering application.&lt;ref name="Materials for..." /&gt;

==Engineering applications==
{{unreferenced section|date = May 2018}}
Gradation is usually specified for each engineering application it is used for.  For example, foundations might only call for coarse aggregates, and therefore an open gradation is needed.

She earned a degree in social work then worked as a financial advisor for  [[Merrill Lynch]]. In 1983, she became a vice president of retail customer investments at [[Prudential Bache Securities]]. In 1987, she founded the Suze Orman Financial Group. In 2002, her program ''The Suze Orman Show'' began airing on [[CNBC]]. In 2006, she won a [[Gracie Allen Awards|Gracie Award]] for Outstanding Program Host on ''The Suze Orman Show''.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite news|author=Curry, Ann |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11642946 |title=''Dateline'' wins Gracie Award|work=MSNBC|date=March 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written several books on the topic of personal finance.

==Early life and education==
Orman was born on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side of Chicago]] on June 5, 1951, to Jewish parents of Russian and Romanian origin, Ann and Morry Orman.&lt;ref name=spiritual&gt;{{cite news|title=Suze Orman's Spiritual Side|work=The Jewish Daily Forward|first=Elissa|last=Strauss|date=October 17, 2007|publisher=The Forward Association, Inc.|url=http://forward.com/articles/11820/a-financial-guru-s-spiritual-side-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dignitymemorial.com/en-ca/obituaries/boca-raton-fl/ann-orman-5228598&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother worked as a secretary for a local rabbi, while her immigrant father from [[Kiev]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Millennial Money Moves|date=February 7, 2015|series= The Suze Orman Show|network=CNBC.com|url=https://www.cnbc.com/live-tv/the-suze-orman-show/full-episode/millenial-money-moves/394285635704}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked in a chicken factory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/magazine/17orman-t.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|first=Susan|last=Dominus|title=Suze Orman Is Having a Moment|date=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1318/is_n11_v52/ai_21225107|work=Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine|title=If you knew Suze…|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foir1-2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/article/tv_suze_orman_isnt_all_about_the_money_she_has_a_spiritual_side_too|title=News - Suze Orman|work=The Jewish Journal|accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and managed Morry's Deli &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Spiselman| first        = Anne| title= Morry's Deli| url= http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/morrys-deli/Location?oid=1360950| newspaper= Chicago Reader| | access-date  = 2016-09-05 |quote=in the mid-1970s—when you might have found college student Suze Orman working behind the counter for her dad, the original owner...}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]].&lt;ref name="Orman2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantor|first=Danielle|title=Successful Women: Suze Orman|publisher=Jewish Women International|work=Jewish Woman|issue=Fall 2004|url=http://www.jwmag.org/site/c.fhLOK0PGLsF/b.2440689/k.3442/Suze_Orman.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923123457/http://www.jwmag.org/site/c.fhLOK0PGLsF/b.2440689/k.3442/Suze_Orman.htm|archivedate=2008-09-23|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orman1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloom|first=Nate|title=Celebrity Jews: Briefly noted|publisher=San Francisco Jewish Community Publications Inc.|website=jewishsf.com|date=2004-06-11|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/22714/edition_id/455/format/html/displaystory.html|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orman3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Iwata|first=Edward|title=Personal finance guru Suze Orman is keepin' it real despite her astounding success|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=1999-05-04|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/examiner/archive/1999/05/04/BUSINESS10622.dtl|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[social work]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="dailyillini.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Post to Wall|url=http://www.dailyillini.com/news/campus/2009/05/18/suze-orman-receives-honorary-degree-addresses-university-graduates|title=Suze Orman receives honorary degree, addresses University graduates.|website=Dailyillini.com|accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Orman received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&lt;ref name="dailyillini.com"/&gt;

==Career==
After finishing school, Orman moved to [[Berkeley, California]], where she worked as a waitress. In 1980, she borrowed $52,000 from friends and wellwishers to open a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suzeorman.com/aboutsuze/index.cfm|title=History from Orman's website|website=Suzeorman.com|accessdate=2012-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701103049/http://www.suzeorman.com/aboutsuze/index.cfm|archivedate=2012-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmE8YHpVl1gC |title=Women &amp; money: owning the power to control your destiny|pages= 27–28|publisher= Random House, Inc.|date= 2007|isbn=0-385-51931-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PublishersWeekly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WomenAndMoney"&gt;{{cite video|people=Orman, Suze|title=Women and Money|medium=TV-program|date=2008-06-05|location=PBS pledge programming|publisher=PBS|url=http://wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=3204814&amp;episode_id=3204816|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615041808/http://www.wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=3204814&amp;episode_id=3204816|archivedate=2008-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still an investment novice, she invested that money through a representative at [[Merrill Lynch]], who promptly lost her entire investment in trading options. Later, Orman trained as an account executive for [[Merrill Lynch]], where she learned that the type of investment her broker had put her in was not suitable for her needs, as option trading is considered a high-risk but high-reward investment suitable only for high net worth individuals. It was explained to her that because her broker was the highest producing representative in the office, his actions went unchecked. After completing her training with Merrill Lynch, she remained at the firm until 1983, when she left to become a vice president of investments at [[Prudential Bache Securities]].

In 1987, Orman resigned from Prudential and founded the Suze Orman Financial Group, in [[Emeryville, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Emeryville became a boom town|work=USA Today|date=June 13, 1988|page=8B|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0ED02A6F0FCB2CCA&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_queryname=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Catastrophic Coverage Raises Some Questions|work=The Times-Picayune|location=New Orleans, Louisiana|date=May 9, 1989|first=Jay|last=Goldinger|page=E4|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0FADA1870A704F01&amp;p_docnum=3&amp;p_queryname=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, she published a booklet, ''The Facts on Single Premium Whole Life'', which compared single-premium whole life, universal life, and single-premium deferred annuities; she distributed copies of the booklet for free to anyone who requested one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Closed-end Funds Offer Good Value for the Investor|work=The Times-Picayune|location=New Orleans, Louisiana|date=September 19, 1989|page=D3|first=Jay|last=Goldinger|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0FADA0310C91E9E0&amp;p_docnum=5&amp;p_queryname=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was director of the firm until 1997.&lt;ref name="PublishersWeekly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Andriani|first=Lynn|title=The Dollars and Sense of Suze Orman|publisher=Publishers Weekly|date=2003-02-24|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA278785.html?display=archive|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920223930/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA278785.html?display=archive|archivedate=2008-09-20|accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orman published three books between 1997-99: ''The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom'' (1997), ''You Earned it Don't Lose it'' (1999), and  ''The Courage to be Rich'' (1999). Other books by Orman include: ''The Road to Wealth'' (2001) and ''The Laws of Money, The Lessons of Life'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_bks&amp;q=Suze+Orman&amp;fq=dt%3Abks Suze Orman], WorldCat.org; accessed 2013-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Suze Orman Show'' began airing on [[CNBC]] in 2002.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In February 2008, Orman gave away copies of her book ''Women and Money'' for free following an appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', generating almost two million downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/magazine/17orman-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|first=Susan|last=Dominus|title=Suze Orman Is Having a Moment|date=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orman has been featured on the [[Food Network]]'s ''[[Paula's Party]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In January 2011, Orman appeared on ''Oprah's Allstars''. In January 2012, Orman's six-episode TV series ''America's Money Class with Suze Orman'' premiered on [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2012/01/09/americas-money-class-with-suze-orman "America's Money Class with Suze Orman"], channelguidemag.com, 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orman writes a financial advice column for ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Orman, Suze (January 6, 2010) [http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/personal/01/06/o.orman.easy.money.list/index.html Easy Money], CNN.com; accessed January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; She is the former author of  [[Yahoo!]]'s "Money Matters" and has written for the ''[[Costco]] Connection Magazine''. She contributes to ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''Lowes MoneyWorks'', and ''Your Business at Home Magazine''.&lt;ref name="ybah"&gt;Orman, Suze.

While she has proven herself a wealth of information about credit and very general financial issues, Orman's understanding of comprehensive financial planning has been questioned by many in the industry. Senior ''MarketWatch'' columnist Chuck Jaffe, for example, states that Orman "scores very high on the personality index, but very low on the knowledge and understanding of the complex issues that face a lot of her audience. She's giving generic, simple solutions to people's most difficult problems, and judging from her [own personal investment] portfolio she's taking them on a path she really hasn't traveled herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/outing-suze-ormans-investment-portfolio|title=Outing Suze Orman's portfolio|author=Chuck Jaffe|date=Mar 8, 2007|website=[[MarketWatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orman's final episode of ''The Suze Orman Show'' aired on March 28, 2015, so Orman could develop a new series, ''Suze Orman's Money Wars'', for Warner Bros. [[Telepictures Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=Suze Orman to Exit CNBC for 'Money Wars' Series with Telepictures|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/suze-orman-to-exit-cnbc-after-14-years-1201364521/|accessdate=8 March 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orman hoped the show would premiere in the fall of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/so-long-suze-orman-show-tvs-only-sane-space-in-a-money-crazed-culture/2015/03/27/068c9524-d331-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html|title=So long, ‘Suze Orman Show,’ TV’s only sane space in a money-crazed culture|last=Stuever|first=Hank|date=2015-03-27|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-05-10|last2=Stuever|first2=Hank|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suze Orman "Approved" prepaid debit card==
In 2012, Orman introduced a prepaid [[debit card]], backed by Bancorp Bank, aimed at [[Working class in the United States|budget-challenged consumers]]. In personal appearances, she claimed the card would contribute to improving the cardholder's [[FICO]] score, even though only one credit agency – [[TransUnion]] – had reviewed the proposal and had agreed only to "examine data from [the] cards". The website for the debit card claimed, "I am proud to say that the Approved card is the first prepaid card in history to share information with TransUnion, a major credit bureau."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/business/truth-behind-suze-ormans-new-debit-card-1C7101032 The truth behind Suze Orman's devit card] [[NBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the program was quietly ended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/business/suze-ormans-approved-prepaid-debit-cards-are-quietly-discontinued.html?_r=0 Suze Orman's prepaid debit cards are quietly discontinued] ''[[New York Times]]'' 2014/06/17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In February 2007, Orman stated that she is a [[lesbian]].&lt;ref&gt;Lo, Malinda.

In an April 2008 online interview with ''[[The Young Turks (talk show)|The Young Turks]]'', Orman said that her net worth was more than US $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Deborah. "She's So Money", ''Sunday New York Times'' magazine; 2007-02-25: 'Despite her rallying cry to "buy term and invest the rest" Orman owns significant amounts of permanent insurance (mostly whole life) for estate planning purposes and because 2008 taught us that guarantees are an important part of constructing a portfolio. She has never come out and said so because she fears it would damage her reputation as a financial advisor and TV guru after villainizing permanent insurance and the people who sell it.'&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The dose makes the poison'''" ({{lang-la|'''sola dosis facit venenum'''}}) is an [[adage]] intended to indicate a basic principle of [[toxicology]]. It is credited to [[Paracelsus]] who expressed the classic toxicology maxim "All things are poison, and nothing is without poison, the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison." This is often condensed to: "The dose makes the poison" or in Latin, {{lang|la|"Sola dosis facit venenum"}}. It means that a substance can produce the harmful effect associated with its toxic properties only if it reaches a susceptible biological system within the body in a high enough concentration (i.e., [[dose (biochemistry)|dose]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.caim.yale.edu/chemsafe/references/dose.html The Dose Makes the Poison on Chemsafe at Yale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202055026/http://learn.caim.yale.edu/chemsafe/references/dose.html |date=2011-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle relies on the finding that all chemicals—even [[Water intoxication|water]] and [[Oxygen toxicity|oxygen]]—can be toxic if too much is eaten, drunk, or absorbed. "The toxicity of any particular chemical depends on many factors, including the extent to which it enters an individual’s body."&lt;ref name="Trautmann"&gt;[http://www.actionbioscience.org/environment/trautmann.html Nancy Trautmann: The Dose Makes the Poison--Or Does It?], Bioscience 2005, American Institute of Biological Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; This finding also provides the basis for public health standards, which specify maximum acceptable concentrations of various contaminants in food, public drinking water, and the environment.&lt;ref name="Trautmann"/&gt;

However, there is no linear relationship and also more to chemical toxicity than the acute effects caused by short-term exposure. Relatively low doses of contaminants in water, food, and environment can already have significant chronic effects if there is a long-term exposure.&lt;ref name="Trautmann"/&gt;  Many pollutants, drugs, and natural substances adhere to this principle by causing different effects at different levels, which can as a result lead to health standards that are either too strong or too weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite |url=http://www.ourstolenfuture.org/NewScience/lowdose/2007/2007-0525nmdrc.html |last=Pete Myers, Ph.D. and Wendy Hessle |title= Does 'the dose make the poison?' |website=ourstolenfuture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the effects of different doses can be very different at different levels (not only bigger and smaller impacts depending on dose).

The '''Information School''' or '''iSchool''' of the [[University of Sheffield]], in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]], was founded in 1963 as the University's '''Postgraduate School of Librarianship''' and became in 2010 the first UK [[iSchool]]. Other names were the '''Postgraduate School of Librarianship and Information Science''' ('''PGSLIS''', 1967-81) and '''Department of Information Studies''' (1981-2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iSchool Timeline|url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/is/about/history.html|work=University of Sheffield: Information School|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, it employs 28 academic staff, 12 administrative/support staff, 7 affiliated research staff, and has about 50 research students. The current head of school is Professor Peter Bath.

The department opened in 1964 as a library school, becoming only the second university-based department in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/016555158901500402 |last=Saunders |first=W. |year=1989|title=The University of Sheffield Department of Information Studies|journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=15 |issue=4-5| pages = 193–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, like many [[information science]] departments it has grown to encompass teaching and research in [[cheminformatics]], educational informatics, [[health informatics]], [[information retrieval]], [[information systems]], knowledge and information management, as well as libraries and information society. Such is the status of the school, that it has twice been honoured with a special issue of the ''[[Journal of Information Science]]'' devoted entirely to the department, its staff and its research outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1989 | journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=15 |issue=4-5|url=http://jis.sagepub.com/content/vol15/issue4-5/|title=The University of Sheffield Department of Information Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2003|title=Special Issue, 40 years of the Department of Information Studies, University of Sheffield|journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=29 |issue=4|url=http://jis.sagepub.com/content/vol29/issue4/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research achievements==
The school has ranked highest or joint highest in its subject rating in every [[Research Assessment Exercise]] since the running of the first exercise in 1986. In this UK-government sponsored assessment of research outputs, no other department in its subject field (or its [[University of Sheffield|University]]) achieved this consistency; few departments of any subject area in UK universities managed such a high level of continuous research output (see the following links to the 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/1992/c26_92t64.html |title=UFC 26/92 - RAE92: The Outcome Table 64 |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/1996/1_96/t61.html |title=1996 RAE - Unit of Assessment: 61 |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/2001/results/byuoa/uoa61.htm |title=Results : 2001 Research Assessment Exercise : Unit of Assessment : 61 Library and Information Management |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAE results). In 2008, rankings of departments was left to news organizations; the [[Times Higher Education]] placed Sheffield at No. 1 again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/Journals/THE/THE/18_December_2008/attachments/RAE_2008_THE_RESULTS.pdf |format=PDF |title=Times Higher Education Table of Excellence |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an analysis of citations showed four of the ten most cited UK information studies academics were working in the Sheffield department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.20771 |url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/4579/ |last=Sanderson |first=M. | year=2008 | title=Revisiting h measured on UK LIS and IR academics| journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (JASIST) |volume=59 |issue=7| pages=1184–1190}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first UK-based (and 2nd European) department to be become an [[i-school|iSchool]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20080">[[File:Electrolysis of Water.png|thumb|300px|Diagram of the [[chemical equation]] of the [[electrolysis of water]], a form of water splitting.]]

'''Water splitting''' is the [[chemical reaction]] in which [[water]] is broken down into [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]]:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Efficient and economical photochemical water splitting would be a technological breakthrough that could underpin a [[hydrogen economy]].  A version of water splitting occurs in [[photosynthesis]], but hydrogen is not produced. No practical version of water splitting has been demonstrated, but the two component reactions (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production) are well known.  The reverse of water splitting is the basis of the [[hydrogen fuel cell]].

== Electrolysis ==
{{Main article|Electrolysis of water}}
[[File:Electrolyser, front, B.jpg|thumb|Electrolyser front with electrical panel in foreground]]
[[Electrolysis of water]] is the decomposition of [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) into [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) due to an [[electricity|electric current]] being passed through the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hauch, A.; Ebbesen, S. D.; Jensen, S. H.; Mogensen, M.|title=Highly Efficient high temperature electrolysis|journal=J. Mater. Chem.|year=2008|volume=18|pages=2331–2340|doi=10.1039/b718822f}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:[[File:Vion radiant energy US Patent 28793.png|thumb|upright|[[Atmospheric electricity]] utilization for the chemical reaction in which water is separated into oxygen and hydrogen. (Image via: Vion, US patent 28793. June 1860.)]]
* Vion, {{US patent|28793}}, "Improved method of using atmospheric electricity", June 1860.

In [[power to gas]] production schemes, the excess power or off peak power created by wind generators or solar arrays is used for load balancing of the energy grid by storing and later injecting the hydrogen into the natural gas grid.

[[File:Hydrogen-challenger hg.jpg|thumb|''|Electrolysis of water ship [[Hydrogen Challenger]]'']]
Production of hydrogen from water is energy intensive. Potential electrical energy supplies include hydropower, wind turbines, or photovoltaic cells. Usually, the electricity consumed is more valuable than the hydrogen produced so this method has not been widely used. In contrast with low-temperature electrolysis, [[high-temperature electrolysis]] (HTE) of water converts more of the initial [[heat]] energy into chemical energy (hydrogen), potentially doubling [[fuel efficiency|efficiency]] to about 50%. Because some of the energy in HTE is supplied in the form of heat, less of the energy must be converted twice (from heat to electricity, and then to chemical form), and so the process is more efficient.

==Water splitting in photosynthesis ==
A version of water splitting occurs in [[photosynthesis]], but the electrons are shunted, not to protons, but to the electron transport chain in [[photosystem II]].  The electrons are used to convert carbon dioxide into sugars.

When photosystem I gets photo-excited, electron transfer reactions gets initiated, which results in reduction of a series of electron acceptors, eventually reducing NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADPH and PS I is oxidized. The oxidized photosystem I captures electrons from photosystem II through a series of steps involving agents like plastoquinone, cytochromes and plastocyanine. The photosystem II then brings about water oxidation resulting in evolution of oxygen, the reaction being catalyzed by CaMn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; clusters embedded in complex protein environment; the complex is known as oxygen evolving complex (OEC).&lt;ref&gt;Yano, J.; Kern, J.; Sauer, K.; Latimer, M. J.; Pushkar, Y.; Biesiadka, J.; Loll, B.; Saenger, W.; Messinger, J.; Zouni, A.; Yachandra, V. K., Where Water Is Oxidized to Dioxygen: Structure of the Photosynthetic Mn(4)Ca Cluster. Science 2006, 314, 821-825.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barber, J., Crystal Structure of the Oxygen-Evolving Complex of Photosystem II. Inorganic Chemistry 2008, 47, 1700-1710.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Algae hydrogen production.jpg|frame|An [[algae bioreactor]] for hydrogen production.]]
In [[Biological hydrogen production (Algae)|biological hydrogen production]], the electrons produced by the photosystem are shunted not to a chemical synthesis apparatus but to [[hydrogenase]]s, resulting in formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This biohydrogen is produced in an [[bioreactor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress08/ii_f_2_melis.pdf DOE 2008 Report 25 %]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photoelectrochemical water splitting==
{{Main article|photoelectrochemical cell|artificial photosynthesis}}
Using electricity produced by [[photovoltaic]] systems potentially offers the cleanest way to produce hydrogen, other than nuclear, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric.  Again, water is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis, but the electrical energy is obtained by a [[photoelectrochemical cell]] (PEC) process.  The system is also named [[artificial photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14441-electrode-lights-the-way-to-artificial-photosynthesis.html Electrode lights the way to artificial photosynthesis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/21155/?a=f Solar-Power Breakthrough: Researchers have found a cheap and easy way to store the energy made by solar power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://swegene.com/pechouse-a-proposed-cell-solar-hydrogen.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= del Valle |first= F. |last2= Ishikawa |first2= A. |last3= Domen |first3= K. |date=May 2009|last4= Villoria De La Mano |first4= J.A.|last5= Sánchez-Sánchez|first5= M.C.|last6= González|first6= I.D.|last7= Herreras|first7= S.|last8= Mota|first8= N.|last9= Rivas|first9= M.E. |title= Influence of Zn concentration in the activity of Cd1-xZnxS solid solutions for water splitting under visible light |journal= Catalysis Today |volume= 143 |issue= 1–2 |pages= 51–59 |publisher= |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.024 |bibcode= |ref=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photocatalytic water splitting==
{{Main article|Photocatalytic water splitting}}
The conversion of solar energy to hydrogen by means of water splitting process is one of the most interesting ways to achieve clean and renewable energy. However, if this process is assisted by photocatalysts suspended directly in water rather than a photovoltaic or an electrolytic system, the reaction takes place in one step, it therefore can be more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= del Valle |first= F. |date=Jun 2009|last2= Álvarez Galván |first2= M.

==Radiolysis==
{{Main article|Radiolysis#Hydrogen_production}}
Nuclear radiation routinely breaks water bonds, in the [[Mponeng]] [[gold mine]], [[South Africa]], researchers found in a [[Background radiation#Areas with high NBR|naturally high radiation zone]], a community dominated by a new [[phylotype]] of ''[[Desulfotomaculum]]'', feeding on primarily [[Radiolysis|radiolytically]] produced [[Hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Li-Hung Lin |author2=Pei-Ling Wang |author3=Douglas Rumble |author4=Johanna Lippmann-Pipke |author5=Erik Boice |author6=Lisa M.

==Thermal decomposition of water==
{{Main article|Thermochemical cycle}}
In [[thermolysis]], water molecules split into their atomic components [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. For example, at 2200&amp;nbsp;°C about three percent of all H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are dissociated into various combinations of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, mostly H, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and OH. Other reaction products like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remain minor. At the very high temperature of 3000&amp;nbsp;°C more than half of the water molecules are decomposed, but at ambient temperatures only one molecule in 100 trillion dissociates by the effect of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Int J Hydrogen Energy |volume=26 |year=2001 |pages=185pp |title=Thermochemical hydrogen production: past and present |doi=10.1016/S0360-3199(00)00062-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high temperatures and material constraints have limited the applications of this approach.

===Nuclear-thermal===
{{see also|NGNP}}
Some prototype [[Generation IV reactor]]s, such as the [[High-temperature engineering test reactor]], operate at 850 to 1000 [[degrees Celsius]], considerably hotter than existing commercial [[nuclear power]] plants. [[General Atomics]] predicts that hydrogen produced in a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor ([[HTGR]]) would cost $1.53/[[kilogram|kg]]. In 2003, steam reforming of natural gas yielded hydrogen at $1.40/kg. At {{As of|2005|alt=2005}} gas prices, hydrogen cost $2.70/kg.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Hence, just within the United States, a savings of tens of billions of dollars per year is possible with a nuclear-powered supply. Much of this savings would translate into reduced oil and natural gas imports.

One side benefit of a nuclear reactor that produces both [[electricity]] and hydrogen is that it can shift production between the two. For instance, the plant might produce electricity during the day and hydrogen at night, matching its electrical generation profile to the daily variation in demand. If the hydrogen can be produced economically, this scheme would compete favorably with existing [[grid energy storage]] schemes. What is more, there is sufficient hydrogen demand in the [[United States]] that all daily peak generation could be handled by such plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dis.anl.gov/ceeesa/documents/NuclearHydrogen_ANL0530Final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927075457/http://www.dis.anl.gov/ceeesa/documents/NuclearHydrogen_ANL0530Final.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hybrid thermoelectric [[Copper-chlorine cycle]] is a [[cogeneration]] system using the [[waste heat]] from nuclear reactors, specifically the [[CANDU reactor|CANDU]] [[supercritical water reactor]].&lt;ref name=Naterer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Naterer |first=G. F. |title=Recent Canadian Advances in Nuclear-Based Hydrogen Production and the Thermochemical Cu-Cl Cycle |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=2901–2917 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.01.090 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar-thermal===

The high temperatures necessary to split water can be achieved through the use of [[concentrating solar power]].  [[Hydrosol-2]] is a 100-kilowatt pilot plant at the [[Plataforma Solar de Almería]] in [[Spain]] which uses sunlight to obtain the required 800 to 1,200&amp;nbsp;°C to split water. Hydrosol II has been in operation since 2008. The design of this 100-kilowatt pilot plant is based on a modular concept. As a result, it may be possible that this technology could be readily scaled up to megawatt range by multiplying the available reactor units and by connecting the plant to [[heliostat]] fields (fields of sun-tracking mirrors) of a suitable size.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1/86_read-14380/&lt;/ref&gt;

Material constraints due to the required high temperatures are reduced by the design of a membrane reactor with simultaneous extraction of hydrogen and oxygen that exploits a defined thermal gradient and the fast diffusion of hydrogen. With concentrated sunlight as heat source and only water in the reaction chamber, the produced gases are very clean with the only possible contaminant being water. A "Solar Water Cracker" with a concentrator of about 100 m² can produce almost one kilogram of hydrogen per sunshine hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h2powersystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its comprehension has been made possible ever since the discovery of water electrolysis by means of the titanium dioxide. [[Artificial photosynthesis]] is a research field that attempts to replicate the natural process of photosynthesis, converting sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. Recently, this has been successful in splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using an artificial compound called [[Nafion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-08/mu-mtl081408.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[High-temperature electrolysis]] (also HTE or [[steam electrolysis]]) is a method currently being investigated for the production of hydrogen from water with oxygen as a by-product. Other research includes [[thermolysis]] on defective [[carbon]] substrates, thus making hydrogen production possible at temperatures just under 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[iron oxide cycle]] is a series of [[Thermochemistry|thermochemical]] processes used to [[Hydrogen production|produce hydrogen]]. The iron oxide cycle consists of two [[chemical reaction]]s whose net reactant is [[water]] and whose net products are [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. All other chemicals are recycled. The iron oxide process requires an efficient source of heat.

The [[sulfur-iodine cycle]] (S-I cycle) is a series of [[Thermochemistry|thermochemical]] processes used to [[Hydrogen production|produce hydrogen]]. The S-I cycle consists of three [[chemical reaction]]s whose net reactant is water and whose net products are [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. All other chemicals are recycled. The S-I process requires an efficient source of heat.

More than 352 [[thermochemistry|thermochemical]] cycles have been described for water splitting or [[thermolysis]].,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review06/pd_10_weimer.pdf 353 Thermochemical cycles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://shgr.unlv.edu/stchNew/source/login.asp UNLV Thermochemical cycle automated scoring database (public)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cycles promise to produce hydrogen  oxygen from water and heat without using electricity.&lt;ref name="Developmentof"&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review05/pd28_weimer.pdf Development of solar-powered thermochemical production of hydrogen from water]&lt;/ref&gt; Since all the input energy for such processes is heat, they can be more efficient than high-temperature electrolysis. This is because the efficiency of electricity production is inherently limited. Thermochemical production of hydrogen using chemical energy from coal or natural gas is generally not considered, because the direct chemical path is more efficient.

For all the thermochemical processes, the summary reaction is that of the decomposition of water:
:&lt;chem&gt; 2H2O &lt;=&gt;[\stackrel{}\ce{Heat}] {2H2} + O2&lt;/chem&gt;
All other reagents are recycled. None of the thermochemical hydrogen production processes have been demonstrated at production levels, although several have been demonstrated in laboratories.

There is also research into the viability of nanoparticles and catalysts to lower the temperature at which water splits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoptek.com/ Naoptek]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/07/hydrogen-production-breakthrough-from-mit-a-giant-leap.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently [[Metal-Organic Framework]] (MOF)-based materials have been shown to be a highly promising candidate for water splitting with cheap, first row transition metals.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Das | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201301327/abstract | journal = Angew.
