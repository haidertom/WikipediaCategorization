'''20Q''' is a computerized game of [[twenty questions]] that began as a test in [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).  It was invented by Robin Burgener in 1988.&lt;ref name=goddard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burgener |first1=Robin |title=Engineering Colloqium: 20Q The Neural Network Mind Reader |url=http://ecolloq.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/2006-Spring/announce.burgener.html |publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216091945/http://ecolloq.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/2006-Spring/announce.burgener.html |archivedate=2013-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was made handheld by [[Radica]] in 2004, but was discontinued in 2011 because [[Techno Source]] took the license for 20Q handheld devices.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The game 20Q is based on the [[Twenty Questions|spoken parlor game]] known as twenty questions, and is both a website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20q.net/ Official 20Q Website]&lt;/ref&gt; and a handheld device. 20Q asks the player to think of something and will then try to guess what they are thinking of with twenty yes-or-no questions. If it fails to guess in 20 questions, it will ask an additional 5 questions. If it fails to guess even with 25 (or 30) questions, the player is declared the winner. Sometimes the first guess of the object can be asked at question 14.

==Principle and history==
The principle is that the player thinks of something and the 20Q artificial intelligence asks a series of  questions before guessing what the player is thinking. This artificial intelligence learns on its own with the information relayed back to the players who interact with it, and is not programmed. The player can answer these questions with: ''Yes'', ''No'', ''Unknown'', and ''Sometimes.'' The experiment is based on the classic word game of Twenty Questions, and on the computer game "Animals," popular in the early 1970s, which used a somewhat simpler method to guess an animal.&lt;ref&gt;with information from: LiCalzi O'Connell, Pamela. "Vegetables And Minerals On The Radar" The New York Times. March 27, 2003; Burgener, Robin, computer architect, inventor.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20Q AI uses an [[artificial neural network]] to pick the questions and to guess.&lt;ref name=goddard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stage.20q.net/flat/rbqanda.html Official 20Q Q&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt; After the player has answered the twenty questions posed (sometimes fewer), 20Q makes a guess. If it is incorrect, it asks more questions, then guesses again. It makes guesses based on what it has learned; it is not programmed with information or what the inventor thinks. Answers to any question are based on players’ interpretations of the questions asked. Newer editions were made for different categories, such as music 20Q which has the player think of a song, and Harry Potter 20Q, which has the player think of something from the world of the [[Harry Potter]] series.

The 20Q AI can draw its own conclusions on how to interpret the information. It can be described as more of a [[folk taxonomy]] than a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]. Its knowledge develops with every game played. In this regard, the online version of the 20Q AI can be inaccurate because it gathers its answers from what people ''think'' rather than from what people ''know''. Limitations of taxonomy are often overcome by the AI itself because it can learn and adapt. For example, if the player was thinking of a "Horse" and answered "No" to the question "Is it an animal?," the AI will, nevertheless, guess correctly, despite being told that a horse is not an animal.

Patent applications in the US and Europe were submitted in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|102,105|application}} [http://www.google.com/patents?id=W5iZAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=Artificial+neural+network+guessing+method+and+game] and {{Cite patent|EP|1710735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, 20Q.net Inc., with Brashworks Studios, developed and released an iOS iPad version available at the Apple ITunes store.

==Handheld device==
The built Artificial Neural Network is not resource intensive either to store or to compute, thus it could be embedded in small, less powerful devices. Currently, there is a [[handheld console|handheld]] version of the AI. The device contains a small portion of the original 20Q website knowledge base; unlike the online versions of the game, the handheld version does not have the ability to learn.

The 20Q artificial intelligence is different from less flexible, and extremely large, expert systems. Its modularity, adaptability, and scalability means that it can be applied to other, more complex devices, for more complex uses.

==Game show==
{{main|20Q (game show)}}
On June 13, 2009, [[Game Show Network|GSN]] began a TV version of the game, hosted by [[Cat Deeley]], with [[Hal Sparks]] as the voice of the computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3650">[[File:Hunter Museum Label.jpg|thumb|Every object in galleries has a label where you'll find that object's accession number. ]]
In [[library|libraries]], [[art gallery|art galleries]], [[museum]]s and [[archive]]s, an '''accession number''' is a unique identifier assigned to, and achieving initial control of, each acquisition. Assignment of accession numbers typically occurs at the point of accessioning or cataloging.  The term is something of a misnomer, because the form accession numbers take is often alpha-numeric.&lt;ref name="Witt"&gt;Witt, B.S., Whittfield, J.C., Stepansky, A.J. (2012) ''Pastperfect software for museum collections: Version 5 users guide.'' Retrieved from http://museumsoftware.com/v5userguide.html&lt;/ref&gt;

If an item is removed from the collection, its number is usually not reused for new items.

In libraries, this numbering system is usually in addition to the [[library classification]] number (or alphanumeric code) and to the [[ISBN]] or International Standard Book Number assigned by [[publisher]]s.

Accession numbers are also used in [[botany]], by institutions with living collections like [[arboretum|arboreta]], [[botanic garden]]s, etc., to identify plants or groups of plants that are of the same [[taxon]], are of the same [[Propagule|propagule type]] (or treatment), were received from the same source, were received at the same time.&lt;ref name="Glasnevin"&gt;Jebb, Matthew (1998) ''Cataloguing and Record keeping for Plant Collections'' Retrieved from http://www.botanicgardens.ie/educ/accnosho.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbarium|Herbaria]] and other botanic institutions collecting non living material also use accession numbers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

An accession number may include the year acquired, sometimes the full date (as at the [[British Museum]]), and a sequential number separated by a period.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt; In addition, departments or art classifications within the collection or museum may reserve sections of numbers. For example, objects identified by the numbers 11.000 through 11.999 may indicate objects obtained by the museum in 1911; the first 300 numbers might be used to indicate American art, while the next fifty (11.301–350) might be used for [[African art]]. In some cases, they also include letters and other punctuation, such as commas, hyphens or slashes.&lt;ref&gt;Reitz, J.M. (2004) ''Dictionary for library and information science.'' Libraries Unlimited. p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt;

In older institutions, simpler numbering systems are sometimes maintained alongside, or incorporated within, newer systems.  Where the objects are unique, institutions normally need to retain the original number in some form as it will have been used in old references that are still of use in scholarship.  In particular, collections of [[manuscripts]] use the prefix "MS", and many well known manuscripts are known by their old MS numbers, often incorporating a prefix for a particular collection within a library.  These collections may be divided by former owners, as with several [[British Library]] [[:Category:British Library collections|"closed" collections]], or by language, as with [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF MS Fr. 2643-6)]], indicating a two volume manuscript in French at the {{lang|fr|[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]}}.

'''Aldo Leopold''' (January 11, 1887 – April 21, 1948) was an American author, philosopher, scientist, ecologist, forester, conservationist, and environmentalist. He was a professor at the [[University of Wisconsin]] and is best known for his book ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949), which has sold more than two million copies.

Leopold was influential in the development of modern [[environmental ethics]] and in the movement for wilderness conservation. His ethics of nature and wildlife preservation had a profound impact on the environmental movement, with his ecocentric or holistic ethics regarding land.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip F. Cramer, ''Deep Environmental Politics: The Role of Radical Environmentalism in Crafting American Environmental Policy'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized biodiversity and ecology and was a founder of the science of [[wildlife management]].&lt;ref&gt;Errington, pp. 341–350&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rand Aldo Leopold was born in [[Burlington, Iowa]], on January 11, 1887. His father, Carl Leopold, was a businessman who made walnut desks and was first cousin to his wife, Clara Starker. Charles Starker, father of Clara and uncle of Carl, was a German immigrant, educated in engineering and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hansen. "[http://www.leopoldheritage.org/index.php/leopold-s-legacy/hansen-column Bringing up Aldo]". Leopold Heritage Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand Aldo was named after two of his father's business partners—C. W. Rand and Aldo Sommers—although he eventually dropped the use of "Rand". The Leopold family included younger siblings Mary Luize, Carl Starker, and Frederic.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold's first language was German,&lt;ref&gt;Meine, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; although he mastered English at an early age.

Aldo Leopold's early life was highlighted by the outdoors. Carl would take his children on excursions into the woods and taught his oldest son woodcraft and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Meine, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Aldo showed an aptitude for observation, spending hours counting and cataloging birds near his home.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Mary would later say of her older brother, "He was very much an outdoorsman, even in his extreme youth. He was always out climbing around the bluffs, or going down to the river, or going across the river into the woods."&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Prospect Hill Elementary, where he ranked at the top of his class, and then, the overcrowded Burlington High School. Every August, the family vacationed in Michigan at the forested [[Les Cheneaux Islands]] in [[Lake Huron]], which the children took to exploring.&lt;ref&gt;Meine, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schooling==
[[File:Aldo Leopold Sheffield Scientific School Class of 1908.jpg|thumb|left|Leopold's entry in the [[Yale]] [[Sheffield Scientific School]] yearbook, 1908]]

In 1900, [[Gifford Pinchot]], who oversaw the newly implemented Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture, donated money to [[Yale University]] to begin one of the nation's first forestry schools. Hearing of this development, the teenaged Leopold decided on forestry as a vocation.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; His parents agreed to let him attend [[The Lawrenceville School]], a preparatory college in New Jersey, to improve his chances of admission to Yale. The Burlington High School principal wrote in a reference letter to the headmaster at Lawrenceville that Leopold was "as earnest a boy as we have in school... painstaking in his work.... Moral character above reproach."&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived at his new school in January 1904, shortly before he turned 17. He was considered an attentive student, although he was again drawn to the outdoors. Lawrenceville was suitably rural, and Leopold spent much time mapping the area and studying its wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;Meine, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold studied at the Lawrenceville School for a year, during which time he was accepted to Yale. Because the [[Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies|Yale School of Forestry]] granted only graduate degrees, he first enrolled in [[Sheffield Scientific School]]'s preparatory forestry courses for his undergraduate studies.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; While Leopold was able to explore the woods and fields of Lawrenceville daily, sometimes to the detriment of his studying, at Yale he had little opportunity to do so; his studies and social life engagements made his outdoor trips few and far between.&lt;ref&gt;Meine, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1909, Leopold was assigned to the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]]'s District 3 in the Arizona and New Mexico territories. At first, he was a forest assistant at the Apache National Forest in the Arizona Territory. In 1911, he was transferred to the Carson National Forest in northern New Mexico. Leopold's career, which kept him in New Mexico until 1924, included developing the first comprehensive management plan for the [[Grand Canyon]], writing the Forest Service's first game and fish handbook, and proposing [[Gila Wilderness|Gila Wilderness Area]], the first national wilderness area in the Forest Service system.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;Meine&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 1923, he was elected an associate member (now called "professional member") of the [[Boone and Crockett Club]], a wildlife conservation organization founded by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[George Bird Grinnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boone and Crockett Club Archives|url=http://cdm16013.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p16013coll13/id/125/rec/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, he accepted transfer to the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin, and became an associate director.

In 1933, he was appointed Professor of Game Management in the Agricultural Economics Department at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], the first such professorship of wildlife management.

[[File:Aldo Leopold's headstone.jpeg|thumb|Leopold's headstone at his family plot in Aspen Grove Cemetery in [[Burlington, Iowa]]]]

He married Estella Bergere in northern New Mexico in 1912 and they had five children together.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold Family. "[https://www.aldoleopold.org/about/aldo-leopold/leopold-family/ Leopold Family]". The Aldo Leopold Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; They lived in a modest two-story home close to the UW–Madison campus. His children followed in his footsteps as teachers and naturalists: [[A. Starker Leopold|Aldo Starker Leopold]] (1913–1983) was a wildlife biologist and professor at UC Berkeley;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raitt, RJ|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v101n04/p0868-p0871.pdf |title=In Memoriam: A.

Leopold]] (1915–2006) became a [[hydrology|hydrologist]] and geology professor at UC Berkeley; [[Nina Leopold Bradley]] (1917–2011) was a researcher and naturalist; [[A. Carl Leopold|Aldo Carl Leopold]] (1919–2009) was a plant physiologist,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Staves and [[Randy Wayne (biologist)|Randy Wayne]]. (December 3, 2009.) "[http://www.lansingstar.com/content/view/5628/71/#ixzz0ZaZuYZGo In Memoriam: A. Carl Leopold]". ''The Lansing Star''. Retrieved on February 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; who taught at Purdue University for 25 years; and daughter [[Estella Leopold]] (b. 1927) is  a noted botanist and conservationist who is a professor ''emeritus'' at the University of Washington. Today, Leopold's home is an official landmark of the city of Madison.

He purchased 80 acres in the [[Central Plain (Wisconsin)|sand country]] of central Wisconsin. The once-forested region had been logged, swept by repeated fires, overgrazed by dairy cows, and left barren. There, he put his theories to work in the field and eventually wrote his best-selling ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949), finished just prior to his death. Leopold died of a heart attack while battling a wild fire on a neighbor's property.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==
Early on, Leopold was assigned to hunt and kill bears, wolves, and mountain lions in New Mexico. Local ranchers hated these predators because of livestock losses, but Leopold came to respect the animals. He developed an ecological ethic that replaced the earlier wilderness ethic that stressed the need for human dominance. His rethinking the importance of predators in the balance of nature has resulted in the return of bears and mountain lions to New Mexico wilderness areas.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

By the early 1920s, Leopold had concluded that a particular kind of preservation should be embraced in the national forests of the American West. He was prompted to this by the rampant building of roads to accommodate the "proliferation of the automobile" and the related increasingly heavy recreational demands placed on public lands. He was the first to employ the term "wilderness" to describe such preservation. Over the next two decades, he added ethical and scientific rationales to his defense of the wilderness concept. In one essay, he rhetorically asked, "Of what avail are forty freedoms without a blank spot on the map?" Leopold saw a progress of ethical sensitivity from interpersonal relationships, to relationships to society as a whole, to relationships with the land, leading to a steady diminution of actions based on expediency, conquest, and self-interest. Leopold thus rejected the utilitarianism of conservationists such as [[Theodore Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

By the 1930s, Leopold was the nation's foremost expert on wildlife management.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} He advocated the scientific management of wildlife habitats by both public and private landholders rather than a reliance on game refuges, hunting laws, and other methods intended to protect specific species of desired game. In his 1933 book ''Game Management'', Leopold defined the science of wildlife management as "the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use." But, as Curt Meine&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt; has pointed out, he also considered it to be a technique for restoring and maintaining diversity in the environment.

The concept of "wilderness" also took on a new meaning; Leopold no longer saw it as a hunting or recreational ground, but as an arena for a healthy biotic community, including wolves and mountain lions. In 1935, he helped found the [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]], dedicated to expanding and protecting the nation's wilderness areas. He regarded the society as "one of the focal points of a new attitude—an intelligent humility toward Man's place in nature."&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Flader, ''Thinking Like a Mountain: Aldo Leopold and the Evolution of an Ecological Attitude toward Deer, Wolves and Forests''. Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 1974, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Science writer Connie Barlow says Leopold wrote eloquently from a perspective that today would be called [[Religious Naturalism]].

==Nature writing==
Leopold's [[Nature Writing|nature writing]] is notable for its simple directness. His portrayals of various natural environments through which he had moved, or had known for many years, displayed impressive intimacy with what exists and happens in nature. He offered frank criticism of the harm he believed was frequently done to natural systems (such as land) out of a sense of a culture or society's sovereign ownership over the land base – eclipsing any sense of a community of life to which humans belong. He felt the security and prosperity resulting from "mechanization" now gives people the time to reflect on the preciousness of nature and to learn more about what happens there; however, he also wrote, "Theoretically, the mechanization of farming ought to cut the farmer's chains, but whether it really does is debatable."&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. ''A Sand County Almanac'' (1970 ed.) p. 262)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A Sand County Almanac''===
The book was published in 1949, shortly after Leopold's death. One of the well-known quotes from the book which clarifies his [[land ethic]] is,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the [[biotic community]]. It is wrong when it tends otherwise. (p.262) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of a [[trophic cascade]] is put forth in the chapter, "[[Thinking like a mountain|Thinking Like a Mountain]]", wherein Leopold realizes that killing a predator wolf carries serious implications for the rest of the ecosystem&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo [http://www.eco-action.org/dt/thinking.html "Thinking Like a Mountain"]&lt;/ref&gt; — a conclusion that found sympathetic appreciation generations later:

{{quote|In January 1995 I helped carry the first grey wolf into Yellowstone, where they had been eradicated by federal predator control policy only six decades earlier. Looking through the crates into her eyes, I reflected on how Aldo Leopold once took part in that policy, then eloquently challenged it. By illuminating for us how wolves play a critical role in the whole of creation, he expressed the ethic and the laws which would reintroduce them nearly a half-century after his death.|[[Bruce Babbitt]], former [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, quote on back cover&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===[[Land ethic|Land Ethic]]===
In "The Land Ethic", a chapter in ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'', Leopold delves into conservation in "The Ecological Conscience" section. He wrote: "Conservation is a state of harmony between men and land." He noted that conservation guidelines at the time boiled down to: "obey the law, vote right, join some organizations, and practice what conservation is profitable on your own land; the government will do the rest." (p.&amp;nbsp;243–244)

Leopold explained:

{{quote|The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land.

This sounds simple: do we not already sing our love for and obligation to the land of the free and the home of the brave? Yes, but just what and whom do we love? Certainly not the soil, which we are sending helter-skelter down river. Certainly not the waters, which we assume have no function except to turn turbines, float barges, and carry off sewage. Certainly not the plants, of which we exterminate whole communities without batting an eye. Certainly not the animals, of which we have already extirpated many of the largest and most beautiful species. A land ethic of course cannot prevent the alteration, management, and use of these ‘resources,’ but it does affirm their right to continued existence, and, at least in spots, their continued existence in a natural state. In short, a land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such.}}

== Legacy ==
The Aldo Leopold Foundation of [[Baraboo, Wisconsin]], was founded in 1982 by Aldo and Estella Leopold's five children as a 501(c)3 not-for-profit conservation organization whose mission is "to foster the land ethic through the legacy of Aldo Leopold." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aldoleopold.org/about/mission-vision/ Mission / Vision]&lt;/ref&gt; The Aldo Leopold Foundation owns and manages the original [[Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm]] and 300 surrounding acres, in addition to several other parcels. Its headquarters is at the green-built Leopold Center, where it conducts educational and land stewardship programs. The foundation also acts as the executor of Leopold's literary estate, encourages scholarship on Leopold, and serves as a clearinghouse for information regarding Leopold, his work, and his ideas. It provides interpretive resources and tours for thousands of visitors annually, distributes a curriculum about how to use Leopold's writing and [[land ethic|ideas]] in environmental education,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aldoleopold.org/teach-learn/leopold-education-project/ Leopold Education Project]&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains a robust website and numerous print resources. In 2012, in collaboration with the [[United States Forest Service]], the foundation released the first high-definition, full-length film about Leopold, entitled ''Green Fire: Aldo Leopold and a Land Ethic for Our Time.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aldoleopold.org/greenfire/index.shtml|title=Green Fire Film |publisher=The Aldo Leopold Foundation|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film aired on public television stations across the nation and won a Midwest regional Emmy award in the documentary category.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aldoleopold.org/teach-learn/green-fire-film/about-green-fire/ About Green Fire]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute at University of Montana Missoula 20130725.JPG|thumb|Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute]]
The [[Aldo Leopold Wilderness]] in New Mexico's [[Gila National Forest]] was named after him in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&amp;sec=wildView&amp;wid=4&amp;tab=General&amp;CFID=5163954&amp;CFTOKEN=93201038 Aldo Leopold Wilderness], Wilderness.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture was established in 1987 at [[Iowa State University]] in Ames. It was named in honor of Leopold. Since its founding, it has pioneered new forms of sustainable agriculture practices.

The [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] established the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute at the [[University of Montana|University of Montana, Missoula]] in 1993. It is "the only Federal research group in the United States dedicated to the development and dissemination of knowledge needed to improve management of [[wilderness]], [[park]]s, and similarly [[protected area]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leopold.wilderness.net/about-us/default.php |title=About Us |publisher=Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute |accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">In [[physiology]], '''aldosterone escape''' is a term that has been used to refer to two distinct phenomena involving [[aldosterone]] that are exactly opposite each other: 
#Escape from the [[sodium]]-retaining effects of excess aldosterone (or other [[mineralocorticoid]]s) in [[primary hyperaldosteronism]], manifested by volume and/or pressure [[natriuresis]].&lt;ref name=prakash&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prakash ES |title="Aldosterone escape" or refractory hyperaldosteronism? |journal=MedGenMed |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=25 |year=2005 |pmid=16369251 |pmc=1681639 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The inability of [[ACE inhibitor]] therapy to reliably suppress aldosterone release, for example, in patients with [[heart failure]] or [[diabetes]], usually manifested by increased salt and water retention. This latter sense may rather be termed [[refractory hyperaldosteronism]].&lt;ref name=prakash/&gt;

In patients with hyperaldosteronism, chronic exposure to excess aldosterone does not cause edema as might be expected.  Aldosterone initially results in an increase in Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reabsorption in these patients through stimulation of [[ENaC]] channels in principal cells of the renal collecting tubules. Increased ENaC channels situated in the apical membranes of the principal cells allow for more Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reabsorption, which may cause a transient increase in fluid reabsorption as well. However, within a few days, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reabsorption returns to normal as evidenced by normal urinary Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels in these patients.

The proposed mechanism for this phenomenon does not include a reduced sensitivity of mineralocorticoid receptors to aldosterone, because low serum potassium is often seen in these patients, which is the direct result of aldosterone-induced expression of ENaC channels. Furthermore, electrolyte homeostasis is maintained in these patients, which excludes the possibility that other Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transporters elsewhere in the kidney are being shut down. If, in fact, other transporters such as the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporter in the proximal tubule or the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/2Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; symporter in the thick ascending loop of Henle were being blocked, other electrolyte disturbances would be expected, such as seen during use of diuretics.

Instead, experiments isolating the perfusion pressures seen by glomerular capillaries from heightened systemic pressures due to hyperaldosteronism have shown that Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; excretion remains minimal until the kidney is exposed to heightened perfusion pressures. These experiments brought about the proposition that initially high perfusion pressures due to increased Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water reabsorption in a hyperaldosterone state actually causes "backflow" of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water into the tubules.

Normally Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water are reabsorbed from the tubules and dumped into the interstitium. From there, Starling forces dictate the gradient for movement of water and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the peritubular capillaries. Because hydrostatic pressures in the tubules, interstitium and peritubular capillaries are normally equivalent, oncotic pressures govern flow.

Typically, oncotic pressures are higher in the peritubular capillaries, because protein composition in the interstitium is nominal; therefore, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water leave the interstitial space and enter the capillaries. When hydrostatic pressures are raised in the peritubular capillaries such as seen in hyperaldosteronism, Starling forces begin to favor "backflow" of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water from the interstitium into the tubules—thus, increasing Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; excretion. This is the proposed mechanism of "mineralocorticoid escape" for how patients with increased levels of aldosterone are able to maintain Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance and avoid an edematous state.

'''Aquacultural engineering''' is a multidisciplinary field of [[engineering]] that aims to solve technical problems associated with farming aquatic [[vertebrates]], [[invertebrates]], and [[algae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Wheaton|title=Aquacultural Engineering|edition= |publisher=Kreiger Pub Co|year=1933 |page= |isbn= 978-0-8946-4786-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common aquaculture systems requiring optimization and engineering include sea cages, [[ponds]], and recirculating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Odd-Ivar Lekang|title=Aquaculture Engineering|edition= 2nd |publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons|year=2013|page=165 |isbn=978-0-470-67085-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and management of these systems is based on their production goals and the economics of the farming operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colt |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |month= |title=The Role of Engineering Disciplines in Aquaculture|url= |journal=iChemE Symposium Series No. 111 |issn= |volume= |issue= |pages=1–17 |id=|accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquaculture technology is varied with design and development requiring knowledge of mechanical, biological and environmental systems along with [[material engineering]] and [[instrumentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas B. Lawson|title=Fundamentals of Aquaculture Engineering|edition= |publisher=Springer US|year=1995|page= |isbn=978-1-4615-7049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, engineering techniques often involve solutions borrowed from [[wastewater treatment]], fisheries, and traditional agriculture.

Aquacultural engineering has played a role in the expansion of the aquaculture industry, which now accounts for half of all [[seafood products]] consumed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5555e.pdf|title=2016 The State of the Worlds Fisheries and Aquaculture|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Food and Agriculture Organization|publisher=United Nations|location=Rome, Italy|page=77|isbn=978-92-5-109185-2|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify effective solutions the discipline is combined with both fish physiology and business economics knowledge.

==Recirculating aquaculture systems==
[[Recirculating aquaculture systems]] often involve intensive, high-density culture of a species with limited water usage and extensive filtration. In a typical recirculating aquaculture system, a series of filtration steps maintains a high level of water quality that promotes rapid fish growth.&lt;ref name="Timmons"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Timmons and James B. Ebeling|title=Recirculating Aquaculture|edition= 3rd |publisher=Ithaca Publishing Company Publishers|year=2013|page=3 |isbn=978-0971264656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steps include solids removal, biofiltration, oxygenation, and pumping, with each one requiring different equipment and engineering considerations. Comprehensive instrumentation and sensor controls are required to monitor this equipment and the underlying water conditions such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH. Development of recirculating aquaculture systems is still underway in 2017, and engineering advances are needed to make the systems economically viable for culturing most species.

==Research==
The ''Journal of Aquacultural Engineering'' publishes engineers' studies related to the design and development of aquacultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |month= |title=Aims &amp; Scope|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/405852/description#description|trans_title= |journal=Aquacultural Engineering |issn= 0144-8609|volume= |issue= |pages= |id=|accessdate=2009-08-23 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, universities provide aquacultural engineering education often under the umbrella of agricultural or biological engineering.

[[File:Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein - Goethe in the Roman Campagna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein]], ''[[Goethe in the Roman Campagna]]'', 1787, portrait of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], German artist known for his works of poetry, drama, prose, philosophy, visual arts, and science.]]
An '''artist''' is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the [[arts]], or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday [[speech]] and academic [[discourse]] is a practitioner in the [[visual art]]s only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a [[business]] context, for [[musician|musicians]] and other performers (less often for actors). "Artiste" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.

==Dictionary definitions==
Wiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows:
# A person who creates art.
# A person who makes and creates art as an [[wikt:occupation|occupation]].
# A person who is skilled at some activity.
# A person whose trade or profession requires a knowledge of design, drawing, painting, etc.
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the older broad meanings of the term "artist":

* A learned person or Master of Arts
* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally medicine, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[chemistry]]
* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice
* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic
* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art
* One who cultivates one of the [[fine arts]] – traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]]

==History of the term==
The Greek word "techně", often translated as "art," implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, "technicus",&lt;ref&gt;
[[Oxford English Dictionary]] s.v. ''technic''
&lt;/ref&gt;
became the source of the English words [[wikt:technique|technique]], technology, [[wikt:technical|technical]].

In Greek culture each of the nine [[Muse]]s oversaw a different field of human creation:
* [[Calliope]] (the 'beautiful of speech'): chief of the muses and muse of [[epic poetry|epic or heroic poetry]]
* [[Clio]] (the 'glorious one'): muse of history
* [[Erato]] (the 'amorous one'): muse of [[love poetry|love or erotic poetry]], lyrics, and marriage songs
* [[Euterpe]] (the 'well-pleasing'): muse of music and [[lyric poetry]]
* [[Melpomene]] (the 'chanting one'): muse of [[tragedy]]
* [[Polyhymnia]] or Polymnia (the '[singer] of many [[hymn]]s'): muse of [[sacred|sacred song]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[Lyrics|lyric]], singing, and [[rhetoric]]
* [[Terpsichore]] (the '[one who] delights in dance'): muse of [[choral]] song and dance
* [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] (the 'blossoming one'): muse of comedy and [[bucolic poetry]]
* [[Urania]] (the 'celestial one'): muse of [[astronomy]]

No muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.&lt;ref&gt;
''In Our Time: The Artist'' [[BBC Radio 4]], TX 28 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''art'' derives from the Latin "ars" (stem ''art-''), which, although literally defined, means "skill method" or "technique", and conveys a connotation of beauty.

During the Middle Ages the word ''artist'' already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling ''craftsman'', while the word ''artesan'' was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some "artisanal" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.

The first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472): ''[[De re aedificatoria]], De statua, De pictura'', which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a [[project]] behind).&lt;ref&gt;
P.Galloni, ''Il sacro artefice. Mitologie degli artigiani medievali'', Laterza, [[Bari]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Academy|Academies]] in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.

Many contemporary definitions of "artist" and "art" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into [[kitsch]].

==The present day concept of an 'artist'==
''Artist'' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as "a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.

Most often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '[[high culture]]', activities such as drawing, painting, [[sculpture]], acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, [[New media art|new media]], photography, and music—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic|critics]] define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] include [[artisan]], [[Master craftsman|craftsman]], and specialized terms such as [[pottery|potter]], [[goldsmith]] or [[glassblower]]. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the [[Renaissance]] in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.

The term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-"art" activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.

Often, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among "artist" and "[[technician]]", "entertainer" and "[[artisan]]", "[[fine arts|fine art]]" and "[[applied art]]", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word ''artiste'' (which in French, simply means "artist") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in [[Music Hall]] or [[Vaudeville]]). Use of the word "artiste" can also be a [[pejorative]] term.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth G. Wilson. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=artist++uncomplimentary+%22artiste%22&amp;source=web&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result The Columbia guide to standard American English].&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.

In ''Living with Art'', Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Getlein |first=Mark |date=2012 |title=Living with Art |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0-07-337925-8 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Create places for some human purpose.
#Create extraordinary versions of ordinary objects.
#Record and commemorate.
#Give tangible form to the unknown.
#Give tangible form to feelings.
#Refresh our vision and help see the world in new ways.

After looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies &amp; program outcomes regarding artists, arts, &amp; culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between "arts for art's sake" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that "this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down" (Eikhof &amp; Haunschild, 2007). Lingo and Tepper point out:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's The Invention of Art: A Cultural History |url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519 |website=www.contempaesthetics.org |accessdate=2015-07-23 |date=21 December 2008 |publisher= |authorlink= |first=David |last=Clowney}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#arts ''consumers'' don't restrict themselves to either "high" or "common" arts; instead, they demonstrate "omnivorous tastes, liking both reggae and Rachmaninoff" (Peterson &amp; Kern, 1996; Walker &amp; Scott-Melnyk, 2002)
#data indicates "artists are willing to move across sectors and no longer see working outside the commercial sector as a badge of distinction or authenticity" (Bridgstock, 2013; Ellmeier, 2003)
#academic, policy, and government leaders are adapting—widening—programs &amp; opportunities in recognition of "the role of artists as drivers of economic growth and innovation" (Bohm &amp; Land, 2009; DCMS, 2006, 2008; Florida, 2012; Hesmondhalgh &amp; Baker, 2010; Lloyd, 2010; Iyengar, 2013).
#arts graduates name "business and management skills" as the "number one area [they] wish they had been more exposed to in college" (Strategic National Arts Alumni Project [SNAAP], 2011; Tepper &amp; Kuh, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=concept of artist |url=http://www.goines.net/Writing/what_is_artist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and employment ==
The [[US Bureau of Labor Statistics]] classifies many visual artists as either ''craft artists'' or ''fine artists''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/craft-and-fine-artists.htm|title=Craft and Fine Artists|last=|first=|date=17 December 2015|website=|series=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-21|edition=2016–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A craft artist makes handmade functional works of art, such as pottery or clothing.  A fine artist makes paintings, illustrations (such as [[book illustration]]s or [[medical illustration]]s), sculptures, or similar artistic works primarily for their aesthetic value.

The main source of skill for both craft artists and fine artists is long-term repetition and practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many fine artists have studied their art form at university and some have a master's degree in fine arts.  Artists may also study on their own or receive on-the-job training from an experienced artist.

The number of available jobs as an artist is increasing more slowly than other fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  About half of US artists are self-employed.  Others work in a variety of industries.  For example, a pottery manufacturer will employ craft artists, and book publishers will hire illustrators.

In the US, fine artists have a median income of approximately US $50,000 per year, and craft artists have a median income of approximately US $33,000 per year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This compares to US $61,000 for all art-related fields, including related jobs such as [[graphic designer]]s, [[multimedia artist]]s, [[animator]]s, and [[fashion designers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many artists work part-time as artists and hold a second job.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Authenticity in art''' is the different ways in which a [[work of art]] or an artistic performance may be considered authentic.{{sfn|Davies|Higgins|Hopkins|2009|pp=156}}
[[Denis Dutton]] distinguishes between ''nominal authenticity'' and ''expressive authenticity''.
The first refers to the correct identification of the author of a work of art, to how closely a performance of a play or piece of music conforms to the author's intention, or to how closely a work of art conforms to an artistic tradition.
The second sense refers to how much the work possesses original or inherent authority, how much sincerity, genuineness of expression, and moral passion the artist or performer puts into the work.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

A quite different concern is the authenticity of the experience, which may be impossible to achieve. A modern visitor to a museum may not only see an object in a very different context from that which the artist intended, but may be unable to understand important aspects of the work. The authentic experience may be impossible to recapture.{{sfn|Phillips|1997|pp=1-4}}

Authenticity is a requirement for inscription upon the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]].{{sfn|UNESCO|2011|pp=21f}} According to the ''Nara Document on Authenticity'', it can be expressed through 'form and design; materials and substance; use and function; traditions and techniques; location and setting; spirit and feeling; and other internal and external factors.'{{sfn|Larsen 1995}}{{sfn|Larsen 1994}}

==Authenticity of provenance==
Authenticity of provenance means that the origin or authorship of a work of art has been correctly identified.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=78}}
As [[Lionel Trilling]] points out in his 1972 book ''Sincerity and Authenticity'', the question of authenticity of provenance has acquired a profoundly moral dimension. Regardless of the appearance of the object or the quality of workmanship, there is great importance in knowing whether a vase is a genuine [[Ming vase]] or just a clever [[Art forgery|forgery]].{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=9}}
This intense interest in authenticity is relatively recent and is largely confined to the western world. In the medieval period, and in countries such as modern Thailand, there was or is little interest in the identity of the artist.{{sfn|Abbing|2002|pp=110}}

The case of [[Han van Meegeren]] is well known. After failing to succeed as an artist in his own right, he turned to creating fake [[Vermeer]] paintings. These were accepted as genuine by experts and acclaimed as masterpieces. After being arrested for selling national treasures to the Germans, he caused a sensation when he publicly demonstrated that he was the artist.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=85}}
To guard against forgeries like this, a [[certificate of authenticity]] may be used to prove that a work of art is authentic, but there is a sizable market in fake certificates.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=87}}
Furthermore a combination of art historical, conservational and technical evidence can be used to authenticate a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://authenticationinart.org/|title=Authentication in Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The financial importance of authenticity may bias collectors to acquiring recent works of art where provenance can more easily be proven, perhaps even by a statement from the artist.{{sfn|McAndrew|2010|pp=56}}
For older works, an increasingly sophisticated array of forensic techniques may be deployed to establish authenticity of provenance.{{sfn|Fleming|1975|pp=567}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2017/11/leonardo-da-vinci-salvator-mundi-goes-to-auction-at-christies/|title=Christie’s da Vinci Auction Reveals Why Forgers Love to Fake Masters|date=2017-11-15|work=Observer|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] discusses at length the question raised by [[Aline B. Saarinen]]: "If a fake is so expert that even after the most thorough and trustworthy examination its authenticity is still open to doubt, is it or is it not as satisfactory a work of art as if it were unequivocally genuine?" Goodman concludes that the question is academic, since there must be some way to distinguish a forgery from the original, and once the forgery is known for what it is, that knowledge alters the perception of value.{{sfn|Goodman|1976|pp=99}}
However, [[Arthur Koestler]] in ''[[The Act of Creation]]'' answers that if a forgery fits into an artist's body of work and produces the same kind of aesthetic pleasure as other works by that artist, there is no reason to exclude it from a museum.{{sfn|Koestler|1964|pp=400ff}}

The question of the value of a forgery may be irrelevant to a curator, since they are concerned only with the provenance of the work and not with its artistic merit.{{sfn|Goodman|1976|pp=119}}
Even for the curator, in many cases provenance is a matter of probabilities rather than a certainty - absolute proof is not possible.{{sfn|McGowan|2000|pp=230}}
But once a forgery has been exposed, no matter how highly the work was praised when it was thought to be "authentic" there is rarely any interest in evaluating the work on its own merit.{{sfn|Schefold|2002}}
[[File:Josquin des Prez.jpg|thumb|right|Facsimile of a 1611 [[woodcut]] of the composer [[Josquin des Prez]], copied from a now-lost oil painting done during his lifetime{{sfn|Macey|2010}}]]

Reproduction is inherent to some forms of art. In Medieval Europe, an artist might create a drawing which was used by another craftsman to create a [[woodcut]] block. The drawing was usually destroyed in the block-cutting process, and the block was thrown away when it became worn out. The copies printed from the block are all that remain of the work.{{sfn|Hind|1935|pp=88ff}}
In a 1936 essay, [[Walter Benjamin]] discussed the new media of photography and film, in which the work of art can be reproduced many times with no one version being the authentic "original". He linked this shift from authentic objects to broadly accessible mass media with a transformation in the function of art from ritual to politics.{{sfn|Benjamin|1936}}
Modern art may raise new issues of authenticity of provenance. For example, the artist [[Duane Hanson]] instructed the conservators of his 1971 sculpture ''Sunbather'' to feel free to replace elements such as the bathing cap or swimsuit if they became faded.{{sfn|Spencer|2004|pp=129}}
As [[Julian H. Scaff]] points out, the computer and the internet further confuse the issue of authenticity of provenance, since a digital work of art may exist in thousands or millions of identical versions, and in variants where there is no way to determine the original version or even the author.{{sfn|Scaff}}

==Cultural authenticity==

Authenticity of provenance is concerned with identifying the person who made the work, or at least pinning down the place and time in which the work was made as closely as possible. Cultural authenticity, or authenticity of style or tradition, is concerned with whether a work is a genuine expression of an artistic tradition, even when the author may be anonymous. Interest in this form of authenticity may be associated with a romantic sense of the value of the pure, unadulterated tradition, often linked to nationalistic and possibly racist beliefs.{{sfn|Bendix|1997|pp=6ff}}

A work of art may be considered an authentic example of a traditional culture or genre when it conforms to the style, materials, process of creation and other essential attributes of that genre.
Many traditions are thought to be "owned" by an ethnic group, and work in that genre is only considered authentic if it is created by a member of that group. Thus [[Inuit art]] can only be considered authentic if created by an [[Inuit people|Inuit]]. This may help to protect the originators of an art tradition from [[cultural appropriation]], but there is a racist aspect to the view as described by Joel Rudinow in his essay ''Race, Ethnicity, Expressive Authenticity: Can White People Sing the Blues?''{{sfn|Coleman|2005|pp=31ff}}

The market for "[[primitive art]]" developed in the western world towards the end of the 19th century as explorers or colonialists came into contact with formerly unknown cultural groups in Africa, Asia and the Pacific. These people quickly learned how to incorporate new materials supplied by traders into their art, such as cloth and glass beads, but found that they could not sell these "inauthentic" objects. However, they learned how to manufacture works from local materials that would be considered authentic for sale to the westerners.{{sfn|Scharfstein|2009|pp=99-100}}
This process of creating art that will be considered authentic by western buyers continues to this day. The objects may be designed or modified to give the impression of having popular attributes and provenance, including religious or ritual uses, antiquity and association with royalty.{{sfn|Carrier|2005|pp=281}}
Similarly, in the 1940s [[Haiti]]an professional artists began to create imitations of images provided by foreign entrepreneurs. The images represented the foreigners' view of the essence of [[Haitian Vodou art]]. The Haitian works were later claimed to be authentic.{{sfn|Richman|2008|p=203}}

[[File:Ifugao sculpture Louvre 70-1999-4-1.jpg|thumb|[[Bulul]] guardian figure of the Ifugao people. Wood and sacrificial remains, northern Luzón Island (Philippines), 15th century.]]
To distinguish from crude objects made for the tourist trade, many collectors consider that a work is only an authentic example of a traditional genre if it meets certain standards of quality and was made for the original purpose. Dutton gives the example of the [[Igorot]] of northern [[Luzon]] who have long created figurines (''[[bulul]]'') for use in traditional ceremonies, but today produce them primarily for the tourist trade. An Igorot family may purchase a roughly carved ''bulul'' from a tourist booth and use it for traditional ceremonies, thus giving authenticity to the work that would not, perhaps, be present otherwise.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}
Although collectors place greater value on "tribal" masks or sculptures that have been used in an active ritual, it may be impossible to prove whether this is the case. Even if a video shows the mask being worn in a ritual dance, the dance may have been staged for tourists. Yet if the provenance of the mask is proven, if the mask was made by a member of the society using traditional designs and techniques, it is presumably an authentic example of the style or tradition.{{sfn|van der Grijp|2009|pp=317}}

It is not always clear what constitutes a style. For example, production of [[Zimbabwe]]an stone sculptures is relatively recent, dating to the 1950s. It does not draw on any earlier tradition. However, the sculpture plays an important role in establishing the existence of a uniquely Zimbabwean culture, and the authenticity of this style is strongly emphasized by the government of Zimbabwe despite the difficulty of defining its characteristics.{{sfn|Baaz|Palmberg|2001|pp=183ff}}
[[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[Sandpainting|sand paintings]] raise a different issue. The traditional paintings must be destroyed on completion of the ritual in which they are used. However, Navajo artists create sand paintings for sale with slightly modified designs. Can these paintings be considered authentic examples of Navajo art?{{sfn|Davies|Higgins|Hopkins|2009|pp=159}}

Traditions change. In an exploration of the evolution of the art of the [[Maroon people]] of [[French Guiana]], [[Sally Price]] shows that contemporary styles have developed through a complex interaction between artists and buyers. The Maroons have a long tradition of artwork, primarily in the form of decoration of everyday objects such as paddles or shutters. This art was purely aesthetic in purpose, with no symbolic meaning. However, European collectors needed to assign symbolism to "native art". Over time, the Maroon artists have come to accept the European [[semiotic]] vocabulary and to assign symbolism to their work, which younger artists may believe to be based on ancestral traditions. The artists have also moved into new media and new designs. Their art may still be considered authentic examples of Maroon art, but the art form and the meaning associated with it is new.{{sfn|Price|2007}}

==Authenticity of performance==

[[File:Diakonie-kantorei.jpg|thumb|An ensemble performing [[Baroque music]] with authentic instruments and techniques, but in modern dress and setting.]]
With performance arts such as music and theater, both the composer or playwright and the performers are involved in creating an instance of the work. There are some who consider that a performance is only truly authentic if it approximates as closely as possible what the original author would have expected to see and hear. In a [[historically informed performance]], the actors or musicians will make every effort to achieve this effect by using replicas of historical instruments, studying historical guides to acting and so on. They would consider, for example, that a performance of one of [[Mozart]]'s piano concertos would be "inauthentic" if played on a modern concert [[grand piano]], an instrument that would have been unknown to the composer.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

Others would not take such a rigorous view. For example, they would accept a performance of a play by [[Shakespeare]] as authentic even if the female parts were played by women rather than boys, and if the words were spoken with modern pronunciation rather than with the pronunciation of the [[Elizabethan era]], which would be difficult for a modern audience to understand.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

==Authenticity of expression==

Dutton's concept of expressive authenticity is based on the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' alternative definition of "possessing original or inherent authority". In this sense, authenticity is a measure of the degree to which the artist's work is a committed, personal expression rather than derived from other work. It includes concepts of originality, honesty and integrity.
In the case of a musical performance, authenticity of expression may conflict with authenticity of performance. The player is true to their personal musical sense and does not imitate someone else's method of playing. Their performance may thus differ significantly from that of a player attempting to follow the style common at the time the musical work was composed.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

[[File:TinaTurner&amp;Clapton.jpg|thumb|[[Tina Turner]] and [[Eric Clapton]] (1987), both known for authenticity of expression rather than authenticity of tradition.]]
Expressive authenticity is related to the technical term ''[[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]'' as used in [[existential philosophy]]. It has always been thought right to know oneself and to act accordingly, and in existential psychology this form of authenticity is seen as central to mental health.{{sfn|Wood et al.}}
Prominent artists such as the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]] [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Arshile Gorky]], and [[Willem de Kooning]] have been understood in existentialist terms, as have [[filmmaker]]s such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Ingmar Bergman]].{{sfn|Crowell|2010}}
The greater popularity of performer-based music as opposed to composition-based music is relatively recent. It seems to reflect a growing interest in expressive authenticity, and thus in musicians who have a unique and charismatic style.{{sfn|Abbing|2002|pp=173}}

The question of whether an artistic work is an authentic expression depends on the artist's background, beliefs and ideals. [[Andrew Potter]] cites the example of [[Avril Lavigne]], a teenage singer from [[Napanee]], [[Ontario]] who burst onto the pop music scene in 2002. She claimed to be a small-town skateboarder, with her background providing the subjects of her songs, and said these songs were her own compositions. These claims of authenticity of expression and of provenance were both challenged. However, her work could have been authentic in expression even if Lavigne had not written it, or authentic in provenance if she had written it but not authentic in expression if the carefully cultivated skater-girl image were false.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=79ff}}
 
Authenticity of expression may thus be linked with authenticity of style or tradition.
Many feel it is not permissible for someone to speak in the voice of another culture or racial background, and that such an expression cannot be authentic.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=79ff}}
For example, [[hip hop]] was originally an art form through which underprivileged minorities in the [[United States]] protested against their condition. As it has become less of an underground culture, there is debate over whether the spirit of hip hop can survive in a marketable integrated version.{{sfn|Rose|1994|pp=39-40}}
In "Authenticity Within Hip Hop and Other Cultures Threatened with Assimilation," [[Kembrew McLeod]] argues that hip hop culture is threatened with assimilation by a larger, mainstream culture, and that authenticity of expression in this genre is being lost.{{sfn|McLeod|1999}}

==Authenticity of experience==

[[File:British Museum Asia 45.jpg|thumb|An 8th-century AD statue of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] goddess [[Tara (Ramayana)|Tara]] from [[Sri Lanka]] in a very different setting from the original]]
A quite different concern is the authenticity of the experience, which may be impossible to achieve. A modern visitor to a museum may not only see an object in a very different context from that which the artist intended, but also may be unable to understand important aspects of the work. The authentic experience may be impossible to recapture. A curator may accept this, perhaps attempting to present the works of art in their authentic condition, but accepting that the artificial setting and lighting are legitimate in providing a contemporary experience of the artwork, even if this experience cannot be "authentic".{{sfn|Phillips|1997|pp=1-4}}

Dutton discusses the importance of the audience, giving a hypothetical example based on ''[[La Scala]]'', the famous [[Milan]] opera house. He imagines that the natural audience, informed aficionados of the opera, lose interest and cease to attend, but the performances continue to be given to tourists who have no understanding of the work they are experiencing. In another example, he quotes a Pacific Island dancer saying "Culture? That's what we do for the tourists." In both cases, although the performances may be authentic in the sense of being true to the original, the authenticity of the experience is open to debate.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

[[File:Black Girls Code at GEM-TECH 2015 awards.jpg|thumb|right|A Black Girls Code booth at the 2015 GEM-TECH awards organized by [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]].]]

'''Black Girls Code''' ('''BGC''') is a not-for-profit organization that focuses on providing technology education for [[African-American]] girls. [[Kimberly Bryant (technologist)|Kimberly Bryant]], an [[electrical engineer]] who had worked in [[biotech]] for over 20 years, founded Black Girls Code in 2011 to rectify the underrepresentation of female African-Americans in the technology industry.&lt;ref name="Robehmed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2013/08/30/black-girls-code-tackles-tech-inclusion/|title=Black Girls Code Tackles Tech Inclusion|last=Robehmed|first=Natalie|date=August 30, 2013|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilpin" /&gt; The organization offers programs in computer programming, coding, as well as website, robot, and mobile application-building, with the goal of providing African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/btn_02272013web.pdf |title=By the Numbers |website=www.ncwit.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
Bryant was inspired to start BGC after her [[gamer]] daughter, Kai, attended a computing summer camp and was disappointed in the experience.&lt;ref name="Gilpin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/black-girls-code-founder-kimberly-bryant-engineer-entrepreneur-mother/#.|title=Black Girls Code founder Kimberly Bryant: Engineer.

She also noted that the boys at the camp were given much more attention from the counselors than the few girls there.&lt;ref name="Gilpin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SFNews" /&gt; In an interview with [[Ebony (magazine)|''Ebony'']], Bryant stated, "I wanted to find a way to engage and interest my daughter in becoming a [[digital creative]] instead of just a consumer, and I did not find other programs that were targeted to girls like her from underrepresented communities."&lt;ref name="Phanor-Faury"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebony.com/life/black-girls-code-founder-kim-bryant-talks-333#axzz2z0qE3OOB|title=Black Girls Code’s Kim Bryant Talks Bits and Bytes|last=Phanor-Faury|first=Alexandra|date=March 19, 2014|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
BGC has become a rapidly growing phenomenon, quickly expanding in the USA and abroad.

[[File:BB at Purley Oaks (1964).jpg|thumb|The Brighton Belle passing Purley Oaks at speed in June 1964.]]
The '''''Brighton Belle''''' was a [[named train]] which was operated by the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] and subsequently by [[British Rail]] from [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] in London to [[Brighton]], on the Sussex coast. Commissioned as the flagship of the Southern Railway's mass electrification project, which commenced in January 1931, the world's only electric all-[[Pullman train (UK)|Pullman]] service ran daily between London Victoria and Brighton from 1 January 1933 until 30 April 1972.

==History==
The [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&amp;SCR) began using Pullman cars in its express trains in 1875, and in December 1881 they introduced the first all-Pullman train in the UK. Known as the ''Pullman Limited'', this ran between London Victoria and Brighton via [[Horsham]] and subsequently ordinary rolling stock was added to the service. In 1888 a second all-Pullman service was instituted, using cars lit by electricity and designed by [[William Stroudley]].&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Nicholas, The Brighton Belle, [http://www.southernelectric.org.uk/preservation/preserved-stock/preservationpull.html Southern Electric Group: Preserved Pullmans], Southern Electric Group (1972), p9&lt;/ref&gt;

The LB&amp;SCR was the origin of the British [[umber]] and cream Pullman livery. In 1903 [[R. J. Billinton]] changed the colour of the ordinary LB&amp;SCR coaches to umber brown with white or cream upper panels, and in 1906 this colour scheme was also adopted by the Pullman Car Co., with the name of the car in large gilt letters on the lower panel and flanked on each side by a coloured transfer of the Pullman Company's crest.

Another all-Pullman service was introduced in 1908 under the name of the ''Southern Belle''. Contemporary advertising by the LB&amp;SCR claimed that this was "... the most luxurious train in the world...". In 1908 this could be experienced for a special London Victoria to Brighton day return fare of 12 shillings, a premium rate at a time when average earnings were around £1 a week (or 20 shillings). The ''Southern Belle'' was steam hauled until 1 January 1933, when electric units were introduced. Trial trains had commenced running between London and Brighton on 2 November 1932, using an experimental five-coach unit (No. 2001) and examples of the new rolling stock were exhibited at London Victoria and Brighton stations from 29 December 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Antony, "Pullman Profile No. 4 - The Brighton Belle &amp; Southern Electric Pullmans" Noodle Books {{ISBN|978-1909328051}} (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of the mid-day Victoria to Brighton service at Brighton Station on 29 June 1934, the Mayor of Brighton, Margaret Hardy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mayors from 1900 until 1990 {{!}} Corporation and Council {{!}} Topics {{!}} My Brighton and Hove|url = http://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/page_id__8298.aspx|website = www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-03|first = Community Sites|last = (www.communitysites.co.uk)}}&lt;/ref&gt; renamed the train the ''Brighton Belle'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brightonbelle.com/| title=Walk through "Hazel" on the Belle's 80th anniversary!| author=BBC News| date=June 29, 2013| website=Bringing Back the Brighton Belle| accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it retained this title until withdrawal. The service was scheduled to take 60 minutes for the 51-mile express journey.

Three five-car all-Pullman electric multiple units designated [[British Rail Class 403|5-BEL]] were commissioned by the Southern Railway as the flagship of the world's then-largest electrification project, which covered over 160 track miles. The 15 cars – built in 1932 by Metropolitan-Cammell at its Saltley works in Birmingham – were operated in trains comprising two units, the remaining unit normally held in reserve. The 'spare' multiple unit set was used for a Sunday Pullman service from [[Eastbourne]], known as the ''Eastbourne Pullman'' for much of the 1950s, but this service was discontinued in 1957.

During the [[Second World War]] the service was suspended after Unit 3052 was badly damaged by aerial bombing at London Victoria; all cars were placed in safe storage at [[Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station|Crystal Palace (High Level) station]], but the service was progressively reinstated in 1946.

The trains were refurbished and overhauled in 1955, but by 1972 the stock was old and rode poorly by contemporary standards. Despite protests,&lt;ref&gt;Dunstone, Denis, For the Love of Trains, Ian Allan, {{ISBN|0-7110-3301-3}} (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; the decision was taken not to replace the rolling stock and the service was withdrawn on 30 April 1972. Every car was preserved, in most cases to meet the ambitions of major breweries to 'bolt on' Pullman restaurants to pubs and hotels, although most were removed relatively quickly because of the high cost of maintenance and refurbishment.&lt;ref&gt;"Farewell to the Belle". This is Cheshire.&lt;/ref&gt; A number were progressively acquired by the [[Venice Simplon Orient Express]], while one still remains in use as B&amp;B accommodation at the Little Mill Inn, Rowarth, Derbyshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelittlemill.co.uk/ Little Mill Inn, Rowarth]&lt;/ref&gt; Motor brake car 90 was used for passenger service on the [[Nene Valley Railway]] between 1980 and 1990, but was subsequently scrapped at Bury in 1995 following a series of arson attacks.

The Southern ran three Pullman trains with the suffix ''Belle''. The others were the ''[[Bournemouth Belle]]'' and the ''[[Devon Belle]]''. British Railways introduced the ''[[Thanet Belle]]'' (later renamed the ''Kentish Belle'') in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.semgonline.com/misc/named_05.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
[[File:Cars 88 and 91 together again.JPG|thumb|Driving Cars 88 and 91 were coupled together for the very first time when the latter arrived at Rampart of Derby for restoration in September 2009.]]
A campaign&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semgonline.com/coach/coupe/coupe066.pdf Coupe News (Journal of Pullman Car Services) No. 66, pp 24–25]&lt;/ref&gt; to return the ''Brighton Belle'' to mainline service was launched by the 5-BEL Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bringing Back The Brighton Belle|url = http://www.brightonbelle.com/|website = www.brightonbelle.com|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009. The trustees had been concerned for some time about the worrying state of electric train preservation in Britain and wanted to raise the profile of the issue and to deal with the issues of financial support and covered accommodation. The project was launched at the [[National Railway Museum]] following the acquisition of two of the surviving 14 cars; by early 2009 four out of the five cars needed to form a complete unit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernelectric.org.uk/preservation/preserved-stock/preservationpull.html Southern Electric Group: Preserved Pullmans]&lt;/ref&gt; had been acquired and the trust had set in place agreements to cover refurbishment of the cars, which began at Pullman restoration specialists Rampart Engineering at the [[Barrow Hill Engine Shed]] in February 2009.

When the 5-BEL project is completed, it will be returned to mainline service. Despite the high cost of the restoration (approaching £6 million) the programme is seen as an investment for future generations. Progress with the restoration of the ''Brighton Belle'' to mainline use will depend in part on the level of public donations. This is the first time that a complete train will have been restored in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us3.campaign-archive1.com/?u=86207125bd754c522402e803e&amp;id=2a48594ecc&amp;e=6d9a0710ca 5BEL Trust Newsletter, March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; A short train of three cars will undergo mainline proving trials in the near future, with mainline excursions with a four car unit commencing upon testing success.&lt;ref&gt;[Heritage Railway magazine April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Train unit completed==

The 5-BEL Trust had purchased ''Golden Arrow'' Pullman Kitchen Car ''Carina'' and supplied this to the Bluebell railway in exchange for ''Doris'', allowing the Bluebell Railway to complete a five-car all-Pullman ''Golden Arrow'' rake. ''Carina'' is of considerable heritage importance, having formed part of [[Winston Churchill]]'s funeral train which carried the principal mourners from London to [[Bladon]] on 30 January 1965.

The 5-BEL Trust said at the time that acquiring ''Doris'' as the trust's fifth car was not only the right move from a heritage standpoint but also it demonstrated the benefits of like-minded organisations working together. The following year, on 6 September 2012, the 5BEL Trust announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |magazine=The Railway Magazine |date=October 2012 |issue=1338 |volume=158 |page=15 |title=Brighton Belle 'Hazel' to run again |editor-first=Nick |editor-last=Pigott |editor-link=Nick Pigott |issn=0033-8923 |publisher=Mortons Media Group |location=Horncastle }}&lt;/ref&gt; that, following two years of complex negotiations with the owners of the Black Bull at Moulton, near Richmond, it had purchased Pullman first 'Hazel' (no. 279) the previous month and had removed the car by road to the Brighton Belle shed at Barrow Hill. The car had been in continuous use as a highly praised restaurant since 1972 and her removal was an extremely delicate operation, involving the use of two of the largest mobile cranes in Britain. The acquisition of a second first class car, originally considered as an impossible outcome, permits the correct unit configuration of two motor brakes, two trailer kitchen firsts and a trailer parlour third, with a trailer held in reserve.

'''Buddhist religious architecture''' developed in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Three types of structures are associated with the [[sacred architecture|religious architecture]] of [[early Buddhism]]: monasteries ([[vihara]]s), places to venerate relics ([[stupa]]s), and shrines or prayer halls ([[chaitya]]s, also called ''chaitya grihas''), which later came to be called temples in some places.

The initial function of a stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of [[Gautama Buddha]]. The earliest surviving example of a stupa is in [[Sanchi]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]]).

In accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into chaitya-grihas (prayer halls). These are exemplified by the complexes of the [[Ajanta Caves]] and the [[Ellora Caves]] ([[Maharashtra]]). The [[Mahabodhi Temple]] at [[Bodh Gaya]] in [[Bihar]] is another well-known example.

The [[Pagoda]] is an evolution of the Indian stupa.

==Early development==
[[File:Sanchi1 N-MP-220.jpg|thumb|right|The Great Stupa in [[Sanchi]] ]]
[[File:Sanchi_temple_17.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gupta period]] temple at Sanchi besides the Apsidal hall with  [[Maurya]] foundation ]]
A characteristic new development at Buddhist religious sites was the [[stupa]]. Stupas were originally more sculpture than building, essentially markers of some holy site or commemorating a holy man who lived there. Later forms are more elaborate and also in many cases refer back to the Mount Meru model.

One of the earliest Buddhist sites still in existence is at [[Sanchi]], India, and this is centred on a stupa said to have been built by [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]] (273–236 BCE). The original simple structure is encased in a later, more decorative one, and over two centuries the whole site was elaborated upon. The four cardinal points are marked by elaborate stone gateways.

As with [[Buddhist art]], architecture followed the spread of Buddhism throughout south and east Asia and it was the early Indian models that served as a first reference point, even though Buddhism virtually disappeared from India itself in the 10th century.

Decoration of Buddhist sites became steadily more elaborate through the last two centuries BCE, with the introduction of tablets and friezes, including human figures, particularly on stupas. However, the Buddha was not represented in human form until the 1st century CE. Instead, aniconic symbols were used. This is treated in more detail in [[Buddhist art]], Aniconic phase. It influenced the development of temples, which eventually became a backdrop for Buddha images in most cases.

As Buddhism spread, Buddhist architecture diverged in style, reflecting the similar trends in Buddhist art. Building form was also influenced to some extent by the different forms of Buddhism in the northern countries, practicing [[Mahayana]] Buddhism in the main and in the south where [[Theravada]] Buddhism prevailed.

The '''CERGA Observatory''' ({{lang-fr|'''Centre de recherches en géodynamique et astrométrie'''}}; [[List of observatory codes|obs. code]]: [[IAU code#010|010]]) was a scientific department and astronomical station of the [[Côte d'Azur Observatory]] in southern France, where several [[asteroid]]s were discovered during 1984–1993.&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2252-CERGA" /&gt;

== Description ==

CERGA included 28 researchers and as many engineers and technicians located on the Observatory sites of [[Nice]], [[Grasse]] and [[Calern]] ([[Caussols, Alpes-Maritimes|Caussols]]). The scientific activities covered fields as diverse as fundamental [[astronomy]], [[celestial mechanics]], and space [[geodesy]]. CERGA was in charge of several observing facilities of the [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment]], for example, the lunar-laser ranging telescope and the two satellite laser stations. 

By nature the scientific activity involved the acquisition of data and their processing, a dedicated instrumental development and a close relationship with the more theoretical aspects in dynamics and observation modelling.

CERGA was dissolved in 2004 when the parent [[Côte d'Azur Observatory]] re-organized. The main-belt asteroid [[2252&amp;nbsp;CERGA]] was named for the observatory, where this asteroid was discovered by [[Kōichirō Tomita]].&lt;ref name="2252-CERGA" /&gt;

'''Calponin 3. acidic''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''CNN3'' [[gene]].

The ''CNN3'' gene is located at 1p22-p21&lt;ref name="pmid8526917"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maguchi M, Nishida W, Kohara K, Kuwano A, Kondo I, Hiwada K | title = Molecular cloning and gene mapping of human basic and acidic calponins | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 217 | issue = 1 | pages = 238–44 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8526917 | doi = 10.1006/bbrc.1995.2769 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the human chromosomal genome. ''CNN3'' gene contains 7 exons and encodes calponin 3, a 36.4-kDa protein consisting of 329 amino acids with isoelectric point (pI) of 5.84. Calponin 3 is known as acidic calponin. Among three isoforms of calponin, less is known for the gene regulation and function of calponin 3. Nonetheless, much has been learned from extensive studies on the homologous genes ''CNN1'' and ''CNN2'' that encode [[calponin 1]] and [[calponin 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu R, Jin JP | year =  2016 | title = Calponin Isoforms CNN1, CNN2 and CNN3: Regulators for Actin Cytoskeleton Functions in Smooth Muscle and Non-Muscle Cells. | journal = Gene | doi=10.1016/j.gene.2016.02.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
[[File:CNN3 wikipage.jpg|thumb|382x382px|
'''Figure 1.''' Evolutionary lineage of vertebrate calponin 3 isoforms deduced from alignment of amino acid sequences.
]]''CNN3'' is one of the three homologous calponin isoform genes. Calponin 3 is significantly diverged from calponin 1 and calponin 2 in the C terminal variable region. The higher degree of divergence among vertebrate ''CNN3'' genes than that in the ''CNN1'' and ''CNN2'' gene families suggests possibly earlier emergence of ''CNN3'', indicating that calponin 3 may represent a prototype of calponin ancestral of the three present-day isoforms (Fig. 1).

== Structure-function relationships ==

The primary structure of calponin 3 is similar as that of calponin 1 and calponin 2, consisting of a conserved N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, a conserved middle region containing two actin-binding sites, and a C-terminal variable region. The unique length amino acid sequence of the C-terminal segment of the three calponin isoforms are responsible for their size and overall charge differences.

Calponin 3 has been shown to participate in actin cytoskeleton-based activities such as that in embryonic development&lt;ref name="Shibukawa_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shibukawa Y, Yamazaki N, Kumasawa K, Daimon E, Tajiri M, Okada Y, Ikawa M, Wada Y | title = Calponin 3 regulates actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in trophoblastic cell fusion | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 21 | issue = 22 | pages = 3973–84 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20861310 | pmc = 2982094 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E10-03-0261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and myogenesis.&lt;ref name="Daimon_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daimon E, Shibukawa Y, Wada Y | title = Calponin 3 regulates stress fiber formation in dermal fibroblasts during wound healing | journal = Archives of Dermatological Research | volume = 305 | issue = 7 | pages = 571–84 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23545751 | doi = 10.1007/s00403-013-1343-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike calponin 1, calponin 3 has little effect on actomyosin Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase activity and does not cause actin filaments bundling at the same condition as calponin 1 does.&lt;ref name="pmid12033495"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujii T, Yabe S, Nakamura K, Koizumi Y | title = Functional analysis of rat acidic calponin | journal = Biological &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 573–9 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12033495 | doi = 10.1248/bpb.25.573 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

Calponin 3 was found in stress fibers of skin fibroblasts and myofibroblasts during wound healing. ''Cnn3'' knockdown in primary fibroblasts impaired stress fiber formation, resulting in decreased cell motility and contractile ability.&lt;ref name="Daimon_2013"/&gt;&gt; Calponin 3 in the brain has a potential function in regulating actin filaments during neuronal remodeling.&lt;ref name="pmid16358313"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rami G, Caillard O, Medina I, Pellegrino C, Fattoum A, Ben-Ari Y, Ferhat L | title = Change in the shape and density of dendritic spines caused by overexpression of acidic calponin in cultured hippocampal neurons | journal = Hippocampus | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–97 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16358313 | doi = 10.1002/hipo.20145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calponin 3 was also found in dendritic spines of adult hippocampal neurons to regulate dendritic spine plasticity.&lt;ref name="Ferhat_2003"/&gt; While mice with systemic knockout of ''Cnn1''&lt;ref name="pmid11112431"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Yoshimoto R, Fuchibe K, Fujishige A, Mitsui-Saito M, Hori M, Ozaki H, Yamamura H, Awata N, Taniguchi S, Katsuki M, Tsuchiya T, Karaki H | title = Regulation of shortening velocity by calponin in intact contracting smooth muscles | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 279 | issue = 1 | pages = 150–7 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11112431 | doi = 10.1006/bbrc.2000.3909 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Cnn2'',&lt;ref name="pmid18617524"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang QQ, Hossain MM, Wu K, Parai K, Pope RM, Jin JP | title = Role of H2-calponin in regulating macrophage motility and phagocytosis | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 283 | issue = 38 | pages = 25887–99 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18617524 | pmc = 2533796 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M801163200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or both ''Cnn1'' and ''Cnn2'' survive to adulthood and fertile, systemic knockout of calponin 3 in mice results in embryonic and neonatal lethality due to defect in the development of central nervous system.&lt;ref name="Flemming_2015"/&gt; ''CNN3'' was found in the trophoblasts of human placenta and plays a role of negative regulator of trophoblast fusion. Knockdown or dissociation of calponin 3 from cytoskeleton in response to PKC phosphorylation promoted fusion of trophoblasts.&lt;ref name="Shibukawa_2010"/&gt;

Consistently, calponin 3 was also present in myoblasts as an inhibitory regulator of cell fusion. Overexpression of calponin 3 in mouse C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; myoblasts inhibited cell fusion during ''in vitro'' differentiation, whereas ''Cnn3'' gene knockdown promoted cell fusion and the expression of skeletal muscle myosin. The inhibitory effect of calponin 3 was reversed upon phosphorylation by Rho-associated kinase 1/2 (ROCK1/2).&lt;ref name="Shibukawa_2010"/&gt;

The chemistry of the Casparian strip has been described as composed of suberin. According to some studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Casparian strip begins as a localized deposition of [[natural phenol|phenolic]] and [[unsaturated fat]]ty substances in the middle [[Lamella (cell biology)|lamella]] between the radial walls, as partly oxidized films. The primary wall becomes encrusted with and later thickened by deposits of similar substances on the inside of that wall. The encrustation of the cell wall by the material constituting the Casparian strip presumably plugs the pores that would have otherwise allowed the movement of water and nutrients via [[capillary action]] along that path.&lt;ref name="frey"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cytoplasm]] of the [[Endodermis|endodermal]] cell is firmly attached to the Casparian strip so that it does not readily separate from the strip when the cells are subjected to contraction of the [[protoplast]]s. At the root, the casparian strip is embedded within the cell wall of endodermal cells in the non-growing region of the root behind the root tip.&lt;ref name="Taiz"&gt;Taiz, L., Zeiger, Eduardo, Møller, Ian Max, &amp; Murphy, Angus. (2015). Plant physiology and development (Sixth ed.).&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the casparian strip serves as a boundary layer separating the apoplast of the cortex from the apoplast of the vascular tissue thereby blocking diffusion of material between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grebe | first1 = M | year = 2011 | title = Unveiling the Casparian strip | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 473 | issue = 7347| pages = 294–5 | doi=10.1038/473294a| pmid = 21593860 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This separation forces water and solutes to pass through the plasma membrane via a symplastic route in order to cross the endodermis layer.&lt;ref name="Taiz" /&gt;

Casparian strips differentiate after an outward growth of the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] is completed. At this level of the root development, the primary [[xylem]] of its vascular cylinder is only partly advanced. In [[gymnosperm]]s and [[angiosperm]]s displaying secondary growth, the roots commonly develop only endodermis with Casparian strips. In many of those, the endodermis is later discarded, together with the cortex, when the [[periderm]] develops from the [[pericycle]]. If the pericycle is superficial and the cortex is retained, either the endodermis is stretched or crushed or it keeps pace with the expansion of the vascular cylinder by radial [[wikt:anticline|anticlinal]] divisions, and the new walls develop Casparian strips in continuity with the old ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of secondary growth (most [[monocotyledon]]s and a few [[eudicot]]s), the endodermis commonly undergoes wall modifications. There are two developmental stages beyond the development of the Casparian strip. In the second stage suberin (or endoderm&lt;ref name="frey" /&gt;) coats the entire wall on the inside of the cell. As a result, the Casparian strip is separated from the cytoplasm and the connection between the two ceases to be evident. In the third stage, a thick [[cellulose]] layer is deposited over the suberin, sometimes mainly on the inner tangential walls. The thickened wall, as well as the original wall in which the Casparian strip is located, may become lignified, creating a secondary cell wall. The Casparian strip may be identifiable after the thickening of the endodermal wall has occurred. The thickened endodermal wall may have pits. The successive development of endodermal walls is clearly expressed in monocotyledons. In dicotyledons, the distinction between.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Nestled in [[Rock Creek Park]] behind [[Embassy Row]], the Center for Hellenic Studies offers a variety of both residential and remote fellowships each year to scholars and researchers working on projects in a variety of fields, including "archaeology, [[art history]], [[epigraphy]], history, literary criticism, philology, philosophy, pedagogical applications, reception, and interdisciplinary studies".&lt;ref name="CHS Fellowships"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=Fellowships&amp;bdc=12&amp;mn=0|title=Opportunities for Researchers: CHS Fellowships in Hellenic Studies |website=CHS |accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center provides housing for "residential" fellows and their families, and accommodates remote fellows and visiting scholars during shorter stays.  Fellows are selected by a panel of Senior Fellows, a group of five internationally selected senior [[classicists]].  Fellows are typically pre-tenured PhDs from around the world, most often from [[Europe]] or North America.  The "Center", as it is commonly called, has been a stopping point in the careers of many budding classicists who have gone on to be major contributors in the field.

==Director of the Center==
The Director of the Center is appointed by Harvard University.  [[Michael C.J. Putnam]] ([[Brown University]], 1962) was the first director, but acted as a substitute for [[Bernard Knox]] ([[Yale University]], 1963–1985), the Center's first official Director.  Knox was succeeded by Zeph Stewart ([[Harvard University]], 1985–1992), and Stewart by Co-Directors, [[Kurt Raaflaub]] and Deborah Boedeker ([[Brown University]], 1992–2000).&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;Lindquist, Eric N. "The Origins of the Center for Hellenic Studies." Princeton, N.J.: Princeton UP, 1990.  {{ISBN|0-691-03174-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current Director of the Center is [[Gregory Nagy]] ([[Harvard University]], 2000–present).

==Campus==
The main building of the Center houses one of the world's premier research libraries for the study of the classical world. The library is primarily used by residential and visiting fellows, as well as visiting scholars, but it is also open to the public.  It includes a rare book room with editions from as early as the 1600s.  The main building also houses offices for the fellows,  staff, and administration.

The wooded campus has a large [[mansion]] as the director's residence, a "stoa" with five apartments for the fellows without families, three [[cottage]]s for the fellows with families, two subdivided cottages serving as double residences, five guest-rooms to accommodate visiting scholars, and one cottage that has been transformed into a multi-media conference facility.&lt;ref name="Convergeo, Digital Agora"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.convergeo.com/agora.html|title=Convergeo - Harvard Hellenic Center|website=www.convergeo.com|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is easy access from the Center to Rock Creek Park.

== History ==

The Center was established in 1961 through an endowment, "exclusively for the establishment of an educational center in the field of [[Hellenic studies|Hellenic Studies]] designed to rediscover the humanism of the Hellenic Greeks," made by the [[Old Dominion Foundation]], (the predecessor to the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]).  The governing body was the "Trustees of Harvard University" (one of [[Harvard University]]'s two governing boards, now known as the President and Fellows of Harvard College or Harvard Corporation).  The Center was completed in 1963 by the architect [[H. Page Cross]] on land donated by Marie Beale in memory of her son, Walker Blaine Beale (Harvard College class of 1918) who died in [[World War I]].  In 1996, the [[Italian Embassy in Washington|Italian Embassy]] bought about half of the land from the Center and built a new facility there.  In the mid-1990s, under the directorship of Raaflaub and Boedecker, the Center was greatly expanded (from 8 Junior Fellows to 12, and with a significant renovation of the library).

Starting in 2000, the current Director, [[Gregory Nagy]], has brought a new focus on outreach (both national and international), information technology, publishing, and collaborative research to the Center for Hellenic Studies, as evidenced by the Center's dynamic website. In 2003, under Nagy's direction, the Center began renovations to transform one of the cottages into a new multi-media conference center.  The design plans were drawn up by the architectural firm, Convergeo,&lt;ref name="Convergeo home"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.convergeo.com/|title=Convergeo - Waldvogel &amp; Huang|website=www.convergeo.com|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006, the "Digital Agora"&lt;ref name="Convergeo, Digital Agora"  /&gt; was unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savethis.clickability.com/st/saveThisApp?clickMap=link&amp;webPadID=K769688262{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CHS Greece ==
In 2008, the Center for Hellenic Studies opened a campus in [[Nafplio]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="CHS Greece"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nafplio.gr/en/kentroellspoudonharvardmenu.html|title=The Center for Hellenic Studies (Greece), Harvard University|last=|first=|date=|website=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece, Harvard University|Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece]] is a Harvard international Center that unites the humanistic pursuits of the CHS in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] with the homeland of Hellenism. Dr. Ioannis Petropoulos of the [[Democritus University of Thrace]] is the first, and current Director of the Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece (CHS GR).  CHS GR began as an office of the CHS DC, and has evolved into a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] base of operations and twin institution to its counterpart in Washington, D.C. It organizes, hosts and supports the summer programs of Harvard and other institutions, including opportunities for research, study and internship abroad.

The '''UCD Center for Mind and Brain''' is a [[research]] and [[training]] unit at the [[University of California, Davis]] dedicated to understanding the nature of the [[human mind]] from interdisciplinary perspectives.

Scientists currently in the CMB (19 core members), and those who will be recruited to join it, include those interested in a wide range of fundamental questions about how our minds are organized. We address these questions using interdisciplinary approaches from [[social science]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]]), [[biological science]] ([[behavioral neuroscience|behavioral]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[physiology]]), [[engineering science]] ([[biomedical]] and [[electrical engineering]], [[computer science]]), and [[medical science]] ([[neurology]], [[psychiatry]] and [[medical imaging]]).

The research mission of the CMB includes investigation of a variety of fundamental issues aimed at answering the fundamental question: How does the mind arise from the biology of the [[brain]]? Scientists in the CMB study language, memory, attention, cognitive control, emotion, multi-sensory integration, music cognition, social cognition, and visual cognition from cognitive neuroscience and developmental perspectives in healthy infants, children, and adults, and in special patient populations. We are also a leader in the emerging field of translational cognitive neuroscience, which endeavors to translate basic science findings about the operation of healthy minds and brains into clinical research on mind-[[brain disorder]]s such as [[autism]], [[schizophrenia]], [[attention deficit disorder]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]].

The Center for Mind and Brain is located adjacent to the University of California, Davis campus at 267 Cousteau Place (main building) and 202 Cousteau Place (CMB and Developmental Psychology Annex). The CMB and Developmental Psychology Annex includes over {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. of custom designed laboratories, offices and shared facilities.

==Overview==
The Chile Pepper Institute is a research institute and is the only international organization that is devoted to the research, resource and education of chile peppers. The institute helps and promotes the iconic and famous [[New Mexico chile|state vegetable of New Mexico]]. CPI is located in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on the campus of New Mexico State University, and research is conducted at the Fabian Garcia Horticultural Center, where it also showcase 100-200 varieties of chile pepper from around the world. Paul W. Bosland is the current director and the co-founder of The Chile Pepper Institute, who is also a professor of horticulture at New Mexico State University, where he leads the chile breeding and genetics research program.&lt;ref name=BoslandBio&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul W. Bosland|url=http://aces.nmsu.edu/academics/pes/paul-w-bosland.html|website=New  Mexico State University|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chile Pepper Institute is responsible for discovering the then world's hottest chile pepper, the [[Bhut Jolokia]], led by Paul W. Bosland, and confirmed by the [[Guinness World Records]] in the Fall of 2006.&lt;ref name=HolyJolokia&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bannister|first1=Justin|title=NMSU's Chile Pepper Institute gets fired up with 'Holy Jolokica' hot sauce|url=http://newscenter.nmsu.edu/4551/|website=New Mexico State University|ref=Discovery|date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many interesting records about chile peppers are discovered at the Chile Pepper Institute including the world's largest chile pepper, the Numex Big Jim specimen, that was developed in 1976 at [[New Mexico State University|NMSU]],&lt;ref name=ChileMan&gt;{{cite web|title=Database of Chile Pepper Varieties|url=http://www.thechileman.org/results.php?chile=1&amp;find=NUMEX%20BIG%20JIM&amp;heat=Any&amp;origin=Any&amp;genus=Any|website=The Chile Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recently released specimen chile pepper, NuMex Heritage 6-4, which is five times the flavor of a standard green chile.&lt;ref name=Heritage6_4&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bosland|first1=Paul W.|title=‘NuMex Heritage 6-4’ New Mexican Chile Pepper|url=http://www.chilepepperinstitute.org/content/files/H64.full.pdf|website=New Mexico State University, HortScience|accessdate=9 May 2015|format=pdf|date=2012|quote=The New  Mexico  Chile  Pepper  Breeding  and Genetics Program announces the release of ‘NuMex Heritage 6-4’}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Barque de Dante (Delacroix 3820).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Vergil]] leading [[Dante]] on his journey in the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', an image that dramatizes the continuity of the classical tradition&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, Glenn W. Most, and Salvatore Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. viii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Dante and Vergil in Hell'' by [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], 1823)]]
The [[Western culture|Western]] '''classical tradition''' is the [[reception theory|reception]] of [[classical antiquity|classical Greco-Roman antiquity]] by later cultures, especially the post-classical West,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Grafton]], [[Glenn W. Most]], and Salvatore Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt; involving texts, imagery, objects, ideas, institutions, monuments, architecture, cultural artifacts, rituals, practices, and sayings.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'', p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Philosophy]], [[History of political thinking|political thought]], and [[classical mythology|mythology]] are three major examples of how classical culture survives and continues to have influence.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, entry on "mythology," in ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 614 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; The West is one of a number of world cultures regarded as having a classical tradition, including the [[Classical India|Indian]], [[Chinese classics|Chinese]], [[Judaism|Judaic]], and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'', p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the classical tradition differs from [[classical philology]], which seeks to recover "the meanings that ancient texts had in their original contexts."&lt;ref&gt;Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''A Companion to the Classical Tradition'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It examines both later efforts to uncover the realities of the [[Greco-Roman world]] and "creative misunderstandings" that reinterpret ancient values, ideas and aesthetic models for contemporary use.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton, Most, and Settis, preface to ''The Classical Tradition'', p. vii; Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The classicist and translator [[Charles Martindale]] has defined the reception of classical antiquity as "a two-way process … in which the present and the past are in dialogue with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Martindale, "Reception," in ''A Companion to the Classical Tradition'' (2007), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The beginning of a self-conscious classical tradition is usually located in the [[Renaissance]], with the work of [[Petrarch]] in [[Italian Renaissance|14th-century Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Petrarch believed that he was recovering an unobstructed view of a classical past that had been obscured for centuries, the classical tradition in fact had continued uninterrupted during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no single moment of rupture when the inhabitants of what was formerly the [[Roman Empire]] went to bed in antiquity and awoke in the medieval world; rather, the cultural transformation occurred over centuries. The use and meaning of the classical tradition may seem, however, to change dramatically with the emergence of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Aeneas]] carrying his father and leading his son from fallen [[Troy]], a popular image in the Renaissance for the retrieval of the past as a way to make possible the future; the figure of his wife, [[Creusa]], who did not survive, represents that which was lost&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gillgren, ''Siting Federico Barocci and the Renaissance Aesthetic'' (Ashgate, 2011), pp. 165–167.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Federico Barocci]], 1598)]]
The phrase "classical tradition" is itself a modern label, articulated most notably in the [[Post-war#Year spans of the post-World War II era|post-World War II era]] with ''The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature'' of [[Gilbert Highet]] (1949) and ''The Classical Heritage and Its Beneficiaries'' of [[R. R. Bolgar]] (1954). The English word "tradition," and with it the concept of "handing down" classical culture, derives from the Latin verb ''trado, tradere, traditus'', in the sense of "hand over, hand down."&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 1.&lt;!--note--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers and artists influenced by the classical tradition may name their ancient models, or [[allusion|allude]] to their works. Often scholars infer classical influence through [[Comparative literature|comparative methods]] that reveal patterns of thought. Sometimes authors' copies of Greek and Latin texts will contain handwritten annotations that offer direct evidence of how they read and understood their classical models; for instance, in the late 20th century the discovery of [[Montaigne]]'s copy of [[Lucretius]] enabled scholars to document an influence that had long been recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Kallendorf, introduction to ''Companion'', p. 2.&lt;!--here--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2005">The '''collaborative human interpreter''' ('''CHI''') is a proposed software interface for [[human-based computation]] (first proposed as a programming language on the blog [[Google Blogoscoped]], but implementable via an [[API]] in virtually any programming language) specially designed for collecting 
and making use of [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]] in a [[computer program]].
One typical usage is implementing impossible-to-automate functions.

For example, it is currently difficult for a computer to differentiate between images of [[man|men]], [[woman|women]] and non-humans. However, this is easy for people. A programmer using CHI could write a code fragment along these lines:

 enum GenderCode {
  MALE, FEMALE, NOT_A_HUMAN 
 }
 Photo photo = loadPhoto(file)
 GenderCode result = checkGender(photo)

Code for the function &lt;code&gt;checkGender(Photo p)&lt;/code&gt; can currently only approximate a result, but the task can easily be solved by a person. When the function &lt;code&gt;checkGender()&lt;/code&gt; is called, the system will send a request to someone, and the person who received the request will process the task and input the result.

'''Cornwall Archaeological Society''' is an amateur archaeological society based in [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]] for the study of [[archaeology]] in Cornwall and the [[Isles of Scilly]]. It was founded in 1961 by members of the West Cornwall Field Club.&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://cornisharchaeology.org.uk/about-us/history/|website=Cornwall Archaeological Society|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===West Cornwall Field Club===
The West Cornwall Field Club was founded by [[Lt Col]] F C Hirst and six of the volunteers who were excavating a site at [[Porthmeor]], in the [[Zennor|parish of Zennor]] from 1933 to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Porthmeor|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=423591|website=Pastscape|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership increased to nineteen in 1937 and averaged fifty in the 1950s. Between 1953 and 1961 the club produced twenty-seven publications including six field guides and an annual journal, and the club members took part in forty excavations. During the fifties many members lived in mid and east Cornwall and the field club was publishing increasingly more articles from those areas. It was felt that the name no longer relevant to the scope of the field club and at the [[annual general meeting]] on 10 August 1961 it was unanimously approved to change the title to Cornwall Archaeological Society.&lt;ref name=v1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=A C|title=Editorial|journal=Cornish Archaeology|volume=1|pages=1–4|url=http://cornisharchaeology.org.uk/volume-1-1962/|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cornwall Archaeological Society===
The first President of the society was [[Ralegh Radford|C A Ralegh Radford]] an English archaeologist and historian who specialised in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]].&lt;ref name=v1/&gt;

==Excavations==
The Society has organised a number of excavations. One, considered to be outstanding was at [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] led by [[Roger Mercer]] from 1970 to 1973, which established a new class of site — the [[Neolithic Europe|Early Neolithic]] [[tor enclosure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carn Brea, Early Neolithic tor enclosure, c 3700 BC|url=http://www.royalarchinst.org/jubilee/cas|website=Royal Archaeology Society|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Society publishes a journal ''Cornish Archaeology Hendhyscans Kernow'' in most years. The first was published in 1962 and the latest, number 54, was published in 2015. A newsletter is published three times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newsletter|url=http://www.cornisharchaeology.org.uk/newsletter.htm|website=Cornwall Archaeological Society|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical psychology''' is a perspective on psychology that draws extensively on [[critical theory]]. Critical psychology challenges mainstream [[psychology]] and attempts to apply psychological understandings in more progressive ways, often looking towards social change as a means of preventing and treating psychopathology.

One of critical psychology's main criticisms of conventional psychology is that it fails to consider or deliberately ignores the way [[Power (philosophy)|power]] differences between social classes and groups can affect the mental and physical well-being of individuals or groups of people. It does this, in part, because it tends to explain behavior at the level of the individual.

==Origins==
Criticisms of mainstream psychology consistent with current critical psychology usage have existed since psychology's modern development in the late 19th century. Use of the term "critical psychology" started in the 1970s in Berlin at [[Freie Universität Berlin]]. The German branch of critical psychology predates and has developed largely separately from the rest of the field. As of May 2007, only a few works have been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1992): ''On Doing Psychology Critically''. Theory and Psychology 2, S.193–204; for further references see also Charles Tolman (1994): ''Psychology, Society and Subjectivity: An Introduction to German Critical Psychology'', London: Routledge &amp; Thomas Teo (1998): ''Klaus Holzkamp and the Rise and Fall of German Critical Psychology''. History of Psychology 1998, Vol. 1, Nr. 3; Wolfgang Maiers (1999): ''Critical Psychology – An Unfinished Modern Project''. In: Wolfgang Maiers et al. (Eds.): ''Challenges to Theoretical Psychology'', 457–66&lt;/ref&gt; The German Critical Psychology movement is rooted in the post-war babyboomers' student revolt of the late '60s; see [[German student movement]]. [[Marx]]'s ''[[Critique of Political Economy]]'' played an important role in the German branch of the student revolt, which was centered in [[Berlin]]. Then Berlin was a capitalist city surrounded by communist-ruled [[East Germany]], represented a "hot spot" of political and ideological controversy for the revolutionary German students. The sociological foundations of critical psychology are decidedly Marxist.

===Klaus Holzkamp===
One of the most important and sophisticated books in the field is the ''Grundlegung der Psychologie''&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1983): ''Grundlegung der Psychologie''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus&lt;/ref&gt; (''Foundations of Psychology'') by [[Klaus Holzkamp]], who might be considered the theoretical founder of critical psychology. Holzkamp, who had written two books on theory of science&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1964), ''Theorie und Experiment in der Psychologie''. Berlin: de Gruyter (''Theory and Experiment in Psychology''); Klaus Holzkamp (1968): ''Wissenschaft als Handlung. Versuch einer neuen Grundlegung der Wissenschaftslehre''. Berlin: de Gruyter (''Science as Action – A new Approach to the Theory of Science'')&lt;/ref&gt; and one on sensory perception&lt;ref name="ekoart"&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1973): ''Sinnliche Erkenntnis. Historischer Ursprung und gesellschaftliche Funktion der Wahrnehmung''. Frankfurt/M.: Athenäum (''Sensory Perception: Historical Origins and Social Functions of Perception''&lt;/ref&gt; before publishing the ''Grundlegung der Psychologie'' in 1983, thought this major work provided a solid [[paradigm]] for psychological research, as he viewed psychology as a pre-paradigmatic scientific discipline ([[T.S. Kuhn]] had used the term "pre-paradigmatic" for [[social science]]).

Holzkamp mostly based his sophisticated attempt to provide a comprehensive and integrated set of categories defining the field of psychological research on [[Aleksey Leontyev]]'s approach to [[cultural–historical psychology]] and [[activity theory]]. Leontyev had seen human action as a result of biological as well as cultural evolution and, drawing on Marx's materialist conception of culture, stressed that individual cognition is always part of social action which in turn is mediated by man-made tools (cultural artifacts), language and other man-made systems of symbols, which he viewed as a major distinguishing feature of human culture and, thus, human cognition. Another important source was Lucien Séve's theory of personality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/seve/index.htm Lucien Seve&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which provided the concept of "social activity matrices" as mediating structure between individual and social reproduction. At the same time, the ''Grundlegung'' systematically integrated previous specialized work done at Free University of Berlin in the '70s by critical psychologists who also had been influenced by Marx, Leontyev and Seve. This included books on [[ethology|animal behavior]]/[[ethology]],&lt;ref&gt;Volker Schurig (1975): ''Naturgeschichte des Psychischen 1: Psychogenese und elementare Formen der Tierkommunikation''. (''Natural History of the Psyche 1: Psychogenesis and Elementary Forms of Animal Communication''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus; Volker Schurig (1975): ''Naturgeschichte des Psychischen 2: Lernen und Abstraktionsleistungen bei Tieren'' (''Natural History of the Psyche 2: Learning and Abstraction Capabilities in Animals''. Frankfurt/M. Campus; Volker Schurig (1976): ''Die Entstehung des Bewußtseins'' (''The Emergence of Consciousness''). Frankfurt/M.: Campus; . Frankfurt/M.: Campus;&lt;/ref&gt; [[sensory perception]],&lt;ref name="ekoart"/&gt; [[motivation]]&lt;ref&gt;Ute Osterkamp (1975/1976): ''Grundlagen der Psychologischen Motivationsforschung'' (''Foundations of Psychological Research of Motivation'', Frankfurt/M: Campus (2 Volumes)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Seidel (1976): ''Denken. Psychologische Analyse der Entstehung und Lösung von Problemen''. (''Cognition. Psychological Analysis of Formulating and Solving Problems''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus&lt;/ref&gt; He also incorporated ideas from Freud's [[psychoanalysis]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]]'s [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] into his approach.

One core result of Holzkamp's historical and comparative analysis of human reproductive action, perception and cognition is a very specific concept of meaning that identifies symbolic meaning as historically and culturally constructed, purposeful conceptual structures that humans create in close relationship to material culture and within the context of historically specific formations of social reproduction.

Coming from this phenomenological perspective on culturally mediated and socially situated action, Holzkamp launched a devastating and original methodological attack on behaviorism (which he termed S–R (stimulus–response) psychology) based on linguistic analysis, showing in minute detail the rhetorical patterns by which this approach to psychology creates the illusion of "scientific objectivity" while at the same time losing relevance for understanding culturally situated, intentional human actions.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1987): ''Die Verkennung von Handlungsbegründungen als empirische Zusammenhangsannahmen in sozialpsychologischen Theorien: Methodologische Fehlorientierung infolge von Begriffsverwirrung'' (''Mistaking Reasons for Causes in Theories of Social Psychology: Methodological Errors as a Result of Conceptual Confusion''), Forum Kritische Psychologie 19, Berlin: Argument Verlag, pp. 23–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1993): ''Lernen: Subjektwissenschaftliche Grundlegung''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus, Chapter 1: "Hinführung auf das Verfahren der Problementwicklung" (''Introduction to the Sequence of Presentation''), pp. 17–39&lt;/ref&gt; Against this approach, he developed his own approach to generalization and objectivity, drawing on ideas from [[Kurt Lewin]] in Chapter 9 of ''Grundlegung der Psychologie''.

His last major publication before his death in 1995 was about learning.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1993): ''Lernen: Subjektwissenschaftliche Grundlegung'' (''"Learning: Subject-Scientific Foundations"''). Frankfurt/M.: Campus&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in 1993 and contained a phenomenological theory of learning from the standpoint of the subject. One important concept Holzkamp developed was "reinterpretation" of theories developed by conventional psychology. This meant to look at these concepts from the standpoint of the paradigm of critical psychology, thereby integrating their useful insights into critical psychology while at the same time identifying and criticizing their limiting implications, which in the case of S–R psychology were the rhetorical elimination of the subject and intentional action, and in the case of cognitive psychology which did take into account subjective motives and intentional actions, [[methodological individualism]]. 

The first part of the book thus contains an extensive look at the history of psychological theories of learning and a minute re-interpretation of those concepts from the perspective of the paradigm of critical psychology, which focuses on intentional action situated in specific socio-historical/cultural contexts. The conceptions of learning he found most useful in his own detailed analysis of "classroom learning" came from cognitive anthropologists [[Jean Lave]] ([[situated learning]]) and [[Edwin Hutchins]] ([[distributed cognition]]). 

The book's second part contained an extensive analysis on the modern state's institutionalized forms of "classroom learning" as the cultural–historical context that shapes much of modern learning and [[socialization]]. In this analysis, he heavily drew upon [[Michel Foucault]]'s '''''[[Discipline and Punish]]'''''. Holzkamp felt that classroom learning as the historically specific form of learning does not make full use of student's potentials, but rather limits her or his learning potentials by a number of "teaching strategies." Part of his motivation for the book was to look for alternative forms of learning that made use of the enormous potential of the human psyche in more fruitful ways. Consequently, in the last section of the book, Holzkamp discusses forms of "expansive learning" that seem to avoid the limitations of classroom learning, such as apprenticeship and learning in contexts other than classrooms.  

This search culminated in plans to write a major work on [[life leadership]] in the specific historical context of modern (capitalist) society. Due to his death in 1995, this work never got past the stage of early (and premature) conceptualizations, some of which were published in the journals ''Forum Kritische Psychologie'' and ''Argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1995): ''Alltägliche Lebensführung als subjektwissenschaftliches Grundkonzept'' ''(Everyday Life Leadership as Basic Concept of a Scientific Theory of the Subject)''. Das Argument, 37. Jahrgang, Heft 6, November/December 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s–1970s===
In the 1960s and 1970s the term ''radical psychology'' was used by psychologists to denote a branch of the field which rejected conventional psychology's focus on the individual as the basic unit of analysis and sole source of psychopathology. Instead, radical psychologists examined the role of society in causing and treating problems and looked towards social change as an alternative to therapy to treat mental illness and as a means of preventing psychopathology. Within psychiatry the term ''[[anti-psychiatry]]'' was often used and now British activists prefer the term ''[[critical psychiatry]]''. ''Critical psychology'' is currently the preferred term for the discipline of psychology keen to find alternatives to the way the discipline of psychology reduces human experience to the level of the individual and thereby strips away possibilities for radical social change.

===1990s===
Starting in the 1990s a new wave of books started to appear on critical psychology, the most influential being the edited book ''Critical Psychology'' by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky. Various introductory texts to critical psychology written in the United Kingdom have tended to focus on discourse, but this has been seen by some proponents of critical psychology as a reduction of human experience to language which is as politically dangerous as the way mainstream psychology reduces experience to the individual mind.  Attention to language and ideological processes, others would argue, is essential to effective critical psychology - it is not simply a matter of applying mainstream psychological concepts to issues of social change.

===Ian Parker===
In 1999 [[Ian Parker (psychologist)|Ian Parker]] published an influential manifesto in both the online journal ''Radical Psychology'' and the [[Annual Review of Critical Psychology]]. This manifesto argues that critical psychology should include the following four components:
# Systematic examination of how some varieties of psychological action and experience are privileged over others, how dominant accounts of "psychology" operate ideologically and in the service of power;
# Study of the ways in which all varieties of psychology are culturally historically constructed, and how alternative varieties of psychology may confirm or resist ideological assumptions in mainstream models;
# Study of forms of surveillance and self-regulation in everyday life and the ways in which psychological culture operates beyond the boundaries of academic and professional practice; and
# Exploration of the way everyday "ordinary psychology" structures academic and professional work in psychology and how everyday activities might provide the basis for resistance to contemporary disciplinary practices.

===Critical psychology today===
There are a few international journals devoted to critical psychology, including the no longer published ''International Journal of Critical Psychology''  (continued in the journal Subjectivity) and the ''Annual Review of Critical Psychology''. The journals still tend to be directed to an academic audience, though the ''Annual Review of Critical Psychology'' runs as an open-access online journal. There are close links between critical psychologists and critical psychiatrists in Britain through the Asylum Collective. [[David Smail (psychologist)|David Smai]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l was one of the founders of The Midlands Psychology Group, a critical psychology collective who produced a manifesto for a social materialist psychology of distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.midpsy.org/draft_manifesto.htm|title=Draft Manifesto for a Social Materialist Psychology of Distress|last=Midlands Psychology Group|date=|website=midpsy.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical psychology courses and research concentrations are available at Manchester Metropolitan University, York St Johns University, the University of East London, the University of Edinburgh, the University of KwaZulu Natal, the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and the University of West Georgia. Undergraduate concentrations can also be found at the California Institute of Integral Studies and Prescott College.

==Extensions==
Like many critical applications, critical psychology has expanded beyond Marxist and feminist roots to benefit from other critical approaches. Consider ecopsychology and [[transpersonal psychology]]. Critical psychology and related work has also sometimes been labelled [[radical psychology]] and [[liberation psychology]]. In the field of developmental psychology, the work of [[Erica Burman]] has been influential.

Various sub-disciplines within psychology have begun to establish their own critical orientations. Perhaps the most extensive are [[International Society of Critical Health Psychology|critical health psychology]] and [[community psychology]].

==Internationally==
An early international overview of critical psychology perspectives can be found in Critical Psychology: Voices for Change, edited by Tod Sloan (Macmillan, 2000).  In 2015, Ian Parker edited the Handbook of Critical Psychology.
===Germany===
At FU-Berlin, critical psychology was not really seen as a division of psychology and followed its own methodology, trying to reformulate traditional psychology on an unorthodox [[Marxist]] base and drawing from Soviet ideas of [[cultural–historical psychology]], particularly [[Aleksey Leontyev]]. Some years ago the department of critical psychology at FU-Berlin was merged into the traditional psychology department.

An April 2009 issue of the Sage journal ''Theory &amp; Psychology''&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol19/issue2/?etoc Special Issue: German Critical Psychology: Interventions in Honor of Klaus Holzkamp]&lt;/ref&gt; (edited by Desmond Painter, Athanasios Marvakis, and Leendert Mos) is devoted to an examination of German critical psychology.

===South Africa===
The University of KwaZulu-Natal in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], is one of few worldwide to offer a Master's course in critical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukzn.ac.za/psychology/default.asp University of KwaZulu-Natal: Critical psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; For an overview of critical psychology in South Africa, see Desmond Painter and Martin Terre Blanche's article on "Critical Psychology in South Africa: Looking back and looking forwards".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criticalmethods.org/collab/critpsy.htm Critical Psychology in South Africa: Looking back and looking forwards]&lt;/ref&gt; They have also now started a critical psychology blog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://critpsy.blogspot.com/ Critical Psychology] &lt;/ref&gt;

===United States and Canada===
Critical psychology in the United States and Canada has, for the most part, focused on critiques of mainstream psychology's support for an unjust ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce E. Levine]], [http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/05/14/psychiatrys-manufacture-of-consent/ The Chemical Imbalance Theory and the Antidepressant Explosion - Psychiatry’s Manufacture of Consent], 2014-05-14, ''[[CounterPunch]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  No departments of critical psychology exist, with the exception of the Bachelor's Completion Program with a minor in Critical Psychology, offered at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciis.edu/Academics/Bachelors_Completion_Program/Minor_in_Critical_Psychology/Critical_Psychology.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121214151955/http://www.ciis.edu/Academics/Bachelors_Completion_Program/Minor_in_Critical_Psychology/Critical_Psychology.html |archivedate=2012-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though critical perspectives are sometimes encountered in traditional universities, perhaps especially within community psychology programs. The University of West Georgia offers a Ph.D. in Consciousness and Society with critical psychology being one of the main three theoretical orientations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westga.edu/psydept/index_7775.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141008150229/http://www.westga.edu/psydept/index_7775.php |archivedate=2014-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; North American efforts include the 1993 founding of RadPsyNet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://radpsynet.org RadPsyNet]&lt;/ref&gt; the 1997 publication of ''Critical Psychology: An Introduction''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dennisfox.net/critpsy/book.html ''Critical Psychology: An Introduction'']&lt;/ref&gt; (edited by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky; expanded 2009 edition edited by Dennis Fox, Isaac Prilleltensky, and Stephanie Austin), the 2001 Monterey Conference on Critical Psychology, and in underlying themes of many contributions to the ''Journal of Social Action in Counseling and Psychology''.

== Research ==
DID is distinctive for its interest in rising middle income developing countries (like the [[BRIC]]s) as well as in social, political, and economic phenomena in conjunction with policy related questions of those fast-growing developing countries. The department’s mission is “to explore the sources of success in emerging economies as well as understand the major development challenges they continue to face”.

DID’s areas of research are ‘[[Inclusive growth|inclusive development]]’ on the one hand and ‘national development’ on the other hand. Within these two broad themes, it works on five research clusters:

* Political Institutions in Emerging Economies
* Poverty, Inequality and the New Middle Classes in Emerging Economies
* Natural Resources and Emerging Economies
* Gender Relations in Emerging Economies
* Private Sector Development in Emerging Economies

DID publishes a [[working paper]] series and has links to various external organisations including institutions like the UK [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] and the UK [[Department for International Development]], the [[British Academy]], the [[European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes|European Association of Development Institutes]], the UK [[Development Studies Association]], the US [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[UNDP]], the [[United Nations University]], the [[WHO]], the [[World Bank]], and various international non-governmental and research organisations.

'''Developmental dysfluency''' is considered a normal part of childhood development. About twenty-five percent of children experience some loss in fluency.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of developmental dysfluency include the repetition of sounds or pauses between words. These symptoms have generally been noted within youngsters from 18 months to 5 years of age. This may persist for weeks or months but eventually disappears due to the maturation of the child's nervous system.

ex.: "Daddy, I was, I was, um, um, I was..."

Instances like the aforementioned example indicate that the child is learning to use language. On the other hand, children with [[stutter|stuttering disorder]], will likely repeat sounds or one-syllable words three or more times. They may also prolong sounds for two or more seconds. In comparison, stuttering can be seen as a process where a word appears to become "stuck," and the person may grimace, jerk the head or neck as he struggles to overcome the stutter.

Children with normal dysfluency tend to have stuttering difficulties that come and go. Generally this is during [[preschool]] years and the problem normally ceases altogether by the time a child starts school.

'''Erhard Blankenburg''' (October 30, 1938 – March 28, 2018) was a German sociologist, specializing in the [[sociology of law]].
[[File:Erhard Blankenburg.jpg|thumb|Erhard Blankenburg (2013)]]

== Education and Career ==
Blankenburg studied philosophy, sociology and German literature at the [[University of Freiburg]] and the Free University Berlin. He received an MA from the University of Oregon (1965) and a PhD (D.Phil.) from the University of Basel (1966). After working as an assistant to the sociologist [[Heinrich Popitz]] at the University of Freiburg (1966-1968), he received there his [[habilitation]] (1974). From 1975 to 1980, Blankenburg worked at the renowned [[Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung|Wissenschaftszentrums Berlin]]. In 1980 he became professor of sociology of law at the [[Free University Amsterdam]]

In the 1970s, he was, along with [[Wolfgang Kaupen]], [[Rüdiger Lautmann]] and [[Volkmar Gessner]], instrumental in reviving sociology of law in Germany. There, he was among the founders of the "Zeitschrift für Rechtssoziologie", still the leading journal in the German socio-legal community. He also played a role in establishing the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]]. In 1991, together with [[Bill Felstiner]], he organized the first joint meeting of the [[Law and Society Association]] and the [[Research Committee on Sociology of Law]], the two leading organizations of socio-legal scholars in Amsterdam. His research covered a broad range of socio-legal topics, with an interest in describing and comparing legal cultures at the centre.

In 2005, Blankenburg received, at the annual conference of the Research Committee on Sociology of Law in Paris, the [[Adam Podgórecki]] Prize "for outstanding achievements in socio-legal research".
"Blankenburg has given us an important body of work. It is work that is (and should be) extremely influential in the field; and no respectable sociologist of law  can afford to ignore it. For this he deserves out thanks and our congratulation" (Friedman 1998, 386).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="125633">'''Field electron emission''' (also known as '''field emission''' ('''FE''') and '''electron field emission''') is emission of [[electron]]s induced by an electrostatic field. The most common context is field emission from a solid surface into vacuum. However, field emission can take place from solid or liquid surfaces, into vacuum, air, a fluid, or any non-conducting or weakly conducting dielectric. The field-induced promotion of electrons from the valence to conduction band of semiconductors (the [[Zener effect]]) can also be regarded as a form of field emission. The terminology is historical because related phenomena of surface photoeffect, [[thermionic emission]] (or [[Richardson–Dushman effect]]) and "cold electronic emission", i.e. the emission of electrons in strong static (or quasi-static) electric fields, were discovered and studied independently from the 1880s to 1930s. When field emission is used without qualifiers it typically means "cold emission".

Field emission in pure metals occurs in high electric fields: the gradients are typically higher than 1 gigavolt per metre and strongly dependent upon the [[work function]]. While electron sources based on field emission have a number of applications, field emission is most commonly an undesirable primary source of [[Electrical breakdown|vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge]] phenomena, which engineers work to prevent. Examples of applications for surface field emission include construction of bright electron sources for high-resolution [[electron microscope]]s or the discharge of induced charges from [[spacecraft]]. Devices which eliminate induced charges are termed [[Electrostatics#Charge neutralization|charge-neutralizers]].

Field emission was explained by [[quantum tunneling]] of electrons in the late 1920s. This was one of the triumphs of the nascent [[quantum mechanics]]. The theory of field emission from bulk metals was proposed by [[Ralph H. Fowler]] and [[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim]].&lt;ref name="Fowler1928"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Electron Emission in Intense Electric Fields|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|date=1928-05-01|first=R.H.|last=Fowler|author2=Dr. L. Nordheim|volume=119|issue=781|pages=173–181|doi=10.1098/rspa.1928.0091|url=http://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/lc/wkshp/RFBreakdwn/references/fowler.pdf|accessdate=2009-10-26|bibcode = 1928RSPSA.119..173F }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A family of approximate equations, "Fowler–Nordheim equations", is named after them. Strictly, Fowler–Nordheim equations apply only to field emission from bulk metals and (with suitable modification) to other bulk [[crystalline solid]]s, but they are often used – as a rough approximation – to describe field emission from other materials.

==Terminology and conventions==
''Field electron emission'', ''field-induced electron emission'', ''field emission'' and ''electron field emission'' are general names for this experimental phenomenon and its theory. The first name is used here.

''[[#Fowler–Nordheim tunneling|Fowler–Nordheim tunneling]]'' is the wave-mechanical tunneling of electrons through a rounded triangular barrier created at the surface of an electron conductor by applying a very high electric field. Individual electrons can escape by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from many materials in various different circumstances.

''[[#Cold field electron emission|Cold field electron emission]]'' (CFE) is the name given to a particular statistical emission regime, in which the electrons in the emitter are initially in internal [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], and in which most emitted electrons escape by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from electron states close to the emitter [[Fermi level]]. (By contrast, in the [[Thermionic emission|Schottky emission]] regime, most electrons escape over the top of a field-reduced barrier, from states well above the Fermi level.) Many solid and liquid materials can emit electrons in a CFE regime if an electric field of an appropriate size is applied.

''[[#Fowler–Nordheim-type equation|Fowler–Nordheim-type equations]]'' are a family of approximate equations derived to describe CFE from the internal electron states in bulk metals. The different members of the family represent different degrees of approximation to reality. Approximate equations are necessary because, for physically realistic models of the tunneling barrier, it is mathematically impossible in principle to solve the [[Schrödinger equation]] exactly in any simple way. There is no theoretical reason to believe that Fowler-Nordheim-type equations validly describe field emission from materials other than bulk crystalline solids.

For metals, the CFE regime extends to well above room temperature. There are other electron emission regimes (such as "[[Thermionic emission|thermal electron emission]]" and "[[Thermionic emission|Schottky emission]]") that require significant external heating of the emitter. There are also emission regimes where the internal electrons are not in thermodynamic equilibrium and the emission current is, partly or completely, determined by the supply of electrons to the emitting region. A non-equilibrium emission process of this kind may be called field (electron) emission if most of the electrons escape by tunneling, but strictly it is not CFE, and is not accurately described by a Fowler-Nordheim-type equation.

Care is necessary because in some contexts (e.g. spacecraft engineering), the name "field emission" is applied to the field-induced emission of ions (field ion emission), rather than electrons, and because in some theoretical contexts "field emission" is used as a general name covering both field electron emission and field ion emission.

Historically, the phenomenon of field electron emission has been known by a variety of names, including "the aeona effect", "autoelectronic emission", "cold emission", "cold cathode emission", "field emission", "field electron emission" and "electron field emission".

Equations in this article are written using the [[International System of Quantities]] (ISQ). This is the modern (post-1970s) international system, based around the rationalized-meter-kilogram-second (rmks) system of equations, which is used to define SI units. Older field emission literature (and papers that directly copy equations from old literature) often write some equations using an older equation system that does not use the quantity [[Vacuum permittivity|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]. In this article, all such equations have been converted to modern international form. For clarity, this should always be done.

Since work function is normally given in electronvolts (eV), and it is often convenient to measure fields in volts per nanometer (V/nm), values of most universal constants are given here in units involving the eV, V and nm. Increasingly, this is normal practice in field emission research. However, all equations here are ISQ-compatible equations and remain dimensionally consistent, as is required by the modern international system. To indicate their status, numerical values of universal constants are given to seven significant figures. Values are derived using the 2006 values of the fundamental constants.

==Early history of field electron emission==
Field electron emission has a long, complicated and messy history. This section covers the early history, up to the derivation of the original Fowler–Nordheim-type equation in 1928.

In retrospect, it seems likely that the electrical discharges reported by Winkler&lt;ref name=Winkler1744&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gedanken von den Eigenschaften, Wirkungen und Ursachen der Electricität nebst Beschreibung zweiner electrischer Maschinen|year = 1744|author = Winkler, J.H.|publisher = Book Chapter Breitkopf|location = Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1744 were started by CFE from his wire electrode. However, meaningful investigations had to wait until after [[J.J. Thomson]]'s&lt;ref name=Thomson1897&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cathode Rays|date = October 1897|last = Thomson|first = J.J.|authorlink=J. J. Thomson|journal = Phil.

After 1922, experimental interest increased, particularly in the groups led by [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Millikan]] at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in [[Pasadena, California]],&lt;ref name=Millikan1926&gt;{{cite journal|title = Laws governing the pulling of electrons out of metals under intense electrical fields|year = 1926|journal = Phys.

Schottky |doi=10.1007/bf01340034|bibcode = 1923ZPhy...14...63S }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested in 1923 that the effect might be due to thermally induced emission over a field-reduced barrier. If so, then plots of log(''i'') vs. {{sqrt|''V''}} should be straight, but they were not.{{r|Millikan1926}} Nor is Schottky's explanation compatible with the experimental observation of only very weak temperature dependence in CFE{{r|Lilienfeld1922}} – a point initially overlooked.{{r|Richardson}}

A breakthrough came when [[Charles Christian Lauritsen|Lauritsen]]&lt;ref name=Millikan&gt;{{cite journal|title = Relations of field-currents to thermionic-currents|year = 1928|journal = [[PNAS]]|pages = 45–49|volume = 14|issue = 1|last1 = Millikan|first1 = R.A.|authorlink1 = Robert Andrews Millikan|last2 = Lauritsen|first2 = C.C.|authorlink2 = Charles Christian Lauritsen|doi = 10.1073/pnas.14.1.45|pmid = 16587302|pmc = 1085345|bibcode = 1928PNAS...14...45M|url = http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS::MILpnas28a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(and [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] independently&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer1928&gt;{{cite journal|title = Three notes on the quantum theory of aperiodic effects|year = 1928|author = Oppenheimer, J.R.|journal = Physical Review|pages = 66–81|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.31.66|bibcode = 1928PhRv...31...66O }}&lt;/ref&gt;) found that plots of log(''i'') vs. 1/''V'' yielded good straight lines. This result, published by Millikan and Lauritsen{{r|Millikan}} in early 1928, was known to [[Ralph H. Fowler|Fowler]] and [[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim|Nordheim]].

[[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] had predicted{{r|Oppenheimer1928}} that the field-induced tunneling of electrons from atoms (the effect now called field ionization) would have this ''i''(''V'') dependence, had found this dependence in the published experimental field emission results of Millikan and Eyring,{{r|Millikan1926}} and proposed that CFE was due to field-induced [[quantum tunnelling|tunneling]] of electrons [[atomic orbital|from atomic-like orbitals]] in surface metal atoms. An alternative Fowler–Nordheim theory{{r|Fowler1928}} explained both the Millikan-Lauritsen finding and the very weak dependence of current on temperature. Fowler–Nordheim theory predicted both to be consequences if CFE were due to field-induced tunneling from [[free electron model|free-electron-type states]] in what we would now call a metal [[electronic band structure|conduction band]], with the electron states occupied in accordance with [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].

In fact, [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] (although right in principle about the theory of field ionization) had mathematical details of his theory seriously incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Theory of the ionization of the hydrogen atom by an external electrostatic field|year = 1977|journal = Physical Review A|pages = 877–890|volume = 16|issue = 3|last1 = Yamabe|first1 = T.|last2 = Tachibana|first2 = A.|last3 = Silverstone|first3 = H.J.|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.16.877|bibcode = 1977PhRvA..16..877Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a small numerical error in the final equation given by Fowler–Nordheim theory for CFE [[current density]]: this was corrected in the 1929 paper of {{Harv|Stern|Gossling|Fowler|1929}}.&lt;ref name=Fowler1929&gt;{{cite journal|title = Further studies in the emission of electrons from cold metals|jstor = 95240|year = 1929|journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|pages = 699–723|last1 = Stern|first1 = T.E.|last2 = Gossling|first2 = B.S. |last3 = Fowler|first3 = R.H.|volume = 124|issue = 795|doi=10.1098/rspa.1929.0147|bibcode = 1929RSPSA.124..699S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly, if the barrier field in Fowler-Nordheim 1928 theory is exactly proportional to the applied voltage, and if the emission area is independent of voltage, then the Fowler-Nordheim 1928 theory predicts that plots of the form (log(''i''/''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) vs. 1/''V'') should be exact straight lines. However, contemporary experimental techniques were not good enough to distinguish between the Fowler-Nordheim theoretical result and the Millikan-Lauritsen experimental result.

Thus, by 1928 basic physical understanding of the origin of CFE from bulk metals had been achieved, and the original Fowler-Nordheim-type equation had been derived.

The literature often presents Fowler-Nordheim work as a proof of the existence of [[quantum tunnelling|electron tunneling]], as predicted by wave-mechanics. Whilst this is correct, the validity of wave-mechanics was largely accepted by 1928. The more important role of the Fowler-Nordheim paper was that it was a convincing argument from experiment that [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] applied to the behavior of electrons in metals, as suggested by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]]&lt;ref name=Sommerfeld1927&gt;{{cite journal|year = 1927|author = Sommerfeld, A.|journal = Naturwissenschaften|page = 825|volume = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1927. The success of Fowler–Nordheim theory did much to support the correctness of Sommerfeld's ideas, and greatly helped to establish modern [[Electronic band structure|electron band theory]].&lt;ref name=som1963&gt;{{cite journal|title = Handbuch der Physik|year = 1963|journal = Julius Springer-Verlag|volume = 24|last1 = Sommerfeld|first1 = A.|last2= Beth|first2 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the original Fowler-Nordheim-type equation was one of the first to incorporate the [[Statistical mechanics|statistical-mechanical]] consequences of the existence of [[electron spin]] into the theory of an experimental condensed-matter effect. The Fowler-Nordheim paper also established the physical basis for a unified treatment of field-induced and [[Thermionic emission|thermally induced electron emission]].{{r|som1963}} Prior to 1928 it had been hypothesized that two types of electrons, "thermions" and "conduction electrons", existed in metals, and that thermally emitted electron currents were due to the emission of thermions, but that field-emitted currents were due to the emission of conduction electrons. The Fowler-Nordheim 1928 work suggested that thermions did not need to exist as a separate class of internal electrons: electrons could come from a single [[Electronic band structure|band]] occupied in accordance with Fermi–Dirac statistics, but would be emitted in statistically different ways under different conditions of temperature and applied field.

The ideas of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]], [[Ralph H. Fowler|Fowler]] and [[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim|Nordheim]] were also an important stimulus to the development, by [[George Gamow|Gamow]],&lt;ref&gt;''Z. Physik'' '''5'''1, 204 (1928) G. Gamow, "Zur Quantentheorie des Atomkernes".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ronald W.

==Practical applications: past and present==

===Field electron microscopy and related basics===
As already indicated, the early experimental work on field electron emission (1910–1920) &lt;ref name="Lilienfeld1922"/&gt; was driven by [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld|Lilienfeld's]] desire to develop miniaturized [[X-ray]] tubes for medical applications. However, it was too early for this technology to succeed.

After Fowler-Nordheim theoretical work in 1928, a major advance came with the development in 1937 by [[Erwin Wilhelm Mueller|Erwin W. Mueller]] of the spherical-geometry [[field emission microscope|field electron microscope]] (FEM) &lt;ref name=Mueller1937&gt;{{cite journal|year = 1937|author = Mueller, E.W.|journal = Z. Phys.|pages = 541–550|volume = 106|doi = 10.1007/BF01339895|title = Elektronenmikroskopische Beobachtungen von Feldkathoden|bibcode = 1937ZPhy..106..541M|issue = 9–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also called the "field emission microscope"). In this instrument, the electron emitter is a sharply pointed wire, of apex radius ''r''. This is placed, in a vacuum enclosure, opposite an image detector (originally a phosphor screen), at a distance ''R'' from it. The microscope screen shows a projection image of the distribution of current-density ''J'' across the emitter apex, with magnification approximately (''R''/''r''), typically 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. In FEM studies the apex radius is typically 100&amp;nbsp;nm to 1 μm. The tip of the pointed wire, when referred to as a physical object, has been called a "field emitter", a "tip", or (recently) a "Mueller emitter".

When the emitter surface is clean, this FEM image is characteristic of: (a) the material from which the emitter is made: (b) the orientation of the material relative to the needle/wire axis; and (c) to some extent, the shape of the emitter endform. In the FEM image, dark areas correspond to regions where the local work function ''φ'' is relatively high and/or the local barrier field ''F'' is relatively low, so ''J'' is relatively low; the light areas correspond to regions where ''φ'' is relatively low and/or ''F'' is relatively high, so ''J'' is relatively high. This is as predicted by the exponent of Fowler-Nordheim-type equations [see eq. (30) below].

The [[adsorption]] of layers of gas atoms (such as oxygen) onto the emitter surface, or part of it, can create surface [[electric dipole]]s that change the local work function of this part of the surface. This affects the FEM image; also, the change of work-function can be measured using a Fowler-Nordheim plot (see below). Thus, the FEM became an early observational tool of [[surface science]].&lt;ref name=Gomer1961&gt;{{Cite book|title = Field emission and field ionization|year = 1961|author = Gomer, R.|publisher = Harvard Univ. Press|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn = 1-56396-124-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Recent advances in field electron microscopy of metals|year = 1975|journal =Advances in Electronics and Electron Physics|pages = 193–309|volume = 32|last1 = Swanson|first1 = L.W.|last2 = Bell|first2 = A.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 1960s, FEM results contributed significantly to discussions on [[heterogeneous catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;"The role of the adsorbed state in heterogeneous catalysis", Discuss. Faraday Soc., Vol. 41 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; FEM has also been used for studies of [[surface diffusion|surface-atom diffusion]]. However, FEM has now been almost completely superseded by newer surface-science techniques.

A consequence of FEM development, and subsequent experimentation, was that it became possible to identify (from FEM image inspection) when an emitter was "clean", and hence exhibiting its clean-surface work-function as established by other techniques. This was important in experiments designed to test the validity of the standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation.&lt;ref name=Dyke1953&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Field emission: Large current densities, space charge, and the vacuum arc

Agreement to within about 10% was achieved. Only very recently&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Field emission from crystalline niobium|year = 2009|journal = Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams

Analysis of the resulting Fowler-Nordheim plot yields a work-function value close to the independently known work-function of the emitter.

===Field electron spectroscopy (electron energy analysis)===
Energy distribution measurements of field-emitted electrons were first reported in 1939.&lt;ref name=AH39/&gt; In 1959 it was realized theoretically by Young,&lt;ref name=Y59&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.113.110|title=Theoretical Total-Energy Distribution of Field-Emitted Electrons|year=1959|last1=Young|first1=Russell D.|journal=Physical Review|volume=113|pages=110–114|bibcode = 1959PhRv..113..110Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed experimentally by Young and Mueller&lt;ref name=YM59&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.113.115|title=Experimental Measurement of the Total-Energy Distribution of Field-Emitted Electrons|year=1959|last1=Young|first1=Russell D.|last2=Müller|first2=Erwin W.|journal=Physical Review|volume=113|pages=115–120|bibcode = 1959PhRv..113..115Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the quantity measured in spherical geometry was the distribution of the total energy of the emitted electron (its "total energy distribution"). This is because, in spherical geometry, the electrons move in such a fashion that [[angular momentum]] about a point in the emitter is very nearly conserved. Hence any [[kinetic energy]] that, at emission, is in a direction parallel to the emitter surface gets converted into energy associated with the radial direction of motion. So what gets measured in an energy analyzer is the [[total energy]] at emission.

With the development of sensitive electron energy analyzers in the 1960s, it became possible to measure fine details of the total energy distribution. These reflect fine details of the [[surface physics]], and the technique of Field Electron Spectroscopy flourished for a while, before being superseded by newer surface-science techniques.&lt;ref name=mo84&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

===Field electron emitters as electron-gun sources===
To achieve high-resolution in [[transmission electron microscope|electron microscopes]] and other electron beam instruments (such as those used for [[electron beam lithography]]), it is helpful to start with an electron source that is small, optically bright and stable. Sources based on the geometry of a Mueller emitter qualify well on the first two criteria. The first [[electron microscope]] (EM) observation of an individual atom was made by Crewe, Wall and Langmore in 1970,&lt;ref name=CWL70&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.168.3937.1338|title=Visibility of Single Atoms|year=1970|last1=Crewe|first1=A. V.|last2=Wall|first2=J.|last3=Langmore|first3=J.|journal=Science|volume=168|pages=1338–40|pmid=17731040|issue=3937|bibcode = 1970Sci...168.1338C }}&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[scanning electron microscope]] equipped with an early field emission gun.

From the 1950s onwards, extensive effort has been devoted to the development of field emission sources for use in [[electron gun]]s.&lt;ref name=Ch95&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0169-4332(95)00517-X|title=Developing and using the field emitter as a high intensity electron source|year=1996|last1=Charbonnier|first1=F|journal=Applied Surface Science|volume=94-95|pages=26–43|bibcode = 1996ApSS...94...26C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OR08&gt;{{cite book|editor=J.Orloff|title=Handbook of Charged Particle Optics|edition=2|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.W. Swanson and A.E. Bell, Adv. Electron. Electron Phys. 32 (1973) 193&lt;/ref&gt; [e.g., DD53] Methods have been developed for generating on-axis beams, either by field-induced emitter build-up, or by selective deposition of a low-work-function [[adsorption|adsorbate]] (usually [[Zirconium oxide]] - ZrO) into the flat apex of a [[Miller index|(100) oriented]] [[Tungsten]] emitter.&lt;ref name=Sw75&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1116/1.568503|title=Comparative study of the zirconiated and built-up W thermal-field cathode|year=1975|last1=Swanson|first1=L. W.|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology|volume=12|page=1228|bibcode = 1975JVST...12.1228S|issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources that operate at room temperature have the disadvantage that they rapidly become covered with adsorbate [[molecule]]s that arrive from the [[vacuum]] system walls, and the emitter has to be cleaned from time to time by "flashing" to high temperature. Nowadays, it is more common to use Mueller-emitter-based sources that are operated at elevated temperatures, either in the [[Thermionic emission|Schottky emission]] regime or in the so-called temperature-field intermediate regime. Many modern high-resolution electron microscopes and electron beam instruments use some form of Mueller-emitter-based electron source. Currently, attempts are being made to develop [[carbon nanotubes]] (CNTs) as electron-gun field emission sources.&lt;ref name=Milne/&gt;&lt;ref name=JB04&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rsta.2004.1438|title=Carbon nanotube electron sources and applications|year=2004|last1=De Jonge|first1=Niels|last2=Bonard|first2=Jean-Marc|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A|volume=362|pages=2239–66|pmid=15370480|issue=1823|bibcode = 2004RSPTA.362.2239D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various shape models have been tried for Mueller emitters; the best seems to be the "Sphere on Orthogonal Cone" (SOC) model introduced by Dyke, Trolan.

The design of efficient modern field-emission electron guns requires highly specialized expertise.

===Atomically sharp emitters===
Nowadays it is possible to prepare very sharp emitters, including emitters that end in a single atom. In this case, electron emission comes from an area about twice the crystallographic size of a single atom. This was demonstrated by comparing FEM and [[field ion microscope]] (FIM) images of the emitter.&lt;ref name=Fi88&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/38/2/029|title=Point source for ions and electrons|year=1988|last1=Fink|first1=Hans-Werner|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=38|pages=260–263|bibcode = 1988PhyS...38..260F|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-atom-apex Mueller emitters also have relevance to the [[scanning probe microscopy]] and [[scanning Helium Ion Microscope|helium scanning ion microscopy]] (He SIM).&lt;ref name=WNB06&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1116/1.2357967|title=Helium ion microscope: A new tool for nanoscale microscopy and metrology|year=2006|last1=Ward|first1=B.

===Large-area field emission sources: vacuum nanoelectronics===

====Materials aspects====
Large-area field emission sources have been of interest since the 1970s. In these devices, a high density of individual field emission sites is created on a substrate (originally silicon). This research area became known, first as "vacuum microelectronics", now as "vacuum nanoelectronics".

One of the original two device types, the "[[Spindt tip|Spindt array]]",&lt;ref name=SBHW76&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.322600|title=Physical properties of thin-film field emission cathodes with molybdenum cones|year=1976|last1=Spindt|first1=C. A.|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=47|pages=5248–5263|bibcode = 1976JAP....47.5248S|issue=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; used [[integrated circuit|silicon-integrated-circuit (IC)]] fabrication techniques to make regular arrays in which [[molybdenum]] cones were deposited in small cylindrical voids in an oxide film, with the void covered by a counterelectrode with a central circular aperture. This overall geometry has also been used with [[carbon nanotubes]] grown in the void.

The other original device type was the "Latham emitter".&lt;ref name=la95&gt;{{cite book|editor=R.V. Latham|title=High-Voltage Vacuum Insulation: Basic Concepts and Technological Practice|publisher=Academic, London|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=F01&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0038-1101(00)00208-2|title=Low-macroscopic-field electron emission from carbon films and other electrically nanostructured heterogeneous materials: hypotheses about emission mechanism|year=2001|last1=Forbes|first1=R|journal=Solid-State Electronics|volume=45|pages=779–808|bibcode=2001SSEle..45..779F|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were MIMIV (metal-insulator-metal-insulator-vacuum) – or, more generally, CDCDV (conductor-dielectric-conductor-dielectric-vacuum) – devices that contained conducting particulates in a dielectric film. The device field-emits because its microstructure/nanostructure has field-enhancing properties. This material had a potential production advantage, in that it could be deposited as an "ink", so IC fabrication techniques were not needed. However, in practice, uniformly reliable devices proved difficult to fabricate.

Research advanced to look for other materials that could be deposited/grown as thin films with suitable field-enhancing properties. In a parallel-plate arrangement, the "macroscopic" field ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; between the plates is given by ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = ''V''/''W'', where ''W'' is the plate separation and ''V'' is the applied voltage. If a sharp object is created on one plate, then the local field ''F'' at its apex is greater than ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and can be related to ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt; F = \gamma F_{\mathrm{M}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The parameter ''γ'' is called the "field enhancement factor" and is basically determined by the object's shape. Since field emission characteristics are determined by the local field ''F'', then the higher the ''γ''-value of the object, then the lower the value of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; at which significant emission occurs. Hence, for a given value of ''W'', the lower the applied voltage ''V'' at which significant emission occurs.

For a roughly ten year-period from the mid-1990s, there was great interest in field emission from plasma-deposited films of [[diamond like carbon|amorphous and "diamond-like" carbon]].&lt;ref name=Ro02&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0927-796X(02)00005-0|title=Diamond-like amorphous carbon|year=2002|last1=Robertson|first1=J|journal=Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports|volume=37|pages=129–281|issue=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.R.P. Silva |author2=J.D. Carey |author3=R.U.A. Khan |author4=E.G. Gerstner |author5=J.V. Anguita |chapter=9|title=Handbook of Thin Film Materials|editor=H.S. Nalwa|publisher=Academic, London|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, interest subsequently lessened, partly due to the arrival of [[carbon nanotube|CNT]] emitters, and partly because evidence emerged that the emission sites might be associated with particulate carbon objects created in an unknown way during the [[chemical vapor deposition|deposition process]]: this suggested that [[quality control]] of an industrial-scale production process might be problematic.

The introduction of CNT field emitters,&lt;ref name=JB04/&gt; both in "mat" form and in "grown array" forms, was a significant step forward. Extensive research has been undertaken into both their physical characteristics and possible technological applications.&lt;ref name=Milne/&gt; For field emission, an advantage of CNTs is that, due to their shape, with its high [[aspect ratio]], they are "natural field-enhancing objects".

In recent years there has also been massive growth in interest in the development of other forms of thin-film emitter, both those based on other carbon forms (such as "carbon nanowalls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hojati-Talemi | first1 = P. | last2 = Simon | first2 = G. | year = | title = Field emission study of graphene nanowalls prepared by microwave-plasma method | url = | journal = Carbon | volume = 49 | issue = 8| pages = 2875–2877 | doi = 10.1016/j.carbon.2011.03.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ") and on various forms of wide-band-gap semiconductor.&lt;ref name=XH05&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.mser.2004.12.001|title=Novel cold cathode materials and applications|year=2005|last1=Xu|first1=N|last2=Huq|first2=S|journal=Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports|volume=48|pages=47–189|issue=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular aim is to develop "high-''γ''" nanostructures with a sufficiently high density of individual emission sites.

Common problems with all field emission devices, particularly those that operate in "industrial vacuum conditions" is that the emission performance can be degraded by the adsorption of gas atoms arriving from elsewhere in the system, and the emitter shape can be in principle be modified deleteriously by a variety of unwanted subsidiary processes, such as bombardment by ions created by the impact of emitted electrons onto gas-phase atoms and/or onto the surface of counter-electrodes. Thus, an important industrial requirement is "robustness in poor vacuum conditions"; this needs to be taken into account in research on new emitter materials.

At the time of writing, the most promising forms of large-area field emission source (certainly in terms of achieved average emission current density) seem to be [[Spindt tip|Spindt arrays]] and the various forms of source based on CNTs.

====Applications====
The development of large-area field emission sources was originally driven by the wish to create new, more efficient, forms of [[flat panel display|electronic information display]]. These are known as "[[field emission display]]s" or "nano-emissive displays". Although several prototypes have been demonstrated,&lt;ref name=Milne/&gt; the development of such displays into reliable commercial products has been hindered by a variety of industrial production problems not directly related to the source characteristics [En08].

Other proposed applications of large-area field emission sources&lt;ref name=Milne&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milne WI |title=E nano newsletter |date=Sep 2008 |issue=13 |url=http://www.phantomsnet.net/Foundation/Enano_newsletter13.php|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; include [[microwave]] generation, space-vehicle neutralization, [[X-ray generation]], and (for array sources) multiple [[electron beam lithography|e-beam lithography]]. There are also recent attempts to develop large-area emitters on flexible substrates, in line with wider trends towards "[[plastic electronics]]".

The development of such applications is the mission of vacuum nanoelectronics. However, field emitters work best in conditions of good ultrahigh vacuum. Their most successful applications to date (FEM, FES and EM guns) have occurred in these conditions. The sad fact remains that field emitters and industrial vacuum conditions do not go well together, and the related problems of reliably ensuring good "vacuum robustness" of field emission sources used in such conditions still await better solutions (probably cleverer materials solutions) than we currently have.

===Vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge phenomena===
As already indicated, it is now thought that the earliest manifestations of field electron emission were the electrical discharges it caused. After Fowler-Nordheim work, it was understood that CFE was one of the possible primary underlying causes of vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge phenomena. (The detailed mechanisms and pathways involved can be very complicated, and there is no single universal cause)&lt;ref name=Mil03&gt;{{cite news|url=http://isdeiv.lbl.gov/MillerBiblio/WBib2000Txt.htm |title=Bibliography: electrical discharges in vacuum: 1877-2000 |date=November 2003 |author=H. Craig Miller |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113184640/http://isdeiv.lbl.gov/MillerBiblio/WBib2000Txt.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where vacuum breakdown is known to be caused by electron emission from a cathode, then the original thinking was that the mechanism was CFE from small conducting needle-like surface protrusions. Procedures were (and are) used to round and smooth the surfaces of electrodes that might generate unwanted field electron emission currents. However the work of Latham and others&lt;ref name=la95/&gt; showed that emission could also be associated with the presence of semiconducting inclusions in smooth surfaces. The physics of how the emission is generated is still not fully understood, but suspicion exists that so-called "triple-junction effects" may be involved. Further information may be found in Latham's book&lt;ref name=la95/&gt; and in the on-line bibliography.&lt;ref name=Mil03/&gt;

===Internal electron transfer in electronic devices===
In some electronic devices, electron transfer from one material to another, or (in the case of sloping bands) from one band to another ("[[Zener diode|Zener tunneling]]"), takes place by a field-induced tunneling process that can be regarded as a form of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. For example, [[Emlyn Rhoderick|Rhoderick's]] book discusses the theory relevant to [[metal-semiconductor junction|metal-semiconductor contacts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rhoderick|first1= E. H.|authorlink1= Emlyn Rhoderick|title= Metal-Semiconductor Contacts|year= 1978|publisher= [[Clarendon Press]]|location= Oxford|isbn= 0-19-859323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fowler–Nordheim tunneling==

===Introduction===
The next part of this article deals with the basic theory of cold field electron emission from bulk metals. This is best treated in four main stages, involving theory associated with: (1) derivation of a formula for "[[transmission coefficient|escape probability]]", by considering [[quantum tunnelling|electron tunneling]] through a rounded triangular barrier; (2) an integration over internal electron states to obtain the "total energy distribution"; (3) a second integration, to obtain the emission current density as a function of local barrier field and local work function; (4) conversion of this to a formula for current as a function of applied voltage. The modified equations needed for large-area emitters, and issues of experimental data analysis, are dealt with separately.

Fowler–Nordheim tunneling is the [[quantum tunnelling|wave-mechanical tunneling]] of an electron through an exact or rounded triangular barrier. Two basic situations are recognized: (1) when the electron is initially in a [[surface states|localized state]]; (2) when the electron is initially not strongly localized, and is best represented by a [[travelling wave]]. Emission from a bulk metal [[conduction band]] is a situation of the second type, and discussion here relates to this case. It is also assumed that the barrier is one-dimensional (i.e., has no lateral structure), and has no fine-scale structure that causes "[[scattering]]" or "resonance" effects. To keep this explanation of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling relatively simple, these assumptions are needed; but the atomic structure of matter is in effect being disregarded.

===Motive energy===
For an electron, the one-dimensional [[Schrödinger equation]] can be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \Psi(x)}{\mathrm{d}x^2} = \left[U(x)-E_{\mathrm{n}}\right]\Psi(x) = M(x)\Psi(x), \qquad \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

where Ψ(''x'') is the electron [[wave function|wave-function]], expressed as a function of distance ''x'' measured from the emitter's electrical surface,&lt;ref name=F99&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0304-3991(99)00098-4|title=The electrical surface as centroid of the surface-induced charge|year=1999|last1=Forbes|first1=R|journal=Ultramicroscopy|volume=79|pages=25–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''m'' is the electron mass, ''U''(''x'') is the [[potential energy|electron potential energy]], ''E''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[total energy|total electron energy]] associated with motion in the ''x''-direction, and ''M''(''x'') {{nowrap| {{=}} [''U''(''x'') &amp;minus; ''E''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]}} is called the electron motive energy.&lt;ref name=HN49&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.21.185|title=Thermionic Emission|year=1949|last1=Herring|first1=Conyers|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=21|pages=185–270|last2=Nichols|first2=M.|bibcode=1949RvMP...21..185H|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''M''(''x'') can be interpreted as the negative of the electron kinetic energy associated with the motion of a hypothetical classical point electron in the ''x''-direction, and is positive in the barrier.

The shape of a tunneling barrier is determined by how ''M''(''x'') varies with position in the region where ''M''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0. Two models have special status in field emission theory: the ''exact triangular (ET) barrier'' and the ''Schottky&amp;ndash;Nordheim (SN) barrier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W. Schottky|journal=Phys. Z.|volume=15|year=1914|page=872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=n28b&gt;{{cite journal|author=L.W. Nordheim|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | volume=121|year=1928|pages=626–639|doi=10.1098/rspa.1928.0222|title=The Effect of the Image Force on the Emission and Reflexion of Electrons by Metals|bibcode = 1928RSPSA.121..626N|issue=788 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are given by equations (2) and (3), respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;M^{\mathrm{ET}}(x) = h - eFx \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\;\;\; (2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M^{\rm{SN}}(x) = h - eFx -e^2/(16\pi\varepsilon_0 x), \qquad\qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''h'' is the zero-field height (or ''unreduced height'') of the barrier, ''e'' is the [[elementary charge|elementary positive charge]], ''F'' is the barrier field, and ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity|electric constant]]. By convention, ''F'' is taken as positive, even though the [[electric field|classical electrostatic field]] would be negative.  The SN equation uses the classical image potential energy to represent the physical effect "correlation and exchange".

===Escape probability===
For an electron approaching a given barrier from the inside, the ''probability of escape'' (or "[[transmission coefficient]]" or "penetration coefficient") is a function of ''h'' and ''F'', and is denoted by ''D''(''h'',''F''). The primary aim of tunneling theory is to calculate ''D''(''h'',''F''). For physically realistic barrier models, such as the Schottky-Nordheim barrier, the [[Schrödinger equation]] cannot be solved exactly in any simple way. The following so-called "semi-classical" approach can be used. A parameter ''G''(''h'',''F'') can be defined by the [[WKB|JWKB (Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin)]] integral:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=H. Jeffreys|journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society |volume=23|year=1924|pages=428–436| doi = 10.1112/plms/s2-23.1.428|title=On Certain Approximate Solutions of Lineae Differential Equations of the Second Order}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G(h, F) = g\int M^{1/2}\mbox{d}x, \qquad\qquad (4)&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is taken across the barrier (i.e., across the region where ''M''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0), and the parameter ''g'' is a universal constant given by

:&lt;math&gt; g \,= 2\sqrt{2m}/\hbar \approx 10.24624 \; {\rm{eV}}^{-1/2}\; {\rm{nm}}^{-1}. \qquad\qquad (5)&lt;/math&gt;

Forbes has re-arranged a result proved by Fröman and Fröman, to show that, formally – in a one-dimensional treatment – the exact solution for ''D'' can be written&lt;ref name=F08c&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.2937077|title=On the need for a tunneling pre-factor in Fowler–Nordheim tunneling theory|year=2008|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=103|page=114911|bibcode = 2008JAP...103k4911F|issue=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\,D = \frac{P\mathrm{e}^{-G}}{1 + P\mathrm{e}^{-G}}, \qquad\qquad (6)&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''tunneling pre-factor'' ''P'' can in principle be evaluated by complicated iterative integrations along a path in [[Complex Hilbert space|complex space]].&lt;ref name=F08c/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Fröman and P.O. Fröman, "JWKB approximation: contributions to the theory" (North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; In the CFE regime we have (by definition) ''G''&amp;nbsp;≫&amp;nbsp;1. Also, for simple models ''P''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1. So eq. (6) reduces to the so-called simple [[WKB|JWKB]] formula:

:&lt;math&gt;D\approx P \mathrm{e}^{-G} \approx \mathrm{e}^{-G}. \qquad\qquad (7)&lt;/math&gt;

For the exact triangular barrier, putting eq. (2) into eq. (4) yields {{nowrap|''G''&lt;sup&gt;ET&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''bh''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;/''F''}}, where

:&lt;math&gt; b = \frac{2g}{3e} = \frac{4\sqrt{2 m}}{3e\hbar} \approx 6.830890 \; {\mathrm{eV}}^{-3/2} \; \mathrm{V} \; {\mathrm{nm}}^{-1}. \qquad\qquad (8) &lt;/math&gt;

This parameter ''b'' is a universal constant sometimes called the ''second Fowler&amp;ndash;Nordheim constant''. For barriers of other shapes, we write

:&lt;math&gt;G(h, F) = \nu(h, F) G^{\mathrm{ET}} = \nu(h, F)b h^{3/2}/F, \qquad\qquad (9)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ν''(''h'',''F'') is a correction factor that in general has to be determined by [[numerical integration]], using eq. (4).

===Correction factor for the Schottky–Nordheim barrier===
The Schottky-Nordheim barrier, which is the barrier model used in deriving the standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation,&lt;ref name=fd07&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2007.0030|title=Reformulation of the standard theory of Fowler–Nordheim tunnelling and cold field electron emission|year=2007|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|last2=Deane|first2=Jonathan H.B.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|volume=463|pages=2907–2927|bibcode = 2007RSPSA.463.2907F|issue=2087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a special case. In this case, it is known that the correction factor &lt;math&gt; \it{\nu} &lt;/math&gt; is a function of a single variable ''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', defined by ''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''F''/''F&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''F&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the field necessary to reduce the height of a Schottky&amp;ndash;Nordheim barrier from ''h'' to 0. This field is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \, F_h = (4\pi \epsilon_0/e^3) h^2 = (0.6944617 \; \mathrm{V}\; {\mathrm{nm}}^{-1})(h/{\rm{eV}})^2. \qquad\qquad (10) &lt;/math&gt;

The parameter ''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' runs from 0 to 1, and may be called the ''scaled barrier field'', for a Schottky-Nordheim barrier of zero-field height ''h''.

For the Schottky&amp;ndash;Nordheim barrier, ''ν''(''h'',''F'') is given by the particular value ''ν''(''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'') of a function ''ν''(''ℓ&amp;prime;''). The latter is a function of mathematical physics in its own right and has been called the ''principal Schottky&amp;ndash;Nordheim barrier function''. An explicit series expansion for ''ν''(''ℓ&amp;prime;'') is derived in a 2008 paper by J. Deane.&lt;ref name=DF08&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/41/39/395301|title=The formal derivation of an exact series expansion for the principal Schottky–Nordheim barrier function, using the Gauss hypergeometric differential equation|year=2008|last1=Deane|first1=Jonathan H B|last2=Forbes|first2=Richard G|journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical|volume=41|page=395301|bibcode = 2008JPhA...41M5301D|issue=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following good simple approximation for ''ν''(''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'') has been found:&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v(f_h) \approx 1 - f_h + \tfrac{1}{6} f_h\ln f_h...........\rm{(11)} &lt;/math&gt;

===Decay width===
The ''decay width'' (in energy), ''d&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', measures how fast the [[transmission coefficient|escape probability]] ''D'' decreases as the barrier height ''h'' increases; ''d&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{d_h} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}(\ln D)}{\mathrm{d}h}. \qquad\qquad (12) &lt;/math&gt;

When ''h'' increases by ''d&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' then the escape probability ''D'' decreases by a factor close to e (&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;2.718282). For an elementary model, based on the exact triangular barrier, where we put ''ν''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''P''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1, we get

:&lt;math&gt;d_h^{\mathrm{(el)}} = \frac{2F}{3b\sqrt{h}} = \frac{e F}{g \sqrt{h}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The decay width ''d&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' derived from the more general expression (12) differs from this by a "decay-width correction factor" ''λ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'', so:

:&lt;math&gt;d_h=  \lambda_d d_h^{\mathrm{(el)}} = \frac{\lambda_d e F}{g \sqrt{h}}. \qquad\qquad (13)&lt;/math&gt;

Usually, the correction factor can be approximated as unity.

The decay-width ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; for a barrier with ''h'' equal to the local work-function ''φ'' is of special interest. Numerically this is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; d_{\mathrm{F}}= \frac{\lambda_d e F}{g \sqrt{\phi}}  \approx \frac{e F}{g \sqrt{\phi}} \approx 0.09759678 \; \mathrm{eV} \, \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1\ \mathrm{eV}}{\phi}} \cdot \frac{F}{1\ \mathrm{V}\ \mathrm{nm}^{-1}}. \qquad\qquad (14)&lt;/math&gt;

For metals, the value of ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is typically of order 0.2&amp;nbsp;eV, but varies with barrier-field ''F''.

===Comments===
A historical note is necessary. The idea that the Schottky-Nordheim barrier needed a correction factor, as in eq. (9), was introduced by Nordheim in 1928,&lt;ref name=n28b/&gt; but his mathematical analysis of the factor was incorrect. A new (correct) function was introduced by Burgess, [[Herbert Kroemer|Kroemer]] and Houston&lt;ref name=BKH53&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.90.515|title=Corrected Values of Fowler-Nordheim Field Emission Functions v(y) and s(y)|year=1953|last1=Burgess|first1=R. E.|last2=Houston|first2=J. M.|journal=Physical Review|volume=90|page=515|last3=Houston|first3=J.|bibcode = 1953PhRv...90..515B|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953, and its mathematics was developed further by Murphy and Good in 1956.&lt;ref name=MG56&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.102.1464|title=Thermionic Emission, Field Emission, and the Transition Region|year=1956|last1=Murphy|first1=E. L.|last2=Good|first2=R. H.|journal=Physical Review|volume=102|pages=1464–1473|bibcode = 1956PhRv..102.1464M|issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This corrected function, sometimes known as a "special field emission elliptic function", was expressed as a function of a mathematical variable ''y'' known as the "Nordheim parameter". Only recently (2006 to 2008) has it been realized that, mathematically, it is much better to use the variable ''ℓ&amp;prime;'' {{nowrap|( {{=}} ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. And only recently has it been possible to complete the definition of ''ν''(''ℓ&amp;prime;'') by developing and proving the validity of an exact series expansion for this function (by starting from known special-case solutions of the Gauss [[hypergeometric differential equation]]). Also, approximation (11) has been found only recently. Approximation (11) outperforms, and will presumably eventually displace, all older approximations of equivalent complexity. These recent developments, and their implications, will probably have a significant impact on field emission research in due course.

The following summary brings these results together. For tunneling well below the top of a well-behaved barrier of reasonable height, the escape probability ''D''(''h'',''F'') is given formally by:

:&lt;math&gt;D(h, F) \approx P\exp\left[-\frac{\nu(h, F) bh^{3/2}}{F}\right], \qquad\qquad (15)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ν''(''h'',''F'') is a correction factor that in general has to be found by numerical integration. For the special case of a Schottky-Nordheim barrier, an analytical result exists and ''ν''(''h'',''F'') is given by ''ν''(''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''), as discussed above; approximation (11) for ''ν''(''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'') is more than sufficient for all technological purposes. The pre-factor ''P'' is also in principle a function of ''h'' and (maybe) ''F'', but for the simple physical models discussed here it is usually satisfactory to make the approximation ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. The exact triangular barrier is a special case where the [[Schrödinger equation]] can be solved exactly, as was done by Fowler and Nordheim;&lt;ref name="Fowler1928"/&gt; for this physically unrealistic case, ''ν''(''f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and an analytical approximation for ''P'' exists.

The approach described here was originally developed to describe Fowler&amp;ndash;Nordheim tunneling from smooth, classically flat, planar emitting surfaces. It is adequate for smooth, classical curved surfaces of radii down to about 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;nm. It can be adapted to surfaces of sharper radius, but quantities such as ''ν'' and ''D'' then become significant functions of the parameter(s) used to describe the surface curvature. When the emitter is so sharp that atomic-level detail cannot be neglected, and/or the tunneling barrier is thicker than the emitter-apex dimensions, then a more sophisticated approach is desirable.

As noted at the beginning, the effects of the atomic structure of materials are disregarded in the relatively simple treatments of field electron emission discussed here. Taking atomic structure properly into account is a very difficult problem, and only limited progress has been made.&lt;ref name=mo84/&gt; However, it seems probable that the main influences on the theory of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling will (in effect) be to change the values of ''P'' and ''ν'' in eq. (15), by amounts that cannot easily be estimated at present.

All these remarks apply in principle to Fowler&amp;nbsp;Nordheim tunneling from any conductor where (before tunneling) the electrons may be treated as in [[travelling wave|travelling-wave states]]. The approach may be adapted to apply (approximately) to situations where the electrons are initially in [[surface states|localized states]] at or very close inside the emitting surface, but this is beyond the scope of this article.

==Total-energy distribution==

The energy distribution of the emitted electrons is important both for scientific experiments that use the emitted electron energy distribution to probe aspects of the emitter [[surface physics]]&lt;ref name=GP73/&gt; and for the field emission sources used in electron beam instruments such as [[electron microscopes]].&lt;ref name=HK96/&gt; In the latter case, the "width" (in energy) of the distribution influences how finely the beam can be focused.

The theoretical explanation here follows the approach of Forbes.&lt;ref name=F04&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/sia.1900|title=Use of energy-space diagrams in free-electron models of field electron emission|year=2004|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|journal=Surface and Interface Analysis|volume=36|pages=395–401|issue=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''ε'' denotes the [[total energy|total electron energy]] relative to the emitter Fermi level, and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[kinetic energy]] of the electron parallel to the emitter surface, then the electron's ''normal energy'' ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (sometimes called its "forwards energy") is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \; \epsilon_{\mathrm{n}} = \epsilon - K_{\mathrm{p}}...........(16) &lt;/math&gt;.

Two types of theoretical energy distribution are recognized: the ''normal-energy distribution'' (NED), which shows how the energy ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is distributed immediately after emission (i.e., immediately outside the tunneling barrier); and the ''total-energy distribution'', which shows how the total energy ''ε'' is distributed. When the emitter Fermi level is used as the reference zero level, both ''ε'' and ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; can be either positive or negative.

Energy analysis experiments have been made on field emitters since the 1930s. However, only in the late 1950s was it realized (by Young and Mueller&lt;ref name=Y59/&gt; [,YM58]) that these experiments always measured the total energy distribution, which is now usually denoted by ''j''(''ε''). This is also true (or nearly true) when the emission comes from a small field enhancing protrusion on an otherwise flat surface.&lt;ref name=GP73/&gt;

To see how the total energy distribution can be calculated within the framework of a [[free electron model|Sommerfeld free-electron-type model]], look at the ''P-T energy-space diagram'' (P-T="parallel-total").
&lt;gallery widths=400px heights=300ps&gt;
Image:P-T_Energy_Space.pdf|Fig. 1. P-T energy-space diagram, showing the region in P-T energy space where traveling-wave electron states exist.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
This shows the "parallel [[kinetic energy]]" ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; on the horizontal axis and the [[total energy]] ''ε'' on the vertical axis. An electron inside the bulk metal usually has values of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and ''ε'' that lie within the lightly shaded area. It can be shown that each element d''ε''d''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; of this energy space makes a contribution &lt;math&gt; z_{\mathrm{S}} f_{\mathrm{FD}} \mathrm{d}{\it{\epsilon}} \mathrm{d} K_{\mathrm{p}} &lt;/math&gt; to the electron current density incident on the inside of the emitter boundary.&lt;ref name=F04/&gt; Here, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the universal constant (called here the ''[[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] supply density''):

:&lt;math&gt;z_{\mathrm{S}}=4\mathrm{\pi}em / h_{\mathrm{P}}^3 = 1.618311 \times 10^{14} \, \rm{A} \, m^{-2} \, eV^{-2}, ...........(17)&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; f_{\mathrm{FD}} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac distribution function]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \, f_{\mathrm{FD}} (\epsilon) = 1/[1+\mathrm{exp}(\epsilon / k_{\mathrm{B}}T)],...........(18)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is [[thermodynamic temperature]] and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]].

This element of incident current density sees a barrier of height ''h'' given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \, h=\phi - \epsilon + K_{\mathrm{p}}...........(19a)&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding [[Transmission coefficient|escape probability]] is ''D''(''h'',''F''): this may be expanded (approximately) in the form&lt;ref name=F04/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; D(h,F) \approx D_{\mathrm{F}} \; \mathrm{exp}(\epsilon / d_{\mathrm{F}}) \; \mathrm{exp}(-K_{\mathrm{p}} / d_{\mathrm{F}}) .......... (19b), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the escape probability for a barrier of unreduced height equal to the [[work function|local work-function ''φ'']]. Hence, the element d''ε''d''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; makes a contribution &lt;math&gt;z_{\mathrm{S}} f_{\mathrm{FD}} D \mathrm{d} {\it{\epsilon}} \mathrm{d} K_{\mathrm{p}} &lt;/math&gt; to the emission current density, and the total contribution made by incident electrons with energies in the elementary range d''ε'' is thus

:&lt;math&gt; j(\epsilon) \mathrm{d} \epsilon = z_{\mathrm{S}} f_{\mathrm{FD}} \left[ \int D \mathrm{d} K_{\mathrm{p}} \right] \mathrm{d} \epsilon =
z_{\mathrm{S}} f_{\mathrm{FD}} D_{\mathrm{F}} \mathrm{exp}(\epsilon / d_{\mathrm{F}}) \left[ \int_{0}^{\infty} \mathrm{exp}(-K_{\mathrm{p}} / d_{\mathrm{F}}) \; \mathrm{d} K_{\mathrm{p}} \right] \mathrm{d} \epsilon...........(20) &lt;/math&gt;,

where the integral is in principle taken along the strip shown in the diagram, but can in practice be extended to ∞ when the decay-width ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is very much less than the [[Fermi energy]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; (which is always the case for a metal). The outcome of the integration can be written:

:&lt;math&gt; \, j(\epsilon) = z_{\mathrm{S}} d_{\mathrm{F}} D_{\mathrm{F}} f_{\mathrm{FD}}(\epsilon) \mathrm{exp}(\epsilon/d_{\mathrm{F}}) = j_{\mathrm{F}} f_{\mathrm{FD}}(\epsilon) \mathrm{exp} (\epsilon / d_{\mathrm{F}}), ...........(21) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; d_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; D_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt; are values appropriate to a barrier of unreduced height ''h'' equal to the local work function ''φ'', and &lt;math&gt; j_{\mathrm{F}} [ \,= z_{\mathrm{S}} d_{\mathrm{F}} D_{\mathrm{F}} ] &lt;/math&gt; is defined by this equation.

For a given emitter, with a given field applied to it, &lt;math&gt; j_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt; is independent of ''F'', so eq. (21) shows that the shape of the distribution (as ''ε'' increases from a negative value well below the Fermi level) is a rising exponential, multiplied by the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|FD distribution function]]. This generates the familiar distribution shape first predicted by Young.&lt;ref name=Y59/&gt; At low temperatures, &lt;math&gt; f_{\mathrm{FD}} (\epsilon) &lt;/math&gt; goes sharply from 1 to 0 in the vicinity of the Fermi level, and the [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]] of the distribution is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{FWHM} \, = d_{\mathrm{F}} \mathrm{ln} (2) \approx 0.693 \, d_{\mathrm{F}}. ..........(22) &lt;/math&gt;

The fact that experimental CFE total energy distributions have this basic shape is a good experimental confirmation that electrons in metals obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].

==Cold field electron emission==

===Fowler–Nordheim-type equations===

====Introduction====
Fowler–Nordheim-type equations, in the ''J''-''F'' form, are (approximate) theoretical equations derived to describe the local current density ''J'' emitted from the internal electron states in the [[conduction band]] of a bulk metal. The ''emission current density'' (ECD) ''J'' for some small uniform region of an emitting surface is usually expressed as a function ''J''(''φ'',''F'') of the [[work function|local work-function ''φ'']] and the local barrier field ''F'' that characterize the small region. For sharply curved surfaces, ''J'' may also depend on the parameter(s) used to describe the surface curvature.

Owing to the physical assumptions made in the original derivation,&lt;ref name="Fowler1928"/&gt; the term ''Fowler-Nordheim-type equation'' has long been used only for equations that describe the ECD at zero temperature. However, it is better to allow this name to include the slightly modified equations (discussed below) that are valid for finite temperatures within the CFE emission regime.

====Zero-temperature form====
Current density is best measured in A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The total current density emitted from a small uniform region can be obtained by integrating the total energy distribution ''j''(''ε'') with respect to total electron energy ''ε''. At zero temperature, the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac distribution function]] ''f''&lt;sub&gt;FD&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 for ''ε''&lt;0, and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;FD&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for ''ε''&gt;0. So the ECD at 0 K, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is given from eq. (18) by

:&lt;math&gt; J_0 = z_{\mathrm{S}} d_{\mathrm{F}} D_{\mathrm{F}} \int_{-\infty}^{0} \mathrm{exp}(\epsilon /
d_{\mathrm{F}}) \; \mathrm{d} \epsilon \; = \; z_{\mathrm{S}} {d_{\mathrm{F}}}^2 D_{\mathrm{F}} \; = \; Z_{\mathrm{F}} D_{\mathrm{F}}, ..........(23) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; Z_{\mathrm{F}} \; [=z_{\mathrm{S}} {d_{\mathrm{F}}}^2] &lt;/math&gt; is the ''effective supply for state F'', and is defined by this equation. Strictly, the lower limit of the integral should be –''K''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Fermi Energy]]; but if ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is very much less than ''K''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; (which is always the case for a metal) then no significant contribution to the integral comes from energies below ''K''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, and it can formally be extended to –∞.

Result (23) can be given a simple and useful physical interpretation by referring to Fig. 1. The electron state at point "F" on the diagram ("state F") is the "forwards moving state at the Fermi level" (i.e., it describes a Fermi-level electron moving normal to and towards the emitter surface). At 0 K, an electron in this state sees a barrier of unreduced height ''φ'', and has an escape probability ''D''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; that is higher than that for any other occupied electron state. So it is convenient to write ''J''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, where the "effective supply" ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the current density that would have to be carried by state F inside the metal if all of the emission came out of state F.

In practice, the current density mainly comes out of a group of states close in energy to state F, most of which lie within the heavily shaded area in the energy-space diagram. Since, for a [[free electron model|free-electron model]], the contribution to the current density is directly proportional to the area in energy space (with the [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] supply density ''z''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; as the constant of proportionality), it is useful to think of the ECD as drawn from electron states in an area of size ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (measured in eV&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the energy-space diagram. That is, it is useful to think of the ECD as drawn from states in the heavily shaded area in Fig. 1. (This approximation gets slowly worse as temperature increases.)

''Z''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; can also be written in the form:

:&lt;math&gt; Z_{\mathrm{F}} =z_{\mathrm{S}} {d_{\mathrm{F}}}^2= {\lambda_d}^2 (z_{\mathrm{S}} e^2 g^{-2}) \phi^{-1} F^2 = {\lambda_d}^2 a \phi^{-1} F^2, ..........(24) &lt;/math&gt;

where the universal constant ''a'', sometimes called the ''First Fowler–Nordheim Constant'', is given by

:&lt;math&gt; a = z_{\mathrm{S}} e^2 g^{-2} = e^3 /8 \pi h_{\mathrm{P}} \approx \; 1.541434 \times 10^{-6} \; \mathrm{A \; eV} \; {\mathrm{V}}^{-2}. ..........(25) &lt;/math&gt;

This shows clearly that the pre-exponential factor ''a'' ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''F''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that appears in Fowler-Nordheim-type equations, relates to the effective supply of electrons to the emitter surface, in a free-electron model.

====Non-zero temperatures====
To obtain a result valid for non-zero temperature, we note from eq. (23) that ''z''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = ''J''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. So when eq. (21) is integrated at non-zero temperature, then – on making this substitution, and inserting the explicit form of the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac distribution function]] – the ECD ''J'' can be written in the form:

:&lt;math&gt; J=J_0 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm{exp}(\epsilon / d_{\mathrm{F}})}{1 + \mathrm{exp} [(\epsilon/d_{\mathrm{F}})(d_{\mathrm{F}}/k_{\mathrm{B}} T)]} \mathrm{d}(\epsilon/ d_{\mathrm{F}}) = \lambda_T J_0 ,..........(26)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is a temperature correction factor given by the integral. The integral can be transformed, by writing &lt;math&gt; w = d_{\mathrm{F}}/k_{\mathrm{B}}T &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x=\epsilon/d_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt;, and then &lt;math&gt; u = \mathrm{exp}(x) &lt;/math&gt;, into the standard result:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gradshteyn and Rhyzhik|title=Tables of Integrals, Series and Products|year=1980|publisher=Academic, New York}} see formula 3.241 (2), with ''μ''=1&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{ {\mathrm{e}}^x } { 1+ {\mathrm{e}}^{wx} } \mathrm{d}x = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm{d}u}{1+u^w} = \frac{\pi} {w\mathrm{sin}(\pi/w)}. ..........(27) &lt;/math&gt;

This is valid for ''w''&gt;1 (i.e., ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' &gt; 1). Hence – for temperatures such that ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''&lt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_T = \frac{\pi k_{\mathrm{B}} T/d_{\mathrm{F}} }{ \mathrm{sin}(\pi k_{\mathrm{B}} T / d_{\mathrm{F}})} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{6} {\frac{\pi k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{ d_{\mathrm{F}}}}^2, ..........(28) &lt;/math&gt;

where the expansion is valid only if (π''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' /''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;&lt; 1. An example value (for ''φ''= 4.5 eV, ''F''= 5 V/nm, ''T''= 300 K) is ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;= 1.024. Normal thinking has been that, in the CFE regime, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is always small in comparison with other uncertainties, and that it is usually unnecessary to explicitly include it in formulae for the current density at room temperature.

The emission regimes for metals are, in practice, defined, by the ranges of barrier field ''F'' and temperature ''T'' for which a given family of emission equations is mathematically adequate. When the barrier field ''F'' is high enough for the CFE regime to be operating for metal emission at 0 K, then the condition ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''&lt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; provides a formal upper bound (in temperature) to the CFE emission regime. However, it has been argued that (due to approximations made elsewhere in the derivation) the condition ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''&lt;0.7''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is a better working limit: this corresponds to a ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;-value of around 1.09, and (for the example case) an upper temperature limit on the CFE regime of around 1770 K. This limit is a function of barrier field.&lt;ref name=mo84/&gt;&lt;ref name=MG56/&gt;

Note that result (28) here applies for a barrier of any shape (though ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; will be different for different barriers).

====Physically complete Fowler–Nordheim-type equation====
Result (23) also leads to some understanding of what happens when atomic-level effects are taken into account, and the [[band structure|band-structure]] is no longer free-electron like. Due to the presence of the atomic ion-cores, the surface barrier, and also the electron [[wave function|wave-functions]] at the surface, will be different. This will affect the values of the correction factor &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, the prefactor ''P'', and (to a limited extent) the correction factor ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;. These changes will, in turn, affect the values of the parameter ''D''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and (to a limited extent) the parameter ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. For a real metal, the supply density will vary with position in energy space, and the value at point "F" may be different from the Sommerfeld supply density. We can take account of this effect by introducing an electronic-band-structure correction factor ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; into eq. (23). Modinos has discussed how this factor might be calculated: he estimates that it is most likely to be between 0.1 and 1; it might lie outside these limits but is most unlikely to lie outside the range 0.01&lt;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;10.&lt;ref name=Mo01&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0038-1101(00)00218-5|title=Theoretical analysis of field emission data|year=2001|last1=Modinos|first1=A|journal=Solid-State Electronics|volume=45|pages=809–816|bibcode=2001SSEle..45..809M|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By defining an overall supply correction factor ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; equal to ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and combining equations above, we reach the so-called physically complete Fowler-Nordheim-type equation:&lt;ref name=F08b&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1116/1.2827505|title=Physics of generalized Fowler-Nordheim-type equations|year=2008|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B|volume=26|page=788|bibcode = 2008JVSTB..26..788F|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J \;= \lambda_Z a \phi^{-1} F^2 P_{\mathrm{F}} \mathrm{exp}[- \nu_{\mathrm{F}} b \phi^{3/2} / F ], ..........(29) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\nu}_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt; [=&lt;math&gt;{\nu}_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;(''φ'',''F'')] is the exponent correction factor for a barrier of unreduced height ''φ''. This is the most general equation of the Fowler–Nordheim type. Other equations in the family are obtained by substituting specific expressions for the three correction factors &lt;math&gt;{\nu}_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; it contains. The so-called elementary Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, that appears in undergraduate textbook discussions of field emission, is obtained by putting ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt;→1, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;→1, &lt;math&gt;{\nu}_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;→1; this does not yield good quantitative predictions because it makes the barrier stronger than it is in physical reality. The so-called standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, originally developed by Murphy and Good,&lt;ref name=MG56/&gt; and much used in past literature, is obtained by putting ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt;→''t''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;→1, &lt;math&gt;{\nu}_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;→''v''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is ''v''(''f''), where ''f'' is the value of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; obtained by putting ''h''=''φ'', and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is a related parameter (of value close to unity).&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt;

Within the more complete theory described here, the factor ''t''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; is a component part of the correction factor ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [see,&lt;ref name=F08c/&gt; and note that ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is denoted by ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; there]. There is no significant value in continuing the separate identification of ''t''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Probably, in the present state of knowledge, the best approximation for simple Fowler-Nordheim-type equation based modeling of CFE from metals is obtained by putting ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt;→1, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; → 1, &lt;math&gt;{\nu}_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt; → ''v''(''f''). This re-generates the Fowler-Nordheim-type equation used by Dyke and Dolan in 1956, and can be called the "simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation".

Explicitly, this recommended ''simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation'', and associated formulae, are:

:&lt;math&gt; J = \; a {\phi^{-1}} F^2 \mathrm{exp}[- v(f) \;b \phi^{3/2} / F ], ..........(30a) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a \approx \; 1.541434 \times 10^{-6} \; \mathrm{A \; eV} \; {\mathrm{V}}^{-2};\;\;\;\;\; b \approx 6.830890 \; {\mathrm{eV}}^{-3/2} \; \mathrm{V} \; {\mathrm{nm}}^{-1}, ..........(30b)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v(f) \approx 1 - f + (1/6) f \mathrm{ln} f.......... (30c) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f = \; F/F_{\phi} = (e^3 / 4 \pi \epsilon_0) (F/ {\phi}^2) = (1.439964 \; {\mathrm{eV}}^2 \; {\mathrm{V}}^{-1} \; \mathrm{nm}) (F/ {\phi}^2). ..........(30d) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''&lt;/sub&gt; here is the field needed to reduce to zero a Schottky-Nordheim barrier of unreduced height equal to the [[work function|local work-function ''φ'']], and ''f'' is the scaled barrier field for a Schottky-Nordheim barrier of unreduced height ''φ''. [This quantity ''f'' could have been written more exactly as ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;SN&lt;/sup&gt;, but it makes this Fowler-Nordheim-type equation look less cluttered if the convention is adopted that simple ''f'' means the quantity denoted by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;SN&lt;/sup&gt; in,&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt; eq. (2.16).] For the example case (''φ''= 4.5 eV, ''F''= 5 V/nm), ''f''≈ 0.36 and ''v''(''f'') ≈ 0.58; practical ranges for these parameters are discussed further in.&lt;ref name=F08a&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1116/1.2834563|title=Description of field emission current/voltage characteristics in terms of scaled barrier field values (f-values)|year=2008|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B|volume=26|page=209|bibcode = 2008JVSTB..26..209F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the variable ''f'' (the scaled barrier field) is not the same as the variable ''y'' (the Nordheim parameter) extensively used in past field emission literature, and that " ''v''(''f'') " does NOT have the same mathematical meaning and values as the quantity " ''v''(''y'') " that appears in field emission literature. In the context of the revised theory described here, formulae for ''v''(''y''), and tables of values for ''v''(''y'') should be disregarded, or treated as values of ''v''(''f''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;). If more exact values for ''v''(''f'') are required, then&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt; provides formulae that give values for ''v''(''f'') to an absolute mathematical accuracy of better than 8×10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;. However, approximation formula (30c) above, which yields values correct to within an absolute mathematical accuracy of better 0.0025, should gives values sufficiently accurate for all technological purposes.&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt;

====Comments====
A historical note on methods of deriving Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is necessary. There are several possible approaches to deriving these equations, using [[free electron model|free-electron theory]]. The approach used here was introduced by Forbes in 2004 and may be described as "integrating via the total energy distribution, using the parallel kinetic energy ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; as the first variable of integration".&lt;ref name=F04/&gt; Basically, it is a free-electron equivalent of the Modinos procedure&lt;ref name=mo84/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mo01/&gt; (in a more advanced quantum-mechanical treatment) of "integrating over the surface Brillouin zone". By contrast, the free-electron treatments of CFE by Young in 1959,&lt;ref name=Y59/&gt; Gadzuk and Plummer in 1973&lt;ref name=GP73/&gt; and Modinos in 1984,&lt;ref name=mo84/&gt; also integrate via the total energy distribution, but use the normal energy ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (or a related quantity) as the first variable of integration.

There is also an older approach, based on a seminal paper by Nordheim in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L.W. Nordheim|journal=Z. Phys.|volume=46|year=1928|pages=833–855|bibcode = 1928ZPhy...46..833N |doi = 10.1007/BF01391020|title=Zur Theorie der thermischen Emission und der Reflexion von Elektronen an Metallen|issue=11–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that formulates the problem differently and then uses first ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and then ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (or a related quantity) as the variables of integration: this is known as "integrating via the normal-energy distribution". This approach continues to be used by some authors. Although it has some advantages, particularly when discussing resonance phenomena, it requires integration of the Fermi–Dirac distribution function in the first stage of integration: for non-free-electron-like electronic band-structures this can lead to very complex and error-prone mathematics (as in the work of Stratton on [[semiconductors]]).&lt;ref name=St62&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.125.67|title=Theory of Field Emission from Semiconductors|year=1962|last1=Stratton|first1=Robert|journal=Physical Review|volume=125|pages=67–82|bibcode = 1962PhRv..125...67S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, integrating via the normal-energy distribution does not generate experimentally measured electron energy distributions.

In general, the approach used here seems easier to understand, and leads to simpler mathematics.

It is also closer in principle to the more sophisticated approaches used when dealing with real bulk crystalline solids, where the first step is either to integrate contributions to the ECD over [[constant energy surface]]s in a [[wave vector|wave-vector]] space ('' '''k''''' -space),&lt;ref name=GP73/&gt; or to integrate contributions over the relevant surface Brillouin zone.&lt;ref name=mo84/&gt; The Forbes approach is equivalent either to integrating over a spherical surface in''' ''k''' ''-space, using the variable ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; to define a ring-like integration element that has cylindrical symmetry about an axis in a direction normal to the emitting surface, or to integrating over an (extended) surface Brillouin zone using circular-ring elements.

===CFE theoretical equations===
The preceding section explains how to derive Fowler-Nordheim-type equations. Strictly, these equations apply only to CFE from bulk metals. The ideas in the following sections apply to CFE more generally, but eq. (30) will be used to illustrate them.

For CFE, basic theoretical treatments provide a relationship between the local emission current density ''J'' and the local barrier field ''F'', at a local position on the emitting surface. Experiments measure the emission current ''i'' from some defined part of the emission surface, as a function of the voltage ''V'' applied to some counter-electrode. To relate these variables to'' J'' and ''F'', auxiliary equations are used.

The ''voltage-to-barrier-field conversion factor'' ''β'' is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \; \beta V, ..........(31) &lt;/math&gt;

The value of ''F'' varies from position to position on an emitter surface, and the value of ''β'' varies correspondingly.

For a metal emitter, the ''β''−value for a given position will be constant (independent of voltage) under the following conditions: (1) the apparatus is a "diode" arrangement, where the only electrodes present are the emitter and a set of "surroundings", all parts of which are at the same voltage; (2) no significant field-emitted vacuum [[space charge|space-charge]] (FEVSC) is present (this will be true except at very high emission current densities, around 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or higher &lt;ref name="Dyke1953"/&gt;&lt;ref name=F08d&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.2996005|title=Exact analysis of surface field reduction due to field-emitted vacuum space charge, in parallel-plane geometry, using simple dimensionless equations|year=2008|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=104|page=084303|bibcode = 2008JAP...104h4303F|issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;); (3) no significant "patch fields" exist,&lt;ref name=HN49/&gt; as a result of non-uniformities in [[work function|local work-function]] (this is normally assumed to be true, but may not be in some circumstances). For non-metals, the physical effects called "field penetration" and "[[band bending]]" [M084] can make ''β'' a function of applied voltage, although – surprisingly – there are few studies of this effect.

The emission current density ''J'' varies from position to position across the emitter surface. The total emission current ''i'' from a defined part of the emitter is obtained by integrating ''J'' across this part. To obtain a simple equation for ''i''(''V''), the following procedure is used. A reference point "r" is selected within this part of the emitter surface (often the point at which the current density is highest), and the current density at this reference point is denoted by ''J''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. A parameter ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, called the ''notional emission area'' (with respect to point "r"), is then defined by:

:&lt;math&gt; i = A_{\mathrm{r}} J_{\mathrm{r}} = \int J \mathrm{d} A, ..........(32) &lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is taken across the part of the emitter of interest.

This parameter ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; was introduced into CFE theory by Stern, Gossling and Fowler in 1929 (who called it a "weighted mean area").&lt;ref name=sgf29&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1929.0147|title=Further Studies in the Emission of Electrons from Cold Metals|year=1929|last1=Stern|first1=T. E.|last2=Gossling|first2=B. S.|last3=Fowler|first3=R. H.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|volume=124|pages=699–723|bibcode = 1929RSPSA.124..699S|issue=795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For practical emitters, the emission current density used in Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is always the current density at some reference point (though this is usually not stated). Long-established convention denotes this reference current density by the simple symbol ''J'', and the corresponding local field and conversion factor by the simple symbols ''F'' and ''β'', without the subscript "r" used above; in what follows, this convention is used.

The notional emission area ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; will often be a function of the reference local field (and hence voltage),&lt;ref name=AH39&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.56.113|title=The Range and Validity of the Field Current Equation|year=1939|last1=Abbott|first1=F. R.|last2=Henderson|first2=Joseph E.|journal=Physical Review|volume=56|pages=113–118|bibcode = 1939PhRv...56..113A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some circumstances might be a significant function of temperature.

Because ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; has a mathematical definition, it does not necessarily correspond to the area from which emission is observed to occur from a single-point emitter in a [[field emission microscope|field electron (emission) microscope]]. With a large-area emitter, which contains many individual emission sites, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; will nearly always be very very{{Clarify|date=June 2009|reason=was repeated 'very' intended?}} much less than the "macroscopic" geometrical area (''A''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) of the emitter as observed visually (see below).

Incorporating these auxiliary equations into eq. (30a) yields

:&lt;math&gt; i = \; A_{\mathrm{r}} a {\phi^{-1}} {\beta}^2 V^2 \mathrm{exp}[- v(f) \;b \phi^{3/2} / \beta V ], ..........(33) &lt;/math&gt;

This is the simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, in ''i''-''V'' form. The corresponding "physically complete" equation is obtained by multiplying by ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Modified equations for large-area emitters===
The equations in the preceding section apply to all field emitters operating in the CFE regime. However, further developments are useful for large-area emitters that contain many individual emission sites.

For such emitters, the notional emission area will nearly always be very very{{Clarify|date=June 2009|reason=was repeated 'very' intended?}} much less than the apparent "macroscopic" geometrical area (''A''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) of the physical emitter as observed visually. A dimensionless parameter ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, ''the area efficiency of emission'', can be defined by

:&lt;math&gt; A_{\mathrm{r}} = \; \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} A_{\mathrm{M}}. ..........(34)&lt;/math&gt;

Also, a "macroscopic" (or "mean") emission current density ''J''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; (averaged over the geometrical area ''A''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; of the emitter) can be defined, and related to the reference current density ''J''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; used above, by

:&lt;math&gt; J_{\mathrm{M}} = \; i/A_{\mathrm{M}} = \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} (i /A_{\mathrm{r}}) = \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} J_{\mathrm{r}}. ..........(35)&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to the following "large-area versions" of the simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation:

:&lt;math&gt; J_{\mathrm{M}} = \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} a {\phi^{-1}} F^2 \mathrm{exp}[- v(f) \;b \phi^{3/2} / F ], ..........(36) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; i = \; \alpha_{\mathrm{r}} A_{\mathrm{M}} a {\phi^{-1}} {\beta}^2 V^2 \mathrm{exp}[- v(f) \;b \phi^{3/2} / \beta V ], ..........(37) &lt;/math&gt;

Both these equations contain the area efficiency of emission ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. For any given emitter this parameter has a value that is usually not well known. In general, ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; varies greatly as between different emitter materials, and as between different specimens of the same material prepared and processed in different ways. Values in the range 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; appear to be likely, and values outside this range may be possible.

The presence of ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; in eq. (36) accounts for the difference between the macroscopic current densities often cited in the literature (typically 10 A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for many forms of large-area emitter other than [[Spindt tip|Spindt arrays]]&lt;ref name=SBHW76/&gt;) and the local current densities at the actual emission sites, which can vary widely but which are thought to be generally of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or possibly slightly less.

A significant part of the technological literature on large-area emitters fails to make clear distinctions between local and macroscopic current densities, or between notional emission area ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and macroscopic area ''A''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, and/or omits the parameter ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; from cited equations. Care is necessary in order to avoid errors of interpretation.

It is also sometimes convenient to split the conversion factor ''β''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; into a "macroscopic part" that relates to the overall geometry of the emitter and its surroundings, and a "local part" that relates to the ability of the very-local structure of the emitter surface to enhance the electric field. This is usually done by defining a "macroscopic field" ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; that is the field that would be present at the emitting site in the absence of the local structure that causes enhancement. This field ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is related to the applied voltage by a "voltage-to-macroscopic-field conversion factor" ''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; defined by:

:&lt;math&gt; F_{\mathrm{M}} = \; \beta_{\mathrm{M}} V. ..........(38) &lt;/math&gt;

In the common case of a system comprising two parallel plates, separated by a distance ''W'', with emitting nanostructures created on one of them, ''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''W''.

A "field enhancement factor" ''γ'' is then defined and related to the values of ''β''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and ''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \; F_{\mathrm{r}} / F_{\mathrm{M}} = \beta_{\mathrm{r}} / \beta_{\mathrm{M}}. ..........(39) &lt;/math&gt;

With eq. (31), this generates the following formulae:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \; \gamma F_{\mathrm{M}} = \beta V ..........(40); \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \beta = \; \beta_{\mathrm{M}} \gamma ..........(41);&lt;/math&gt;

where, in accordance with the usual convention, the suffix "r" has now been dropped from parameters relating to the reference point. Formulae exist for the estimation of ''γ'', using [[electrostatics|classical electrostatics]], for a variety of emitter shapes, in particular the "hemisphere on a post".&lt;ref name=FEV01&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0304-3991(02)00297-8|title=Some comments on models for field enhancement|year=2003|last1=Forbes|first1=R|journal=Ultramicroscopy|volume=95|pages=57–65|pmid=12535545|last2=Edgcombe|first2=CJ|last3=Valdrè|first3=U|issue=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equation (40) implies that versions of Fowler-Nordheim-type equations can be written where either ''F'' or ''βV'' is everywhere replaced by &lt;math&gt;\gamma F_{\mathrm{M}}&lt;/math&gt;. This is often done in technological applications where the primary interest is in the field enhancing properties of the local emitter nanostructure. However in some past work, failure to make a clear distinction between barrier field ''F'' and macroscopic field ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; has caused confusion or error.

More generally, the aims in technological development of large-area field emitters are to enhance the uniformity of emission by increasing the value of the area efficiency of emission ''α''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, and to reduce the "onset" voltage at which significant emission occurs, by increasing the value of ''β''. Eq. (41) shows that this can be done in two ways: either by trying to develop "high-''γ''" nanostructures, or by changing the overall geometry of the system so that ''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is increased. Various trade-offs and constraints exist.

In practice, although the definition of macroscopic field used above is the commonest one, other (differently defined) types of macroscopic field and field enhancement factor are used in the literature, particularly in connection with the use of probes to investigate the'' i''-''V'' characteristics of individual emitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1989443|title=Interpretation of enhancement factor in nonplanar field emitters|year=2005|last1=Smith|first1=R.

P.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=87|page=013111|bibcode = 2005ApPhL..87a3111S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In technological contexts field emission data are often plotted using (a particular definition of) ''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; or 1/''F''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; as the ''x''-coordinate. However, for scientific analysis it usually better not to pre-manipulate the experimental data, but to plot the raw measured ''i''-''V'' data directly. Values of technological parameters such as (the various forms of) ''γ'' can then be obtained from the fitted parameters of the ''i''-''V'' data plot (see below), using the relevant definitions.


=== Modified equations for nanometrically sharp emitters ===

Most of the theoretical derivations in the field emission theory are done under the assumption that the barrier takes the Schottky-Nordheim form eq. (3). However, this barrier form is not valid for emitters with radii of curvature &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; comparable to the length of the tunnelling barrier. The latter depends on the work function and the field, but in cases of practical interest, the SN barrier approximation can be considered valid for emitters with radii &lt;math&gt;R &gt; 20 \text{nm}&lt;/math&gt;, as explained in the next paragraph.

The main assumption of the SN barrier approximation is that the electrostatic potential term takes the linear form &lt;math&gt;\Phi = Fx&lt;/math&gt; in the tunnelling region. The latter has been proved to hold only if &lt;math&gt;x \ll R&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=KX&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0811|title=Derivation of a generalized Fowler-Nordheim equation for nanoscopic field-emitters|year=2015|last1=Kyritsakis|first1=A.|last2=Xanthakis|first2=J. P. |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|volume=471|page=20140811|bibcode=2015RSPSA.47140811K}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, if the tunnelling region has a length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;L&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that determines the tunnelling process; thus if &lt;math&gt;L \ll R&lt;/math&gt; eq. (1) holds and the SN barrier approximation is valid. If the tunnelling probability is high enough to produce measurable field emission, L does not exceed 1-2nm. Hence, the SN barrier is valid for emitters with radii of the order of some tens of nm.

However, modern emitters are much sharper than this, with radii that of the order of a few nm. Therefore, the standard FN equation, or any version of it that assumes the SN barrier, leads to significant errors for such sharp emitters. This has been both shown theoretically &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.106257|title=Derivation of a generalized Fowler-Nordheim equation for nanoscopic field-emitters|year=1991|last1=He|first1=J.|last2=Cutler|first2=P.

The above problem was tackled in ref. &lt;ref name=KX&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0811|title=Derivation of a generalized Fowler-Nordheim equation for nanoscopic field-emitters|year=2015|last1=Kyritsakis|first1=A.|last2=Xanthakis|first2=J. P. |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|volume=471|page=20140811|bibcode=2015RSPSA.47140811K}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The SN barrier was generalized taking into account the curvature of the emitter. It can be proven that the electrostatic potential in the vicinity of any metal surface with radius of curvature &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can be [[asymptotic expansion | asymptotically expanded ]] as 
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = Fx \left[ 1+\frac{x}{R} + O \left(\frac{x}{R} \right)^2 \right] \text{, for   } x \ll R \text{.}..........(42)&lt;/math&gt; 

Furthermore, the image potential for a sharp emitter is better represented by the one corresponding to a spherical metal surface rather than a planar one. After neglecting all &lt;math&gt;O(x/R)^2&lt;/math&gt; terms, the total potential barrier takes the form found by Kyritsakis and Xanthakis &lt;ref name=KX&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0811|title=Derivation of a generalized Fowler-Nordheim equation for nanoscopic field-emitters|year=2015|last1=Kyritsakis|first1=A.|last2=Xanthakis|first2=J. P. |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|volume=471|page=20140811|bibcode=2015RSPSA.47140811K}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; M^{KX} (x) = h - eFx\left(1+\frac{x}{R} \right) - \frac{e^2}{16\pi \epsilon_0 x (1-x/2R)} ..........(43)&lt;/math&gt;

If the [[WKB approximation | JWKB approximation]] (4) is used for this barrier, the Gamow exponent takes a form that generalizes eq. (5) 
:&lt;math&gt; G(h,F,R) = \frac{b h^{3/2}}{F} \left(v(f) + \omega(f)\frac{h}{eFR} \right)..........(44)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined by (30d), &lt;math&gt;v(f)&lt;/math&gt; is given by (30c) and &lt;math&gt;\omega(f)&lt;/math&gt; is a new function that can be approximated in a similar manner as (30c): 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega(f) \approx \frac{4}{5} - \frac{7}{40} f  - \frac{1}{200} \log(f) \text{.}..........(45)&lt;/math&gt;

Given the expression for the Gamow exponent as a function of the field-free barrier height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, the emitted current density for cold field emission can be obtained from eq. (23). It yields 
:&lt;math&gt; J = a \frac{F^2}{\phi} \left(\frac{1}{\lambda_d(f)} + \frac{\phi}{eFR} \psi(f) \right)^{-2} \exp\left[-\frac{b \phi^{3/2}}{F} \left(v(f) + \omega(f)\frac{\phi}{eFR} \right) \right]..........(46)&lt;/math&gt; 
where the functions &lt;math&gt;\lambda_d(f)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi(f)&lt;/math&gt; are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\lambda_d(f)} \equiv v(f) - \frac{4}{3}f \frac{\partial v}{\partial f} \approx 1 + \frac{f}{9} - \frac{f \log(f)}{22} ..........(47a)&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(f) \equiv \frac{5}{3} \omega(f) - \frac{4}{3}f\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial f} \approx \frac{4}{3} - \frac{f}{500} - \frac{f \log(f)}{30}..........(47b)&lt;/math&gt;
In equation (46), for completeness purposes, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_d&lt;/math&gt; is not approximated by unity as in (29) and (30a), although for most practical cases it is a very good approximation.
Apart from this, equations (43), (44) and (46) coincide with the corresponding ones of the standard Fowler-Nordheim theory (3), (9), and (30a), in the limit &lt;math&gt;R \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;; this is expected since the former equations generalise the latter.

Finally, note that the above analysis is asymptotic in the limit &lt;math&gt;L \ll R&lt;/math&gt;, similarly to the standard Fowler-Nordheim theory using the SN barrier. However, the addition of the quadratic terms renders it significantly more accurate for emitters with radii of curvature in the range ~5-20nm. For sharper emitters there is no general approximation for the current density. In order to obtain the current density, one has to calculate the electrostatic potential and evaluate the [[WKB approximation| JWKB integral]] numerically. For this purpose, scientific computing software-libraries have been developed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.commatsci.2016.11.010|title=A general computational method for electron emission and thermal effects in field emitting nanotips|year=2017|last1=Kyritsakis|first1=A.|last2=Djurabekova|first2=F. |journal=Computational Material Science|volume=128|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; .



===Empirical CFE ''i''–''V'' equation===
At the present stage of CFE theory development, it is important to make a distinction between theoretical CFE equations and an empirical CFE equation. The former are derived from condensed matter physics (albeit in contexts where their detailed development is difficult). An empirical CFE equation, on the other hand, simply attempts to represent the actual experimental form of the dependence of current ''i'' on voltage ''V''.

In the 1920s, empirical equations were used to find the power of ''V'' that appeared in the exponent of a semi-logarithmic equation assumed to describe experimental CFE results. In 1928, theory and experiment were brought together to show that (except, possibly, for very sharp emitters) this power is ''V''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It has recently been suggested that CFE experiments should now be carried out to try to find the power (''κ'') of ''V'' in the pre-exponential of the following empirical CFE equation:&lt;ref name=F08e&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.2918446|title=Call for experimental test of a revised mathematical form for empirical field emission current-voltage characteristics|year=2008|last1=Forbes|first1=Richard G.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=92|page=193105|bibcode = 2008ApPhL..92s3105F|issue=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; i = \; C V^{\kappa} \mathrm{exp}[-B/V], ..........(48) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''B'', ''C'' and ''κ'' are treated as constants.

From eq. (42) it is readily shown that

:&lt;math&gt; - \mathrm{dln} i / \mathrm{d} (1/V) = \; \kappa V + B, ..........(49)&lt;/math&gt;

In the 1920s, experimental techniques could not distinguish between the results κ =0 (assumed by Millikan and Laurtisen)&lt;ref name=Millikan/&gt; and κ=2 (predicted by the original Fowler-Nordheim-type equation).&lt;ref name="Fowler1928"/&gt; However, it should now be possible to make reasonably accurate measurements of dlni/d(1/V) (if necessary by using [[lock-in amplifier]]/phase-sensitive detection techniques and computer-controlled equipment), and to derive ''κ'' from the slope of an appropriate data plot.&lt;ref name=SBHW76/&gt;

Following the discovery of approximation (30b), it is now very clear that – even for CFE from bulk metals – the value ''κ''=2 is not expected. This can be shown as follows. Using eq. (30c) above, a dimensionless parameter ''η'' may be defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \eta = b \phi^{3/2} / F_{\phi} = \; (b e^3 / 4 \pi \epsilon_0) {\phi}^{-1/2} \approx 9.836239 \;\; (\mathrm{eV} / \phi)^{1/2}. ..........(50) &lt;/math&gt;

For ''φ'' = 4.50 eV, this parameter has the value ''η'' = 4.64. Since ''f'' = ''F''/''F''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''(''f'') is given by eq (30b), the exponent in the simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation (30) can be written in an alternative form and then expanded as follows:&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{exp} [-v(f) \; b {\phi}^{3/2} / F] \; = \;\mathrm{exp}[-v(f) \; \eta /f] \; \approx \; {\mathrm{e}}^{\eta} f^{-\eta/6} \mathrm{exp}[- \eta /f] \; = \; {\mathrm{e}}^{\eta} f^{-\eta/6} \mathrm{exp}[-b {\phi}^{3/2} /F ]. ..........(51) &lt;/math&gt;

Provided that the conversion factor ''β'' is independent of voltage, the parameter ''f'' has the alternative definition ''f'' = ''V''/''V''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''&lt;/sub&gt; is the voltage needed, in a particular experimental system, to reduce the height of a Schottky-Nordheim barrier from'' φ'' to zero. Thus, it is clear that the factor ''v''(''f'') in the ''exponent'' of the theoretical equation (30) gives rise to additional ''V''-dependence in the ''pre-exponential'' of the empirical equation. Thus, (for effects due to the Schottky-Nordheim barrier, and for an emitter with ''φ''=4.5 eV) we obtain the prediction:

:&lt;math&gt; \kappa \approx 2 - \eta / 6 = 2 - 0.77 = 1.23. ..........(52) &lt;/math&gt;

Since there may also be voltage dependence in other factors in a Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, in particular in the notional emission area&lt;ref name=AH39/&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and in the local work-function, it is not necessarily expected that ''κ'' for CFE from a metal of local work-function 4.5 eV should have the value ''κ'' = 1.23, but there is certainly no reason to expect that it will have the original Fowler-Nordheim value ''κ'' = 2.&lt;ref name=Je99&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.369584|title=Exchange-correlation, dipole, and image charge potentials for electron sources: Temperature and field variation of the barrier height|year=1999|last1=Jensen|first1=K. L.|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=85|page=2667|bibcode = 1999JAP....85.2667J|issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A first experimental test of this proposal has been carried out by Kirk, who used a slightly more complex form of data analysis to find a value 1.36 for his parameter ''κ''. His parameter ''κ'' is very similar to, but not quite the same as, the parameter ''κ'' used here, but nevertheless his results do appear to confirm the potential usefulness of this form of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;T. Kirk, 21st Intern. Vacuum Nanoelectronics Conf., Wrocław, July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the empirical CFE equation (42), and the measurement of ''κ'', may be of particular use for non-metals. Strictly, Fowler-Nordheim-type equations apply only to emission from the [[conduction band]] of bulk [[crystalline]] solids. However, empirical equations of form (42) should apply to all materials (though, conceivably, modification might be needed for very sharp emitters). It seems very likely that one way in which CFE equations for newer materials may differ from Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is that these CFE equations may have a different power of ''F'' (or ''V'') in their pre-exponentials. Measurements of ''κ'' might provide some experimental indication of this.

==Fowler–Nordheim plots and Millikan–Lauritsen plots==
The original theoretical equation derived by Fowler and Nordheim&lt;ref name="Fowler1928"/&gt; has, for the last 80 years, influenced the way that experimental CFE data has been plotted and analyzed. In the very widely used Fowler-Nordheim plot, as introduced by Stern ''et al.'' in 1929,&lt;ref name=sgf29/&gt; the quantity ln{''i''/''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;} is plotted against 1/''V''. The original thinking was that (as predicted by the original or the elementary Fowler-Nordheim-type equation) this would generate an exact straight line of slope ''S''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt;. ''S''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt; would be related to the parameters that appear in the exponent of a Fowler-Nordheim-type equation of ''i''-''V'' form by:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{FN}} = \; - b {\phi}^{3/2} / \beta. ..........(47) &lt;/math&gt;

Hence, knowledge of ''φ'' would allow ''β'' to be determined, or vice versa.

[In principle, in system geometries where there is local field-enhancing nanostructure present, and the macroscopic conversion factor ''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; can be determined, knowledge of ''β'' then allows the value of the emitter's effective field enhancement factor'' γ'' to be determined from the formula ''γ'' = ''β''/''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;. In the common case of a film emitter generated on one plate of a two-plate arrangement with plate-separation ''W'' (so ''β''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''W'') then

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \; \beta W. ..........(48) &lt;/math&gt;

Nowadays, this is one of the most likely applications of Fowler-Nordheim plots.]

It subsequently became clear that the original thinking above is strictly correct only for the physically unrealistic situation of a flat emitter and an exact triangular barrier. For real emitters and real barriers a "slope correction factor" ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt; has to be introduced, yielding the revised formula

:&lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{FN}} = \; - \sigma_{\mathrm{FN}} b {\phi}^{3/2} / \beta. ..........(49) &lt;/math&gt;

The value of ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt; will, in principle, be influenced by any parameter in the physically complete Fowler-Nordheim-type equation for ''i''(''V'') that has a voltage dependence.

At present, the only parameter that is considered important is the correction factor &lt;math&gt; \nu_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt; relating to the barrier shape, and the only barrier for which there is any well-established detailed theory is the Schottky-Nordheim barrier. In this case, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt; is given by a mathematical function called ''s''. This function ''s'' was first tabulated correctly (as a function of the Nordheim parameter ''y'') by Burgess, [[Herbert Kroemer|Kroemer]] and Houston in 1953;&lt;ref name=BKH53/&gt; and a modern treatment that gives ''s'' as function of the scaled barrier field ''f'' for a Schottky-Nordheim barrier is given in.&lt;ref name=fd07/&gt; However, it has long been clear that, for practical emitter operation, the value of ''s'' lies in the range 0.9 to 1.

In practice, due to the extra complexity involved in taking the slope correction factor into detailed account, many authors (in effect) put ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 in eq. (49), thereby generating a systematic error in their estimated values of ''β'' and/or ''γ'', thought usually to be around 5%.

However, empirical equation (42) – which in principle is more general than Fowler-Nordheim-type equations - brings with it possible new ways of analyzing field emission ''i''-''V'' data. In general, it may be assumed that the parameter ''B'' in the empirical equation is related to the unreduced height ''H'' of some characteristic barrier seen by tunneling electrons by

:&lt;math&gt; B = \; b H^{3/2} / \beta. ..........(50) &lt;/math&gt;

(In most cases, but not necessarily all, ''H'' would be equal to the local work-function; certainly this is true for metals.) The issue is how to determine the value of ''B'' by experiment. There are two obvious ways. (1) Suppose that eq. (43) can be used to determine a reasonably accurate experimental value of ''κ'', from the slope of a plot of form [–dln{''i''}/d(1/''V'') vs. ''V'']. In this case, a second plot, of ln(''i'')/''V''&lt;sup&gt;''κ''&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 1/''V'', should be an exact straight line of slope –''B''. This approach should be the most accurate way of determining ''B''.

(2) Alternatively, if the value of ''κ'' is not exactly known, and cannot be accurately measured, but can be estimated or guessed, then a value for'' B'' can be derived from a plot of the form [ln{''i''} vs. 1/''V'']. This is the form of plot used by Millikan and Lauritsen in 1928. Re-arranging eq. (43) gives

:&lt;math&gt; B = \; - \mathrm{dln} (i) / \mathrm{d} (1/V) - \kappa (1/V). ..........(51) &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, ''B'' can be determined, to a good degree of approximation, by determining the mean slope of a Millikan-Lauritsen plot over some range of values of 1/''V'', and by applying a correction, using the value of 1/''V'' at the midpoint of the range and an assumed value of ''κ''.

The main advantages of using a Millikan-Lauritsen plot, and this form of correction procedure, rather than a Fowler-Nordheim plot and a slope correction factor, are seen to be the following. (1) The plotting procedure is marginally more straightforward. (2) The correction involves a physical parameter (''V'') that is a measured quantity, rather than a physical parameter (''f'') that has to be calculated [in order to then calculate a value of ''s''(''f'') or, more generally ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;FN&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'')]. (3) Both the parameter ''κ'' itself, and the correction procedure, are more transparent (and more readily understood) than the Fowler-Nordheim-plot equivalents. (4) This procedure takes into account all physical effects that influence the value of ''κ'', whereas the Fowler-Nordheim-plot correction procedure (in the form in which it has been carried out for the last 50 years) takes into account only those effects associated with barrier shape – assuming, furthermore, that this shape is that of a Schottky-Nordheim barrier. (5) There is a cleaner separation of theoretical and technological concerns: theoreticians will be interested in establishing what information any measured values of ''κ'' provide about CFE theory; but experimentalists can simply use measured values of ''κ'' to make more accurate estimates (if needed) of field enhancement factors.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=February 2016}}

This correction procedure for Millikan-Lauritsen plots will become easier to apply when a sufficient number of measurements of ''κ'' have been made, and a better idea is available of what typical values actually are. At present, it seems probable that for most materials ''κ'' will lie in the range -1&lt;''κ''&lt;3.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2016}}

==Further theoretical information==
Developing the approximate theory of CFE from metals above is comparatively easy, for the following reasons. (1) [[free electron model|Sommerfeld's free-electron theory]], with its particular assumptions about the distribution of internal electron states in energy, applies adequately to many metals as a first approximation. (2) Most of the time, metals have no [[surface states]] and (in many cases) metal [[wavefunction|wave-functions]] have no significant "[[surface states|surface resonances]]". (3) Metals have a high [[density of states]] at the Fermi level, so the charge that generates/screens external electric fields lies mainly on the outside of the top atomic layer, and no meaningful "field penetration" occurs. (4) Metals have high [[electrical conductivity]]: no significant voltage drops occur inside metal emitters: this means that there are no factors obstructing the supply of electrons to the emitting surface, and that the electrons in this region can be both in effective local [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] and in effective thermodynamic equilibrium with the electrons in the metal support structure on which the emitter is mounted. (5) Atomic-level effects are disregarded.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=February 2016}}

The development of "simple" theories of field electron emission, and in particular the development of Fowler-Nordheim-type equations, relies on all five of the above factors being true. For materials other than metals (and for atomically sharp metal emitters) one or more of the above factors will be untrue. For example, [[crystalline]] [[semiconductors]] do not have a free-electron-like band-structure, do have surface states, are subject to field penetration and [[band bending]], and may exhibit both internal voltage drops and statistical decoupling of the surface-state electron distribution from the electron distribution in the surface region of the bulk [[band structure|band-structure]] (this decoupling is known as "the Modinos effect").&lt;ref name=mo84/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mo74&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0039-6028(74)90013-2|title=Field emission from surface states in semiconductors|year=1974|last1=Modinos|first1=A|journal=Surface Science|volume=42|pages=205–227|bibcode = 1974SurSc..42..205M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the theory of the actual Fowler-Nordheim tunneling process is much the same for all materials (though details of barrier shape may vary, and modified theory has to be developed for initial states that are localized rather than are [[travelling wave|travelling-wave-like]]). However, notwithstanding such differences, one expects (for [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] situations) that all CFE equations will have exponents that behave in a generally similar manner. This is why applying Fowler-Nordheim-type equations to materials outside the scope of the derivations given here often works. If interest is only in parameters (such as field enhancement factor) that relate to the slope of Fowler-Nordheim or Millikan-Lauritsen plots and to the exponent of the CFE equation, then Fowler-Nordheim-type theory will often give sensible estimates. However, attempts to derive meaningful current density values will usually or always fail.

Note that a straight line in a Fowler-Nordheim or Millikan-Lauritsen plot does ''not'' indicate that emission from the corresponding material obeys a Fowler-Nordheim-type equation: it indicates only that the emission mechanism for individual electrons is probably Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2016}}

Different materials may have radically different distributions in energy of their internal electron states, so the process of integrating current-density contributions over the internal electron states may give rise to significantly different expressions for the current-density pre-exponentials, for different classes of material. In particular, the power of barrier field appearing in the pre-exponential may be different from the original Fowler-Nordheim value "2". Investigation of effects of this kind is an active research topic. Atomic-level "resonance" and "[[scattering]]" effects, if they occur, will also modify the theory.

Where materials are subject to field penetration and band bending, a necessary preliminary is to have good theories of such effects (for each different class of material) before detailed theories of CFE can be developed. Where voltage-drop effects occur, then the theory of the emission current may, to a greater or lesser extent, become theory that involves internal transport effects, and may become very complex.

'''Hexazinone''' is an [[organic compound]] that is used as a broad spectrum [[herbicide]].  It is a colorless solid.  It exhibits some solubility in water but is highly soluble in most organic solvents except alkanes.  A member  of the [[triazine]] class herbicides, it is manufactured by [[DuPont]] and sold under the trade name '''Velpar'''.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold P. Appleby, Franz Müller, Serge Carpy "Weed Control" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It functions by inhibiting photosynthesis and thus is a nonselective herbicide.  It is used to control grasses, broadleaf, and woody plants. Approximately 33% is used on alfalfa, 31% in forestry, 29% in industrial areas, 4% on rangeland and pastures, and &lt; 2% on sugarcane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/herb-growthreg/fatty-alcohol-monuron/hexazinone/herb-prof-hexazinone.html Hexazinone], Herbicide Profile, Pesticide Management Education Program, [[Cornell University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexazinone is a pervasive groundwater contaminant, due to its high water solubility

== History ==
Hexazinone is widely used as a herbicide. It is a non-selective herbicide from the triazine family. It's is used among a broad range of places. It is used to control weeds within all sort of applications. From sugarcane plantations, forestry field nurseries, pineapple plantations to high- and railway grasses and industrial plant sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Huili|last2=Xu|first2=Shuxia|last3=Tan|first3=Chengxia|last4=Wang|first4=Xuedong|date=2009-05-30|title=Anaerobic biodegradation of hexazinone in four sediments|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389408012752|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=164|issue=2–3|pages=806–811|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.08.073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexazinone was first registered in 1975 for the overall control of weeds and later for uses in crops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/web/pdf/0266fact.pdf|title=Hexazinone: Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) Fact Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and reactivity ==
Triazines like hexazinone can bind to the D-1 quinone protein of the electron transport chain in photosystem II to inhibit the photosynthesis. These diverted electrons can thereby damage membranes and destroy cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agron-www.agron.iastate.edu/Courses/Agron317/Photosynthesis_Inhibitors.htm|title=Agronomy 317 - Iowa State University|website=agron-www.agron.iastate.edu|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==
Hexazinone can be synthesized in two different reaction processes. One process starts with a reaction of [[methyl chloroformate]] with [[cyanamide]], forming hexazinone after a five-step pathway:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/470787466|title=Ullmann's agrochemicals.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=9783527316045|oclc=470787466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second synthesis starts with methyl[[thiourea]].:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Degradation ==
The degradation of hexazinone has long been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helling|first=C. S.|last2=Kearney|first2=P. C.|last3=Alexander|first3=M.|year=1971|title=Behavior of pesticides in soil|url=|journal=Adv. Agron.|volume=23|pages=147–240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It degrades approximately 10% in five weeks, when exposed to artificial sunlight in distilled water. However, degradation in natural waters can be three to seven times greater. Surprisingly, the [[pH]] and the temperature of the water do not affect the [[photodegradation]] significantly.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=R. C.|year=1980b|title=Studies with 14C-labeled hexazinone in water and bluegill sunfish|url=|journal=J. Agric. Food Chem.|volume=28|pages=306–310|via=|doi=10.1021/jf60228a002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is mainly degraded by aerobic microorganisms in soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=R. C.|year=1980a|title=Soil Studies with 14C-labeled hexazinone|url=|journal=J. Agric. Food Chem.|volume=28|pages=311–315|via=|doi=10.1021/jf60228a012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
Hexazinone is a broad-spectrum residual and contact [[herbicide]], rapidly absorbed by the leaves and roots. It is tolerated by conifers, and therefore it is a very effective [[herbicide]] for the control for [[Annual plant|annual]] and [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[Broad-leaved tree|broadleaf]] weeds, some grasses, and some woody species. Hexazinone works as rain or snowmelt makes it possible for the [[herbicide]] to move downward into the soil. There the hexazinone is absorbed from the soil by the roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental fates and impacts of major forest use pesticides|last=Ghassemi|first=M., et al.|publisher=|year=1981|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=169–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; It moves through the conductive tissues to the leaves, where it blocks the [[photosynthesis]] of the plant within the [[chloroplast]]s. Hexazinone binds to a protein of the [[photosystem II]] complex, which blocks the electron transport. The result are multiple following reactions. First triplet-state [[chlorophyll]] reacts with [[oxygen]] to form [[singlet oxygen]]. Both [[chlorophyll]] and [[singlet oxygen]] then remove [[hydrogen ion]]s from the unsaturated [[lipid]]s present in de cells and the organelle membranes, forming lipid radicals. These radicals will oxydize other lipids and proteins, eventually resulting in loss of the membrane integrity of the cells and organelles. This will result in a loss of [[chlorophyll]], leakage of cellular contents, cell death, and eventually death of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wssa.net/|title=Weed Science Society of America|website=wssa.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woody plants first show yellowing of the leaves before they start to defoliate, eventually they will die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidhu|first=S. S.|last2=Feng.|first2=J. C.|year=1993|title=Hexazinone and its metabolites in boreal forest vegetation.|url=|journal=Weed Sci.|volume=41|pages=281–287|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes plants are able to refoliate and defoliate again during the growing season.

The '''High Flux Australian Reactor''' ('''HIFAR''') was Australia's first [[nuclear reactor]]. It was built at the [[Australian Atomic Energy Commission]] (later [[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|ANSTO]]) Research Establishment at {{NSWcity|Lucas Heights}}, [[Sydney]]. The reactor was in operation between 1958 and 2007, when it was superseded by the [[Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor]], also in Lucas Heights.

==Background and operation==
Based on the [[DIDO (nuclear reactor)|DIDO reactor]] at [[Harwell]] in the UK, HIFAR was cooled and moderated by [[heavy water]] ([[deuterium oxide|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]), and the fuel was [[enriched uranium]]. There was also a graphite neutron reflector surrounding the core. Like DIDO, its original purpose was nuclear materials testing, using its high neutron flux to give materials intended for use in [[nuclear power reactor]]s their entire expected lifetime neutron exposure in a relatively short period.

HIFAR was used for research, particularly [[neutron diffraction]] experiments, production of neutron transmutation doped (NTD) silicon, and for production of medical and industrial [[radioisotope]]s.

HIFAR went critical at 11:15 pm local time on 26 January 1958,&lt;ref name="hifar_background"&gt;{{cite press release|author=|title=HIFAR Media Backgrounder|url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/6449/HIFAR_Media_Backgrounder.pdf|format=PDF|work=|publisher=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first run at full power of {{convert|10|MW}} (thermal) in 1960. The initial fuel was highly enriched uranium, but over the years the enrichment level of new fuel was steadily reduced, in line with international trends designed to reduce the danger of diversion of research reactor fuel for weapons programs. HIFAR completed conversion to low enriched uranium fuel (LEU) in 2006.
Of the six DIDO class reactors built including DIDO itself, HIFAR was the last to cease operation.  Permanent decommissioning of HIFAR commenced on 30 January 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Science Minister turns off nuclear reactor|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1836243.htm|work=ABC online|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to be completed by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/discovering_ansto/history_of_ansto/hifar|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505144252/http://www2.ansto.gov.au/discovering_ansto/history_of_ansto/hifar|title=Australia's first reactor|publisher=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|archivedate=5 May 2013|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 August 2006 [[Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor]] (abbreviated as OPAL), the {{convert|20|MW}} replacement reactor located on an adjacent site, went critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/discovering_ansto/anstos_research_reactor/development_of_opal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162011/http://www2.ansto.gov.au/discovering_ansto/anstos_research_reactor/development_of_opal|title=Development of OPAL|publisher=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|archivedate=16 May 2013|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; OPAL is served by the same complex of research, isotope production and remote handling laboratories.  The two reactors ran in parallel for six months while OPAL was being tested. HIFAR was then permanently shut down and OPAL took over HIFAR's role of Australia's only operating nuclear reactor.&lt;ref name="hifar_background" /&gt;

'''Information visualization''' or '''information visualisation''' is the study of (interactive) visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. The abstract data include both numerical and non-numerical data, such as text and geographic information. However, information visualization differs from [[scientific visualization]]: "it’s infovis [information visualization] when the spatial representation is chosen, and it’s scivis [scientific visualization] when the spatial representation is given".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2008/pitfalls/|title=Process and Pitfalls in Writing Information Visualization Research Papers|author=[[Tamara Munzner]]|date=|website=www.cs.ubc.ca|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|240px|Partial map of the Internet early 2005, each line represents two [[IP addresses]], and some delay between those two nodes.]]

The field of information visualization has emerged "from research in [[human-computer interaction]], [[computer science]], [[graphics]], [[visual design]], [[psychology]], and [[business methods]]. It is increasingly applied as a critical component in scientific research, [[digital libraries]], [[data mining]], financial data analysis, market studies, manufacturing [[production control]], and [[drug discovery]]".&lt;ref name = "BBB03"&gt;Benjamin B. Bederson and [[Ben Shneiderman]] (2003). [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/pubs/books/craft.shtml ''The Craft of Information Visualization: Readings and Reflections''], Morgan Kaufmann {{ISBN|1-55860-915-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information visualization presumes that "visual representations and interaction techniques take advantage of the human eye’s broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once. Information visualization focused on the creation of approaches for conveying abstract information in intuitive ways."&lt;ref&gt;James J. Thomas and Kristin A. Cook (Ed.) (2005). [http://nvac.pnl.gov/agenda.stm ''Illuminating the Path: The R&amp;D Agenda for Visual Analytics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929155753/http://nvac.pnl.gov/agenda.stm |date=2008-09-29 }}. National Visualization and Analytics Center. p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Data analysis is an indispensable part of all applied research and problem solving in industry. The most fundamental data analysis approaches are visualization (histograms, scatter plots, surface plots, tree maps, parallel coordinate plots, etc.), [[statistics]] ([[hypothesis test]], [[regression analysis|regression]], [[Principal component analysis|PCA]], etc.), [[data mining]] ([[Association rule learning|association mining]], etc.), and [[machine learning]] methods ([[cluster analysis|clustering]], [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[decision trees]], etc.). Among these approaches,  information visualization, or visual data analysis, is the most reliant on the cognitive skills of human analysts, and allows the discovery of unstructured actionable insights that are limited only by human imagination and creativity. The analyst does not have to learn any sophisticated methods to be able to interpret the visualizations of the data. Information visualization is also a hypothesis generation scheme, which can be, and is typically followed by more analytical or formal analysis, such as statistical hypothesis testing.

== History ==
The modern study of visualization started with [[computer graphics]], which "has from its beginning been used to study scientific problems. However, in its early days the lack of graphics power often limited its usefulness. The recent emphasis on visualization started in 1987 with the special issue of Computer Graphics on Visualization in ''[[Scientific Computing (magazine)|Scientific Computing]]''. Since then there have been several conferences and workshops, co-sponsored by the [[IEEE Computer Society]] and [[ACM SIGGRAPH]]".&lt;ref&gt;G. Scott Owen (1999). [http://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperVis/visgoals/visgoal3.htm History of Visualization]. Accessed Jan 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They have been devoted to the general topics of [[data visualisation]], information visualization and [[scientific visualisation]], and more specific areas such as [[volume visualization]].

'''The Institute for Cognitive Science Studies (ICSS)''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: پژوهشکده علوم شناختی)  is a non-governmental institution in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]], committed to providing a [[research]] and educational environment that brings together the various disciplines that contribute to  [[cognitive sciences]].

In the process of studying [[cognition]], ICSS pursues the following major objectives:
Discovery of important, unknown facts about key issues in [[cognitive science]] through quality experiments; understanding unresolved issues in [[cognitive science]] through provision of new, effective, analytical theories; identifying means of employing achievements in cognitive science to improve the quality of individual and social wellbeing

The prime interest of ICSS is to conduct research studies that enhance our knowledge and understanding of [[cognitive science]]. That objective requires the kind of theoretical, experimental, and applied studies, which would be beneficial not only in terms of employing these achievements in various aspects of life, but also in terms of advancing our scientific knowledge. The institute also adheres to the principle that research findings should be shared with other scientific communities through their publication in respectable peer-reviewed [[Academic journal|journals]] and [[books]]. To these ends, ICSS engages in a host of other activities.  They include:
* Offering graduate studies programs
* Providing short-term training programs and [[workshops]]
* Organizing and supporting scientific [[Academic conference|conferences]] and discussion meetings
* Participating in international collaborations
* Publishing (or supporting the publication of) specialized [[books]] and journals
* Providing an effective research environment by means of modernizing and equipping its [[laboratories]], and maintaining a resourceful [[library]]

The institute currently offers [[PhD]] and [[Master's degrees]] in the field of [[cognitive neuroscience]].

Currently, Dr Reza Zamani, a [[psychologist]] and previous [[associate professor]] of [[psychology]] in [[Tehran University]], is the director of the institute.

The '''International Planetarium Society, Inc.''' (IPS) is the global association of [[planetarium]] professionals. Its nearly 700 members come from [[List of planetariums|35 countries]] around the world. They represent schools, colleges and universities, museums, and public facilities of all sizes, including both fixed and portable planetariums. The primary goal of the Society is to encourage the sharing of ideas among its members through conferences, publications, and networking. By sharing their insights and creative work, IPS members become better planetarians.

IPS membership is open to anyone interested in planetariums. Members include directors, teachers, technicians, writers, artists, media specialists, digital artists and producers, presenters, vendors, scientists, students, and sponsors and friends of the planetarium dome and its starry sky.

More than 20 regional and national planetarium associations from around the world are affiliated with IPS. Representatives from those affiliates, together with the elected officers, make up the Executive Council, the ruling body of the organization.

All positions are volunteer.

== History&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=a_Engle1982 Historical Aspects of the International Planetarium Society]," Paul R. Engle, ''Planetarian'', Vol. 11 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=weinrich40year A Forty-year Perspective of the International Planetarium Society]," Dave Weinrich, ''Proceedings of the 47th Annual GLPA Conference'' in Champaign, Illinois, October 19–22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The genesis of what was to become the International Planetarium Society began with a meeting of planetarium educators in 1958 at the Cranbrook Institute in Michigan. Sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), about 100 delegates from 67 facilities attended. The conference's proceedings were published as ''[https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/pdf-pubs/1958_cranbrook_proceedings.pdf Planetaria and Their Uses for Education]''.

Another meeting was sponsored by the NSF in 1960, this time in Cleveland, Ohio, and resulted in ''[https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/pdf-pubs/1960_cleveland_proceedings.pdf Planetariums and Their Uses for Education, Volume 2].'' At this meeting those attending voted to initiate a national planetarium association called the American Association of Planetarium Operators, but nothing came out of the action.

Regional associations of planetarium educators formed in the 1960s, resulting in the forming of GLPA, MAPS, SWAP, PPA, RMPA, and SWAP, and PAC was formed in Canada.

More than 300 planetarians gathered in 1970 at the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University in East Lansing at a meeting called CAPE - the Conference of Planetarium Educators. At this meeting the decision was made to organize a North American planetarium association and publish a journal. By-laws for the International Society of Planetarium Educators were approved in 1971, and the journal, ''Planetarian'', began in 1972. Paul Engle from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Planetarium became the first president, and the first editor was Frank C. Jettner from the Department of Astronomy at the State University of New York at Albany. Among the articles in the first issue was "Science and Communication" by Isaac Asimov.

== Early Planetarians ==
The planetarium field's earliest members were those who invented and modified the equipment used to project the stars onto the dome.
Among them are
* [[Walther Bauersfeld]], often called the "father" of planetariums, for his development of the Zeiss 1 model opto-mechanical projector in 1923
* [[Armand Spitz]], who developed an early inexpensive opto-mechanical projector
* [[Richard H. Emmons]], who helped establish more than 23 planetariums

== Awards ==
The highest award given by IPS is the '''Service Award''', started in 1982. This award is bestowed, from time to time, by the Society upon an individual or institution whose presence and work in the planetarium field has been, through the years, an inspiration to the profession and its members.” Since 1982 there have been 23 people&lt;ref&gt;https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=awardees&lt;/ref&gt; awarded with the IPS Service Award.

Similarly, the IPS '''Technology and Innovation Award''' is given by the Society, from time to time, upon an individual whose technology and/or innovations in the planetarium field have been, through the years, used or replicated by other members and/or other planetariums.” The award began in 2009 and 4 persons&lt;ref&gt;https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=awardees&lt;/ref&gt; have been recognized.

Deserving IPS members also may be named a '''Fellow''' of the Society. To be named, a member must have continuous active membership in good standing in IPS for at least five years and substantial contributions in at least two of the following respects:

* Serving IPS in effective office, diligent and/or devoted committee work, and the organization of conferences and meetings.
* Relevant and significant publications and/or conference presentations.
* Cooperation with professional societies, organizations and groups which bring attention to the importance of planetariums’ existence.
* The development of new methods in the planetarium field.

'''John Brass''' was a manager and later director of [[Little Houghton, South Yorkshire|Houghton]] Main Colliery Co Ltd.  According to the ''Colliery Year Book and Coal Trades Directory'' he was "one of the most prominent figures in the South Yorkshire coal mining industry".{{sfn|anon|1947}}  He held significant posts in the mining, gas and coke industries both in South Yorkshire and nationally.  Between 1934 and 1937 he was one of the assessors in the [[Gresford disaster]] inquiry and, along with the other assessor, published dissenting reports to the main inquiry.

== Background ==
Brass' father '''Thomas Francis Brass OBE, JP, MA(Durham)''' was born in 1858, the son of a [[blacksmith]] in [[Sherburn Hill]], County Durham.{{sfn|DMM|2016}}  TF Brass rose from colliery clerk through colliery cashier, to become a Surface Manager and eventually the Under Manager for Kimblesworth Colliery.  By 1921 he was the agent (responsible for the general laying out and supervision of the workings) for Charlaw &amp; Sacriston Collieries Co Ltd.{{sfn|DMM|2016}}  In 1903 he was one of the team of rescuers who entered the flooded Sacriston pit.  For this he was awarded the silver medal of the [[Royal Humane Society]].  TF Brass retired in 1934 and died in 1937.{{sfn|DMM|2016}}

== Career ==
Brass was born 1879 in Wingate, County Durham.{{sfn|DMM|2018}}  He was the eldest son of Thomas Francis Brass, the agent for Charlaw &amp; Sacriston Collieries Co Ltd.  Brass attended the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne]].  In 1894 he started work at Charlaw &amp; [[Sacriston]] Collieries in County Durham.  In 1902 he gained his Manager's certificate (number 2,098) and in 1903 became the manager or Primrose Colliery.  In that year he was one of the rescuers who entered Sacriston Colliery along with his father, but unlike his father he was not awarded a RHS medal.{{efn|However some sources credit him with receiving a medal.  The Colliery Year Book and Coal Trades Directory for 1940 credits him with the medal, but the issues for 1933, 1945 and 1950 do not.{{sfn|DMM|2018}}  The Mines Inspectors Report for 1903 states that: "six of the explorers ; those selected being Mr. W. Walker, Inspector of Mines, Mr. W. C. Blackett, the Agent of the Colliery, Mr. S. Tate, the Agent for Messrs. Walter Scott, Ltd., Mr. T. F. Brass, Assistant Manager, and H. Blackburn and J. Hall, two Deputy-Overmen."{{sfn|Mine Inspectors Report|1903}}}}  By 1909 he was a member of the Institute of Mining Engineers.

During [[World War I]] he was Acting Major, 13th [[York and Lancaster Regiment#New Armies|York and Lancaster]] Service Battalion.{{sfn|DMM|2018}}{{efn|The battalion was known as the 1st Barnsley Pals.  The battalion was formed in Barnsley on 17 September 1914.  It moved to [[Silkstone]] in December 1914, to [[Penkridge]] Camp (Cannock Chase) in May 1914, to [[Claro Barracks|Ripon]] in July 1915 and to [[Salisbury Plain#Defence Training Estate (DTE SP)|Salisbury plain]] in October 1915.  In December 1915 the battalion moved to Egypt, and from there was sent to France in March 1916 where it took part on the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme]].{{sfn|Baker|2018}}}}  Later in the war Brass was appointed Divisional Commander of Special Police for the Staincross Division of Yorkshire and became a Military Representative on Tribunals.{{sfn|DMM|2018}}

In 1923 Brass was Director and General Manager of [[Little Houghton, South Yorkshire|Houghton]] Main Colliery Co Ltd.  Between 1923 and 1925 he was the President of the Midland Institute of Mining Engineers during which time he also became a member of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]].{{sfn|DMM|2018}}  In 1929 Brass was a member of the committee which examined the issues surrounding the replacement of rail mounted tubs with conveyor belts.{{sfn|The_Science &amp; Art of Mining|1929|p=6}}

In 1935 he was awarded the Medal of the Institution of Mining Engineers "in recognition of distinguished services to the mining profession and industry over a period of many years".{{sfn|The Science &amp; Art of Mining|1935|p=155}}  He was also awarded the Peake Gold Medal by the Midland Institute of Mining Engineers.{{sfn|DMM|2018}}

== Gresford inquiry ==
{{further|Gresford disaster#Inquiry}}
On Saturday 22 September 1934 at 2:08 a.m. a violent explosion ripped through the Dennis section of [[Gresford Colliery]].{{sfn|Walker|Brass|Jones|1937}}  An inquiry into the [[Gresford disaster]] was ordered on 11 October 1934 and sat intermittently from 25 October 1934 to 13 December 1936.{{sfn|Walker|Brass|Jones|1937}}  The report was laid before Parliament and debated on 23 February 1937.{{sfn|"Hansard"|1937}}  The inquiry sat with a commissioner and two assessors, one of whom was Brass.  The outcome was unusual for all three men arrived at different conclusions with the assessors' reports being presented as appendices to the main report.{{sfn|Walker|Brass|Jones|1937}}  The official finding, as presented by the commissioner Sir Henry Walker, viewed with suspicion [[Dynamite|shot]] firing activities.  The other assessor, [[Joseph Jones (trade unionist)|Mr Joseph Jones]], was concerned about a possible [[firedamp]] build up on one of the faces which was ignited by an accident with a safety lamp or from a spark from a mechanised coalcutter.  Brass however was concerned about the telephones which were not of an approved type.  He surmised that the explosion could have been caused by a gas build on one of the main access tunnels which was ignited by the telephone being called.{{sfn|Walker|Brass|Jones|1937}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3282">The '''Konrad Lorenz Institute of Ethology''' (German: “Konrad-Lorenz-Institut für Vergleichende Verhaltensforschung“ or KLIVV) is a research institute in [[Vienna]], Austria, dedicated to studying behavioral biology and the links between animal behaviour and conservation. Founded by the animal photographer Otto Koenig and his wife, the illustrator Lilli Koenig as “Biologische Station Wilhelminenberg” (Biological Station Wilhelminenberg) in 1945, it was later named after the Nobel laureate [[Konrad Lorenz]] and incorporated into the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna]] in 2011.

==History and organisation==
The “Biologische Station Wilheminenberg” was founded by the biologist couple Otto and Lilli Koenig in response to the ground-breaking research in the field of comparative ethology, including the work by Konrad Lorenz. The research institute was established in abandoned army barracks&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencev2.orf.at/stories/1671239/&lt;/ref&gt; in the outskirts of Vienna’s 16th district [[Ottakring]] at the onset of the [[Vienna Woods]], and endowed with substantial space and facilities supported by private means.

The facility developed and was re-structured into the Institute of Ethology of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in 1967. Otto Koenig, who became a public figure through his role as a presenter of nature documentaries,&lt;ref&gt;https://idw-online.de/de/news609724&lt;/ref&gt; remained director also after this re-structuring until his retirement in 1984. He was succeeded by the ornithologist Hans Winkler. When Konrad Lorenz died in 1989, the institute was renamed after him.

Under the leadership of Hans Winkler, the Konrad Lorenz Institute was gradually modernised and both laboratories and staff were extended. This resulted in substantial refurbishments between 1985 and 2002, when Dustin J. Penn succeeded Winkler as director.

In 2011, the Konrad Lorenz Institute was merged with the Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology and both facilities became part of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. Both research institutes combined now provide a facility for approximately 80 scientists. Director of the new institute is Walter Arnold. Since spring 2015, the Konrad Lorenz Institute is also the headquarter of the Austrian Ornithological Centre (AOC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/konrad-lorenz-institute-of-ethology/austrian-ornithological-centre-aoc/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The scientific work at the Konrad Lorenz Institute traditionally focusses on ethology and evolutionary aspects of animal behaviour, in particular related to sexual selection and sexual conflicts. The restructuring of 2011 broadened the research objectives to include physiological and ecological aspects of wild animals in interaction with their environment.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2010}}

A '''lab-on-a-chip''' ('''LOC''') is a device that integrates one or several [[laboratory]] functions on a single [[integrated circuit]] (commonly called a "chip") of only millimeters to a few square centimeters to achieve automation and high-throughput screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Volpatti, L. R. |author2=Yetisen, A. K. | title = Commercialization of microfluidic devices | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 7 | pages = 347–350 |date=Jul 2014 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2014.04.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; LOCs can handle extremely small fluid volumes down to less than [[pico-]]liters. Lab-on-a-chip devices are a subset of [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) devices and sometimes called "micro total analysis systems" (µTAS). LOCs may use [[microfluidics]], the physics, manipulation and study of minute amounts of fluids. However, strictly regarded "lab-on-a-chip" indicates generally the scaling of single or multiple lab processes down to chip-format, whereas "µTAS" is dedicated to the integration of the total sequence of lab processes to perform chemical analysis. The term "lab-on-a-chip" was introduced when it turned out that µTAS technologies were applicable for more than only analysis purposes.

== History ==
[[File:Labonachip20017-300.jpg|thumb|Microelectromechanical systems chip, sometimes called "lab on a chip"]]
After the invention of [[microtechnology]] (~1954) for realizing integrated [[semiconductor]] structures for microelectronic chips, these [[lithography]]-based technologies were soon applied in pressure sensor manufacturing (1966) as well. Due to further development of these usually [[CMOS]]-compatibility limited processes, a tool box became available to create micrometre or sub-micrometre sized mechanical structures in silicon [[wafers]] as well: the Micro Electro Mechanical Systems ([[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]) era had started.

Next to pressure sensors, airbag sensors and other mechanically movable structures, fluid handling devices were developed. Examples are: channels (capillary connections), mixers, valves, pumps and dosing devices. The first LOC analysis system was a gas chromatograph, developed in 1979 by S.C. Terry at Stanford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=James B. Angell |author2=Stephen C. Terry |author3=Phillip W. Barth |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=April 1983 |title=Silicon Micromechanical Devices |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=248 |issue=4 |pages=44–55 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0483-44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.C.Terry, J.H.Jerman and J.B.Angell: A Gas Chromatographic Air Analyzer Fabricated on a Silicon Wafer, IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, ED-26, 12(1979) 1880–1886.&lt;/ref&gt; However, only at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s did the LOC research start to seriously grow as a few research groups in Europe developed micropumps, flowsensors  and the concepts for integrated fluid treatments for analysis systems.&lt;ref&gt;A.Manz, N.Graber and H.M.Widmer: Miniaturized total Chemical Analysis systems: A Novel Concept for Chemical Sensing, Sensors and Actuators, B 1 (1990) 244–248.&lt;/ref&gt;  These µTAS concepts demonstrated that integration of pre-treatment steps, usually done at lab-scale, could extend the simple sensor functionality towards a complete laboratory analysis, including additional cleaning and separation steps.

A big boost in research and commercial interest came in the mid 1990s, when µTAS technologies turned out to provide interesting tooling for [[genomics]] applications, like [[capillary electrophoresis]] and [[DNA microarrays]]. A big boost in research support also came from the military, especially from [[DARPA]] (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), for their interest in portable bio/chemical warfare agent detection systems. The added value was not only limited to integration of lab processes for analysis but also the characteristic possibilities of individual components and the application to other, non-analysis, lab processes. Hence the term "Lab-on-a-Chip" was introduced.

Although the application of LOCs is still novel and modest, a growing interest of companies and applied research groups is observed in different fields such as analysis (e.g. chemical analysis, environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics and cellomics)  but also in synthetic chemistry (e.g. rapid screening and microreactors for pharmaceutics). Besides further application developments, research in LOC systems is expected to extend towards downscaling of fluid handling structures as well, by using [[nanotechnology]]. Sub-micrometre and nano-sized channels, DNA labyrinths, single cell detection and analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Venkat Chokkalingam, Jurjen Tel, Florian Wimmers, Xin Liu, Sergey Semenov, Julian Thiele, Carl G.

== Chip materials and fabrication technologies ==
The basis for most LOC fabrication processes is [[photolithography]]. Initially most processes were in silicon, as these well-developed technologies were directly derived from [[semiconductor]] fabrication. Because of demands for e.g. specific optical characteristics, bio- or chemical compatibility, lower production costs and faster prototyping, new processes have been developed such as glass, ceramics and metal [[industrial etching|etching]], deposition and bonding, [[polydimethylsiloxane]] (PDMS) processing (e.g., [[soft lithography]]), [[Off-stoichiometry thiol-ene polymer]]s (OSTEmer) processing, thick-film- and [[stereolithography]] as well as fast replication methods via [[electroplating]], [[injection molding]] and [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossing]]. The demand for cheap and easy LOC prototyping resulted in a simple methodology for the fabrication of PDMS microfluidic devices: ESCARGOT (Embedded SCAffold RemovinG Open Technology).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Saggiomo, V. |author2=Velders, H. A. | title = Simple 3D Printed Scaffold-Removal Method for the Fabrication of Intricate Microfluidic Devices | journal = Advanced Science | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = X |date=Jul 2015 | doi = 10.1002/advs.201500125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique allows for the creation of microfluidic channels, in a single block of PDMS, via a dissolvable scaffold (made by e.g. [[3D printing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z8I7awRYY4|title=Simple fabrication of complex microfluidic devices (ESCARGOT)|first=|last=Vittorio Saggiomo|date=17 July 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, the LOC field more and more exceeds the borders between lithography-based microsystem technology, nanotechnology and precision engineering.

== Advantages ==
LOCs may provide advantages, which are specific to their application. Typical advantages&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; are:
* low fluid volumes consumption (less waste, lower reagents costs and less required sample volumes for diagnostics)
* faster analysis and response times due to short diffusion distances, fast heating, high surface to volume ratios, small heat capacities.
* better process control because of a faster response of the system (e.g. thermal control for exothermic chemical reactions)
* compactness of the systems due to integration of much functionality and small volumes
* massive parallelization due to compactness, which allows high-throughput analysis
* lower fabrication costs, allowing cost-effective disposable chips, fabricated in mass production&lt;ref name="researchgate.net"&gt;Ryan S. Pawell, David W. Inglis, Tracie J. Barber, and Robert A. Taylor, ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256487052_Manufacturing_and_wetting_low-cost_microfluidic_cell_separation_devices Manufacturing and wetting low-cost microfluidic cell separation devices]'', Biomicrofluidics 7, 056501 (2013); {{DOI|10.1063/1.4821315}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* part quality may be verified automatically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10404-014-1464-1?sa_campaign=email/event/articleAuthor/onlineFirst | doi=10.1007/s10404-014-1464-1 | volume=18 | title=Automating microfluidic part verification | journal=Microfluidics and Nanofluidics | pages=657–665}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* safer platform for chemical, radioactive or biological studies because of integration of functionality, smaller fluid volumes and stored energies

== Disadvantages ==
The most prominent disadvantages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engel|first=U|last2=Eckstein|first2=R|date=2002-09-09|title=Microforming – from basic research to its realization|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924013602004156|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=125|issue=Supplement C|pages=35–44|doi=10.1016/S0924-0136(02)00415-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Labs-on-chip are:
* The micro-manufacturing process required to make them is complex and labor intensive, requiring both expensive equipment and specialized personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanchez-Salmeron|first=A. J.|last2=Lopez-Tarazon|first2=R.|last3=Guzman-Diana|first3=R.|last4=Ricolfe-Viala|first4=C.|date=2005-08-30|title=Recent development in micro-handling systems for micro-manufacturing|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092401360500590X|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|series=2005 International Forum on the Advances in Materials Processing Technology|volume=167|issue=2|pages=499–507|doi=10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2005.06.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be overcome by the recent technology advancement on low-cost [[3D printing]] and [[laser engraving]]
*The complex fluidic actuation network requires multiple pumps and connectors, where fine control is difficult. It can be overcome by careful simulation, an intrinsic pump, such as air-bag embed chip, or by using a centrifugal force to replace the pumping, i.e. [[centrifugal micro-fluidic biochip]]

* Most LOCs are novel proof of concept application that are not yet fully developed for widespread use.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-3534-5|title=Microfluidics and BioMEMS Applications |publisher= SpringerLink|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-3534-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More validations are needed before practical employment
* In the microliter scale that LOCs deal with, surface dependent effects like capillary forces, surface roughness or chemical interactions are more dominant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can sometimes make replicating lab processes in LOCs quite challenging and more complex than in conventional lab equipment
* Detection principles may not always scale down in a positive way, leading to low [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s

== Global health ==
Lab-on-a-chip technology may soon become an important part of efforts to improve [[global health]],&lt;ref name="Yager2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Paul Yager |author2= Thayne Edwards |author3= Elain Fu |author4= Kristen Helton |author5= Kjell Nelson |author6= Milton R. Tam |author7= Bernhard H. Weigl |date=July 2006 |title= Microfluidic diagnostic technologies for global public health |journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume= 442 |issue= 7101 |pages= 412–418|doi= 10.1038/nature05064 |pmid= 16871209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly through the development of [[point-of-care testing]] devices.&lt;ref name="Yetisen2013"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yetisen A. K. | year = 2013 | title = Paper-based microfluidic point-of-care diagnostic devices | url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/lc/c3lc50169h | journal = Lab on a Chip |volume= 13 |issue= 12 |pages= 2210–2251 |doi=10.1039/C3LC50169H}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In countries with few healthcare resources, [[infectious diseases]] that would be treatable in a developed nation are often deadly.  In some cases, poor healthcare clinics have the drugs to treat a certain illness but lack the [[diagnostic tool]]s to identify patients who should receive the drugs.  Many researchers believe that LOC technology may be the key to powerful new diagnostic instruments. The goal of these researchers is to create [[microfluidic]] chips that will allow healthcare providers in poorly equipped clinics to perform diagnostic tests such as [[immunoassays]] and [[nucleic acid]] [[assays]] with no laboratory support.

=== Global challenges ===
For the chips to be used in areas with limited resources, many challenges must be overcome.  In developed nations, the most highly valued traits for diagnostic tools include speed, sensitivity, and specificity; but in countries where the healthcare infrastructure is less well developed, attributes such as ease of use and shelf life must also be considered.  The reagents that come with the chip, for example, must be designed so that they remain effective for months even if the chip is not kept in a [[climate control]]led environment.  Chip designers must also keep [[cost]], [[scalability]], and [[recyclability]] in mind as they choose what materials and fabrication techniques to use.

=== Examples of global LOC application ===
One of the most prominent and well known LOC devices to reach the market is the at home pregnancy test kit, a device that utilizes  [[paper-based microfluidics]] technology. Another active area of LOC research involves ways to diagnose and manage [[HIV]] infections.  Around 36.9 million people are infected with HIV in the world today and 59% of these people receive [[anti-retroviral]] treatment. Only 75% of people living with HIV knew their HIV status&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Measuring the number of [[CD4+ T lymphocytes]] in a person’s blood is an accurate way to determine if a person has HIV and to track the progress of an HIV infection {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}.  At the moment, flow [[cytometry]] is the gold standard for obtaining CD4 counts, but flow cytometry is a complicated technique that is not available in most developing areas because it requires trained technicians and expensive equipment. Recently such a cytometer was developed for just $5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozcan|first=Aydogan|title=Diagnosis in the palm of your hand|url=http://dailybruin.com/2011/08/21/43312-8-22-radio-diagnosis/|work=Multimedia::Cytometer|publisher=The Daily Bruin|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another active area of LOC research is for controlled separation and mixing.  In such devices it is possible to quickly diagnose and potentially treat diseases. As mentioned above, a big motivation for development of these is that they can potentially be manufactured at very low cost.&lt;ref name="researchgate.net"/&gt;

== Plant sciences ==
Lab-on-a-chip devices could be used to characterize [[pollen tube]] guidance in [[Arabidopsis thaliana]]. Specifically, plant on a chip is a miniaturized device in which pollen tissues and ovules could be incubated for plant sciences studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=AK Yetisen |author2=L Jiang |author3=J R Cooper |author4=Y Qin |author5=R Palanivelu |author6=Y Zohar |title=A microsystem-based assay for studying pollen tube guidance in plant reproduction. |journal= J.

'''The London Centre for Nanotechnology''' is a multidisciplinary research centre in physical and biomedical [[nanotechnology]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It brings together three institutions that are world leaders in nanotechnology, [[University College London]], [[Imperial College London]] and [[King's College London]]. It was conceived from the outset with a management structure allowing for a clear focus on exploitation and commercialisation. Although based at UCL's campus in [[Bloomsbury]], the LCN includes research in departments of Imperial's [[South Kensington]] campus and in King's [[Strand, London|Strand]] campus.

The LCN's work requires it to draw on the combined skills of multiple departments, including medicine, chemistry, physics, electrical and electronic engineering, biochemical engineering, materials and earth sciences, and two leading business centres. The LCN’s stated vision is to become Europe’s premier research centre in nanotechnology applied to health care, information technology and the environment.

==History==

The London Centre for Nanotechnology was established as a joint venture between UCL and [[Imperial College London]] in 2003 following the award of a £13.65m higher education grant under the Science Research Infrastructure Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2698649.stm | title=London's little idea|accessdate=31 October 2010|publisher=BBC News| date=27 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2981480.stm | title=Nanotech under the microscope|accessdate=31 October 2010 | publisher=BBC News| date=12 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006 the LCN installed the first monochromated electron microscope in the UK at its site on the [[Imperial College London]] campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/news/2006/october/20100601.asp | title=UK researchers unveil country's most powerful microscope|accessdate=31 October 2010 | publisher=Chemistry World| date=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[flight dynamics]], '''longitudinal static stability''' is the stability of an aircraft in the longitudinal, or pitching, plane under [[steady flight]] conditions. This characteristic is important in determining whether a [[Aviator|human pilot]] will be able to control the aircraft in the pitching plane without requiring excessive attention or excessive strength.&lt;ref name=LJC16&gt;Clancy, L.J. (1975) ''Aerodynamics'', Chapter 16, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Static stability ==
[[File:Aircraft static longitudinal stability.svg|400px|thumbnail|Three cases for static stability: following a pitch disturbance, aircraft can be either unstable, neutral, or stable.]]

As any vehicle moves it will be subjected to minor changes in the forces that act on it, and in its speed.
* If such a change causes further changes that tend to restore the vehicle to its original speed and orientation, without human or machine input, the vehicle is said to be statically stable. The aircraft has positive stability.
* If such a change causes further changes that tend to drive the vehicle away from its original speed and orientation, the vehicle is said to be statically unstable.  The aircraft has negative stability.
* If such a change causes no tendency for the vehicle to be restored to its original speed and orientation, and no tendency for the vehicle to be driven away from its original speed and orientation, the vehicle is said to be neutrally stable.  The aircraft has zero stability.

For a vehicle to possess positive static stability it is not necessary for its speed and orientation to return to exactly the speed and orientation that existed before the minor change that caused the upset.  It is sufficient that the speed and orientation do not continue to diverge but undergo at least a small change back towards the original speed and orientation.

== Longitudinal stability ==
The longitudinal stability of an aircraft refers to the aircraft's stability in the pitching plane - the plane which describes the position of the aircraft's nose in relation to its tail and the horizon.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;  (Other stability modes are [[directional stability]] and lateral stability.)

If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, a small increase in [[angle of attack]] will cause the [[pitching moment]] on the aircraft to change so that the angle of attack decreases.  Similarly, a small decrease in angle of attack will cause the pitching moment to change so that the angle of attack increases.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;

== The pilot's task ==
The pilot of an aircraft with positive longitudinal stability, whether it is a human pilot or an [[autopilot]], has an easy task to fly the aircraft and maintain the desired pitch attitude which, in turn, makes it easy to control the speed, angle of attack and [[fuselage]] angle relative to the horizon.  The pilot of an aircraft with negative longitudinal stability has a more difficult task to fly the aircraft.  It will be necessary for the pilot devote more effort, make more frequent inputs to the elevator control, and make larger inputs, in an attempt to maintain the desired pitch attitude.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;

Most successful aircraft have positive longitudinal stability, providing the aircraft's [[center of gravity]] lies within the approved range.  Some acrobatic and combat aircraft have low-positive or neutral stability to provide high maneuverability.  Some advanced aircraft have a form of low-negative stability called [[relaxed stability]] to provide extra-high maneuverability.

== Center of gravity ==
The longitudinal static stability of an aircraft is significantly influenced by the distance (moment arm or lever arm) between the [[centre of gravity]] (c.g.) and the [[aerodynamic centre]] of the airplane.  The c.g. is established by the design of the airplane and influenced by its loading, as by payload, passengers, etc.  The aerodynamic centre (a.c.) of the airplane can be located approximately by taking the algebraic sum of the plan-view areas fore and aft of the c.g. multiplied by their blended moment arms and divided by their areas, in a manner analogous to the method of locating the c.g. itself.  In conventional aircraft, this point is aft of, but close to, the one-quarter-chord point of the wing.  In unconventional aircraft, e.g. the [[Rutan Quickie|Quickie]], it is between the two wings because the aft wing is so large.  The pitching moment at the a.c. is typically negative and constant.

The a.c. of an airplane typically does not change with loading or other changes; but the c.g. does, as noted above.  If the c.g. moves forward, the airplane becomes more stable (greater moment arm between the a.c. and the c.g.), and if too far forward will cause the airplane to be difficult for the pilot to bring nose-up as for landing.  If the c.g. is too far aft, the moment arm between it and the a.c. diminishes, reducing the inherent stability of the airplane and in the extreme going negative and rendering the airplane longitudinally unstable; see the diagram below.

Accordingly, the operating handbook for every airplane specifies the range over which the c.g. is permitted to move.  Inside this range, the airplane is considered to be inherently stable, which is to say that it will self-correct longitudinal (pitch) disturbances without pilot input.&lt;ref&gt;"The slope of the pitching moment curve [as a function of lift coefficient] has come to be the criterion of static longitudinal stability." Perkins and Hage, ''Airplane Performance, Stability, and Control'', Wiley, 1949, p. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
&lt;!-- The following material was cut from [[Pitching moment]] and pasted here when this article (Longitudinal static stability) was created on 10 Dec 2007.  To see the history of the following material go to [[Pitching moment]] and view the history prior to 10 Dec 2007.--&gt;
Near the cruise condition most of the lift force is generated by the wings, with ideally only a small amount generated by the fuselage and tail. We may analyse the longitudinal static stability by considering the aircraft in [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] under wing lift, tail force, and weight.  The moment equilibrium condition is called [[trim (aircraft)|trim]], and we are generally interested in the longitudinal stability of the aircraft about this trim condition.

[[File:AirStability.svg]]

Equating [[force]]s in the vertical direction:
:&lt;math&gt;W=L_w+L_t&lt;/math&gt;
where W is the weight, &lt;math&gt;L_w&lt;/math&gt; is the wing lift and &lt;math&gt;L_t&lt;/math&gt; is the tail force.  

For a thin airfoil at low [[angle of attack]], the wing lift is proportional to the angle of attack:
:&lt;math&gt;L_w=qS_w\frac{\partial C_L}{\partial \alpha} (\alpha-\alpha_0)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is the wing area &lt;math&gt;C_L&lt;/math&gt; is the (wing) [[lift coefficient]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of attack.  The term &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0&lt;/math&gt; is included to account for camber, which results in lift at zero angle of attack. Finally &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dynamic pressure]]:
:&lt;math&gt;q=\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[air density]] and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the speed.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins and Hage, ''Airplane Performance, Stability, and Control'', Wiley, NY, 1949, p. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This ref has been dropped in here as the best place for it, but somebody needs to check that it does bear out the above analysis --&gt;

===Trim===
The force from the tailplane is proportional to its angle of attack, including the effects of any elevator deflection and any adjustment the pilot has made to trim-out any stick force.  In addition, the tail is located in the flow field of the main wing, and consequently experiences  [[downwash]], reducing its angle of attack. 

In a statically stable aircraft of conventional (tail in rear) configuration, the [[tailplane]] force may act upward or downward depending on the design and the flight conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = BRA | last = Burns | title = Canards: Design with Care | newspaper = Flight International | date = 23 February 1985 | pages = 19–21 | quote = It is a misconception that tailed aeroplanes always carry tailplane downloads. They usually do, with flaps down and at forward c.g. positions, but with flaps up at the c.g. aft, tail loads at high lift are frequently positive (up), although the tail's maximum lifting capability is rarely approached.}}.[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200561.html p.19][http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200562.html p.20][http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200563.html p.21]&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical canard aircraft both fore and aft planes are lifting surfaces. The fundamental requirement for static stability is that the aft surface must have greater authority (leverage) in restoring a disturbance than the forward surface has in exacerbating it.  This leverage is a product of moment arm from the center of mass and surface area. Correctly balanced in this way, the partial derivative of pitching moment with respect to changes in angle of attack will be negative: a momentary pitch up to a larger angle of attack makes the resultant pitching moment tend to pitch the aircraft back down. (Here, pitch is used casually for the angle between the nose and the direction of the airflow; angle of attack.) This is the "stability derivative" d(M)/d(alpha), described below. 

The tail force is, therefore:
:&lt;math&gt; L_t=q S_t\left(\frac{\partial C_l}{\partial \alpha}\left(\alpha-\frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial \alpha}\alpha\right)+\frac{\partial C_l}{\partial \eta}\eta\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S_t\!&lt;/math&gt; is the tail area, &lt;math&gt;C_l\!&lt;/math&gt; is the tail force coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\eta\!&lt;/math&gt; is the elevator deflection, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\!&lt;/math&gt; is the downwash angle.

A canard aircraft may have its foreplane rigged at a high angle of incidence, which can be seen in a canard catapult glider from a toy store; the design puts the c.g. well forward, requiring nose-up lift.

Violations of the basic principle are exploited in some high performance "relaxed static stability" combat aircraft to enhance agility; artificial stability is supplied by active electronic means.

There are a few classical cases where this favourable response was not achieved, notably some early T-tail jet aircraft. In the event of a very high angle of attack, the horizontal stabilizer became immersed in downwash from the wing and fuselage, causing excessive download on the stabilizer, increasing the angle of attack still further. The only way an aircraft could recover from this situation was by jettisoning tail ballast or deploying a special tail parachute.  The phenomenon became known as '[[Stall (flight)#Deep stall|deep stall]]'.

Taking moments about the [[center of gravity]], the net nose-up moment is:
:&lt;math&gt;M=L_w x_g-(l_t-x_g)L_t\!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_g\!&lt;/math&gt; is the location of the center of gravity behind the [[aerodynamic center]] of the main wing, &lt;math&gt;l_t\!&lt;/math&gt; is the tail moment arm.
For trim, this moment must be zero.  For a given maximum elevator deflection, there is a corresponding limit on center of gravity position at which the aircraft can be kept in equilibrium.  When limited by control deflection this is known as a 'trim limit'.  In principle trim limits could determine the permissible forwards and rearwards shift of the centre of gravity, but usually it is only the forward cg limit which is determined by the available control, the aft limit is usually dictated by stability.

In a missile context 'trim limit' more usually refers to the maximum angle of attack, and hence lateral acceleration which can be generated.

===Static stability===
The nature of stability may be examined by considering the increment in pitching moment with change in angle of attack at the trim condition.  If this is nose up, the aircraft is longitudinally unstable; if nose down it is stable.  Differentiating the moment equation with respect to &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial M}{\partial \alpha}=x_g\frac{\partial L_w}{\partial \alpha}-(l_t-x_g)\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial \alpha} &lt;/math&gt;
Note: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial M}{\partial \alpha} &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Stability derivatives|stability derivative]].

It is convenient to treat total lift as acting at a distance h ahead of the centre of gravity, so that the moment equation may be written:
:&lt;math&gt;M=h(L_w+L_t)\!&lt;/math&gt;
Applying the increment in angle of attack:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial M}{\partial \alpha}=h\left(\frac{\partial L_w}{\partial \alpha}+\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial \alpha}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Equating the two expressions for moment increment:
:&lt;math&gt;h=x_g-l_t\frac {\frac {\partial L_t}{\partial \alpha}}{\frac{\partial L_w}{\partial \alpha}+\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial \alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;
The total lift &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of &lt;math&gt;L_w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_t&lt;/math&gt; so the sum in the denominator can be simplified and written as the derivative of the total lift due to angle of attack, yielding:
:&lt;math&gt;h=\frac{x_g}{c}-\left(1-\frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial \alpha}\right)\frac{\frac{\partial C_l}{\partial \alpha}}{\frac{\partial C_L}{\partial \alpha}}\frac{l_t S_t}{c S_w}&lt;/math&gt;
Where c is the [[mean aerodynamic chord]] of the main wing.  The term:
:&lt;math&gt;V_t=\frac{l_t S_t}{c S_w}&lt;/math&gt;
is known as the tail volume ratio.  Its rather complicated coefficient{{clarify|date=December 2014}}&lt;!-- why is it complicated? --&gt;, the ratio of the two lift derivatives, has values in the range of 0.50 to 0.65 for typical configurations, according to Piercy.  Hence the expression for h may be written more compactly, though somewhat approximately, as:
:&lt;math&gt;h=x_g-0.5 cV_t\!&lt;/math&gt;
h is known as the [[static margin]].  For stability it must be negative. (However, for consistency of language, the static margin is sometimes taken as &lt;math&gt;-h&lt;/math&gt;, so that positive stability is associated with positive static margin.)

== Neutral point ==
A mathematical analysis of the longitudinal static stability of a complete aircraft (including horizontal stabilizer) yields the position of center of gravity at which stability is neutral.  This position is called the neutral point.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;  (The larger the area of the horizontal stabilizer, and the greater the moment arm of the horizontal stabilizer about the aerodynamic center, the further aft is the neutral point.)

The static center of gravity margin (c.g. margin) or [[static margin]] is the distance between the center of gravity (or mass) and the neutral point.  It is usually quoted as a percentage of the [[Chord (aircraft)|Mean Aerodynamic Chord]].  The center of gravity must lie ahead of the neutral point for positive stability (positive static margin). If the center of gravity is behind the neutral point, the aircraft is longitudinally unstable (the static margin is negative), and active inputs to the control surfaces are required to maintain stable flight.  Some combat aircraft that are controlled by [[fly-by-wire]] systems are designed to be longitudinally unstable so they will be highly maneuverable.  Ultimately, the position of the center of gravity relative to the neutral point determines the stability, control forces, and controllability of the vehicle.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;

For a [[tailless aircraft]] &lt;math&gt;V_t=0&lt;/math&gt;, the neutral point coincides with the aerodynamic center, and so for longitudinal static stability the center of gravity must lie ahead of the aerodynamic center.

== Longitudinal dynamic stability ==

An aircraft’s static stability is an important, but not sufficient, measure of its handling characteristics, and whether it can be flown with ease and comfort by a human pilot. In particular, the [[longitudinal dynamic stability]] of a statically stable aircraft will determine whether or not it is finally able to return to its original position.

The '''Malthusian trap''' or '''population trap''' is a condition whereby excess population would stop growing due to shortage of food supply leading to starvation. It is named for [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], who suggested that while technological advances could increase a society's supply of resources, such as food, and thereby improve the standard of living, the resource abundance would enable [[population growth]], which would eventually bring the per capita supply of resources back to its original level.  Some economists contend that since the [[industrial revolution]], mankind has broken out of the trap.&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Galor |first=Oded |year=2005 |chapter=From Stagnation to Growth: Unified Growth Theory |title=Handbook of Economic Growth |volume=1 |pages=171–293 |publisher=Elsevier |chapterurl=https://ideas.repec.org/h/eee/grochp/1-04.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Gregory |year=2007 |title=A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-12135-2 |title-link=A Farewell to Alms }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the continuation of [[extreme poverty]] indicates that the Malthusian trap continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Zinkina &amp; [[Andrey Korotayev]].

''World Futures'' 70/2 (2014): 120–39].&lt;/ref&gt; Others further argue that due to lack of food availability coupled with excessive pollution, developing countries show more evidence of the trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/197551/2/WP59.pdf|title=The Malthusian Trap and Development in Pre-Industrial Societies: A View Differing from the Standard One|last=Tisdell|first=Clem|date=1 January 2015|website=University of Queensland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malthus' theoretical argument==
Malthus argued that society has a natural propensity to increase its population, a propensity that causes population growth to be the best measure of the happiness of a people: "The happiness of a country does not depend, absolutely, upon its poverty, or its riches, upon its youth, or its age, upon its being thinly, or fully inhabited, but upon the rapidity with which it is increasing, upon the degree in which the yearly increase of food approaches to the yearly increase of an unrestricted population."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus, Essay on the Principle of Population, Ch. VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the propensity for population increase also leads to a natural cycle of abundance and shortages:
{{quote|We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population...increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions, must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease; while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great, that population is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of an increased industry amongst them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land; to turn up fresh soil, and to manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage; till ultimately the means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened; and the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.|Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', Chapter II.}}

Malthus faced opposition from economists both during his life and since. A vocal critic several decades later was [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 |last=Engels |first=Fredrick |authorlink= |year=1892 |publisher= Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co |location= London |isbn= |url= http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1844engels.html }} Engels wrote that poverty and poor living conditions in 1844 had largely disappeared.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 978-0521808781 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence to support the theory===
Research indicates that technological superiority and higher land productivity had significant positive effects on population density but insignificant effects on the standard of living during the time period 1–1500 AD.&lt;ref name="Ashraf and Galor, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ashraf |first=Quamrul |first2=Oded |last2=Galor |year=2011 |title=Dynamics and Stagnation in the Malthusian Epoch |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=2003–41 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.5.2003 |pmid=25506082 |pmc=4262154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, scholars have reported on the lack of a significant trend of wages in various places over the world for very long stretches of time.&lt;ref name="Clark2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=R. C. |title=The Great Divergence in European Wages and Prices from the Middle Ages to the First World War |journal=Explorations in Economic History |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=411–47 |year=2001 |doi=10.1006/exeh.2001.0775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Babylonia during the period 1800 to 1600 BC, for example, the daily wage for a common laborer was enough to buy about 15 pounds of wheat.  In Classical Athens in about 328 BC, the corresponding wage could buy about 24 pounds of wheat.  In England in 1800 AD the wage was about 13 pounds of wheat.&lt;ref name="Clark2007"/&gt;{{rp|50}} In spite of the technological developments across these societies, the daily wage hardly varied. In Britain between 1200 and 1800, only relatively minor fluctuations from the mean (less than a factor of two) in real wages occurred.  Following depopulation by the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics, real income in Britain peaked around 1450–1500 and began declining until the [[British Agricultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] posits that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death throughout Europe had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labor, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making employers and landowners less well off while improving the economic prospects and living standards of workers. He says that "the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations." This leveling effect was reversed by a "demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292–93, 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fogel]] published a study of lifespans and nutrition from about a century before Malthus to the 19th century that examined European birth and death records, military and other records of height and weight that found significant stunted height and low body weight indicative of chronic hunger and malnutrition.  He also found short lifespans that he attributed to chronic malnourishment which left people susceptible to disease.  Lifespans, height and weight began to steadily increase in the UK and France after 1750.  Fogel's findings are consistent with estimates of available food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 978-0-521-80878-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Malthusian view==
{{See also|Malthusianism}}
The rapid increase in the global population since 1900 exemplifies Malthus's predicted population patterns, whereby expansion of food supply has encouraged population growth. "Neo-Malthusianism" may be used as a label for those who are concerned that [[human overpopulation]] may increase [[resource depletion]] or [[environmental degradation]] to a degree that is not [[sustainability|sustainable]]. Many in [[environmentalism|environmental movements]] express concern over the potential dangers of population growth.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Post War Intellectual Roots of the Population Bomb |author1=Pierre Desrochers |author2=Christine Hoffbauer |journal=[[International Policy Network|The Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development]] |url=http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |year=2009 |volume=1 |issue=3 |accessdate=2010-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302185414/http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |archivedate=March 2, 2012 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- maybe highlight in text that opinions are from fake journal from pressure group, no CiteSeerX cite --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, ecologist [[Garrett Hardin]] published an influential essay in ''Science'' that drew heavily from Malthusian theory. His essay, [[Tragedy of the commons|"The Tragedy of the Commons,"]] argued that "a finite world can support only a finite population" and that "freedom to breed will bring ruin to all."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardin|first=Garrett|year=1968|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|journal=Science|volume=162|issue=3859|pages=1243–1248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Club of Rome]] published a famous book entitled ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UOcUZ9uquhEC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Taking Nature Into Account: A Report to the Club of Rome |editor=Wouter van Dieren |year=1995 |publisher=Springer Books |isbn=978-0-387-94533-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] is a prominent neo-Malthusian who first raised concerns in 1968 with the publication of ''[[The Population Bomb]]''.

On the other hand, in 2011 [[Andrey Korotayev]] and his colleagues suggested that the emergence of major sociopolitical upheavals at the escape from the Malthusian trap is not an abnormal, but a regular phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Korotayev"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Korotayev |first=A. |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/79t737gt |title=A Trap At The Escape From The Trap? Demographic-Structural Factors of Political Instability in Modern Africa and West Asia |journal=Cliodynamics |volume=2/2 |year=2011 |pages=1–28 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korotayev, A., Malkov, S., &amp; [[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, L.]] (2014).

Some demographic structural factors of political instability in modernizing social systems. ''History &amp; Mathematics'', 4, 201-267].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory that society has overcome the trap==
{{See also|Industrial Revolution#Causes|British Agricultural Revolution}}
The view that a "breakout" from the Malthusian trap has led to an era of sustained economic growth is explored by "[[unified growth theory]]".&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)" /&gt; One branch of unified growth theory is devoted to the interaction between human evolution and economic development. Some argue that natural selection during the Malthusian epoch selected beneficial traits to the growth process and brought about the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Galor |first=Oded |first2=Omer |last2=Moav |year=2002 |title=Natural Selection and The Origin of Economic Growth |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=1133–91 |doi=10.1162/003355302320935007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.199.2634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers contend that a British breakout occurred due to technological improvements and structural change away from agricultural production, while coal, capital, and trade played a minor role.&lt;ref&gt;Tepper, Alexander and Karol J. Borowiecki. Accounting for Breakout in Britain: The Industrial Revolution through a Malthusian Lens (2013). Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report 639. Available at: https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fednsr/639.html&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] has argued, in his book ''[[A Farewell to Alms]]'', that a British breakout may have been caused by differences in reproduction rates among the rich and the poor (the rich were more likely to marry, tended to have more children, and, in a society where disease was rampant and childhood mortality at times approached 50%, upper-class children were more likely to survive to adulthood than poor children.) This in turn led to sustained "downward mobility": the descendants of the rich becoming more populous in British society and spreading [[middle-class values]] such as hard work and literacy.

A '''modular process skid''' is a [[Process engineering|process system]] contained within a frame that allows the process system to be easily transported.  Individual skids can contain complete process systems and multiple process skids can be combined to create larger process systems or entire portable plants. They are sometimes called “a system in a box.” An example of a multi-skid process system might include a raw materials skid, a utilities skid and a processing unit which work in tandem.

Process skids are considered an alternative to traditional stick-built construction where process system parts are shipped individually and installed incrementally at the manufacturing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csidesigns.com/flowgeeks/what-is-a-skid-system/ |title=What Is a Skid System? &amp;#124; FlowGeeks |publisher=Csidesigns.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide the advantage of parallel construction, where process systems are built off-site in a fabrication facility while civil site upgrades are completed at the plant site simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicmodularprocess.com/blog/advantages-of-modular-process-design-infographic |title=Advantages of Modular Process Design Infographic |publisher=Epicmodularprocess.com |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skids are not always appropriate. If individual process parts are large and cannot reasonably be contained within the frame of a modular process skid, traditional construction methods are preferred.

==Skid design and layout==
Process skids are designed to contain a complete process system, a complete unit of operations or to organize a manufacturing process into logical units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proscon.com/solutions/modular.html |title=Modular Process Systems from |publisher=ProsCon |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; All skids have the following characteristics in common:
* '''Portable design'''– because they are self-contained units, built within frames, skid systems are easier to transport than traditional process systems. 
* '''Small footprint''' – process skid frames allow equipment layering. Piping, tanks, and necessary process equipment can be fit into a smaller footprint with a skid design
* '''Gathered process connections''' – process connections are gathered into one spot on the skid, making plant connections easier. In traditional process systems, connections are spread throughout the plant. 
* '''Controlled assembly''' – skids are typically built in controlled conditions offsite. Existing operations are not affected by skid fabrication. 
*[[Acceptance testing|'''FAT testing''']] before installation – Factory acceptance testing (FAT) can be completed before modular process skids are shipped to site. This reduces the amount of on-site startup time.
*'''Accessible layout''' – skids are designed for accessibility, usually including a center hallway, and major pieces of equipment placed around the edge of the frame.

'''The Mycetoma Research Center''' was established in 1991 under the umbrella of the University of Khartoum. It was set up at Soba University Hospital to provide medical care for [[Mycetoma]] patients, research and education and teaching in the various aspects of Mycetoma.

Mycetoma is a common health problem, endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions and reported throughout the globe.

'''The Staff'''

The staff members are of medical, health and science backgrounds; they are interested in all facets related to Mycetoma and have good track records in patients’ management, teaching, research and community development. Through clinical and basic research, the staff of the center has continually explored new approaches to patients’ management.

'''Research Programmes'''

The research programmes and projects carried out in the Center are of a multidisciplinary approach focusing on basic research into the causes and progression of Mycetoma, the translation of new knowledge and technology into novel treatments and the provision of patient care.

The '''National Automotive Innovation Centre '''(NAIC), also sometimes referred to as the National Automotive Innovation Campus, is a proposed building at the [[University of Warwick]]. It is a joint venture between the University's [[Warwick Manufacturing Group]], [[Jaguar Land Rover]] and [[Tata Motors]].

The NAIC will be a focus for automotive research, combining expertise from industry, university academics and supply chain companies. It is intended to support advances in technology to reduce dependency on [[fossil fuels]] and vehicle emissions.&lt;ref name="BQ"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bq-magazine.co.uk/midlands-july-2014/£100m-auto-innovation-centre-gets-go-ahead?dm_i=1SK3,2LD4D,AUSIR2,9GUJ8,1 | title=£100m auto innovation centre gets the go-ahead | work=BQ Magazine | date=7 July 2014 | accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{GBP}}100&amp;nbsp;million project is funded by a range of partners, including; £50&amp;nbsp;million of the project funding is being provided by the University of Warwick's development partners, Jaguar Land Rover, with additional funding from the Warwick Manufacturing Group and Tata Motors European Technical Centre.

{{For|another sequencing process of same name|Oligotyping (sequencing)}}
'''Oligotyping''' is a [[diagnosis|diagnostic]] or [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] method for classification of [[organism]]s by short intervals of primary [[DNA sequence]].  

Oligotyping 'systems' are sets of recognized target sequences which identify the members of the categories within the classification.  The classification may be for the purpose of primary biological [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], or for a functional classification.

'''Philology''' is the study of language in oral and written historical sources; it is the intersection between [[textual criticism]], [[literary criticism]], [[history]], and [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2joVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5 |title=Philology |last=Peile |first=John |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |year=1880 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philology is more commonly defined as the study of literary texts as well as oral and written records, the establishment of their authenticity and their original form, and the determination of their meaning. A person who pursues this kind of study is known as a philologist.

In older usage, especially British, philology is more general, covering comparative and historical linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/philology |title=philology |website=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/philology |title=philology |website=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical philology]] studies [[classical languages]]. Classical philology principally originated from the [[Library of Pergamum]] and the [[Library of Alexandria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=F. W.|title=A Companion to Classical Texts|year=1968|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford, England|pages=22–52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzW7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the fourth century BCE, continued by Greeks and Romans throughout the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]/[[Byzantine Empire]]. It was preserved and promoted during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], and eventually resumed by European scholars of the [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance]], where it was soon joined by philologies of other non-Asian (European) ([[Germanic philology|Germanic]], [[Celtic studies|Celtic]]), Eurasian ([[Slavistics]], etc.) and Asian ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Sanskrit grammarians|Sanskrit]], [[Sinology|Chinese]], etc.) languages. [[Indo-European studies]] involves the [[comparative linguistics|comparative]] philology of all [[Indo-European languages]].

Philology, with its focus on historical development ([[Synchrony and diachrony|diachronic]] analysis), is contrasted with [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistics]] due to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s insistence on the importance of [[Synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic analysis]]. The contrast continued with the emergence of [[structuralism]] and [[Chomskyan]] linguistics alongside its emphasis on [[syntax]].
{{wiktionary}}

== Etymology ==
The term "[[:wikt:philology|philology]]" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|φιλολογία}} (''philología''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111282 |chapter=φιλολογία |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the terms {{lang|grc|φίλος}} (''phílos'') "love, affection, loved, beloved, dear, friend" and {{lang|grc|λόγος}} (''[[lógos]]'') "word, articulation, reason", describing a love of learning, of literature, as well as of argument and reasoning, reflecting the range of activities included under the notion of {{lang|grc|[[logos|λόγος]]}}. The term changed little with the Latin ''philologia'', and later entered the English language in the 16th century, from the [[Middle French]] ''philologie'', in the sense of "love of literature".

The adjective {{lang|grc|φιλόλογος}} (''philólogos'') meant "fond of discussion or argument, talkative", in [[Koine Greek|Hellenistic Greek]], also implying an excessive ("[[sophism|sophistic]]") preference of argument over the love of true wisdom, {{lang|grc|[[philosophy|φιλόσοφος]]}} (''philósophos'').

As an [[allegory]] of literary erudition, ''philologia'' appears in fifth-century postclassical literature ([[Martianus Capella]], ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii''), an idea revived in Late Medieval literature ([[Chaucer]], [[John Lydgate|Lydgate]]).

The meaning of "love of learning and literature" was narrowed to "the study of the historical development of languages" ([[historical linguistics]]) in 19th-century usage of the term. Due to the rapid progress made in understanding [[sound law]]s and [[language change]], the "golden age of philology" lasted throughout the 19th century, or "from [[Giacomo Leopardi]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] to [[Nietzsche]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.princeton.edu/nwegmann/ |title=Nikolaus Wegmann, Princeton University Department of German |publisher=Scholar.princeton.edu |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglo-Saxon world, the term philology to describe work on languages and literatures, which had become synonymous with the practices of German scholars, was abandoned as a consequence of anti-German feeling following [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]]. "Them Philologists: Philological Practices and Their Discontents from Nietzsche to Cerquiglini." ''The Year's Work in Medievalism'' 26 (2011): 4–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Most continental European countries still maintain the term to designate departments, colleges, position titles, and journals. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] opposed the nationalist reaction against philological practices, claiming that "the philological instinct" was "universal as is the use of language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tolkien |first=J. R. R. |authorlink=J. R. R. Tolkien |title=Philology: General Works |journal=The Year's Work of English Studies |volume=4 |number=1 |year=1923 |pages=36–37 |doi=10.1093/ywes/IV.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]]. "''Englische Philologie'' vs. English Studies: A Foundational Conflict", in ''Das Potential europäischer Philologien: Geschichte, Leistung, Funktion'', ed. Christoph König (Göttingen: Wallstein, 2009), pp. 34–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[British English]] usage, and in British academia, "philology" remains largely synonymous with "historical linguistics", while in [[US English]], and US academia, the wider meaning of "study of a language's grammar, history and literary tradition" remains more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna Morpurgo Davies|A. Morpurgo Davies]], ''History of Linguistics'' (1998) 4 I. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Bravmann, ''Studies in Semitic Philology''. (1977) p.&amp;nbsp;457.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the harsh critique of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], US scholars since the 1980s have viewed philology as responsible for a narrowly [[scientism|scientistic]] study of language and literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]].

== Branches ==

=== Comparative ===
{{main article|Comparative philology}}
[[File:Indo European philology historical and comparative 1969.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Indo-European Philology: Historical and Comparative'' by [[William Burley Lockwood]] (1969)]]

The [[comparative linguistics]] branch of philology studies the relationship between languages. Similarities between [[Sanskrit]] and [[European languages]] were first noted in the early 16th century&lt;ref&gt;This is noted in Juan Mascaro's introduction to his translation of the ''Bhagavad Gita'', in which he dates the first ''Gita'' translation to 1785 (by Charles Williams). Mascaro claims the linguist [[Alexander Hamilton (linguist)|Alexander Hamilton]] stopped in Paris in 1802 after returning from India, and taught Sanskrit to the German critic [[Friedrich von Schlegel]]. Mascaro says this is the beginning of modern study of the roots of the Indo-European languages.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to speculation of a common ancestor language from which all these descended. It is now named [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. Philology's interest in ancient languages led to the study of what were, in the 18th century, "exotic" languages, for the light they could cast on problems in understanding and [[decipher]]ing the origins of older texts.

=== Textual ===
{{main article|Textual criticism}}
Philology also includes the study of texts and their history. It includes elements of [[textual criticism]], trying to reconstruct an author's original text based on variant copies of manuscripts. This branch of research arose among Ancient scholars in the 4th century BC Greek-speaking world, who desired to establish a standard text of popular authors for the purposes of both sound interpretation and secure transmission.  Since that time, the original principles of textual criticism have been improved and applied to other widely distributed texts such as the Bible.  Scholars have tried to reconstruct the original readings of the [[Bible]] from the manuscript variants. This method was applied to Classical Studies and to medieval texts as a way to reconstruct the author's original work. The method produced so-called "critical editions", which provided a reconstructed text accompanied by a "[[critical apparatus]]", i.e., footnotes that listed the various manuscript variants available, enabling scholars to gain insight into the entire manuscript tradition and argue about the variants.&lt;ref name = GB1&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JewJCYZlYV8C&amp;pg=PA9 |title=Textual Scholarship: An Introduction |first=D. C. |last=Greetham |publisher=Garland Publishing |year=1994 |accessdate=2011-07-16 |isbn=9780815317913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related study method known as [[higher criticism]] studies the authorship, date, and provenance of text to place such text in historical context.&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; As these philological issues are often inseparable from issues of interpretation, there is no clear-cut boundary between philology and [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; When text has a significant political or religious influence (such as the reconstruction of Biblical texts), scholars have difficulty reaching objective conclusions.

Some scholars avoid all critical methods of textual philology,&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; especially in historical linguistics, where it is important to study the actual recorded materials. The movement known as [[New Philology]] has rejected textual criticism because it injects editorial interpretations into the text and destroys the integrity of the individual manuscript, hence damaging the reliability of the data. Supporters of New Philology insist on a strict "diplomatic" approach: a faithful rendering of the text exactly as found in the manuscript, without emendations.

=== Cognitive ===
{{main article|Cognitive philology}}
Another branch of philology, cognitive philology, studies written and oral texts. Cognitive philology considers these oral texts as the results of human mental processes. This science compares the results of textual science with the results of experimental research of both psychology and artificial intelligence production systems.

=== Decipherment ===
In the case of [[Bronze Age literature]], philology includes the prior [[decipherment]] of the language under study. This has notably been the case with the [[Ancient Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Ugaritic]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]] languages. Beginning with the famous decipherment and translation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] by [[Jean-François Champollion]] in 1822, a number of individuals attempted to decipher the writing systems of the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]]. In the case of [[Old Persian]] and [[Mycenaean Greek]], decipherment yielded older records of languages already known from slightly more recent traditions ([[Middle Persian]] and [[Ancient Greek|Alphabetic Greek]]).

Work on the ancient languages of the Near East progressed rapidly. In the mid-19th century, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] and others deciphered the [[Behistun Inscription]], which records the same text in [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], using a variation of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] for each language. The elucidation of cuneiform led to the decipherment of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. [[Hittite language|Hittite]] was deciphered in 1915 by [[Bedřich Hrozný]].

[[Linear B]], a script used in the ancient Aegean, was deciphered in 1952 by [[Michael Ventris]] and [[John Chadwick]], who demonstrated that it recorded an early form of Greek, now known as [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean Greek]]. [[Linear A]], the writing system that records the still-unknown language of the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoans]], resists deciphering, despite many attempts.

Work continues on scripts such as the [[Maya script|Maya]], with great progress since the initial breakthroughs of the phonetic approach championed by [[Yuri Knorozov]] and others in the 1950s. Since the late 20th century, the Maya code has been almost completely deciphered, and the Mayan languages are among the most documented and studied in Mesoamerica. The code is described as a [[logosyllabic]] style of writing, which could be used to fully express any spoken thought.

==In popular culture==

In the ''[[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]]'' by [[C.S. Lewis]], the main character, Elwin Ransom, is a philologist - as was Lewis' close friend [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

Dr. Edward Morbius, one of the main characters in the science-fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'', is a philologist.

[[Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld]], the main character in [[Alexander McCall Smith]]'s 1997 comic novel ''[[Portuguese Irregular Verbs]]'' is a philologist, educated at Cambridge.

'''Plasmolysis''' is the process in which cells lose water in a [[hypertonic]] solution. The reverse process, [[cytolysis]], can occur if the cell is in a [[Tonicity#Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] solution resulting in a lower external [[osmotic pressure]] and a net flow of water into the cell. Through observation of plasmolysis and deplasmolysis, it is possible to determine the [[tonicity]] of the cell's environment as well as the rate solute molecules cross the [[Cell membrane|cellular membrane]].

== Turgidity ==
{{main|Turgor pressure}}
A plant cell in hypotonic solution will absorb water by [[endosmosis]], so that the increased volume of water in the cell will increase pressure, making the [[protoplasm]] push against the [[cell wall]], a condition known as [[turgor]]. Turgor makes plant cells push against each other in the same way and is the main line method of support in non-woody plant tissue. Plant cell walls resist further water entry after a certain point, known as full turgor, which stops plant cells from bursting as animal cells do in the same conditions. This is also the reason that plants stand upright. Without the stiffness of the plant cells the plant would fall under its own weight.  Turgor pressure allows plants to stay firm and erect, and plants without turgor pressure (known as flaccid) wilt. A cell will begin to decline in turgor pressure only when there is no air spaces surrounding it and eventually leads to a greater osmotic pressure than that of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plants in Action|last=Munns|first=Rana|publisher=Australian Society of Plant Scientists|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vacuoles play a role in turgor pressure when water leaves the cell due to [[hyperosmotic]] solutions containing solutes such as [[mannitol]], [[sorbitol]], and [[sucrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lang|first=Ingeborg|date=10 September 2014|title=Plasmolysis: Loss of Turgor and Beyond|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/3/4/583/pdf|journal=Plants|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plasmolysis ==
[[Image:Turgor pressure on plant cells diagram.svg|thumb|300px|right|Plant cell under different environments]] If a plant cell is placed in a [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] solution, the plant cell loses water and hence [[turgor]] pressure by plasmolysis: pressure decreases to the point where the protoplasm of the cell peels away from the cell wall, leaving gaps between the cell wall and the membrane and making the plant cell shrink and crumple.  A continued decrease in pressure eventually leads to [[cytorrhysis]] – the complete collapse of the cell wall. Plants with cells in this condition wilt. After plasmolysis the gap between the cell wall and the cell membrane in a plant cell is filled with [[hypertonic]] solution. This is because as the solution surrounding the cell is hypertonic, [[exosmosis]] takes place and the space between the cell wall and cytoplasm is filled with solutes, as most of the water drains away and hence the concentration inside the cell becomes more hypertonic. There are some mechanisms in plants to prevent excess water loss in the same way as excess water gain. Plasmolysis can be reversed if the cell is placed in a [[hypotonic]] solution. [[Stoma|Stomata]] help keep water in the plant so it does not dry out. [[Wax]] also keeps water in the plant. The equivalent process in animal cells is called [[crenation]]. 
The liquid content of the cell leaks out due to exosmosis. The cell collapses, and the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall (in plants). Most animal cells consist of only a [[Lipid bilayer|phospholipid bilayer]] ([[plasma membrane]]) and not a cell wall, therefore shrinking up under such conditions.

Plasmolysis only occurs in extreme conditions and rarely happens in nature. It is induced in the laboratory by immersing cells in strong [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] or sugar (sucrose) solutions to cause [[exosmosis]], often using ''[[Elodea]]'' plants or [[onion epidermal cell]]s, which have colored cell sap so that the process is clearly visible.  [[Methylene blue]] can be used to stain plant cells.

Plasmolysis is mainly known as shrinking of cell membrane in hypertonic solution and great pressure.

Plasmolysis can be of two types, either concave plasmolysis or convex plasmolysis. Convex plasmolysis is always irreversible while concave plasmolysis is usually reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lang|first=Ingeborg|last2=Sassmann|first2=Stefan|last3=Schmidt|first3=Brigitte|last4=Komis|first4=George|date=2014-11-26|title=Plasmolysis: Loss of Turgor and Beyond|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/3/4/583|journal=Plants|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=583–593|doi=10.3390/plants3040583|pmc=4844282|pmid=27135521}}&lt;/ref&gt; During concave plasmolysis, the plasma membrane and the enclosed protoplast partially shrinks from the cell wall due to half-spherical, inwarding curving pockets forming between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. During convex plasmolysis, the plasma membrane and the enclosed protoplast shrinks completely from the cell wall, with the plasma membrane's ends in a symmetrically, spherically curved pattern.&lt;ref name="[1]"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Ingeborg|last2=Sassmann|first2=Stefan|last3=Schmidt|first3=Brigitte|last4=Komis|first4=George|title=Plasmolysis: Loss of Turgor and Beyond|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/3/4/583/htm|website=Plants|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''preorbital gland''' is a paired [[exocrine gland]] found in many species of [[even-toed ungulate|hoofed animals]], which is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the [[lacrimal gland]] found in humans. These glands are trenchlike slits of dark blue to black, nearly bare skin extending from the medial [[canthus]] of each eye. They are lined by a combination of [[Sebaceous gland|sebaceous]] and [[Sweat gland|sudoriferous]] [[gland]]s, and they produce [[secretion]]s which contain [[pheromone]]s and other [[semiochemical]] compounds.&lt;ref name=Rue2004/&gt; Ungulates frequently deposit these secretions on twigs and grass as a [[Animal communication|means of communication]] with other animals.&lt;ref name=Albone1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schulz2005/&gt;

The preorbital gland serves different roles in different species. Pheromone-containing secretions from the preorbital gland may serve to establish an animal's [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] (especially in preparation for [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|breeding]]),&lt;ref name=Kile1977/&gt; mark its [[Territory (animal)|territory]], or simply to produce a pleasurable sensation to the animal.&lt;ref name=deerglands/&gt; Because of its critical role in scent marking, the preorbital gland is usually considered as a type of [[scent gland]]. A further function of these glands may be to produce [[antimicrobial]] compounds to fight against skin [[pathogen]]s. Antimicrobial compounds found in these glands may be [[Biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] by the animal itself, or by [[microorganism]]s that live in these glands.&lt;ref name=Wood2010/&gt;

==In cervids==
[[File:Red deer stag 2009 denmark.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of a male [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus''), taken during the [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|mating season]]. Note the prominent preorbital gland, which is [[Hypertrophy|enlarged]] and dilated.]]

[[Deer]] have seven major external [[scent gland]]s, distributed throughout their bodies. These glands are the [[forehead gland]]s (located on the forehead), the preorbital glands (located below the eyes), the [[nasal glands]] (located inside the nostrils), the [[interdigital gland]]s (located between the toes), the [[preputial gland]] (located inside the foreskin of the [[deer's penis]]), the [[metatarsal gland]]s (located outside of the hind legs), and the [[tarsal gland (ungulate)|tarsal glands]] (located inside of the hind legs).&lt;ref name=Nickens2009/&gt; Though it is not their primary function, the [[salivary gland]]s also function as scent glands. Deer rely heavily on these scent glands to communicate with other members of their species, and possibly even with members of other species. A deer may rub its preorbital gland (e.g., on a branch) purely for pleasure.&lt;ref name=deerglands/&gt;

===North American deer===
The two major species of deer found in [[North America]] are the [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus'') and the [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus''). The most important [[sense]] in these animals is [[olfaction]] (the sense of smell)—so much so that they have an [[Olfaction#Accessory olfactory system|accessory olfaction system]].
The [[vomeronasal organ]], located at the base of the [[nasal cavity]], is the sensory organ for this system. Besides locating food and water, deer rely on their two separate olfactory systems to detect the presence of predators, as well as to supply them with information about the identity, sex, dominance status and reproductive status of other deer.&lt;ref name=Miller1990/&gt;

The preorbital gland of ''O. virginianus'' is about {{convert|22|mm|in|sp=us}} in length, while that of ''O. hemionus'' is roughly {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us}} in length. In [[black-tailed deer]] (''O. h. columbianus''), a subspecies of ''O. hemionus'', the preorbital gland measures about {{convert|32|mm|in|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=Rue2004/&gt; In all of these animals, the preorbital glands are surrounded by muscle which is under voluntary control, at least to some extent.&lt;ref name=Miller1990/&gt;

It is not entirely clear whether the preorbital gland secretions of North American deer emit an odor that is significant in terms of chemical communication. Most of the time, the glands remain in the closed position, but they are capable of opening them in certain circumstances. For example, a [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] male may dilate its preorbital glands in order to signal aggression to another nearby male. Female deer often open their glands while caring for their young.&lt;ref name=Miller1990/&gt;

===Other deer===
[[File:Elaphurus davidianus 02.JPG|thumb|A male [[Père David's Deer|Père David's deer]] (''Elaphurus davidianus''). Note the large preorbital gland extending from just below the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]].]]
[[File:Sambhar deer.jpg|thumb|A male [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]] (''Rusa unicolor'') in [[Pench National Park]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India. These animals are often referred to as "four-eyed deer", due to their large preorbital glands.&lt;ref name=Leslie2011/&gt;]]

In juvenile [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus''), the preorbital gland appears to play a role in the response to stress. The preorbital gland is closed in a relaxed calf, whereas it is opened in a stressed calf.&lt;ref name=Bartosova2007/&gt; One example of this is the signalling of hunger and satiety. Fawns open their preorbital glands as a signal that they are hungry, and close the gland after feeding, when they are no longer hungry.&lt;ref name=Bartos2005/&gt;

Other than during the rut (mating season) and for the first six months after giving birth, the adult [[Indian muntjac]] (''Muntiacus muntjac'') is a solitary animal. Adult males in particular are well spaced and marking grass and bushes with secretions from their preorbital glands appears to be involved in the acquisition and maintenance of territory.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg1974/&gt;

==In bovids==
[[File:Hirola2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hirola]] (''Beatragus hunteri'') are often referred to as the "four-eyed antelope", due to their large preorbital glands&lt;ref name=Frommer2010/&gt;]]

The [[bovid]]s ([[family (biology)|family]] Bovidae) comprise some 140 species of [[ruminant]]s in which at least the males bear unbranched, hollow [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] covered in a permanent sheath of [[keratin]]. Most species of bovids have means of spacing themselves across their habitat; territorial behavior is the most consistent type of spacing behavior.&lt;ref name=Bergerud1974/&gt;

[[Goat-antelope|Caprids]] (dwarf antelope, such as the [[sheep]], [[Capra (genus)|goats]], [[muskox]], [[serow]]s, [[goral]]s, and several similar species) use their preorbital glands to establish [[Dominance hierarchy|social rank]]. For example, when competition arises between two grazing sheep (''Ovis aries''), they have been observed to nuzzle each other's preorbital glands. By sending and receiving olfactory cues, this behavior appears to be a means of establishing dominance and of avoiding a fight, which would otherwise involve potentially injurious butting or clashing with the forehead.&lt;ref name=Baskin1974/&gt;

The [[Antilopinae|antilopine]] bovids (dwarf antelope, such as the [[springbok]], [[blackbuck]], [[gazelle]]s, [[dik-dik]]s, [[oribi]], and several similar species) have well-developed preorbital glands.&lt;ref name=Schulz2005/&gt;

Among the [[Duiker|cephalophines]], members of the ''Philantomba'' and ''Sylvicapra'' genera are all solitary animals which display territorial behavior and have well developed preorbital glands. [[Maxwell's duiker]] (''Philantomba maxwellii'') is a solitary animal which utilizes preorbital gland secretions to mark its territory. This behavior is observed most in adult males, less frequently in females, and less still in subadults of this species.&lt;ref name=Bigalke1974/&gt; Secretions from the preorbital gland of the common duiker contain at least 33 different [[chemical compound]]s. Two [[thiazole]] compounds and an [[epoxy]] [[ketone]] are present in significantly higher concentrations in male than in female secretions, suggesting that they could serve as sex recognition cues.&lt;ref name=Burger1990/&gt;

The [[Alcelaphinae|alcephine]] bovids ([[wildebeest]]s, [[hartebeest]]s, [[hirola]], [[bontebok]], [[blesbok]], and several similar species) have preorbital glands which secrete complex mixtures of chemical compounds.&lt;ref name=Schulz2005/&gt; The preorbital glands of the [[bontebok]] (''Damaliscus pygargus pygarus'') are larger in males than in females. Their secretions contain at least forty different chemical compounds, and are deposited on grass and twigs at the borders of their territory. They then appear to transfer the secretions from the grass to their horns and forehead by waving the head from side to side across the stalk bearing the secretion. Marking of plant stalks with preorbital gland secretions is seen in both sexes.&lt;ref name=Damaliscus/&gt; In contrast to the duikers and raphicerids, the [[klipspringer]] (''Oreotragus oreotragus'') is a semi-[[Herd|gregarious]] species, while the [[hirola]] (''Beatragus hunteri'') is fully gregarious. Nevertheless, these animals display territorial scent marking of grasses with secretions from their preorbital glands.&lt;ref name=Bigalke1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beatragus/&gt;

Differences in the social structure and marking behavior among different species may lead to a different size and position of the preorbital glands on the animal's face. For example, [[Günther's dik-dik]] (''Madoqua guentheri'') is a [[monogamy|monogamous]] species of [[antelope]] that lives in a permanent territory, the boundaries of which the animals mark several times a day by actively pressing the preorbital glands to grasses and low-lying plants and applying the secretions. In this territorial animal, the preorbital glands remain of considerable size throughout the year. The glands are located in large [[Antorbital fenestra|preorbital pits]] in the [[lacrimal bone]], and are surrounded by specialized facial muscles that compress them to express the secretions more effectively. In contrast, the [[Saiga Antelope|saiga antelope]] (''Saiga tatarica'') is a [[polygamy|polygamous]] and somewhat nomadic species which does not occupy any permanent territory at any time during the year. For most of the year the preorbital glands remain small, only growing to substantial size during the rut. At that time of year, secretions ooze more or less continuously from the glands. In this nonterritorial animal, the preorbital glands are not as well-developed, lack well-developed surrounding facial muscles, and are positioned in an inconspicuous and shallow depression of the lacrimal bone.&lt;ref name=Frey1997/&gt;

==Research directions==
The recent identification of several antimicrobial compounds from the secretions of animal [[Dermis|dermal]] scent glands may be the beginning of a promising new area of [[drug development]]. Assuming [[Functional analog (chemistry)|functional analog]]s of these [[lead compound]]s can be [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] and [[Structure–activity relationship|found to be effective]] ''in vivo'', the potential exists for producing new antimicrobial agents against pathogenic skin microorganisms.&lt;ref name=Wood2010/&gt;

A '''quake''' is the result when the surface of a [[planet]], [[moon]] or [[star]] begins to shake, usually as the consequence of a sudden release of energy transmitted as [[seismic wave]]s, and potentially with great violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earthquake Hazards Program|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/?source=sitenav|publisher=USGS|accessdate=5 April 2012|author=United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of quakes include:

==Earthquake==
{{See also|Earthquake}}
An earthquake is a [[phenomenon]] that results from the sudden release of stored energy in the [[Earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]] that creates [[seismic wave]]s. At the Earth's surface, earthquakes may manifest themselves by a shaking or displacement of the ground and sometimes cause [[tsunamis]], which may lead to loss of life and destruction of property. An earthquake is caused by tectonic plates (sections of the Earth's crust) getting stuck and putting a strain on the ground. The strain becomes so great that rocks give way and fault lines occur.

==Moonquake==
{{redirect|Moonquake}}
{{Further|Lunar seismology}}
A moonquake is the lunar equivalent of an earthquake (i.e., a quake on the [[Moon]]). They were first discovered by the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] [[astronaut]]s. The largest moonquakes are much weaker than the largest earthquakes, though their shaking can last for up to an hour, due to the lack of attenuation to dampen seismic vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00562004 |title=Moonquakes and lunar tectonism |journal=The Moon |volume=4 |issue=3–4 |pages=373–382 |year=1972 |last1=Latham |first1=Gary |last2=Ewing |first2=Maurice |last3=Dorman |first3=James |last4=Lammlein |first4=David |last5=Press |first5=Frank |last6=Toksőz |first6=Naft |last7=Sutton |first7=George |last8=Duennebier |first8=Fred |last9=Nakamura |first9=Yosio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about moonquakes comes from [[seismometers]] placed on the Moon by [[Apollo 12 Passive Seismic Experiment|from 1969 through 1972]].  The instruments placed by the Apollo 12, 14, 15 and 16 missions functioned perfectly until they were switched off in 1977.

There are at least four different kinds of moonquakes:

*Deep moonquakes (~700&amp;nbsp;km below the surface, probably tidal in origin)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2009.02.004 |title=The physical mechanisms of deep moonquakes and intermediate-depth earthquakes: How similar and how different? |journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors |volume=173 |issue=3–4 |pages=365–374 |year=2009 |last1=Frohlich |first1=Cliff |last2=Nakamura |first2=Yosio }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jupiter.ethz.ch/~akhan/amir/Publications_files/tecto_moon13.pdf{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://adsbit.harvard.edu//full/1980LPSC...11.1855K/0001855.000.html{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Meteorite]] impact vibrations
*Thermal moonquakes (the frigid lunar crust expands when sunlight returns after the two-week lunar night)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/JB079i029p04351 |title=Thermal moonquakes |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=79 |issue=29 |pages=4351–4363 |year=1974 |last1=Duennebier |first1=Frederick |last2=Sutton |first2=George H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shallow moonquakes (50-220 kilometers below the surface)&lt;ref&gt;http://adsbit.harvard.edu//full/1979LPSC...10.2299N/0002299.000.html{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three kinds of moonquakes mentioned above tend to be mild; however, shallow moonquakes can register up to m&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;=5.5 on the [[Seismic_magnitude_scales#Body-wave_magnitude_scales|body-wave magnitude scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oberst |first1=Jurgen |title=Unusually high stress drops associated with shallow moonquakes |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research Solid Earth |date=10 February 1987 |volume=92 |issue=B2 |pages=1397–1405 |doi=10.1029/JB092iB02p01397 |url=https://doi.org/10.1029/JB092iB02p01397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1972 and 1977, 28 shallow moonquakes were observed.  Deep moonquakes tend to occur within isolated kilometer-scale patches, sometimes referred to as nests or clusters.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura,  Y.,  Latham,  G.V.,  Dorman,  H.J.,  Harris,  J.E.,  1981.Passive  seismic  experiment  long-period  event  catalog,  final version. University of Texas Institute for Geophysics Technical Report  18,  Galveston.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marsquake==
{{Main|Marsquake}}
A [[marsquake]] is a quake that occurs on the planet [[Mars]]. A recent study suggests that marsquakes occur every million years. This suggestion is related to recently found evidence of [[Volcanology of Mars#Tectonic boundaries|Mars's tectonic boundaries]].&lt;ref name="mars seismic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/17087-mars-surface-marsquakes-plate-tectonics.html | title=A photo of Mars from NASA's Viking spacecraft, which launched in 1975. 7 Biggest Mysteries of Mars Mars Curiosity Rover with Rocks 1st Photos of Mars by Curiosity Rover (Gallery) Filaments in the Orgueil meteorite, seen under a scanning electron microscope, could be evidence of extraterrestrial bacteria, claims NASA scientist Richard Hoover. 5 Bold Claims of Alien Life Mars Surface Made of Shifting Plates Like Earth, Study Suggests | publisher=[[Space.com]] | work=Yin, An | date=14 August 2012 | accessdate=15 August 2012 | author=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venusquake==
A venusquake is a quake that occurs on the planet [[Venus]].

A Venusquake may have caused a new scarp and a [[landslide]] to form. An image of the landslides was taken in November 1990 during the first flight around Venus by the [[Magellan (spacecraft)|''Magellan'' spacecraft]]. Another image was taken on July 23, 1991 as the ''Magellan'' revolved around Venus for the second time. Each image was {{convert|24|km}} across and {{convert|38|km}} long, and was centered at 2° south latitude and 74° east longitude. The pair of ''Magellan'' images shows a region in [[Aphrodite Terra]], within a steeply sloping valley that is cut by many fractures (faults).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=UPI|title=Surface change seen on Venus|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/08/30/urgentNEWLN-Surface-change-seen-on-Venu-sNEWLN-WILLIAM-HARWOOD/3695683524800/|first=William|last=Harwood|date=1991-08-30|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sunquake==
{{main|Helioseismology}}
A sunquake is a quake that occurs on the [[Sun]].

Seismic waves produced by sunquakes occur in the [[photosphere]] and can travel at velocities of {{convert|35000|kph}} for distances up to {{convert|400000|km}} before fading away.&lt;ref name="Solar Flare Leaves Sun Quaking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Flare Leaves Sun Quaking|url=http://soi.stanford.edu/press/agu05-98/press-rel.html|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 1996, a sunquake was produced by an X2.6 class [[solar flare]] and its corresponding [[coronal mass ejection]]. According to researchers who reported the event in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', this sunquake was comparable to an earthquake of a magnitude 11.3 on the Richter scale. That represents a release of energy approximately 40,000 times greater than that of the devastating [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], and far greater than that of any earthquake ever recorded. Such an event contains the energy of 100-110 billion tons of TNT or 2 million modest sized nuclear bombs. It is unclear how such a relatively modest flare could have liberated sufficient energy to generate such powerful seismic waves.&lt;ref name="Solar Flare Leaves Sun Quaking"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=A. G.|last1=Kosovichev|first2=V. V. |last2=Zharkova|title=X-ray flare sparks quake inside Sun|journal=Nature|date=28 May 1998|volume=393|issue=28 May|pages=317–318|doi=10.1038/30629|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v393/n6683/full/393317a0.html|accessdate=31 March 2012|bibcode = 1998Natur.393..317K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Space Agency|ESA]] and [[NASA]] spacecraft [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] records sunquakes as part of its mission to study the Sun.

==Starquake==
{{main|Asteroseismology}}
A starquake is an [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] phenomenon that occurs when the crust of a [[neutron star]] undergoes a sudden adjustment, analogous to an earthquake on Earth. Starquakes are thought to result from two different mechanisms. One is the huge stresses exerted on the surface of the neutron star produced by twists in the ultra-strong interior [[magnetic field]]s. A second cause is a result of [[spindown]]. As the neutron star loses angular velocity due to [[frame-dragging]] and by the bleeding off of energy due to it being a rotating magnetic dipole, the crust develops an enormous amount of stress. Once that exceeds a certain amount, the shape adjusts itself to a shape closer to non-rotating equilibrium: a perfect sphere. The actual change is believed to be on the order of micrometers or less, and occurs in less than a millionth of a second.

The largest recorded starquake was detected on December 27, 2004 from the [[magnetar|ultracompact stellar corpse]] [[SGR 1806-20]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/1321-biggest-starquake.html|title=The Biggest Starquake Ever|author=|date=|website=space.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which created a quake equivalent to a magnitude 32.{{Citation needed|reason=Space.com and BBC references do not state this|date=November 2017}} The quake, which occurred 50,000 light years from Earth, released gamma rays equivalent to 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; kW. Had it occurred within a distance of 10 light years from Earth, the quake could have triggered a mass extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4278005.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Huge 'star-quake' rocks Milky Way | date=18 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Edward J Routh.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Edward John Routh]], 1831–1907.]]

In [[analytical mechanics]], a branch of [[theoretical physics]], '''Routhian mechanics''' is a hybrid formulation of [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] developed by [[Edward John Routh]]. Correspondingly, the '''Routhian''' is the [[function (mathematics)|function]] which replaces both the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] functions.

The Routhian, like the Hamiltonian, can be obtained from a [[Legendre transform]] of the Lagrangian, and has a similar mathematical form to the Hamiltonian, but is not exactly the same. The difference between the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and Routhian functions are their variables. For a given set of [[generalized coordinates]] representing the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in the system, the Lagrangian is a function of the coordinates and velocities, while the Hamiltonian is a function of the coordinates and momenta.

The Routhian differs from these functions in that some coordinates are chosen to have corresponding generalized velocities, the rest to have corresponding generalized momenta. This choice is arbitrary, and can be done to simplify the problem. It also has the consequence that the '''Routhian equations''' are exactly the Hamiltonian equations for some coordinates and corresponding momenta, and the Lagrangian equations for the rest of the coordinates and their velocities. In each case the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions are replaced by a single function, the Routhian. The full set thus has the advantages of both sets of equations, with the convenience of splitting one set of coordinates to the Hamilton equations, and the rest to the Lagrangian equations.

Often the Routhian approach may offer no advantage, but one notable case where this is useful is when a system has [[cyclic coordinates]] (also called "ignorable coordinates"), by definition those coordinates which do not appear in the original Lagrangian. The Lagrangian equations are powerful results, used frequently in theory and practice, since the equations of motion in the coordinates are easy to set up. However, if cyclic coordinates occur there will still be equations to solve for all the coordinates, including the cyclic coordinates despite their absence in the Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian equations are useful theoretical results, but less useful in practice because coordinates and momenta are related together in the solutions - after solving the equations the coordinates and momenta must be eliminated from each other. Nevertheless, the Hamiltonian equations are perfectly suited to cyclic coordinates because the equations in the cyclic coordinates trivially vanish, leaving only the equations in the non cyclic coordinates.

The Routhian approach has the best of both approaches, because cyclic coordinates can be split off to the Hamiltonian equations and eliminated, leaving behind the non cyclic coordinates to be solved from the Lagrangian equations. Overall fewer equations need to be solved compared to the Lagrangian approach.

As with the rest of analytical mechanics, Routhian mechanics is completely equivalent to Newtonian mechanics, all other formulations of classical mechanics, and introduces no new physics. It offers an alternative way to solve mechanical problems.

==Definitions==

In the case of Lagrangian mechanics, the [[generalized coordinates]] {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ... and the corresponding velocities {{math|''dq''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ''dq''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ...}}, and possibly time&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The coordinates are functions of time, so the Lagrangian always has implicit time-dependence via the coordinates. If the Lagrangian changes with time irrespective of the coordinates, usually due to some time-dependent potential, then the Lagrangian is said to have "explicit" time-dependence. Similarly for the Hamiltonian and Routhian functions.&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|''t''}}, enter the Lagrangian,

:&lt;math&gt;L(q_1,q_2,\ldots,\dot{q}_1,\dot{q}_2,\ldots,t)\,, \quad \dot{q}_i = \frac{d q_i}{dt} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the overdots denote [[time derivative]]s.

In Hamiltonian mechanics, the generalized coordinates {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} and the corresponding generalized momenta {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,}} and possibly time, enter the Hamiltonian,

:&lt;math&gt;H(q_1,q_2,\ldots,p_1,p_2,\ldots,t) = \sum_i \dot{q}_ip_i - L(q_1,q_2,\ldots,\dot{q}_1(p_1),\dot{q}_2(p_2),\ldots,t) \,, \quad p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the second equation is the definition of the generalized momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} corresponding to the coordinate {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} ([[partial derivative]]s are denoted using {{math|∂}}). The velocities {{math|''dq&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}} are expressed as functions of their corresponding momenta by inverting their defining relation. In this context, {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is said to be the momentum "canonically conjugate" to {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

The Routhian is intermediate between {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''H''}}; some coordinates {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are chosen to have corresponding generalized momenta {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the rest of the coordinates {{math|''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to have generalized velocities {{math|''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ..., ''dζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}}, and time may appear explicitly;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where again the generalized velocity {{math|''dq''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt''}} is to be expressed as a function of generalized momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} via its defining relation. The choice of which {{math|''n''}} coordinates are to have corresponding momenta, out of the {{math|''n'' + ''s''}} coordinates, is arbitrary.

The above is used by [[course of theoretical physics|Landau and Lifshitz]], and [[Classical Mechanics (Goldstein book)|Goldstein]]. Some authors may define the Routhian to be the negative of the above definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the length of the general definition, a more compact notation is to use boldface for [[tuple]]s (or vectors) of the variables, thus {{math|'''q''' {{=}} (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, {{math|'''ζ''' {{=}} (''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, {{math|'''p''' {{=}} (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, and {{math|''d'' '''ζ'''/''dt'' {{=}} (''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ..., ''dζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt'')}}, so that

:&lt;math&gt;R(\mathbf{q},\boldsymbol{\zeta}, \mathbf{p}, \dot{\boldsymbol{\zeta}}, t) = \mathbf{p}\cdot\dot{{\mathbf{q}}} - L(\mathbf{q}, \boldsymbol{\zeta}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}, \dot{\boldsymbol{\zeta}},t) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where · is the [[dot product]] defined on the tuples, for the specific example appearing here:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}\cdot\dot{{\mathbf{q}}} = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i\dot{q}_i \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Equations of motion==

For reference, the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian equations]] for {{math|''s''}} degrees of freedom are a set of {{math|''s''}} coupled second order [[ordinary differential equation]]s in the coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_j} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_j} \,,  &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''s''}}, and the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian equations]] for {{math|''n''}} degrees of freedom are a set of {{math|2''n''}} coupled first order ordinary differential equations in the coordinates and momenta

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} \,,\quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Below, the Routhian equations of motion are obtained in two ways, in the process other useful derivatives are found that can be used elsewhere.

===Two degrees of freedom===

Consider the case of a system with two [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''ζ''}}, with generalized velocities {{math|''dq''/''dt''}} and {{math|''dζ''/''dt''}}, and the Lagrangian is time-dependent. (The generalization to any number of degrees of freedom follows exactly the same procedure as with two).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lagrangian of the system will have the form

:&lt;math&gt; L(q, \zeta, \dot{q}, \dot{\zeta}, t) &lt;/math&gt;

The [[differential of a function|differential]] of {{math|''L''}} is

:&lt;math&gt; dL = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}dq + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}d\dot{q} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Now change variables, from the set ({{math|''q''}}, {{math|''ζ''}}, {{math|''dq''/''dt''}}, {{math|''dζ''/''dt''}}) to ({{math|''q''}}, {{math|''ζ''}}, {{math|''p''}}, {{math|''dζ''/''dt''}}), simply switching the velocity {{math|''dq''/''dt''}} to the momentum {{math|''p''}}. This change of variables in the differentials is the [[Legendre transformation]]. The differential of the new function to replace {{math|''L''}} will be a sum of differentials in {{math|''dq''}}, {{math|''dζ''}}, {{math|''dp''}}, {{math|''d''(''dζ''/''dt'')}}, and {{math|''dt''}}. Using the definition of generalized momentum and Lagrange's equation for the coordinate {{math|''q''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \,,\quad  \dot{p} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt; dL = \dot{p}dq + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta + p d\dot{q} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt &lt;/math&gt;

and to replace {{math|''pd''(''dq''/''dt'')}} by {{math|(''dq''/''dt'')''dp''}}, recall the [[product rule]] for differentials,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For two functions {{math|''u''}} and {{math|''v''}}, the differential of the product is {{math|''d''(''uv'') {{=}} ''udv'' + ''vdu''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and substitute

:&lt;math&gt; pd\dot{q} = d(\dot{q} p) - \dot{q}dp &lt;/math&gt;

to obtain the differential of a new function in terms of the new set of variables:

:&lt;math&gt; d(L-p\dot{q}) = \dot{p} dq + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta  - \dot{q} dp + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the Routhian

:&lt;math&gt; R(q,\zeta,p,\dot{\zeta},t) = p \dot{q}(p) - L &lt;/math&gt;

where again the velocity {{math|''dq''/''dt''}} is a function of the momentum {{math|''p''}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt; dR = -\dot{p} dq - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta  + \dot{q}dp - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt\,, &lt;/math&gt;

but from the above definition, the differential of the Routhian is

:&lt;math&gt; dR = \frac{\partial R }{\partial q}dq + \frac{\partial R }{\partial \zeta}d\zeta + \frac{\partial R }{\partial p}dp + \frac{\partial R }{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial R}{\partial t}dt \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the coefficients of the differentials {{math|''dq''}}, {{math|''dζ''}}, {{math|''dp''}}, {{math|''d''(''dζ''/''dt'')}}, and {{math|''dt''}}, the results are [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]] for the coordinate {{math|''q''}},

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{q} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial p} \,,\quad \dot{p} = -\frac{\partial R}{\partial q} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and [[Lagrange's equation]] for the coordinate {{math|''ζ''}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta}  &lt;/math&gt;

which follow from

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta} = - \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta} \,,\quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}} = - \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and taking the total time derivative of the second equation and equating to the first. Notice the Routhian replaces the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions in all the equations of motion.

The remaining equation states the partial time derivatives of {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''R''}} are negatives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial R}{\partial t}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Any number of degrees of freedom===

For {{math|''n'' + ''s''}} coordinates as defined above, with Routhian

:&lt;math&gt;R(q_1,\ldots,q_n,\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s, p_1, \ldots,p_n , \dot{\zeta}_1 , \ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i\dot{q}_i(p_i) - L&lt;/math&gt;

the equations of motion can be derived by a Legendre transformation of this Routhian as in the previous section, but another way is to simply take the partial derivatives of {{math|''R''}} with respect to the coordinates {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''ζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, momenta {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and velocities {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}}, where {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''n''}}, and {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''s''}}. The derivatives are

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i} = -\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} = - \dot{p}_i &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial p_i} = \dot{q}_i &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta_j} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta_j} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial t} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The first two are identically the Hamiltonian equations. Equating the total time derivative of the fourth set of equations with the third (for each value of {{math|''j''}}) gives the Lagrangian equations. The fifth is just the same relation between time partial derivatives as before. To summarize&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{equation box 1
|indent = :
|background colour = white

|title = '''Routhian equations of motion''' (''n'' + ''s'' degrees of freedom)
|equation=&lt;math&gt; \dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial R}{\partial p_i} \,,\quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i}  \,,  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta_j} \,. &lt;/math&gt;
}}

The total number of equations is {{math|2''n'' + ''s''}}, there are {{math|2''n''}} Hamiltonian equations plus {{math|''s''}} Lagrange equations.

==Energy==

Since the Lagrangian has the same units as [[energy]], the units of the Routhian are also energy. In [[SI units]] this is the [[Joule]].

Taking the total time derivative of the Lagrangian leads to the general result

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial t} = \frac{d }{d t}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} + \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} - L\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If the Lagrangian is independent of time, the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian is zero, {{math|∂''L''/∂''t'' {{=}} 0}}, so the quantity under the total time derivative in brackets must be a constant, it is the total energy of the system&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} + \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} - L\,.&lt;/math&gt;

(If there are external fields interacting with the constituents of the system, they can vary throughout space but not time). This expression requires the partial derivatives of {{math|''L''}} with respect to ''all'' the velocities {{math|''dq&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}} and {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}}. Under the same condition of {{math|''R''}} being time independent, the energy in terms of the Routhian is a little simpler, substituting the definition of {{math|''R''}} and the partial derivatives of {{math|''R''}} with respect to the velocities {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}},

:&lt;math&gt;E = R - \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice only the partial derivatives of {{math|''R''}} with respect to the velocities {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}} are needed. In the case that {{math|''s'' {{=}} 0}} and the Routhian is explicitly time-independent, then {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''R''}}, that is, the Routhian equals the energy of the system. The same expression for {{math|''R''}} in when {{math|''s'' {{=}} 0}} is also the Hamiltonian, so in all {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''R'' {{=}} ''H''}}.

If the Routhian has explicit time dependence, the total energy of the system is not constant. The general result is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} = \dfrac{d}{dt}\left(R - \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} \right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which can be derived from the total time derivative of {{math|''R''}} in the same way as for {{math|''L''}}.

==Cyclic coordinates==

The Routhian formulation is useful for systems with [[cyclic coordinates]], because by definition those coordinates do not enter {{math|''L''}}, and hence {{math|''R''}}. The corresponding partial derivatives of {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''R''}} with respect to those coordinates are zero, which equates to the corresponding generalized momenta reducing to constants. To make this concrete, if the {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are all cyclic coordinates, and the {{math|''ζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are all non cyclic, then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}  = \dot{p}_i = - \frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_i = \alpha_i \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are constants. With these constants substituted into the Routhian, {{math|''R''}} is a function of only the non cyclic coordinates and velocities (and in general time also)

:&lt;math&gt;R(\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s,\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n,\dot{\zeta}_1,\ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i\dot{q}_i(\alpha_i) - L(\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s,\dot{q}_1(\alpha_1),\ldots,\dot{q}_n(\alpha_n),\dot{\zeta}_1,\ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|2''n''}} Hamiltonian equation in the cyclic coordinates automatically vanishes,

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i=\frac{\partial R}{\partial \alpha_i}=f_i( \zeta_1(t),\ldots,\zeta_s(t), \dot{\zeta}_1(t),\ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s(t), \alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n,t) \,,\quad \dot{p}_i=-\frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i}=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''s''}} Lagrangian equations are in the non cyclic coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta_j} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the problem has been reduced to solving the Lagrangian equations in the non cyclic coordinates, with the advantage of the Hamiltonian equations cleanly removing the cyclic coordinates. Using those solutions, the equations for &lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i&lt;/math&gt;can be integrated to compute &lt;math&gt;q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

If we are interested in how the cyclic coordinates change with time, the equations for the generalized velocities corresponding to the cyclic coordinates can be integrated.

==Examples==

The Routhian method does not guarantee the equations of motion will be simple, however it will lead to fewer equations.

=== Central potential in spherical coordinates ===

One general class of mechanical systems with cyclic coordinates are those with [[central potential]]s, because potentials of this form only have dependence on radial separations and no dependence on angles.

Consider a particle of mass {{math|''m''}} under the influence of a central potential {{math|''V''(''r'')}} in [[spherical polar coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}}

:&lt;math&gt;L(r,\dot{r},\theta,\dot{\theta},\dot{\phi}) = \frac{m}{2}(\dot{r}^2 + {r}^2\dot{\theta}^2 + r^2 \sin^2\theta\dot{\phi}^2) - V(r) \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Notice {{math|''φ''}} is cyclic, because it does not appear in the Lagrangian. The momentum conjugate to {{math|''φ''}} is the constant

:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = mr^2\sin^2\theta\dot{\phi}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}} can vary with time, but the angular momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is constant. The Routhian can be taken to be

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R(r,\dot{r},\theta,\dot{\theta}) &amp; = p_\phi\dot{\phi} - L \\
&amp; = p_\phi\dot{\phi} - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 - \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 - \frac{p_\phi\dot{\phi}}{2} + V(r) \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi\dot{\phi}}{2} - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 - \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + V(r) \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi^2 }{2mr^2\sin^2\theta} - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 - \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + V(r) \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''θ''}} using Lagrange's equations, and do not need to solve for {{math|''φ''}} since it is eliminated by Hamiltonian's equations. The {{math|''r''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad-m\ddot{r} = -\frac{p_\phi^2}{mr^3\sin^2\theta} - mr\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad -m(2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^2\ddot{\theta}) = -\frac{p_\phi^2\cos\theta}{mr^2\sin^3\theta} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The Routhian approach has obtained two coupled nonlinear equations. By contrast the Lagrangian approach leads to ''three'' nonlinear coupled equations, mixing in the first and second time derivatives of {{math|''φ''}} in all of them, despite its absence from the Lagrangian.

The {{math|''r''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{r} = mr\dot{\theta}^2 + mr\sin^2\theta\dot{\phi}^2 - \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^2\ddot{\theta} = r^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\phi}^2\,, &lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''φ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 2r\dot{r}\sin^2\theta\dot{\phi} + 2r^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta \dot{\theta}\dot{\phi} + r^2\sin^2\theta \ddot{\phi}=0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetric mechanical systems===

====Spherical pendulum====

[[File:Spherical pendulum Lagrangian mechanics.svg|thumb|300px|Spherical pendulum: angles and velocities.]]

Consider the [[spherical pendulum]], a mass {{math|''m''}} (known as a "pendulum bob") attached to a rigid rod of length {{math|''l''}} of negligible mass, subject to a local gravitational field {{math|''g''}}. The system rotates with angular velocity {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}} which is ''not'' constant. The angle between the rod and vertical is {{math|''θ''}} and is ''not'' constant.

The Lagrangian is&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The potential energy is actually
:&lt;math&gt;V=mg\ell(1-\cos\theta)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
but since the first term is constant, it can be ignored in the Lagrangian (and Routhian) which only depend on derivatives of coordinates and velocities. Subtracting this from the kinetic energy means a plus sign in the Lagrangian, not minus.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L(\theta,\dot{\theta},\dot{\phi}) = \frac{m\ell^2}{2}(\dot{\theta}^2 + \sin^2\theta \dot{\phi}^2) + mg\ell\cos\theta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''φ''}} is the cyclic coordinate for the system with constant momentum

:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = m\ell^2\sin^2\theta \dot{\phi} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

which again is physically the angular momentum of the system about the vertical. The angle {{math|''θ''}} and angular velocity {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}} vary with time, but the angular momentum is constant. The Routhian is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R(\theta,\dot{\theta}) &amp; = p_\phi \dot{\phi} - L \\
&amp; = p_\phi \dot{\phi} - \frac{m\ell^2}{2}\dot{\theta}^2 - \frac{p_\phi \dot{\phi}}{2} - mg\ell\cos\theta \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi \dot{\phi}}{2} - \frac{m\ell^2}{2}\dot{\theta}^2  - mg\ell\cos\theta \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi^2 }{2m\ell^2\sin^2\theta} - \frac{m\ell^2}{2}\dot{\theta}^2 - mg\ell\cos\theta
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''θ''}} equation is found from the Lagrangian equations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \quad \Rightarrow \quad - m\ell^2\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{p_\phi^2 \cos\theta}{m\ell^2\sin^3\theta} + mg\ell\sin\theta \,,&lt;/math&gt;

or simplifying by introducing the constants

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{p_\phi^2}{m^2\ell^4}\,,\quad b = \frac{g}{\ell} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

gives

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta} = a\frac{\cos\theta}{\sin^3\theta} - b \sin\theta \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation resembles the simple nonlinear [[pendulum equation]], because it can swing through the vertical axis, with an additional term to account for the rotation about the vertical axis (the constant {{math|''a''}} is related to the angular momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}).

Applying the Lagrangian approach there are two nonlinear coupled equations to solve.

The {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ell^2\ddot{\theta} = m\ell^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\phi}^2 -mg\ell\sin\theta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''φ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 2\sin\theta\cos\theta \dot{\theta}\dot{\phi} + \sin^2\theta \ddot{\phi}=0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L(\theta,\dot{\theta},\dot{\psi},\dot{\phi})=\frac{I_1}{2}(\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{\phi}^2\sin^2\theta) + \frac{I_3}{2}(\dot{\psi}^2+\dot{\phi}^2\cos^2\theta)+I_3\dot{\psi}\dot{\phi}\cos\theta-Mg\ell\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ψ'', ''φ'', ''θ''}} are the [[Euler angles]], {{math|''θ''}} is the angle between the vertical {{math|''z''}}-axis and the top's {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis, {{math|''ψ''}} is the rotation of the top about its own {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis, and {{math|''φ''}} the azimuthal of the top's {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis around the vertical {{math|''z''}}-axis. The principal [[moments of inertia]] are {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the top's own {{math|''x''&amp;prime;}} axis, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the top's own {{math|''y''&amp;prime;}} axes, and {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the top's own {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis. Since the top is symmetric about its {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Here the simple relation for local [[gravitational potential energy]] {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''Mgl''cos''θ''}} is used where {{math|''g''}} is the acceleration due to gravity, and the centre of mass of the top is a distance {{math|''l''}} from its tip along its {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis.

The angles {{math|''ψ'', ''φ''}} are cyclic. The constant momenta are the angular momenta of the top about its axis and its precession about the vertical, respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\psi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\psi}} = I_3\dot{\psi} + I_3\dot{\phi} \cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \dot{\phi}(I_1\sin^2\theta + I_3\cos^2\theta) + I_3\dot{\psi}\cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

From these, eliminating {{math|''dψ''/''dt''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi - p_\psi\cos\theta = I_1\dot{\phi}\sin^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{\phi} = \frac{p_\phi - p_\psi\cos\theta}{I_1\sin^2\theta}\,, &lt;/math&gt;

and to eliminate {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}}, substitute this result into {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and solve for {{math|''dψ''/''dt''}} to find

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\psi} = \frac{p_\psi}{I_3} - \cos\theta \left(\frac{p_\phi - p_\psi\cos\theta}{I_1\sin^2\theta}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The Routhian can be taken to be

:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta,\dot{\theta}) = p_\psi\dot{\psi} + p_\phi\dot{\phi} - L = \frac{1}{2}(p_\psi\dot{\psi} + p_\phi\dot{\phi}) - \frac{I_1 \dot{\theta}^2}{2} + Mg\ell \cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

and since

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{p_\phi\dot{\phi}}{2} = \frac{p_\phi^2}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi\cos\theta}{2I_1\sin^2\theta}\,, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_\psi \dot{\psi}}{2} = \frac{p_\psi^2}{2I_3} - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi\cos\theta  }{2I_1\sin^2\theta} + \frac{p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta}{2I_1\sin^2\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt;R =  \frac{p_\psi^2}{2I_3} + \frac{p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} + \frac{p_\phi^2}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi\cos\theta}{4I_1\sin^2\theta} - \frac{I_1 \dot{\theta}^2}{2} + Mg\ell \cos\theta \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The first term is constant, and can be ignored since only the derivatives of ''R'' will enter the equations of motion. The simplified Routhian, without loss of information, is thus

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{1}{2I_1\sin^2\theta}\left[p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta + p_\phi^2 - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2} \cos\theta\right] - \frac{I_1 \dot{\theta}^2}{2} + Mg\ell \cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

The equation of motion for {{math|''θ''}} is, by direct calculation,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \quad \Rightarrow \quad &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-I_1\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{\cos\theta}{I_1\sin^3\theta}\left[p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta + p_\phi^2 - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2} \cos\theta\right] + \frac{1}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} \left[-2 p_\psi^2 \cos\theta\sin\theta + \frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2} \sin\theta\right] -Mg\ell\sin\theta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

or by introducing the constants

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{p_\psi^2}{I_1^2} \,,\quad b = \frac{p_\phi^2}{I_1^2}\,,\quad c=\frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2 I_1^2}\,,\quad k= \frac{Mg\ell}{I_1}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

a simpler form of the equation is obtained

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta} = \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin^3\theta}( a\cos^2\theta +b -c\cos\theta ) + \frac{1}{2\sin\theta} (2 a \cos\theta - c) + k\sin\theta \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Although the equation is highly nonlinear, there is only one equation to solve for, it was obtained directly, and the cyclic coordinates are not involved.

By contrast, the Lagrangian approach leads to ''three'' nonlinear coupled equations to solve, despite the absence of the coordinates {{math|''ψ''}} and {{math|''φ''}} in the Lagrangian.

The {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow \quad I_1\ddot{\theta} = (I_1- I_3)\dot{\phi}^2\sin\theta\cos\theta -I_3\dot{\psi}\dot{\phi}\sin\theta +Mg\ell\sin\theta\,,&lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''ψ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\psi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \psi} \quad\Rightarrow \quad  \ddot{\psi} +  \ddot{\phi}\cos\theta - \dot{\phi}\dot{\theta}\sin\theta= 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''φ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \quad\Rightarrow \quad \ddot{\phi}(I_1\sin^2\theta + I_3\cos^2\theta) + \dot{\phi}(I_1 - I_3)2\sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\theta} + I_3\ddot{\psi}\cos\theta - I_3\dot{\psi}\sin\theta\dot{\theta} =0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Velocity-dependent potentials ===

==== Classical charged particle in a uniform magnetic field ====
[[File:Charged particle in uniform B field.svg|thumb|300px|Classical charged particle in uniform '''B''' field, using cylindrical coordinates. '''Top:''' If the radial coordinate {{math|''r''}} and angular velocity {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} vary, the trajectory is a helicoid with varying radius but uniform motion in the {{math|''z''}} direction. '''Bottom:''' Constant {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} means a helicoid with constant radius.]]

Consider a classical [[charged particle]] of mass {{math|''m''}} and [[electric charge]] {{math|''q''}} in a static (time-independent) uniform (constant throughout space) [[magnetic field]] {{math|'''B'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kibble|Berkshire|2004|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lagrangian for a charged particle in a general [[electromagnetic field]] given by the [[magnetic potential]] {{math|'''A'''}} and [[electric potential]] {{math|''φ''}} is

:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{m}{2} \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 - q \phi + q \dot{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{A} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

It is convenient to use [[cylindrical coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''z'')}}, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{v} = (v_r, v_\theta,v_z) = (\dot{r},r\dot{\theta},\dot{z}) \,, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = (B_r,B_\theta,B_z) = (0,0,B)\,. &lt;/math&gt;

In this case the electric potential is zero, {{math|''φ'' {{=}} 0}}, and we can choose the axial gauge for the magnetic potential

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{B}\times\mathbf{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{A} = (A_r,A_\theta,A_z) = (0,Br/2,0)\,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt;L(r,\dot{r},\dot{\theta},\dot{z}) = \frac{m}{2} (\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{z}^2) + \frac{qB r^2\dot{\theta}}{2} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Notice this potential has an effectively cylindrical symmetry (although it also has angular velocity dependence), since the only spatial dependence is on the radial length from an imaginary cylinder axis.

There are two cyclic coordinates, {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}}. The canonical momenta conjugate to {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}} are the constants

:&lt;math&gt;p_{\theta} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot {\theta}} = mr^2\dot {\theta} + \frac{qBr^2}{2}  \,,\quad p_z = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot {z}} = m\dot{z} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

so the velocities are

:&lt;math&gt;\dot {\theta} = \frac{1}{mr^2}\left(p_\theta - \frac{qBr^2}{2}\right) \,,\quad \dot{z} = \frac{p_z}{m}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The angular momentum about the ''z'' axis is ''not'' {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, but the quantity {{math|''mr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''dθ''/''dt''}}, which is not conserved due to the contribution from the magnetic field. The canonical momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the conserved quantity. It is still the case that {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the linear or translational momentum along the ''z'' axis, which is also conserved.

The radial component {{math|''r''}} and angular velocity {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} can vary with time, but {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is constant, and since {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is constant it follows {{math|''dz''/''dt''}} is constant. The Routhian can take the form

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R(r,\dot{r}) &amp; = p_{\theta}\dot{\theta}+p_z\dot{z} - L \\
&amp; = p_{\theta}\dot{\theta}+p_z\dot{z} - \frac{m}{2}\dot r^2 - \frac{p_\theta\dot{\theta}}{2} - \frac{p_z\dot{z}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}qBr^2\dot{\theta} \\ 
&amp; =  (p_\theta - qBr^2 )\frac{\dot{\theta}}{2} - \frac{m}{2}\dot r^2 + \frac{p_z\dot{z}}{2} \\ 
&amp; = \frac{1}{2mr^2} \left(p_\theta - qBr^2 \right)\left(p_\theta - \frac{qBr^2}{2} \right) - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 + \frac{p_z^2}{2m} \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{2mr^2} \left(p_\theta^2 - \frac{3}{2}qBr^2  + \frac{(qB)^2r^4}{2} \right) - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2  
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where in the last line, the {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''/2''m''}} term is a constant and can be ignored without loss of continuity. The Hamiltonian equations for {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}} automatically vanish and do not need to be solved for. The Lagrangian equation in {{math|''r''}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial r} &lt;/math&gt;

is by direct calculation

:&lt;math&gt;-m\ddot{r} = \frac{1}{2m}\left[\frac{-2}{r^3} \left(p_\theta^2 - \frac{3}{2}qBr^2  + \frac{(qB)^2 r^4}{2} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2}(- 3qBr + 2(qB)^2r^3)\right] \,, &lt;/math&gt;

which after collecting terms is

:&lt;math&gt;m\ddot{r}=\frac{1}{2m}\left[\frac{2p_{\theta}^2}{r^3}-(qB)^2 r\right] \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and simplifying further by introducing the constants

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{p_{\theta}^2}{m^2} \,,\quad b = - \frac{(qB)^2}{2m^2} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

the differential equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{r} = \frac{a}{r^3} + br  &lt;/math&gt;

To see how {{math|''z''}} changes with time, integrate the momenta expression for {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} above

:&lt;math&gt; z = \frac{p_z}{m}t + c_z \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is an arbitrary constant, the initial value of {{math|''z''}} to be specified in the [[initial conditions]].

The motion of the particle in this system is [[helicoid]]al, with the axial motion uniform (constant) but the radial and angular components varying in a spiral according to the equation of motion derived above. The initial conditions on {{math|''r''}}, {{math|''dr''/''dt''}}, {{math|''θ''}}, {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}}, will determine if the trajectory of the particle has a constant {{math|''r''}} or varying {{math|''r''}}. If initially {{math|''r''}} is nonzero but {{math|''dr''/''dt'' {{=}} 0}}, while {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} are arbitrary, then the initial velocity of the particle has no radial component, {{math|''r''}} is constant, so the motion will be in a perfect helix. If ''r'' is constant, the angular velocity is also constant according to the conserved {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

With the Lagrangian approach, the equation for {{math|''r''}} would include {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} which has to be eliminated, and there would be equations for {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}} to solve for.

The {{math|''r''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{r} = mr\dot{\theta}^2 + qBr\dot{\theta} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m(2r\dot{r}\dot {\theta} + r^2\ddot {\theta}) + qBr\dot{r} = 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''z''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{z}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{z} = 0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''z''}} equation is trivial to integrate, but the {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''θ''}} equations are not, in any case the time derivatives are mixed in all the equations and must be eliminated.

'''Trial advocacy''' is the branch of knowledge concerned with making attorneys and other advocates more effective in trial proceedings.  Trial advocacy is taught in primary, secondary, and undergraduate schools (usually associated with a [[mock trial]] elective).&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, John E. ''Law for Business and Personal Use'' p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  It is taught as an essential trade skill for litigators in [[law school]]s and in [[continuing legal education]] programs.

The skills of trial advocacy can be broken into two categories: skills that accomplish individual tasks ([[Tactic (method)|tactical skills]]) such as selecting jurors, delivering opening statements and closing arguments, and examining witnesses, and those skills that integrate the individual actions to achieve greater effects and to drive unfolding events toward the advocate’s desired outcome ([[litigation strategy|strategy]]) .&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S., ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[law school]] trial advocacy courses focus on tactical skills, though some integrate basic methods of strategic planning.  Some academics have expressed disfavor with advanced strategic techniques because of the imbalance they create, especially against attorneys who are unaware of them.  Proponents of advanced strategic techniques argue that these methods are the only effective means to counter the already-existing imbalances in the system, as between [[indigent]] defendants and the state, and between working-class [[plaintiff]]s and well-resourced, [[wealth]]y [[Conglomerate (company)|corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://advocacyteaching.blogspot.com/2013/01/trial-advocacy-professors-tell-me-that.html Selby-Dreier Debate on ''Advocacy Teaching'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like most legal skills, trial advocacy evolved through the apprenticeship and practice of attorneys.  Even after 1900 (when the education of attorneys shifted to [[law schools]]&lt;ref&gt;Harno, Albert James (2004), ''Legal Education in the United States'' p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;) most law schools offered little education in advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Kutcher, Edward A.; Lee, Robert B. (1962) ''The Deterioration of Trial Advocacy-Are the Laws Schools Responsible?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Bar Association (1967) ''The Law School Curriculum and Advocacy Training''&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1969, in response to criticism within the judicial system that law schools were not properly preparing attorneys for trial practice, a group of lawyers and law professors combined to form the [[National Institute for Trial Advocacy]] (NITA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nita.org/About#History NITA website]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many law schools have added or improved their instruction in trial advocacy, and numerous [[Continuing Legal Education]] organizations have offered classes surveying the subject area, and on specific topics within the field.  Currently nearly one dozen law schools in the United States offer [[Master of Law]] (LL.M.) degrees in trial advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, Eric, Princeton Review (2013) ''The Best 168 Law Schools''&lt;/ref&gt;
Trial advocacy originally focused on individual actions within the trial, proposing methods for improved selection of jurors, delivery of argument, and direct and cross examination.  However, in the 1970s, NITA advanced the concepts of theme and theory as methods of integrating the various components into a cohesive whole.&lt;ref&gt;Lubet, Steven (2004) ''Modern Trial Advocacy''&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, [[Litigation Strategy|litigation strategy]] has blossomed with the importation of concepts from economic [[game theory]], [[Complexity theory and organizations|complexity theory]], [[Gestalt psychology]], and the application of [[maneuver warfare]] as a means not only of integrating the various actions within the trial into a comprehensive case, but also as a means of gaining a decisive advantage over opposing counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics in trial advocacy==
The topics commonly encompassed within Trial Advocacy are:

===Jury selection or ''voir dire''===
{{Main|Jury selection|Voir dire}}
The selection of jurors that will be receptive to the argument the attorney intends to make.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 529 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening statement===
{{Main|Opening statement}}
Presenting a non-argumentative overview of what the jury will see, often in the context of the attorney’s theme, theory and story.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 8 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct examination===
{{Main|Direct examination}}
Eliciting evidence from one’s own witnesses through non-[[leading question]]s.  Because studies have shown that people best remember the first and the most recent (last) information heard (methods referred to as [[Serial position effect|primacy and recency]]), the preferred method is to start with an engaging and favorable topic, move through more mundane matters, and to finish on a strong, favorable point.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 45 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross examination===
{{Main|Cross examination}}
Working with witnesses offered by the opposing party who may be [[hostile witness|hostile]] or uncooperative.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 83 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing argument===
{{Main|Closing argument}} 
Using [[argument]] to create within the jurors a perception of what they have seen and heard that influences them to find in favor of the attorney’s client.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 467 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persuasion===
{{Main|Persuasion}}
The general principles that enable an advocate to make the jurors more receptive to his claims.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Lubet, p. 16, 32 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mock trial===
{{Main|Mock trial}}
In mock trial, students take responsibility for the [[prosecution]]/[[plaintiff]] or [[defense counsel|defense]] case in a trial presented using fabricated evidence, and role-players as witnesses and faculty or volunteers as judge or jury.  It evaluates the participants’ skills in argument, evidence handling, and examination of witnesses, but omits jury selection and strategic matters.  Mock trial differs from [[moot court]] in that moot court practices appellate argument, and so involves no handling of witnesses or evidence, but rather is an exercise in legal research and oral advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Korzen, John (2010) ''Make Your Argument: Succeeding in Moot Court and Mock Trial''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic trial strategy===
{{Main|Litigation strategy}}
The means of organizing a case into a clear and complete presentation.
* Case Diagrams: In which the attorney charts the elements he / she intends to prove (or attack) and the evidence that will support each. These ensures the case is comprehensively addressed.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g. Indiana Law School web site [http://www.law.indiana.edu/instruction/tanford/web/reference/basictactics.html], accessed March 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theme and Theory: The theme is a sound bite that captures the emotional appeal of the case, and the theory is an explanation of events.  These serve as strategic focal points, allowing individual actions (opening, examination of each witness, etc.) to be united with a common focus, and in a way that clarifies and reinforces the perception of the case the attorney wants the jury or judge to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 411 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced trial strategy===
{{Main|Litigation strategy}}
The means of organizing the case to maximize the combined impact of every element, and to overwhelm or outmaneuver the opposing counsel while presenting a clear, decisive argument to the jury (or judge, in the case of bench trials).&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'' pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced strategic skills, based upon [[psychology]] and [[maneuver warfare|military maneuver philosophy]], are generally learned outside the classroom, as few law schools teach them.  In fact, [[academic]]s have criticized advanced strategic techniques for tipping [[verdict]]s through means unrelated to the [[merit (law)|merits of the case]].  For example, these techniques may be used to cause an advocate unfamiliar with them to take actions that unwittingly undermine his client’s interests.  There is particular concern regarding the use of advanced strategic techniques by [[prosecutor]]s, who already wield the substantial power of the State against often poorly resourced defendants.

The counterargument is that strategy can correct already-existing imbalances in the justice system, such as when inexperienced advocates must face highly experienced ones, when [[law firm|small firms]] oppose large ones, and when poor clients must litigate their rights against wealthy ones.  Under the current system, without a well-developed strategy, a small firm with a poor client stands almost no chance of success against a large firm with its greater resources, regardless of the merits of the case.
* [[Litigation strategy|Maneuver strategy]] An alternative to arguing the evidence or the law, maneuver strategies pursue solutions such as redirecting the focus of the trial, reshaping the way events are perceived, or disrupting or surprising the opposing counsel, rendering him ineffective at responding to unfolding events.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  While these methods are practiced widely, even by advocates not educated in strategy, some object to this as improper even when practiced ethically, as it subordinates the importance of the evidence and the law in determining a trial's outcome.  One proponent of maneuver strategy, however, has noted that regardless of whether the attorney intends to leverage the tools of maneuver strategy, the attorney must understand the methods or she will be ill-equipped to identify and counter them.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, pp. 86–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gestalt psychology]] This branch of psychology focuses on how things are perceived in whole as opposed to how individual components appear.  It aids in ensuring the jury (or judge, in bench trials) perceives events as the attorney desires, and it offers a means of shaping the way witnesses and opposing counsel will perceive the problems an attorney raises for them during trial.  When coupled with game theory, shaping perception allows an attorney to influence or shape the actions the hostile witness or counsel take.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 37–40, 83–4&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Game theory]] Game theory offers models of how people make decisions.  In trial practice, game theory is useful in predicting the likely actions witnesses will take when presented with a decision.  Because decisions are framed according to how they perceive a situation, when game theory is coupled with Gestalt psychology, attorneys can present problems to witnesses or opposing counsel in a way that increases the likelihood of them making decisions about their responses that improve the attorney's strategic position.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 62–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Litigation strategy|Lines of effort]] In the way a case diagram matches evidence to elements, the line of effort matches actions to specific effects the attorney intends to the various results that achieve her or his goal.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 47–65&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8665">A '''vacuum flange''' is a [[flange]] at the end of a tube used to connect [[vacuum chamber]]s, tubing and [[vacuum pump]]s to each other. Vacuum flanges are used for scientific and industrial applications to allow various pieces of equipment to interact via physical connections and for vacuum maintenance, monitoring, and manipulation from outside a vacuum's chamber. Several flange standards exist with differences in ultimate attainable [[pressure]], size, and ease of attachment.

==Vacuum flange types==

===KF/QF===
[[File:KF 25 Tee.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|A KF-25 tee, o-ring, and clamp]]
The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard quick release flange is known by the names Quick Flange (QF), Klein Flange (KF) or NW, sometimes also as DN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesker.com/newweb/flanges/flanges_technicalnotes_kf_1.cfm?pgid=0 |title=KF (QF) Flanges Technical Notes |accessdate=2007-09-02 |publisher= Kurt J. Lesker Company }}&lt;/ref&gt; The KF designation has been adopted by ISO, [[DIN]], and [[Pneurop]]. KF flanges are made with a [[chamfer]]ed back surface that are attached with a circular clamp and an [[elastomer]]ic [[o-ring]] that is mounted in a metal centering ring. Standard sizes are indicated by the nominal inner diameter in millimeters for flanges 10 through 50&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.&lt;ref name="caburn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caburn.com/resources/downloads/pdfs/sec1.2.pdf |title=ISO KF Flanges and Fittings |accessdate=2007-09-02 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sizes 10, 20 and 32 are less common sizes (see [[Preferred_number#Reynard_numbers|Reynard numbers]]). Some sizes share their flange dimensions with their respective larger neighbor and use the same clamp size. This means a DN10KF can mate to a DN16KF by using an adaptive centering ring. The same applies for DN20KF to DN25KF and DN32KF to DN40KF.
:
* DN10KF
* DN16KF
* DN20KF
* DN25KF
* DN32KF
* DN40KF
* DN50KF

===ISO===
The ISO large flange standard is known as LF, LFB, MF or sometimes just ISO flange. As in KF-flanges, the flanges are joined by a centering ring and an elastomeric o-ring. An extra spring-loaded circular clamp is often used around the large-diameter o-rings to prevent them from rolling off from the centering ring during mounting.

The ISO large flanges come in two varieties. The ISO-K (or ISO LF) flanges are joined with double-claw clamps, which clamp to a circular groove on the tubing side of the flange. The ISO-F (or ISO LFB) flanges have holes for attaching the two flanges with bolts. Two tubes with ISO-K and ISO-F flanges can be joined together by clamping the ISO-K side with single-claw clamps, which are then bolted to the holes on the ISO-F side.

ISO large flanges are available in sizes from 63 to 500&amp;nbsp;mm nominal tube diameter:&lt;ref name="caburn"/&gt;
* DN63LF (63.5&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN100LF (102&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN160LF (160&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN200LF (200&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN250LF (254&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN320LF (316&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN400LF (400&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN500LF (500&amp;nbsp;mm)

===CF (Conflat)===
[[File:Conflat Flange.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|A 2¾ CF (conflat) full nipple with blank flange and [[Oxygen-free copper|OFHC]] gasket]]
[[File:60kV Feedthrough.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|A 60 kV [[high-voltage]] electrical feedthrough on a 4½ inch (or DN63) conflat flange]]
Several vacuum flange [[technical standard|standard]]s exist, and the same flange types are called by different names by different manufacturers and [[standards organization]]s.
CF (ConFlat) flanges use a copper gasket and knife-edge flange to achieve an [[ultrahigh vacuum]] seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesker.com/newweb/flanges/flanges_technicalnotes_conflat_1.cfm |title=CF Flanges Technical Notes |accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ConFlat" is a registered trademark of [[Varian, Inc.]], so "CF" is commonly used by other flange manufacturers. Each face of the two mating CF flanges has a knife edge, which cuts into the softer metal gasket, providing an extremely leak-tight, metal-to-metal seal. Deformation of the metal gasket fills small defects in the flange, allowing Conflat flanges operate down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; [[Torr]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; [[pascal (unit)|Pa]]) pressure. The knife edge is recessed in a groove in each flange. In addition to protecting the knife edge, the groove helps hold the gasket in place, which aligns the two flanges and also reduces gasket expansion during [[bake-out]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avs.org/About/Awards-Recognition/Awardee-Interviews/Interviews/William-R-Wheeler/Interview-Transcript |title=AVS Interview: 1996 Albert Nerken Award Recipient: William R. Wheeler  |author=Daniel Bills |date=1996-10-06 |accessdate=2009-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For stainless-steel conflat flanges, baking temperatures of 450&amp;nbsp;°C can be achieved; the temperature is limited by the choice of gasket material. CF flanges are sexless and interchangeable. In North America, flange sizes are given by flange outer diameter in inches, while in Europe and Asia, sizes are given by tube inner diameter in millimeters. Despite the different naming conventions, the actual flanges are the same.

ConFlat gaskets were originally invented by William Wheeler and other engineers at Varian in an attempt to build a flange that would not leak after baking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avs.org/popup.aspx?FileName=wheeler_int|title=AVS Interview: 1996 Albert Nerken Award Recipient: William R. Wheeler |accessdate=2009-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wheeler===
A Wheeler flange is a large wire-seal flange often used on large vacuum chambers.&lt;ref&gt;''Metal Vacuum Joint'', William R. Wheeler, Varian Associates, {{Cite patent|US|3458221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ASA===
[[ANSI]] has a flange standard called ASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesker.com/newweb/flanges/flanges_technicalnotes_asa_1.cfm?pgid=0 |title=ASA Flanges Technical Notes |accessdate=2007-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These flanges are elastomeric o-ring seal and can be used for both vacuum and pressure applications.  Flange sizes are indicated by tube nominal inner diameter or by flange outer diameter (in inches):  1 (4.25 O.D.), 1.5 (5.00 O.D.), 2 (6.00 O.D.), 3 (7.50 O.D.), 4 (9.00 O.D.), 6 (11.00 O.D.), 8 (13.5 O.D.), 10 (16.00 O.D.).

==Vacuum gaskets==
To achieve a vacuum seal, a [[gasket]] is required. An elastomeric [[o-ring]] gasket can be made of [[Buna rubber]], [[viton]] fluoropolymer, [[silicone rubber]] or [[teflon]]. O-rings can be placed in a groove or may be used in combination with a centering ring or as a "captured" o-ring that is held in place by separate metal rings. Metal gaskets are used in ultra-high vacuum systems where the [[outgassing]] of the elastomer could be a significant gas load. A copper ring gasket is used with conflat flanges. Metal wire gaskets made of copper, [[gold]] or [[indium]] can be used.

==Vacuum feedthrough==
A vacuum feedthrough is a flange that contains a vacuum-tight electrical, physical or mechanical connection to the vacuum chamber. An electrical feedthrough allows voltages to be applied to components under vacuum, for example a [[Electrical filament|filament]] or [[heater]]. An example of a physical feedthrough is a vacuum-tight connection for cooling water. A mechanical feedthrough is used for [[rotation]] and [[translation_(geometry)|translation]] of components under vacuum. A wobble stick is a mechanical feedthrough device that can be used to pick up, move and otherwise manipulate objects in the vacuum chamber.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13148">In [[decision theory]] and [[game theory]], '''[[Abraham Wald|Wald's]] [[Minimax#Maximin|maximin]] model''' is a non-probabilistic decision-making model according to which decisions are ranked on the basis of their worst-case outcomes – the optimal decision is one with the least worst outcome. It is one of the most important models in [[robust decision making]] in general and [[robust optimization]] in particular.

It is also known by a variety of other titles, such as Wald's maximin rule, Wald's maximin principle, Wald's maximin paradigm, and Wald's maximin criterion. Often '[[minimax]]' is used instead of 'maximin'.

==Definition==
Wald's generic maximin model is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;v^{*}:= \max_{d\in D}\min_{s\in S(d)}f(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; denotes the decision space; &lt;math&gt;S(d)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of states associated with decision &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(d,s)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the payoff (outcome) associated with decision &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and state &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

This model represents a 2-person game in which the &lt;math&gt;\max&lt;/math&gt; player plays first. In response, the second player selects  the worst state in &lt;math&gt;S(d)&lt;/math&gt;, namely a state in &lt;math&gt;S(d)&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes the payoff &lt;math&gt;f(d,s)&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S(d)&lt;/math&gt;. In many applications the second player represents uncertainty. However, there are maximin models that are completely deterministic.

The above model is the ''classic'' format of Wald's maximin model. There is an equivalent [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] (MP) format:

:&lt;math&gt;v^{*}:= \max_{d\in D,\,z\in \mathbb{R}} \{z: z \le f(d,s),\forall s\in S(d)\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the real line.

As in [[game theory]], the worst payoff associated with decision &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, namely

: &lt;math&gt;v(d):= \min_{s\in S(d)} f(d,s)\ , \ d \in D&lt;/math&gt;

is called ''the security level'' of decision &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

The minimax version of the model is obtained by exchanging the positions of the &lt;math&gt;\max&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\min&lt;/math&gt;   operations in the classic format:

:&lt;math&gt;v^{\circ}:= \min_{d\in D}\max_{s\in S(d)}f(d,s).&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent MP format is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;v^{\circ}:= \min_{d\in D,\,z\in \mathbb{R}} \{z: z \ge f(d,s),\forall s\in S(d)\}&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
Inspired by maximin models of game theory, [[Abraham Wald]] developed this model in the early 1940s &lt;ref name="wald39"&gt;Wald, A. (1939).  Contributions to the theory of statistical estimation and testing hypotheses. ''The Annals of Mathematics,'' 10(4), 299-326.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wald45"&gt;Wald, A. (1945).  Statistical decision functions which minimize the maximum risk. ''The Annals of Mathematics,'' 46(2), 265-280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wald50"&gt;Wald, A.  (1950). ''Statistical Decision Functions,'' John Wiley, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; as an approach to situations in which there is only one player (the decision maker). The second player represents a pessimistic (worst case) approach to uncertainty. In Wald's maximin model, player 1 (the &lt;math&gt;\max&lt;/math&gt; player) plays first and player 2 (the &lt;math&gt;\min&lt;/math&gt; player) knows player 1's decision when he selects his decision. This is a major simplification of the [[Two-person zero-sum game|classic 2-person zero-sum game]] in which the two players choose their strategies without knowing the other player's choice. The game of Wald's maximin model is also a 2-person [[zero-sum game]], but the players choose sequentially.

With the establishment of modern decision theory in the 1950s, the model became a key ingredient in the formulation of non-probabilistic decision-making models in the face of severe uncertainty.&lt;ref name="resnik"&gt;Resnik, M.D. (1987). ''Choices: an Introduction to Decision Theory,''   University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="french"&gt;French, S. (1986). ''Decision Theory: An Introduction to the Mathematics of Rationality,'' Ellis Horwood, Chichester.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used in diverse fields such as [[decision theory]], [[control theory]], [[economics]], [[statistics]], [[robust optimization]], [[operations research]], [[Maximin (philosophy)|philosophy]], etc.&lt;ref name="ms07"&gt;Sniedovich, M. (2007).  The art and science of modeling decision-making under severe uncertainty. ''Decision Making in Manufacturing and Services,''  1(1-2), 111-136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ms08"&gt;Sniedovich, M. (2008). Wald's maximin model: a treasure in disguise! ''Journal of Risk Finance,'' 9(3), 287-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
One of the most famous examples of a Maximin/Minimax model is

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{x\in \mathbb{R}} \max_{y\in \mathbb{R}}\ \{x^{2} - y^{2}\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the real line. Formally we can set &lt;math&gt;D=S(d)=\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(d,s)=d^{2}-s^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The picture is this

[[Image:Saddle point.png|400px]]

The optimal solution is the  (red) [[saddle point]]  &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Decision tables==
There are many cases where it is convenient to 'organize' the Maximin/Minimax model as a 'table'. The convention is that the rows of the table represent the decisions, and the columns represent the states.

===Example===
Henri is going for a walk. The sun may shine, or it may rain. Should Henri carry an umbrella? Henri does not like carrying an umbrella, but he dislikes getting wet even more. His "[[payoff matrix]]", viewing this as a Maximin game pitting Henri against Nature, is as follows.

{| class="wikitable" align="left"
 !
 ! &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sun &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
 ! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Rain &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 |-
 ! No umbrella
 | &lt;center&gt;5&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/center&gt;
 |-
 ! Umbrella
 | &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/center&gt;
 |}

{{Clear}}
Appending a ''Worst Payoff''&amp;nbsp;  column and a ''Best Worst Payoff''&amp;nbsp; column to the payoff table, we obtain

{| class="wikitable" align="left"
 !
 ! &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sun &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
 ! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Rain &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 ! Worst Payoff
 ! Best Worst Payoff
 |-
 ! No umbrella
 | &lt;center&gt;5&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/center&gt;
 | 
 |-
 ! Umbrella
 | &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/center&gt;
 | &lt;center&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/center&gt;
 |}
{{Clear}}
The worst case, if Henri goes out without umbrella, is definitely worse than the (best) worst case when carrying an umbrella. Therefore, Henri takes his umbrella with him.

==Variations on a theme==
Over the years a variety of related models have been developed primarily to moderate the pessimistic approach dictated by the worst-case orientation of the model.&lt;ref name="resnik" /&gt;&lt;ref name="french" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kouvelis"&gt;Kouvelis P, and Yu G. (1997).  ''Robust Discrete Optimization and Its Applications,''  Kluwer, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ben-tal09"&gt;Ben-Tal, A,  El Gaoui, L, Nemirovski, A. (2009). ''Robust Optimization.''  Princeton University Press, Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sim04"&gt;Bertsimas D, and Sim, M. (2004). The price of robustness. ''Operations Research,''  52(1), 35-53.&lt;/ref&gt; For example,

===Savage's minimax regret===
[[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage's]] [[Minimax regret|minimax regret model]]&lt;ref name="savage51"&gt;Savage, L. (1951). The theory of statistical decision. ''Journal of the American Statistical Association,'' 46, 55–67.&lt;/ref&gt; is an application of Wald's minimax model to the 'regrets' associated with the payoffs. It can be formulated as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{d\in D}\max_{s\in S} r(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;r(d,s):= \max_{d\,'\in D} f(d\,',s) - f(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;

is the regret of payoff &lt;math&gt;f(d,s)&lt;/math&gt; associated with the (decision,state) pair &lt;math&gt;(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Deterministic models==
The sets of states &lt;math&gt;S(d),d\in D,&lt;/math&gt; need not represent uncertainty. They can represent (deterministic) variations in the value of a parameter.

===Example===
Let &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set representing possible locations of an 'undesirable'  public facility (e.g. garbage dump), and let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; denote a finite set of locations in the neighborhood of the planned facility, representing existing dwellings.

It might be desirable to build the facility so that its shortest distance from an existing dwelling is as large as possible. The maximin formulation of the problem is as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\max_{d\in D}\min_{s\in S} dist(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;dist(d,s)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the distance of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. Note that in this problem &lt;math&gt;S(d)&lt;/math&gt; does not vary with &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

In cases where is it desirable to live close to the facility, the objective could be to minimize the maximum distance from the facility. This yields the following minimax problem:

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{d\in D}\max_{s\in S} dist(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;

These are generic [[facility location]] problems.

==Maximin models in disguise==
Experience has shown that the formulation of maximin models can be subtle in the sense that problems that 'do not look like' maximin problems can be formulated as such.

===Example===
Consider the following problem:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 Given a finite set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and a real valued function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, find the largest subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g(x) \le 0&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in this subset.
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The maximin formulation of this problem, in the MP format, is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\max_{Y\subseteq X} \ \{|Y|: g(x)\le 0,\forall x\in Y\}.&lt;/math&gt;

It has been shown that the [[Stability radius|radius of stability]] model and [[info-gap decision theory|info-gap's robustness]] model are simple instances of Wald's maximin model.&lt;ref name="MS10"&gt;Sniedovich, M.

==Constrained maximin models==
Constraints can be incorporated explicitly in the maximin models. For instance, the following is a constrained maximin problem stated in the classic format

:&lt;math&gt;v^{*}:= \max_{d\in D}\min_{s\in S(d)}\ \{f(d,s): g(d,s) \le 0, \forall s\in S(d)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Its equivalent MP format is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;v^{*}:= \max_{d\in D,\,z\in \mathbb{R}} \{z: z \le f(d,s), g(d,s) \le 0, \forall s\in S(d)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Such models are very useful in [[robust optimization]].

==The price of robustness==
One of the 'weaknesses' of the Maximin model is that the robustness that it provides comes with a ''price''.&lt;ref name="sim04" /&gt;  By playing it safe, the Maximin model tends to generate conservative decisions, whose price can be high. The following example illustrates this important feature of the model.

===Example===
Consider the simple case where there are two decisions, d'  and d",  and where S(d')=S(d")=[a,b]. The Maximin model is then as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\max_{d\in D}\min_{s\in S(d)} f(d,s) = \max_{d\,',d\,''}\ \min_{a\le s \le b}f(d,s) = \max\ \{\min_{a\le s \le b}f(d\,',s),\min_{a\le s\le b}f(d\,'',s)\}&lt;/math&gt;

Now consider the instance shown by

[[Image:Maximin price.png|600px]]

Note that although the payoff associated with decision d'  is larger than the payoff associated with decision d" over most of the state space S=[a,b], the best worst case according to Wald's model is provided by decision d". Hence, according to Wald's model decision d" is better than decision d'.

==Algorithms==
There are no general-purpose algorithms for the solution of maximin problems. Some problems are very simple to solve, others are very difficult.&lt;ref name="ben-tal09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sim04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reemstem98"&gt;Reemstem, R. and R\"{u}ckmann, J. (1998). ''Semi-Infinite Programming,'' Kluwer, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rustem02"&gt;Rustem, B. and Howe, M. (2002). ''Algorithms for Worst-case Design and Applications to Risk Management,'' Princeton University Press, Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
Consider the case where the state variable is an "index", for instance  let &lt;math&gt;S(d)=\{1,2,\dots,k\}&lt;/math&gt; for  all &lt;math&gt;d \in D&lt;/math&gt;. The associated maximin problem is then as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\max_{d\in D}\min_{s\in S(d)} f(d,s) &amp;= \max_{d\in D}\min_{1\le s \le k} \{f_{1}(d),\dots,f_{k}(d)\}\\
&amp; = \max_{d\in D, z\in \mathbb{R}} \{z: z\le f_{s}(d),\forall s=1,2,\dots,k\}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f_{s}(d) \equiv f(d,s)&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;d\in \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, all the functions &lt;math&gt;f_{s}, s=1,2,\dots,k,&lt;/math&gt;  are [[linear]], and &lt;math&gt;d\in D&lt;/math&gt; is specified by a system of [[linear]] constraints on &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, then this problem is a [[linear programming]] problem that can be solved by [[linear programming]] algorithms such as the [[simplex algorithm]].
